{"title": "Throwing the Dice", "date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2024", "text": "Looking up at our house from our mailboxA year ago, a friend introduced me to a wonderful thing she was doing called WIPGO. It was a sort of work-in-progress bingo on a Facebook group of the same name. The idea was to take a whiteboard, draw out the squares of a bingo card on it, number them, and then fill them with the names of projects that you had in flight and needed to finish. I was very enthusiastic and took a chalk board, drew up the card, and started putting in all of my unfinished projects (I alluded to some of them in yesterday's post). There were too many for the card, so I doubled up on the little ones. There were still too many, but I figured that that's what 2024 would be for! Anyhoo, each month the moderator of the FB group called out two numbers, and the goal was to work on the projects in the corresponding squares for a certain number of hours each week for the month. There was also a prize for completing a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. It was already March when I found out about the group, and even last year was too crazy for me to follow a plan, so the board languished. Last week I hung it in the sewing room and erased all of the projects. I would like to start it up again, but as I haven't even found all of my handwork WIP's--much less unpacked them, and my life is too too fluid and unsettled right now anyway, so I regretfully decided not to do it this year. (Side note: I also decided not to get chicks, plant a garden, or keep bees this year. Those are next year's projects. Instead I am going to concentrate on cleaning up the tackroom/horse shelter/corral area, moving Turi (my Appaloosa/quarter horse gelding) here, and getting him a herd mate or two. Equine management for the first time in my life is going to be intense enough.) Though I am not going to do the formal WIPGO, this morning I had a glimmer of an idea about integrating the randomness of it into building a retirement structure AND getting sh*t done! A big part of the difficulty in retirement is the lack of structure in your time--the days are all the same, and hours mostly don't have any significance either. When I was \"working\", my schedule was determined by outside forces--meetings, deadlines and commitments, what to leave in, what to leave out (extra bonus nachos if you catch the reference in that last bit). I don't think I'm unusual in rebelling against forcing a structure upon myself just to have one. I want one that's productive, satisfying, and fun. I don't want to go to the gym everyday at 10:00. I have NEVER wanted to go to the gym everyday at 10:00, and I resist the idea that that is the kind of schedule I need now. So back to using the idea of WIP bingo and daily life... a routine is already organically forming a bit in my days. I start the morning with coffee, sometimes in bed. I do a little admin work (email, schedule contractors, research things I need to know like how to manually open the garage door when there doesn't seem to be a pull cord--stuff like that). Then I blog and do a little housework--in either order. Then I have a couple of hours before lunch to work on a project. That's where the randomness of a WIP--like-thing can come in. I have a list of about six household unpacking and organization projects that I need to complete. I have been struggling getting traction on them. Let's be honest--I've been struggling getting started on them. I'd rather whine about it here on the blog. But no more! Today I am going to write six imminent projects on my whiteboard. There are more than six, but I will just pick six. I will assign a number to each. Then each day I will either pick one (if I have a strong preference), or I will roll a die, and then I will spend two hours working on the project that came up on the roll. Heck, I might even add something in like \"take a long walk with the dog\". The projects will stay on the board until completed, and as soon as they are completed, they will be replaced so there is always something next to each number. Six is an excellent number as it means there is one day a week with no scheduled task (days that I have other things on the schedule count for the project that day), and I think I'll stretch and say I can take the day off any day I want--it doesn't have to be a specific day of the week.I was going to continue with the afternoon and evening schedule, but this post is already long, and I am itching to make my new WIP dice board."},
{"title": "I'm Projecting Projects", "date": "Monday, January 29, 2024", "text": "quilting cotton quarters and halvesThe sun is shining and I am ready to Project, Project, Project! That is project, the noun: \"an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim\", and not project, the verb:  \"plan (a project or undertaking).\" (from Oxford Language). Unfortunately my definition of project the noun is rarely \"carefully planned\", and due to my short attention span is often not completed. I go hard for a few days, maybe an intense week, and then--just as I approach the finish line--another shiny object/project pops up and I go haring off after it. Sigh.I need to finish Dave's bison coat by putting on the closures--though it is now way too warm for him to wear. The sewing part of the sewing room is finished, now I need to unpack the office part, but there isn't any more room, and I don't want to...Thread--regular, serger, embroideryI have been itching to start unpacking and putting away the tools in the garage. The glass shed needs to be set up (shelving and work surface installed, and all frit and glass unpacked), and I haven't finished unpacking the basement yet. I got as far as books on shelves, a loveseat in front of the fireplace, and games in the games cabinet, and then I petered out. I still haven't fixed the broken leg of the games table so it is upside down in the middle of the rec room, and the live-edge desk I was making for Austin doesn't fit anywhere and is taking up the space where the loveseat needs to go. Never mind that little room down there that will be the jewelry studio: it's inundated with all the yarn and fiber that didn't go into the attic--including the Ikea cloth cubes (all 50 of them) that go into the two Kallax wall units that are still at our other Polson house because they don't fit anywhere in the new one! I need a fiber barn to get that all sorted out. Shirt and clothing fabricOver the past few days I folded and organized every piece of fabric I have. I found five of Dave's shirts in progress and mostly sewn, and four more cut out and ready to sew. I also tidily arranged fabric for another 177 shirts. I didn't even count all the quarter and halves of quilting fabric. A friend's dress surfaced (I am replacing a zipper on it for her), as did the partially-pieced Crown Royal quilt that I am making for another friend. Oh, and the infamous sunbonnet girls quilt that I started with my grandmother over 50 years ago... I think that one wins for the oldest in-progress project. I'm actually kind of glad that I haven't started organizing the yarn cubes yet as they contain many, many in-progress sweaters--including five baby ones that I started and didn't complete for Jessie--now 22.But that's what retirement is for, right? Completion of old projects and starting all the ones I squirreled away for this very day. But there are baby chicks coming to Murdoch's soon (they have the enclosure set up in the middle of the store), and I don't have a chicken coop yet. It's about time to start seeds for the garden, and I haven't cleaned out the greenhouse yet. How do I choose what to do, and how do I motivate myself to finish what I've already started?Good thing I put up a whiteboard and bought some new dry erase markers. Think I'll go noodle a bit on my board and calendar."},

Just rinse it in cool water and put it back in this box. Dave: Where did you get those, I have never seen them before, what are they?Me: Covers to use on leftovers instead of aluminum foil.Dave: Are they better than aluminum foil?Me: Yes.Dave: How?Me: They don't go into a landfill.A short time later...Me: What do you think of composting toilets?Dave: I think we've already done our part with the waxed thingies.Now, me, I am all into the idea of a composting toilet. Especially one like the HomeBioGas one that you don't have to empty. It makes cooking gas and garden fertilizer as it's output. Our toilets are working fine in the house, and I am not trying to reinvent the wheel. But we are going to be needing guest quarters asap for the flood of people who are going to flock to here in the summer. I am thinking a composting toilet in a yurt. We already have electricity and water to the site, and it is a quick, inexpensive (relatively) solution. Build a deck, get some basic furniture, do a little electrical, do a little plumbing (no septic), get a few appliances, and voilà! Guest quarters!"},
{"title": "Last Best Place? Hell Yeah!", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2024", "text": "Moon setting in the westYesterday I took a lot of pictures of the progress on the sewing room to post today, but life had other plans. Dave alerted me to the view on the western side of the house this morning as he was getting ready to take the garbage down to the bear-proof can (writing those words never gets old), and to get us a latte and croffles from Bayside Riser. I looked out just in time to see the full moon setting in the west, golden from the sun rising in the east. The view to the east didn't disappoint either--mist rising over the National Wildlife Refuge and the mountains limned by the rising sun. I ask you, how often is something so spectacular that the first word that comes to your mind to describe it is limned? Later, as I was sitting here posting, I looked out to the north to see that we are above the clouds and can see to Glacier Park. A few minutes later when I looked again, the light had completely changed and presented me with a different, perfect vista.Sunrise over the mistI need to say that while it is relatively easy to take digital photos and enhance, pop, boost, and nudge them to perfection, each of these photos are untouched. I didn't even adjust the contrast or brightness--just cropped a bit.In between the beauty of the moonset and sitting down to post, my spouse next alerted me to the lack of Internet. Oh the joys of a new house! The Starlink router was not even showing up so I figured it was something to do with the power. Sure enough, all the outlets in the garage and the light above the sink were out. Checked the breakers, nothing flipped. Looked for an obvious GFI circuit in the garage, couldn't find it. Texted the previous owner, he couldn't remember off the top of his head where the master GFI controlling the garage circuits was either. The garage is still so stuffed with everything from the move--and a bunch of random empty cardboard boxes destined for recycling--that I couldn't begin to find all the outlets. That's okay. I had a long, industrial extension cord and power strip, and just plugged the Starlink router and the freezer (with all the beef in it) into it. It's not a perfect solution, but, hey, these are primitive pioneer conditions.The photos below are the ones I mentioned earlier to the north and Glacier, taken about 10 minutes apart."},
{"title": "Retirerment One Year In", "date": "Tuesday, January 23, 2024", "text": "Sunrise lights the clouds in the northI play a lot of solitaire. I'm just putting that out there.Dave has been suggesting recently--some days more forcefully than others--that I need to learn how to retire. This morning--as I am up, showered, dressed, teeth-brushed, and coffee finished- all by 7:45 am, and I have nothing planned for the day--I can see his point. This is the first day this year--and in this house for that matter--that I have been up before 8:00 without needing to be. Maybe before 8:30 or 9:00. Let's be honest: I rarely bestir myself till about 9:45. Oh, I'm awake: I check text messages, maybe read the news, my email, or whatever book I'm in the midst of,  play solitaire, and snuggle under the down comforter till the sun is well and truly up. Many mornings Dave brings me coffee in bed. Today I was restless. I was awake, and I got up, but there was no bounce in my bungee. I loaded the dishwasher as my coffee brewed, and saw a life full of repetitive daily tasks stretching ahead of me as far as I could see. This can't be what retirement is meant to be.I had coffee with a friend in Missoula who is also retired the other week, and he said it's important to take it slow. Unfortunately, I have never done slow well. So far retirement has meant... Huh. I can't even remember what I did for the first few months. I know that when we made the annual migration to Montana in June, I threw myself into home renovation projects (for a home we are no longer keeping), then got mired in the idea of buying a greenhouse/nursery business, then we decided to move here permanently, and I headed back to Texas to pack and ready that house for sale. Getting everything out of that house took five months--and is arguably still not done. But what is left there is Not My Problem. (except for a last little load in the garage). The estate sale person is donating the rest. Anyway, before I knew it, it was the winter holidays, and there is no such thing as a normal life at that time of year for anyone so I didn't even think about retirement.But now it's mid January. I got through the first half of the month working on Dave's coat, but it's mostly done now (he wears it every time he goes out), and I am left facing Life again. Don't get me wrong--this is not a poor-poor-pitiful-me-my-life-is-so-hard-because-all-I-have-is-free-time rant. I think a lot of people go through an episode of life-re-evaluation in January (hence the prevalence of resolutions and new gym memberships). I also think it's more difficult for the newly-ish retired. I am just trying to work through it out loud here. I need structure, but it's difficult coming up with an enjoyable structure. And what's the point of a structure that's NOT enjoyable? Retirement is supposed to be one's Golden Years. Shangri-La. The pot of time at the end of the rainbow. It's NOT supposed to be more time for housework or all the other drudgery that you got to put off before because you were working. Balance. That's what I need. Balance between the want-to's and the have-to's. When you are working, the have-to structure is imposed upon you by your job and then by your home and family--unless your home and family is your job, in which case you already had to struggle through the balance issue. It's easy to do a few hours a week on your non-job-how-to's, and then take the rest of your free time for your want-to's. You can justify it.My problem thus far has been justifying my time choices to myself since I'm no longer \"working\". I find myself cleaning, or doing bookkeeping, or unpacking, and none of those things make we want to bounce out of bed and start my day. I feel guilty if I don't do something with my time that I feel advances the quality of our life here (cleaning... bookkeeping... unpacking). But that's MY problem. That's all in MY mind--Dave is certainly not pushing me that way.Let's look at this a different way. My \"job\" now is to do all the things I planned to do when I finally had time--sewing, weaving, spinning, woodworking, stained glass, ceramics, jewelry, crocheting, knitting, writing a novel, blogging, learning new skills, gardening, equine husbandry, baking, meditating, walking, strength and balance exercises. Those things need to occupy the majority of my day. Then cleaning, bookkeeping, and organizing can fill in around them like they have always filled in around my \"job\". No guilt. Life is too short--and feeling shorter every day."},
{"title": "Whiteouts and Taxes", "date": "Monday, January 22, 2024", "text": "It's a whiteout!I can tell it's getting warmer out as we are back in the white again. I can't say grey because it's a lovely snow color, but you can't see through it. I'm guessing it's humidity, but what do I know? Yesterday saw the driveway plowed. Our guy came up with a bobcat and cleared it, and said it was way more snow than he had seen anywhere else. Anyway, no more Polson drift (like Tokyo drift only slower). Yesterday Dave finished setting up the last bits and bobs in his office--including mounting the last bit of whiteboard, and it is now complete. The copper still is not in operation, but I have hope. I worked on my sewing room. It's going to be tight, but everything will fit, and I will have a cozy nest when I am done. For the first time in 15 years I will have a comfy chair in a studio space so I can just hang out there. When we were in Missoula last month I got a lovely water color floral-print chair in pastels on cream, and as soon as I find the shade for my stained glass floor lamp, I'll  be set. It's amazing how many things are still unaccounted for in the move. There must be big boxes tucked somewhere that I we haven't run across yet. Maybe the garage. Finding it will be a project for another day, however. Today is all about the taxes--both income and property. I have never done income taxes so early. We don't even have half of the official forms in the mail yet, but in this digital age everything is available online. TurboTax (my new best friend) just pulls it all out of the ether for me and Bob's your uncle! His favorite place to sleepAs fast as I am going on taxes, everything else moves very slowly here. I got a call from the hospital this morning that the insurance company approved my MRI, but they can't do it till next Wednesday morning even though it's marked stat because they only do them on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays and are all booked this week. Small town rural hospital life. They are going to try to move someone else and get me in, or I'm first on the cancellation list. I am tentatively supposed to have surgery next Thursday, but the MRI needs to be factored into the surgery. Ah, well. Everything will unravel as it is meant to.In the meantime I will keep tackling one inside space at a time and then move out to the garage and the glass shed. By the time spring rolls around I want to have all my studio spaces set up and ready to go--wood shop, glass shed, fiber barn, sewing room, jewelry studio, and pottery under-deck."},
{"title": "More Travails, and, Yet...", "date": "Sunday, January 21, 2024", "text": "Even the cats hang out on the down comforterWhile I was listing out everything that happened last Wednesday (the day Dave hauled me to the hospital to have my gallbladder scanned), I forgot to include all the Austin stressors that probably contributed to the root cause of the attack. The Great White North was not the only area of the country to be struggling with weather last week. Down in Austin it got so cold that the discharge pipe from the RO system on our well froze, and a water pipe to the apartment above the garage burst, spewing all the water in the well tank onto the stairs up to the apartment where it froze into a slippery sheet of ice all down. I found out about it when the realtor called because the cleaning people were at the house to do the deep clean, and there was no water. Our wonderful neighbor (who shall remain unnamed because he abhors social media and online presence) turned off the water to the house, replumbed the RO discharge, turned the RO back on, and tested it for us. When it didn't work right he diagnosed the problem (a bad pressure switch), and fixed it! Today he is meeting with our plumber to let him in to fix the pipe. I love him. Were it not for Dave (and his wife)...I don't know what the status is of the cleaning--which has to be done before the staging, which has to be done before the photography, which has to be done before the house is (finally) listed for sale. But I trust Dina (our realtor) implicitly, and I know she will Handle It.Today I am waiting for the guy that delivered our firewood to come and plow us out. J went out with  friends last night and had to walk down to the road (about a half mile) in some pretty deep snow so they could pick her up. Even when we're plowed out today I bet her Challenger is sidelined for the rest of the winter. My right hand aches as I type from where I either dislocated, sprained, or partially tore the tendon in my right, index, metacarpophalangeal joint a week ago. It is still swollen, and still painful, and a doctor friend who called to chew me out last night for still considering Oaxaca with my gallbladder issues also laid into me about potential permanent damage to that hand if I don't get it looked at by a doctor. When I went to the walk-in clinic, they x-rayed it to see if it was broken or still dislocated, but that was about it. I got a loose, supposedly-finger-immobilizing splint-thing, and no guidance how long to keep it on or if I should follow up with anyone... *sigh* Bodies suck.And now the yet of this post... In spite of all the work it takes to live here in the snow, maintain my body, and learn how to manage retirement (that's a post for another day), I am happier than I have ever been in my life. There is nothing I can't handle, nothing I won't face, nothing that fills me with dread and makes my stomach tight and achey. Life is just right--and I'm going to keep it that way."},
{"title": "Snow Day!", "date": "Saturday, January 20, 2024", "text": "Face full of snowThis winter continues to be... interesting. We were supposed to go to Austin last Thursday, and instead we braved a blizzard (well it was supposed to be a blizzard but was just blowing snow) to go to the hospital so I could find out I was having a gallbladder attack and have lots and lots of gallstones. While poking around in there they also found a pancreatic anomaly (abnormality?), but I won't know what that means when they get me in for an MRI this week. It needs to be done before I have my gall bladder removed (tentatively scheduled for a week and a half from now, depending on how my meeting with the surgeon goes this week). Gall bladder stuff seems to be pretty common and minor (through quite painful, as another friend can attest) so I'm not worried about it. But I am bummed that we didn't get to go to Austin and have to either postpone or cancel our trip to Oaxaca Mexico (we are currently scheduled to go the day before my surgery). I haven't cancelled the flights yet in case the surgeon decides something other than Feb 1 for the rip-out date. Oh, and no more attacks since that first one a few days ago so don't imagine me here lying on a chaise and moaning in pain. I'm in my cozy morning chair (in the dining room) getting ready to do taxes--which is painful enough. All chained up and nowhere to goThough we didn't get the 10-14 inches of snow predicted, and the winds weren't 45 mph, we did get quite a bit of snow Wednesday, and again more Thursday. We barely made it back up the drive on Thursday after driving into town to pick up mail. Friday I was feeling a bit stir-crazy as Dave had tied me to a chair all day Thursday (figuratively) to recuperate so I drove back into town to get Diet Coke and the mail. There was no way on earth I was going to be snowbound with Dave and Jessie and no Diet Coke. They can get... cranky. We hadn't been able to pick up the mail at our other house on Thursday because we didn't have the right key (for the third time in a row) so I wanted to get it too. Halfway down the drive, and with no way to back up successfully, I knew that I would never make it back up--even with 4WD and rear differential lock, and traction control, and whatever else the 4Runner has. So my main stop in town had to be to get chains. I have never put chains on a vehicle. I remember being in the car coming down the mountain from skiing when I was young and having to stop so dad could put the chains on, and I remember the cursing and struggling that accompanied the task. But needs must when the devil drives in snow.My morning view of the deckMy first stop was Ace Hardware--they don't carry them. Next was Murdoch's Ranch and Home Supply, and though they carry them, they didn't have the size I needed. But I scored front and back chains at Beacon Tire, and the mechanic brought my 4Runner into their shop and showed me how to put them on. I had two different types--one for the front and one for the back as they did not have two matching sets in my size--so I had to learn two different ways to put them on. The mechanic jacked up the back of the car, then he  did one side of the car while I did the other. Then he checked my side. It was still not easy to do--and I banged my hand right on the finger I either dislocated or sprained the other day--so I decided to leave them on for the whole drive home. To get home I had to go on the mostly bare highway, you can only go 25 mph with chains on, and on bare pavement they bump and clang something awful. But I cannot imagine what it would have been like to have to put them on by myself, at the bottom of our drive, in deep snow, and without being able to jack the car up in back (if you can't jack it, you have to drive forward and back in the middle of putting them on to fit them. Even with the chains and all the other fancy-schmancy all-terrain stuff that car has, it was still a tough drive to the top of our mountain.While hunting down chains, I asked everyone with whom I interacted if they knew anyone who did snow plowing. I even pulled up next to a guy in a truck with a plow on the front of it at a stoplight and rolled down my window to ask him if he plowed. Sadly he only did his own. I totally struck out on finding anyone, but I did go home with some leads.This morning I got ahold of the guy who delivers our wood, and asked him, and he does do snow removal. Her can't come today, but he'll be here tomorrow morning. In the meantime, the sun is shining, and we're snug as bugs in a rug in our mountain retreat. Happy snow day, y'all!"},
{"title": " Little House in the Mountains", "date": "Tuesday, January 16, 2024", "text": "I took a few days off from sewing to let my hand heal and to work around the house. There is firewood to bring in and split daily--we are getting easily half of our heat right now from the wood stove on the ground floor, and the temps are still subzero 24/7. The other day I unclogged the kitchen sink drain.  Yesterday I hauled a pickup load of cardboard down to the recycling drop-off in town, drove the garbage 1/2 mile down the drive to our bear-proof can for pick up, got the Excursion battery out and brought it inside to charge, and used Dave's sous vide heater to help unfreeze the sink drain in the garage... Little house in the mountains indeed. I felt like the Laura Ingalls Wilder of the 21st century.Everything I have done recently has been driven by the cold (or the snow). I bought a manual, hydraulic log splitter in Missoula recently to replace the electric one we had in Austin. The electric one had trouble working when the temps were in the 30's-40's, and I couldn't see see any way it would be useful up here so we sold it. The new one has two handles to work back and forth to split the logs. It's a decent upper body workout, and no one is going to trust me anywhere near an ax or a hatchet. We put it inside on the ground floor by the patio door, and every day we bring in three loads of wood and split it. It's messy--but warm!Driving the cardboard to recycling was more to make sure my old Ford pickup would start--and to get the garbage to the bin--than for a burning need to rid myself of cardboard. Dave and I will be driving the pick-up to the airport in Missoula on Thursday before flying back to Austin for a week. We have to leave the 4Runner for Jessie as her car can't get through the snow drifts on the drive. You have to have 4WD to get up to us now. I even got stuck in a snowdrift with the 4Rrunner on North Reservoir Road the other night while driving it to pick Jessie up from a friend's during a snowstorm. Fortunately a very nice man in a big truck came from the other direction five minutes after I got stuck (one of only two cars I had seen on the road at all) and used a chain to pull me out of the drift. On the way home after getting Jessie, we came across two other big men with two big trucks who had managed to both get stuck in the snow--and entirely block the road. There was nothing we could do to help them--and they had help on the way anyway--so we turned around (very carefully) and went back to find another road home.But back to the cold and my plumbing adventures. One of the first nights of this cold front the kitchen sink wouldn't drain. I tried snaking it, but still couldn't get it to work. So the next day I took it apart underneath and let all the water run into a bucket. When I looked in the p-trap (the curved drain pipe under the sink for you non-plumbers) it had an inch-thick plug of solidified fat in it! It was cold enough in the house that the fat solidified and I couldn't even melt it all with hot water. That never happened in Austin!The same day as the first plumbing adventure, I thought it might be a good idea to let a faucet drip in the garage so the pipes wouldn't freeze. Yesterday I went out and saw that the faucet was still dripping, and the sink was half full of... ice. I ran some hot water into it and stirred it around, but it still didn't melt enough to drain. So I got Dave sous vide heater, put it in the sink, plugged it in, and set it to 165 degrees. Periodically over the next several hours I checked it, and even when the water registered 145 degrees, the sink still wouldn't drain. By this time it was 10:00 at night and I didn't want to leave the sous vide heater plugged in and running all night because as soon as it heated the water enough, it would all run out of the sink and leave the heater running dry.When I felt the pipe under the sink, the first 12 inches of it were warm, but the next section--and the p-trap below it--weren't. Pushing up my sleeves (and not bothering with shoes or a coat--at least I was on a rubber mat in the garage with bare feet), I put a big cooler under the sink and unscrewed the pipes. This p-trap was full of ice--the entire bend. I cleaned it all out with the hot water from the sink and left it to dry overnight. Today I will put the pipes back on--and then drill out the elk antler for the coat. Just another day in the Great White North!"},
{"title": "Part 4: Finishing", "date": "Saturday, January 13, 2024", "text": "The sewing is done! All I have left are the closures and trimming off the bottom. The sewing was actually done Thursday--which was a very Good Thing as temps here have been below zero for the past couple of days and this is the only coat Dave has. He wore it to take me to the hospital yesterday morning and then out for lunch and errands. He got many compliments on it, and a checker at Safeway tried very hard to convince me to make and sell them online. (Insert ROFLMAO emoji here.) The hospital trip was to make sure I hadn't broken my hand below my right index finger while wrestling with firewood the day before. Looks like I probably just dislocated and relocated the finger. It was all swollen and sore yesterday, but it's much better today. Dave made me get it x-rayed as he was unaware of my medical certification and unwilling to accept my diagnosis without additional input.But back to the coat... Now it's time to do the closures. I use the word \"closures\" instead of buttons because I am not going to use buttons. I am going to take two pieces of elk antler crown (the place where the antlers detach from the head when they are shed) and drill holes in them through which to run strips of hide. The crowns will be sewn onto one side of the coat and the strips will tie around antler tips sewn onto the other side. I can do three if I need to, but I'm guessing two will be enough.When the closures are done, I will do the hem. Well not really a \"hem\" as I won't be folding it under and sewing the bottom edge: I'll just be cutting it straight. Right now there's a tail hanging off the back, and the curved edges of the natural hide make up the bottom edge. Dave has decided that he would like a straight edge--and he definitely doesn't want a tail--so I will have him stand while wearing the coat, and I will measure up the same distance from the floor all the way around and cut along the resulting line. The hardest part will be drilling the crowns and antler tips to attach them to the coat: not because of the drilling but because my drill press is in the garage and it's -17 degrees right now!"},
{"title": "Part 3a: More Sewing, Less Blood", "date": "Wednesday, January 10, 2024", "text": "All I have left to sew are the sleeve together--I had to section the sleeve pieces into three parts each to fit the hides, the sleeves to the body, and the side seams together. The hardest part of any upper body pattern (for me)--the collar and collar facings--is done. After that I will put on the closures. I can't really call them \"buttons\" as they are (big) pieces of elk antler that I will need to drill before attaching them, and then I will have to cut strips off the hide to be the ties between the antler bits. Fortunately there are front facings down both front pieces that will hide where I sew on the closures--and where I also will add reinforcement to the hide body so it doesn't rip at the attachment points. Previously my goal was to have the coat done for our trip to Austin at the end of next week. But the weather is changing here and we are set to go from 30-some-degree temps every day to -18 (with a -30 windchill) by the end of this week. Dave has dithered about getting a winter coat of any kind so the best he has right now are his data.world fleece vest and his big sweater. The sweater is warm and cozy, but the wind will cut right through it and freeze him into a Davesicle. In preparation for the cold, I drove up to the Murdoch's Ranch and Home Supply in Columbia Falls yesterday and got a new heavy blanket for Turi. I had to get the biggest size Weatherbeeta makes--an 84--for him so I could layer it if necessary. There were none at the Murdoch's in Polson, Missoula, or Kalispell so Columbia Falls it was. Remy came along for the ride--they love him at Murdoch's. We also picked up some more coarse waxed thread from the Joanne store in Kalispell so I can be sure I have enough to finish the coat. I'm not sure they love Remy at Joanne, but they didn't have a sign on the door prohibiting his presence so I took him in with me.Spending an hour each way to drive somewhere shopping is nothing new--for me, or probably for anyone anymore. But the difference between driving along a lake below the mountain peaks with few other cars on the road in the crisp blue and white winter for an hour, and driving in stinking, sweaty, mind-numbingly slow traffic in Austin, or Atlanta, or, or, or... Words cannot describe, and my heart sings."},
{"title": "Part 3: First Blood AKA Sewing the Pieces Together", "date": "Friday, January 05, 2024", "text": "Speedy Stitcher and binder clipsI have sewn garments since I was so young I don't remember learning. I know my mother taught me to make clothes for my Barbies--though I lacked the patience back then to do more than whack fabric into some rude pieces and sloppily stitch them together. I also remember writing somewhere some years ago about finding a quilt project that I had started with my grandmother when I was about ten. It was the Sun Bonnet Sue quilt, and I still have all the pieces we cut out and the few that we (probably Gramma) hemmed. By hand. Patience, again, not my strong suit. But someday I will finish that quilt--and the one I am making for Patrick McGarry out of his Crown Royal bags--though that last project is going to require an actual sewing room with multiple machines set up to complete it. Dave's coat is a project for a simpler, less technical time as I am hand sewing the whole thing. You read that right. Me, the anti-queen of patience, I am sewing every seam of a full-length coat by hand. In fact, I have already begun to sew--hence the initial part of the title of this post. It's hard to type with a deeply stabbed middle finger. 'S' is an irritatingly frequent letter. But I'm getting ahead of the story.First blood on the top edgeI am hand sewing the coat for a couple of reasons, the main one being that I do not have an industrial machine that will sew leather or fur. I know! A tool I do not have that I did not buy just for this project!! The second reason is that doing it by hand that I have more control over the outcome. And I did get to buy a special tool for it: A Speedy Stitcher sewing awl.  It's basically a wooden-handled awl with a sharp needle on the end and a hole running up through the handle to carry the thread. The thread is a heavy waxed linen, and instead of pinning the pieces together together to sew them, I'm using binder clips. The Speedy Stitcher is used to sew heavy materials like leather, vinyl, canvas, and upholstery fabric. It has two distinct advantages over a regular needle and thread: 1) The way you use it creates a locking stitch just like a sewing machine does, and 2) the awl handle makes it possible to push the needle through the heavy material without having to use pliers.The sewing itself is not too difficult unless I hit a tough piece of the hide. When that happens I need to have a thimble (though a block of cork would probably be better) on the back side so I don't jam the needle into my hand. Luckily I've only stabbed myself twice, and I have already sewn the front pieces to the back at the shoulders, the under collar to the coat, the under collar to the upper collar, and half of the front facing to the front. Tomorrow I am taking a day off from sewing to go to Missoula with Dave for shopping, dinner, and a movie--and to give my wrist a chance to rest as I feel a repetitive stress injury coming on."},
{"title": "Part 2: Cutting the Hide", "date": "Thursday, January 04, 2024", "text": "So there I was with my spiffy new pattern and two massive bison hides, and it was time to lay out the pattern, and cut the coat. Oh the terror and reluctance. A bison hide is a complete, beautiful piece of nature's art all on its own. How to even think about marring the existing flow and lines by cutting it? It was beautiful in the way a sheet of patterned blown glass is beautiful. I still have sheets of glass I bought over 30 years ago to use in stained glass projects that I haven't been able to cut because they are so exquisite just as they are and I have not not been able to see a way to make them even more. Then there were the technical considerations.Typically, to layout a pattern and cut a garment, you lay the fabric lengthwise down the table. Then you start at the top (one of the short edges) and put down the pieces one after another making sure to align the grain of the fabric and the grainline on the pattern. Bison does not have grain in the way woven fabric does. And it's nap--the direction of  the fur, the direction you pet a dog or cat unless you want to piss them off--doesn't run in a straight line along the length of the hide. It radiates out from an area on the top of the hump. This directionality makes sense as one of the functions of the fur is to shed rain and the nap is the mechanism that does that. And there were more things to take into account like the variations in length, texture, and color of the fur. And the variations were not just between the two hides, but within each one. The area around the legs had long, coarse, straight, black, guard hair. The hump fur was long but not as long as around the legs, very thick, but finer, and it was a little wavy, mid-brown, and gold tipped. Vast swaths of flank and shoulder had soft, short, light espresso-colored, non-directional curls--and then there were the combination areas. So how to cut the pattern so that not only would both sides match, but also so that there would be flow and continuity between the pieces on either side of the seams (e.g. sleeve to front and back, back to front, facing to front, collar to back, etc.,)? The answer: very, very carefully. I painstakingly laid out every piece and imagined how each would look when sewn to the others. Then I moved them around, tweaking the image in my head to match the new layout. I wanted to emphasize the upper areas of the coat--the shoulders and front collar by using a longer, thicker, lighter area there. For functionality and comfort, I wanted thinner areas under the arms--that area didn't need to be thick for warmth, and it would be easier to move the arms if they weren't encased in massive cocoons of fur. I also wanted to place the hump on the coat where it would have been on the animal--between the shoulder blades on the back. All the fur needed to point down to shed snow. I wanted to keep the option of using the natural edge of the hide on the bottom in lieu of hemming it, and I wanted to use the longer dark guard hair to fall over the wrists--negating the need to hem the cuffs. Finally the biggest consideration of all was that all the pieces needed to all fit on the two hides.The hides were the winter coats of two bulls. One of them was pristine. It was the work of art that I mentioned earlier in this post. But the other one... I'm not sure why I picked the other one except that it called to me. The tale of sourcing and handpicking the hides is a story for another day, but I mention the condition of the hides now as it added the final frosting on the complexity of the design. The second hide had many scuffed and scarred areas down the flanks and around the legs. It was clearly from an old bull who had lived a long life, owned his environment, claimed his place, and dominated his herd. The more I looked this hide, the more I wanted to honor that life in Dave's coat. So I decided that, rather than only use the unmarred areas of the hide, I would incorporate the scuffs and scars to show how badass he had been. Finally, pattern laid out, it was time to cut. I didn't even try to pin the pattern pieces to the hide. Instead I laid them on the tanned back side and traced around them with tailor's chalk, Then I used a furrier's knife--a handled tool loaded with a cut-down, double-edged, super-sharp razor blade--to delicately slice through just the hide. I didn't cut the fur, instead pulling it gently apart as I separated the pieces. It took two days, and I am thrilled with the way all the pieces came together. Luck and skill. Luck and skill.Next up: Let the sewing begin!"},
{"title": "Part 1 : The Pattern", "date": "Tuesday, January 02, 2024", "text": "To make any garment, you need a pattern, and garment patterns are more complicated than you might think. There are more pieces than just front, back, sleeves, and collar. There are also (at minimum) under collar and front facings. Then there's the way the pieces are sewn together and which lines get moved to size them up or down....  If you are lucky enough to have a pattern with which to start, then you still have to carefully measure your model to make sure that the pattern fits in all the appropriate places. You might think that if you are a size X in ready-made clothes, then all you have to do is buy a pattern for size X garments and they will fit just the same. However, consider this: When you go clothes shopping, does everything you try on in a size X actually fit you? No. Because there is no such thing as either an absolute standard size X pattern or an absolute size X body. The next consideration for the pattern is the material for the piece. There are MANY issues with my material. For the purpose of pattern fitting, the biggest one was thickness. The final pattern had to accommodate the thickness of each of the components (sleeves, front, back, collar, etc.) so that Dave would have the ease to move in the finished coat, but it also had to be tailored enough so that he wouldn't be overly hampered by the bulk of it.Right off the bat I was at a disadvantage because I had no coat pattern. I had a sketchbook containing a \"pattern\" of an original bison robe coat, i.e., a not-to-scale line drawing of the various pattern pieces with no suggestions on how to measure for them. I had several photographs of the coats worn by Kurt Russell in the Hateful Eight, I had photos of coats made by other craftsmen, and I had a womens' wool coat of my own whose lines I liked. The only true \"pattern\" I had was the one I use to make Dave's Hawaiian shirts. In my mind, I had a fuzzy image of how I wanted to combine the various elements of the coats in the photographs with the design of my wool coat to make a unique garment. To give me a leg up, I used the shirt pattern for the basic shape of all the pieces. Like I said--garment patterns are complicated and it's hard to tell which edges have to be which lengths in order to sew them together. Collars, facings and sleeves are not as straight-forward to resize as shoulders and sides are. It took three days of futzing, changing, and modifying to come up with a first draft pattern to use for the muslin. I had Dave try on my old wool coat for fit, and I made notes for where it needed to be adjusted for him. Then I traced the pieces of the coat (without taking it apart because I really like that coat) and added in the adjustments for his body. Finally I overlaid those pieces with the shirt pattern as additional validation that I was on the right track. When I was satisfied, I cut and sewed the muslin. For those unfamiliar with the term, a muslin is a test garment made from muslin or some other inexpensive fabric to test the fit of a pattern. I chose heavy canvas for my muslin to simulate the drape and movement of the finished coat. I lucked out in my choice of canvas fabric from WalMart--the only place in Polson left to buy fabric now that the local quilting store closed--in that it had a stripe pattern and the stripes in the finished muslin gave me a visual reminder of the direction of the grain of each piece. More on grain in the post on cutting the actual hide.I finished my muslin at 8:00 pm last night, and when Dave tried it on it fit perfectly. There were a couple of places where I needed to extend the length of a piece so it would fit with another piece sewn to it, but those are quick fixes easily made today. The fit and drape were the biggest issues, and they worked out. Was it luck? Skill? A combination of both?  I am not silly enough to think it was all skill, but I'm not falsely modest enough to lay the win entirely at the feet of luck either. It was a good day."},

As I was making the pattern yesterday, I decided to chronicle my progress here. So why a bison robe coat? Well, Dave has embraced his new inner Montanan, and saw a picture of the coats made by Merlin's Hide Out on the web. Merlin's made the bison robe coats worn by Kurt Russell in Quentin Tarentino's movie the Hateful Eight. But he didn't want anyone to buy him one, and I (of course) decided that it would be much more fun to make it than buy it anyway!Though I would love to get into more details, I need to actually go work on it.

I have become my parents: they kept our house 50 degrees at night and 62 during the day. I hated it when I was growing up, and Jessie hates it now, but I strangely like it. Fortunately for Jessie, the radiant heat from the floor in the basement keeps her room and bathroom a bit warmer. Today looks like a good day to try out a fire in the stove down there too. There is a vent in the dining room on the main floor for passive heat from it. Today we'll see how well it works. Snowing this morning!I am going on and on about the temperature as this is one of the first mornings I have been out of bed before 9:00 am. I wake early, but it's so cozy under the down comforter that I hang and read for awhile before getting up. This morning, however, I had someone coming to service the gas fireplace on the main floor--our main source of heat--so I was up and dressed by 8:00. I turned on the heat, made coffee, and watched it snow while waiting for the guys. Sadly they forgot to tell me that the unit needed to be cold for them to take it apart and clean it so off they went, promising to return sometime next week. Back to the snow. It's snowing!! Little, fine flakes, but snow!This Christmas was one of our best ever. I usually overdo, buy too many presents (spend too much money), and burn both myself and everyone around me out. This year we stuck to two presents and stockings, each and it was glorious. Dave got hiking poles for us and we started the afternoon with a long walk up the hill behind our house (it's tribal conservation land). Then, for the first time, we walked around our own property. Wow is it big!! Turi is gong to be one happy horse. The former owner created little resting/viewing areas and cairns across the property which are just stunning--and so fun to stumble upon while walking. our land is also mostly hill slopes so we followed animal trails up and down and around.Dave and the Pablo Reservoir on our walkToday I begin work on Dave's Christmas present.

{"title": "A Carnivore's Responsibility", "date": "Friday, December 22, 2023", "text": "View from the Nest (tm Anya)Yesterday I spent the late afternoon arranging the furniture in my Nest. I borrow that name from Anya as for the first time I have a small, cozy (the word of the year) space for sewing, spinning, and other lap fiber crafts. It's almost like a tower room as it is at the top of the house, a smaller mirror-image of the master bedroom and has three sets of windows. The bedroom faces east to the Missions, the Nest faces west towards the Flathead river and the Salish Mountains beyond. Dave helped me wrestle the new cozy chair purchased the other day in, and then made me a Negroni to sip as I watched the sunset from it.This morning there is fog in the valley and sun up here and across to the mountains. I am, as usual, in the cozy chair in my nook in the dining room, enjoying an iced latte and a Croffle from Bayside Riser. My wonderful spouse went out foraging first thing this morning before I was even awake and brought me sugary goodness and caffeinated sustenance. Today marks a new point in life for me: I put my money where my mouth is and I am assisting in butchering and packaging half a steer this afternoon. I like to eat meat. I LOVE steak. I love beef, chicken, pork, duck, venison, elk, bison... the list goes on. I also believe in responsibly and humanely farming the animals. I could go to the grocery store (or, rather, Dave could as he does all the food shopping) and buy cellophane-wrapped, sanitized meat in a package without a care as to where it came from, or how the animal that provided it was treated during its life. I could pay money and support the factory farming system. Or I could pay more and trust the marketers who label meat organic, free-range, grass-fed, etc. Frankly, I don't trust those marketers. Every one of those claims could be \"true\" and the animal could still have had a miserable life and/or end of life. Being a control freak, I found a way to know about every step in the life of my food. There is local rancher who raises all his cattle completely free-range on grass. He supplements with hay and a bit of grain in the winter, but the animals are still out in the field, in their herd. They are hormone, antibiotic, and everything-else free. They are never jammed into cattle cars and trucked to a feed lot to stand in misery and filth, eating grain and not exercising so that their meat gets softer and fat, (the way most people like it) until they are killed one after the other by strangers whose only job is the slaughter and butchering. They live their lives free and as comfortable as living outdoors in Montana in the winter can be until they are humanely killed at home by a person they know and who knows them. No fear, no stress. I know it's weird that all of that makes me more at peace with being a carnivore, but it does.I do not expect today to be easy. It is hard thinking that an animal that was living a week ago is now not living because I want to eat it. But if I want to eat it, I should own the rest of the process and take part in the rendering of that animal into food. As I do, I will give thanks to it for feeding us. Were I a better person, I would be a vegetarian or only eat meat from hunted--not farmed--animals. And I would also do the hunting myself. (I will not go into the necessity of humans hunting and our responsibility to keep down the prey populations since there are not enough other predators left to do it. That's a rant for another day.) However I am not yet that person. Maybe next year."},

I spent almost no time with him over the summer between time on renovations of my parents house and moving here--I hadn't seen him at all for two months until yesterday! He let me know it too. He looked at me, and then pointedly looked away when I walked up to the paddock to halter him and take him to the barn for his turn with Sadie the vet. Instead of coming right to me (his usual behavior) he made me slog through the gooey wet mud in my little suede WalMart boots to get him. Ugh. (I put Mucks Tall Chore Boots on my Christmas list when  I got home). But when I brought him into the indoor arena to check him out, he was AMAZING!! I let him off lead and just walked/ran around the arena with him at liberty, and he stayed right with me! Wer swooped and turned and he pranced and kicked up his heels and was my perfect boy. I am sooooo looking forward to bringing him home this spring.When I got home from the barn (I drove the grey beast--my favorite vehicle) I unpacked my goodies from Harbor Freight which included two truck ramps and a big Yukon tool chest. I put the wheels on the tools chest in the back of the pickup, put the brackets on the ramps, and then Dave and I wheeled the tool chest out of the pickup and down the ramp. There is no way we could have lifted it out. As it was, it skittered kind of fast down the ramp.By then it was dark, but not too late for either UPS and FedEx who both delivered packages to our door. Our driveway is a half mile long (I measured). It is gravel/dirt, one lane, twisty, narrow, and uphill. And they STILL deliver to our door! USPS, on the other hand, not only doesn't bring packages up the drive--or leave them at the bottom of the drive, but they don't even bother leaving slips!

Up here at Coyote Song (now officially named for the romping and singing we hear almost daily), we are IN the clouds. All day every day for the past several days it has been white as far as the eye can see (which, to be honest, isn't very far). And it's not snow--it's hoar frost! And it is cold... High 20's every day. But I am still soooo glad we finally moved here!Part of living in Montana in December is (re)learning a whole new skill set. So far I have mastered the gas fireplace (our small, primary source of heat), and am learning how to use the atv with the plow on the front, and manage garbage until we can drive it down to the bear-proof garbage can at the bottom of the drive (which is to say some enormous, to-be-measured-later distance). e got a cord of wood for the stove downstairs but haven't had a real fire in it yet. The closest I have  come is burning packing material and junk mail. That's mostly because we do not have a sitting area set up down there yet (though we got a small love seat last week to put down in front of the stove for cozy reading. The main room down there will house the games table when I finish repairing it from the move. It was badly packed and lost a leg.

We have the radiant floor heat on all the time down there, and she also has a small space heater in her room so it's nice and toasty. The main floor is noticeably cooler as the gas fireplace is really small, and there are high ceilings and openings into the rooms on the upstairs floor--which has no heat at all except for a small space heater in Dave's office.

While Dave has held down the fort (and the cats), I have been laboriously transporting our lives and belongings from Austin to Polson in a 16 ft trailer towed by a 2002 Ford Excursion (it's for sale if you want one!) or in 26-ft UHaul trucks. Four trips, two with each vehicle configuration, and I am done. Well sort of done if you don't count the last trip I will have to make with the 4Runner and the small trailer to pick up some wood (ironically purchased a few years ago in Montana and carried down to Texas), a loom, and some finished glass work. That trip will happen when the Austin house sells or spring, whichever comes first.I meant to start posting again on Day 1 as I am that kind of a girl. The kind that can't watch a series on  tv without starting at Season 1, Episode 1--even if the person with whom I am watching it has already seen all of Season 1 and the first episode of Season 2... (Dave!). The kind that has to have ALL the possible crayon colors (currently Crayola has120 in production of the 400 they ever made). But here I am, breaking the mold, being a little less rigid, and starting in the middle of the beginning...Dave put up the new Christmas tree today. It is new because the tree we had in the Austin house (9 ft) was just too big for the new house. Now we have a lovely little 7-footer, and it's just right. Too big/too much for the new house is the story of our lives right now, as we have seriously downsized on house (while upsizing on land). When we  moved from Atlanta to Austin eight years ago there were seven UHaul loads (I think--it is a bit of a blur in my memory). To get everything down to the four trips for this move, we had to divest A LOT. I didn’t want to add to the landfill so I tried to find homes for the things we decided not to keep. I sold some online, I donated some to various charities and Goodwill (a lot of effort to load, drive, and unload), and I still had mountains of stuff to deal with. I was overwhelmed and in way over my head, and then Angie the Estate Girl stepped in and took care of EVERYTHING. By the time I found her, I would have happily given everything we still had away just to get rid of the headache and stress. Instead I handed it all over to Angie and she not only managed to sell far more than I would have thought possible, but she also coordinated the donation of items that didn't sell, and the disposal of items that couldn't be donated. She (and her crew) were warm, friendly, professional, honest, supportive, and incredibly hard-working. I could not recommend them more. I cannot stress enough how STUPID I was trying to sell and give away our lifetime's worth of belongings without Angie! My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and hire her to help you move on to the next stage in your life or to assist you in dealing with someone else’s lifetime of stuff. If you're not in Austin, find another good estate sales agent.I wasn't there, but Angie had an estate sale in Austin last weekend and we made out like bandits on stuff that I was trying (and failing) to give away. It was a three-day event, and at the end everything that didn't sell and could be donated was (handled by Angie), and everything that couldn't be donated was hauled off in a dumpster (again, coordinated by Angie). The Austin house will probably go on the market in the new year when our fabulous real estate agent Dina deems it ready (repairs, painting, cleaning, staging...). In the meantime, we settle into our new life on in a house on the hill on 33 acres in Montana overlooking Flathead Lake, the Mission Mountains, the one million acre Bob Marshall Wilderness area, and the Pablo National Wildlife Refuge. On a clear day we can almost see Glacier National Park to the north."},
{"title": "Another Storm Cometh", "date": "Wednesday, February 08, 2023", "text": "I got back home from Florida a week ago, and I am just now getting back to a normal life and schedule--including posting! When I arrived home (7 pm last Thursday), there were so many trees down on our drive that Dave couldn't pick me up at the airport. The Uber driver even had difficulty getting me home as one of the main highways on the way home was closed due to downed power lines. At home the power had been out since 7:30 am. It was dark, but not too cold as Dave had a fire going. He had done some fancy cooking over the fire when the poower was out the night before (photos in the last post), and I continued the trend by toasting myself a bagel. Best bagel I ever ate--smokey, everything-bagel, and melty cream cheese.Friday dawned still cold, but no longer freezing, and the last of the ice melted off the ground during the day. Dave was resigned to not being able to get to the office, and we hunkered down by the fire. I wore my Minus33 long underwear, jeans, a t-shirt, and a sweater. Zaga came over and I boiled water and heated cream on the fire for French press coffee. It was surprisingly easy and good--albeit the pan of water kept tipping and spilling into the fire when the logs moved...When I went outdoors I layered up with a sweater vest, a hat, and combo mittens/fingerless gloves. This Montana girl was not daunted! (It actually felt kind of wimpy out for so much devastation and lingering problems--the power outage). In the afternoon an enterprising crew from a tree company came t the door and bid on removing all our downed trees. We took their bid, as did Dan and Zaga next door. They cleared our drive, vowed to come back the next day, and we haven't seen them since. Fortunately no money has changed hands and we can get a car down the drive, so we can wait.Like other preppers (in our case posters), we went to Walmart that afternoon for supplies, and got candles (not regular ones as they were sold out, but they had a lot of the tall glass religious ones for $1.57 each--sweet!), a grill rack to put in the fireplace to cook over, and a cast-iron griddle to cook grilled cheese sandwiches on over the fire for dinner. That evening we lit every pillar candle I ever bought in our married life as well as the new glass-jar ones and some beeswax advent tapers I found from years ago. I thought I had finally thrown all the old pillars away last fall as they were very dusty and we hadn't lit them in YEARS. I was glad to find I hadn't gotten around to it. Proof positive that as soon as you throw something out, you are going to need it. I am never throwing anything away again. Then we moved the games table over in front of the fire and spent the evening playing Terraforming Mars. One game lasts a few hours, and we ended up going through quite a few of the beeswax advent tapers. Pro tip: Take a plate, melt the bottoms of several little advent tapers. and stick them to the plate for a great improve candelabra.When we finally went to bed (the cotton sheets under a down comforter are FREEZING in a cold room!), we made bets as to when the power would come back on. Dave said Saturday afternoon, and I was sure it wouldn't be till Monday morning. We were both wrong as it was back by Saturday morning. We were lucky. We were only without power for three days. There are still 451 active outages in Austin with over 2,000 people affected a week after the outage started. Austin Energy hopes to have all power restored by Sunday the 12th. In the meantime, flood warnings and thunderstorms today. Definitely time to look into a way to flip our solar over from the grid to us so we can access it during an outage."},

I even bought a big laptop charging battery in the airport and am charging it for Dave. We are still without power at home with no idea of when it might be restored. I also heard from both Dave and Zaga that we lost a lot of oak trees from ice and breakage. As I understand it,  there are so many trees down in our drive now that Dave can't get down it with a vehicle until I do 2-3 days of chainsawing. Guess I'll be Ubering home from the airport. The pictures are courtesy of Dave, who cooked merguez sausage and leftover golden potatoes in the fireplace tonight. I am convinced he did it as much for experience points as for hunger. Thank heaven we got that half cord of wood earlier in the winter. Now if we just had a generator or a way to switch our solar from the grid to our own use when the power is out...This is the last time I am caught by stupid winter in Austin. I am going into full-on prepper mode, and will be ready for power outages with their dark, and cold, and meat-ruining abilities next year. I am afraid to know the current state of the meat in the freezer (all of the wild game and other exotic meat I got Dave for his birthday). We can't even get to the store to buy a bunch of bags of ice to throw in there to keep it cold. Never again. We have solar that produces 25-115 kWh of electricity a day--all of which is dumped when the power goes out and the grid is turned off. With the current state of batteries, there is no way to store enough to run the house, but we could go to emergency rationing at night, and probably get by during the day."},

We left the condo in Cedar Key and did a little shopping in Ocala (bead store and quilt store), before splitting up and heading back to our respective lives. I drove to Sarasota to deliver J's car to her, and to meet the boyfriend and have dinner with the two of them. It has been a bittersweet day: I miss Dave, Rémy, and the cats, but the weather here has been particularly fine and my only responsibilities have been to sleep, eat, craft, meditate, do yoga, and be somewhat social. Of course, now that I am not gainfully employed, most of my days may end up being like that! Cedar Key had a lovely small-town vibe, and  was relatively empty of tourists. Maybe the majority of the \"locals\" were snowbirds, but at this time of year there weren't gaggles of families with whiny, sticky, sunburned children clogging everything up. It was refreshing to see a median age of (I'd guess) 65. Or maybe I mean average age... Bah. It's math, and Dave's not here so it'll just be whatever I want it to be. Anyway, they were comfortably rowdy, rumpled, grizzled and grey-haired--and that was just the women! The sunsets could not be beat, and the stillness refreshed my soul.It was good to spend time with my friends on the annual trip--and I picked a particularly auspicious time to be gone as it's in the 70's and sunny here, while it's freezing ice, downed tree limbs, and electrical outages in Austin! I'm glad my flight tomorrow isn't due in till late--hopefully everything will have had a chance to melt and Dave will have been able to clear the driveway of downed tree limbs. Last night for our farewell dinner we went to the Big Deck Raw Bar & Grill for dinner and some stompin' good live  music (really. everyone was stomping). They had an amaaaazing selection of bourbon, and I ended dinner with a shot of Blanton's, ice on the side. There were only two women working the front of the house and one cook in the back, and it was PACKED). The one who waited on us as we sat at the bar--the only available seats in the place--was VERY generous with her pour... I ended up carrying some of it home there was so much.In line with being a newly poor, unemployed person, I am staying at a motel called the \"Golden Host Resort\" in Sarasota. It is also close to Ringling so will be easy to have lunch with J before heading to the airport.It is cutie-patootie and claims to house Florida's oldest Tiki Bar, the Bahi Hut. It also has a saltwater pool, drag bingo on Sunday, and other scintillating activities throughout the week. It looks to be a 1950's/60's originally side-of-the-highway-now-in-town motel, with a really spiffy remodel. The shower floor is a beautiful pebble mosaic, the fridge and microwave are 1960's baby blue replicas, and the furniture (chair and tables) is Jetson's chic. Seems clean, and has a comfortable bed--what more could I ask? And I might need to stay an extra day if the weather in Austin continues to suck. Okay, off to meditate before heading to dinner. Cute as the room is, I don't think I'll get down on the floor--even with my mat--to do yoga."},
{"title": "It's All About the Handwork", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2023", "text": "Coffee in a lovely sea green ceramic mug, Lynne's podcast on metal clay and the lapping of waves and the calls of the gulls for my music. Photo at right courtesy of Lynne, who is an avid and excellent photographer. This time in Florida is a time of focused, creative recharge. I brought four projects with me--two beading and two textile. I have so far worked on three of the four, and will start the fourth today. I have also meditated at least once a day, done yoga every day, and moved January from \"dry\" to \"moist\"... or maybe a little more damp than that. It's not sopping wet yet, but there are still two more days! Oh, and if all that wasn't enough, I finally figured out the premise for an urban fantasy series I have long wanted to write. More on that in another post. Today, it's all about the craft(s). Project I is a 3-D beading endeavor. On last year's January trip I visited Jumping Mouse Beads, a friend's bead shop in Blue Ridge GA. She had a frosted blue bottle with a peyote (bead, not hallucinogen) abstract sleeve on the neck that she used for a display prop. I fell in love with it, and convinced her to sell it to me. Since then I have wanted to do my own 3-D bead overlay, and the current project is a beaded deer antler. The idea, antler, and instruction came from Laura at Austin Bead Gallery I realized when I arrived here that I had neglected to finish drilling the holes in the antler, and had not bring any kind of hole-making apparatus. I am a resourceful mammal with a credit card so was undaunted. However, Cedar Key is a small town... village... dot on the map. It's smaller than Polson--our summer home in Montana. When we walked around the corner to the town's hardware store we discovered that they don't carry power tools. Nor did they have a manual hand drill. (Insert shocked face emoji here). So we all piled into Becky's car and drove 30 miles to the Ace Hardware in Chiefland to acquire a Dremel and a couple of 1/16\" drill bits. Back at the house-on-stilts, I drilled the remaining holes and set to beading. It's a completely unstructured project where both the beads and the stitches I use are at will and at random. I have just started this project, so there is a lot of bare antler and not very many beads--though there are more beads on the underside. But hat will change. By today even.A couple of hours later, I switched to Project II: an art deco-style beaded necklace by Linda Richmond with two gorgeous Swarovski crystal square rings for the focal point. It uses peyote, herringbone, and brick stitches, and came as a kit so I didn't need to design the colors or scrounge the materials--enabling me to just focus on the technique. After a couple of hours I had an inch and a quarter done... and three and a half inches more to go on the first small section. A bit daunting, but I reminded myself that it is all about the journey--and went to take a nap. Napping is a HUGE component of creativity--especially when nit is prefaced with a glass of wine.After napping and before dinner I worked on Project III:Norah's Vintage Afghan, a Berroco pattern which incorporates different colors and stitches in a series of knitted squares. I started this project pre-Covid or early Covid, and am about one quarter of the way through. I am not going to put it down again till I finish it. Ironically, when I first started it, I enthused about it so much to another friend that she also got the pattern... and then knitted the whole thing. To add insult to injury, she made it with the wool I brought back from Iceland for her. I, of course, have done nothing with any of my Icelandic wool. (Insert eye-rolling emoji here). I suppose if I make it a requirement to knit something with the plötulopi (a special kind of Icelandic yarn) I brought home before I can go to Iceland again, I might get in gear and knit a sweater... or maybe a tunic... a scarf?Today I begin another new project, a crocheted mandala afghan from Annie's Kit Clubs. I'm making the multi-color one on the right, and I know I won't have any trouble finishing this one as I already completed one of their other crocheted afghan patterns (in record time for me) last year, and I loved doing it. I gave it to Jessie, and she liked it enough she took it to college this year as her one blanket from home. This was quite an honor as she has at least three other hand-made blankets she could have chosen. Okay, enough with the writing about crafting, on to the crafting!"},

It's like being back on a cruise ship. Apparently I was able to sway the whole house by doing yoga last night after the others went to bed. I would NOT want to be here in a high wind.There is no place like Florida in the winter time: Birds, breezes, empty beaches--and golf carts galore. On the way to the beer shack last evening, I saw a cart bedecked with pirate skeletons and sea booty. Now THAT was a golf cart I would drive! I'm sorry I didn't get a picture, but the week is young. Pre-covid, I used to spend a long weekend every January in Destin for a spin-in. Imagine a conference room in a resort, filled with hard-eyed, hard-drinking, hard-shopping, hand spinners of all ages, pronouns, and declensions, and you get the picture. It was my January Joy. But the average age was probably 60 so the Boomer Doom (aka Covid) killed the in-person meeting. It still goes on (it's happening this weekend even), but over zoom. I am so heartily sick of zoom that it would have to be a really incredible live activity for me to be willing to join it. Until we have VR headsets with other sensory input (smells, temperature) for zoom, count me out. Even then, count me out.Florida is also old people. Wise people. My kind of people. (See above: hard-eyed, hard-drinking...). Except for the dearth of teeth. I'll go gray. I'll take wrinkles and saggy boobs, but I will not give up my teeth. So, old people. Let's talk about old people for a moment. When I was 27, a friend and I were making tiropita for the University of Chicago's annual linguistics conference (CLS)--traditionally catered by the first year grad students. Yours truly was the organizer for my year and I decided to do a Greek feast--hence the tiropita. Karen Deaton and I made HUNDREDS of little phyllo pastry cheese pies--many of them while watching Lethal Weapon. There is one scene where Mel Gibson walks to the refrigerator naked. No stunt butt. We were watching on VHS, and we used the rewind button to watch him walk back and forth, and back and forth, and back forth like a Hobbit (there and back again) as we cackled like mad . I see that Mel now, and I could not be less interested. Absolutely zip, zero, zilch attraction for me. But Mel Gibson now, in Fat Man... The Mel Gibson that looks like my spouse on a craggy day... Now THAT is a hot guy. I am aware that I have been becoming invisible to younger people. I am gradually being replaced by an old-person cut-out. Arguably, for anyone under 30, I have been unknowingly there for awhile. But it is more apparent to me now as I am more often looked through than looked at. And I remember looking at \"old\" people when I was in my 20's and thinking how horrible it must be to be old, and no longer attractive, and looked through by the young and vibrant. Now I recognize that thought as spawned by the arrogance and ignorance of youth, and I chuckle, quietly and evilly, to myself realizing that I look through them as much as they look through me. Thirty-somethings are not remotely attractive to me, (apologies to friends in their 30's but...). Instead, they seem larval and I feel parental. I know someday they will be interesting, but right now all they've got is hubris.Returning to the beer shack of yesterday, my \"type\" now must have grey hair--or at least salt and pepper, weather-worn skin with lots of laugh lines, and a solid, relaxed, I'm good-in-my-skin-ness that (for most people) does not come before 55 or 60. A man who knows how to laugh, live, and love for today. As I looked at the scruffy, old, hippy guys sitting and watching the world go by, I felt an urge to flirt. Obviously not because I am looking for anything, but because I was attracted, and felt like appreciatively expressing that attraction. Well-oiled, sleek, firm bodies on the beach just irritate me and make me want to yell \"Get Out of My Sun!\"--the old woman equivalent to \"Get Off My Lawn\"."},

{"title": " Techniques of F*ing Refinement", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2023", "text": "IntroLa Croix sparkling water in a can as I catch my breath after yoga and post. The sound of the oven, which has been producing delectables all the live-long day, is my music. The post today is named for Dave, as he is usually the one in the house who combines magic, science, and cookery into something really amazing. True to form, he is currently braising the most exquisite-smelling Korean short ribs. But this post isn't about the short ribs--or any of Dave's cookery. Nope. Today was my day to kick butt and take names in the kitchen as I upped my biscotti game. Today I made four kinds--two keto two regular--with four different kinds of dark chocolate--one keto (sugar-free) and three regular ranging from 55% to 72% cocoa --in five batches. I planned to make four batches, but I accidentally doubled one of the ingredients in one of the batches and had to double the batch. But that's okay because it was the regular Stella Parks straight recipe that got doubled, and I already know it's perfect so it served as the control group. The biscotti shown above are (from left to right):Regular (almond/anise) with Lily's dark chocolateRegular with almond flour and monkfruit sweetenerRegular with Guittard Extra DarkRegular with almond flour and alloloseRegular with Ghirardelli 72% cocoa The basics of biscottiI mentioned previously that Stella Parks is my baking guru. I wrote about her pie crust recipe, and today I delve into her take on biscotti. First, let me say, I do not like licorice. Anise is similar to licorice. I am not usually attracted to recipes that call for anise. The Stella Park's biscotti recipe is loaded with anise, but the flavor profile is so well-balanced that it works. What makes good biscotti? First and foremost, it must be hard. Biscotti is meant to be dipped, and there are few things more disappointing than the tip of the biscotti plopping off into your coffee and sluggishly swimming around dissolving in it. It also has to be sturdy--hold together and not crumble in the tin. Finally, it needs a complex, delicate flavor. An additional requirement for me today--as I made five batches and I only eat a piece a day--is it should have a long shelf-life. Stella Parks recipe has all of those things:It is satisfyingly rock-likeIt stays in one, perfect piece when cutThe blend of vanilla, toasted whole almonds, and chopped anise seeds is sublimeIt has no fat in it so it lasts *forever*I have made this recipe a few times in past couple of months, and though it requires precision and paying attention, it is not difficult. You toast the almonds, roughly chop them and the anise, mix the chopped bits with the rest of the dry ingredients using the stand mixer, add three cold eggs, and blend until smooth. Then you make a loaf from the dough, roll it out till it is as long as the half-sheet pan you bake it on, and pat it flat until it measures 17\" x 4\" x 1/2\". It is baked in three stages. The first, and half the total baking time is unttil it is puffy and just beginning to brown. At that point you take it out of the oven and let it cool five minutes on the pan and then five minutes more on the cutting board. When is just warm and no longer hot, you cut it into 1/2\" slices with a thin serrated knife, and put the slices on their sides and they go back into the oven for 12 minutes on one side and then 12 minutes on the other side, and Bob's your uncle! (That means they're done).Today's bunch of batches is in preparation for meeting up with some friends in Florida at the end of the week. As some of them are big keto-ers, I decided to play with the recipe a bit and make:almond/anise (the regular recipe, two batches)pistachio (no anise, otherwise the regular recipe)keto almond/anise with almond flour and monk fruitketo almond/anise with almond flour and alluloseAdding another variable to the experimentChocolates usedEven though the biscotti is perfectly flavored on its own, I also wanted to try tempering chocolate and drizzling it over some f the slices. For those who are not familiar with the term \"tempering\" (like me before the other day), tempered chocolate is chocolate that has melted and hardened in such a way that it forms just the right crystalline structure. Chocolate, you see, is a six-phase polymorphic crystal because of the cocoa butter in it, and the optimal polymorphic form is Form V, also known as beta-V. \"Beta crystals are composed of triglyceride molecules interlocked in a way that makes them most resistant to melting (they have a melting point of about 95 or 96 degrees F and most resistant to physical distortion (this is the reason the chocolate snaps rather than bends and doesn't set when cooled).\"  Really. Getting it to form into the beta V structure is all about managing the heat, and this is the only time that Stella Parks has let me down. She is old-school, and uses a technique called seeding. Seeding it too loosey-goosey (prone to failure) for me so I used the sous-vide technique detailed in this article by  J. Kenji López-Alt. He wrote The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science (which Dave, of course, has). He is an excellent, knowledgable, engaging writer, and makes the science-y stuff accessible to, well, everyone. In addition to being able to exactly control the temperature changes with the sous vide, another benefit of this method is that there is absolutely no mess and no waste. To do it you vacuum-seal the chocolate, pop it into a sous vide bath at 115 degrees F, after a few minutes (five or so) when it is all melted, drop the temperature to 81 degrees. To drop the temp, you add ice to the sous vide. When it gets down to 80 degrees, set the sous-vide for 90 degrees. As the temperature rises, take the bag(s) of chocolate out every minute oor so and really mash them around to keep the chocolate mixing, and the crystals forming appropriately and evenly. You can then hold the chocolate at 90 degrees until you are ready to use it.To use it, snip a corner of the vacuum bag like a pastry bag, and drizzle the melted chocolate. When you are done, you just reseal the bag with the vacuum sealer, and the left-over chocolate keeps indefinitely for future melting, re-tempering, and drizzling!The chocolates I used are:Guittard 63% Extra Dark Chocolate Baking ChipsGuittard Akoma Extra Semisweet Organic 55% Dark Chocolate Baking ChipsGhirardelli 72% Cacao Dark Chocolate Premium Baking ChipsLily's Dark Chocolate Baking Chips 55% cocoa (sweetened with Stevia)LabelingVacuum-sealed bags of chocolate, labeledWhen baking a bunch of different things which end up looking pretty much the same it is wise to label every stage of every batch. To this end, I used a black Sharpie to write the type of biscotti in each batch on the parchment paper. I also numbered the bags of chocolate chips 1-4 and put the corresponding numbers on the vacuum bags after I sealed them. Finally, I have pretty little cellophane bags that I Sharpied on the bottom with the code for the biscotti and the chocolate. Well, that was my INTENT anyway! the reality was pretty much like that, and even where I missed labeling I can tell which is which for the biscotti and most of the chocolate.Results - biscottiPistachio is a wonderful flavor, but just pistachio with no spice counterpoint is not as orally exciting as almond and anise. It made an adequate biscotti, not a brilliant one. Next time I need to find a spice for it...Almond flour doers not make biscotti. What it makes is closer to a coarse shortbread. It is also MUCH harder to handle as almond flour does not have the structural integrity of wheat flour (i.e., gliuten) so the pieces were prone to crumbling and breaking as they were cut and flipped for baking. The almond flour is richer and sweeter than wheat flour, and chock full of oil--something missing from regular wheat-flour biscotti. The oil also makes it a bit softer and not as dry. I would guess it is also less shelf-stable thanks to the oil. If I want biscotti, I prefer the wheat version. However, if I were gluten-sensitive or on keto, the almond-flour version (made with Stella Park's recipe substituting almond flour for all-purpose flour 1:1 and dusting the rolling surface with almond flour too) is not bad.  As for sweeteners, I had high hopes for monk fruit as it does not raise your glycemic level, has anti-inflammatory properties, is all natural, and has no calories. It is also 200 times sweeter than sugar. In spite of the disparity in sweetness, different brands of monkfruit sweetener recommend different ratios for substitution for sugar. I used HEB's brand which recommends 1:1, and it was both too sweet and had a weird sweetener flavor that I don't really like. Again, if I couldn't have sugar, the monkfruit version was good enough. It just wasn't great.On the other hand, the biscotti made with the allulose sugar substitute (Swerve) had a less noticeable taste and adequate sweetness. It is also used 1:1 for sugar. Allulose is another naturally occurring sugar that is 70% as sweet as sugar, does not raise blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is almost calorie free. The biggest downsides to allulose are the price (it is WAY expensive) and that excessive consumption can cause gassiness and bloating. I might experiment a little more, but my inclination now is to use allullose whenever I can't use sugar.Results - chocolateWow is this turning into a long post! Okay, all chocolate does not melt the same. There seems to be a correlation between flow of the chocolate and the percentage of cocoa. (Interesting note: For something to be called chocolate in the US, it must contain 100% cocoa butter and not any less expensive fat like coconut or palm oil). The Ghirardelli was runny like chocolate syrup and slightly melted into the sides of the biscotti. The Lily's dark and the Guittard dark (both at 55%) were very stiff and kept their shape, just resting on surface of the biscotti slices. The Guittard Akoma (63% and the first one I used) was almost as stiff as the 55% ones. Next time I use them, I think I will up the temperature a bit for the lower % cocoa chocolates to see if they will flow better.For taste and appearance, all were delicious and glossy with a good snap to them.ConclusionI have experimented enough with keto biscotti. I am going to stick with all-purpose flour and sugar, and make keto batches upon request for friends. My next forays will be into spice-nut combinations: pecan/brown sugar, molasses, cinnamonwalnut/nutmeg, clovepistachio/chai spicecashews/pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cloves)As for the chocolate, as easy as it is, I'll do it--but only for half the batch: There is nothing like the pure flavor of the biscotti dipped in coffee to make my morning perfect!"},

Instead I: had a facialdropped by the Austin Bead Gallery (ABG) for a refresher lesson on Peyote wrapping (I am beading a deer antler)started designing labels for the biscotti I want to package and give to friendswent to the retirement-from-data.world party at Jewboy Subs thrown by my wonderful spousedrank an entire bottle of lovely Roederer collection 242 champagnewent to bed at 8:45 like a really old personSo, bead soup. Where does that come from? I learned about bead soup from Laura at ABG. It refers to the practice of taking a bunch of seed beads and other small to medium beads (usually odds and ends leftover from projects in limited quantities), and mixing them all together in a baggie. This soup is then the material used for any abstract bead project--like the antler I am working on. I have a bead soup that I carefully made for my antler, and yesterday as I was looking for a few more beads to add to it, I dropped a whole tray of little boxes of beads on the floor of my studio. Some of them opened, some of them did not. Those that opened spewed little beads EVERYWHERE. My first thought when they hit the floor was \"CRAP that's going to be a mess to sort!\" But when I swept them all together to pick up, I saw that they made a really nice bead soup (shown above). As you might guess, I choose to see the inadvertent bead soup as a serendipitous metaphor for my life right now. It's kind of like, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade--only with beads!CRASH! Something just hit the floor behind me. I looked over at a swinging strand of carabiners and thought, \"Huh, how did whatever that was happen?\" Then I saw both the 19-lb cat slink under the table and the newly fallen container of red #15 Miyuki delicas spilled open on the floor. After yelling at the cat, banishing him from the studio, and sweeping up the wee beads, I have decided to just take the pile as a new addition to my bead soup of life."},
{"title": "Let the Day Begin", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2023", "text": "Coffee is long since drunk, \"Let the Day Begin\" by The Call on Spotify. Another day, another (non-) workweek begins. Yesterday was a holiday so I don't count it. Today Dave is back to work, and in wall-to-wall meetings. I chortle happily and head off to the fiber studio/office/she-cave to get on with MY day. Outside the wall of windows in front of me the sun is shining and the air is still. In the pause between songs, I hear the birds chirping, and my heart cannot help but to lift, to soar. No matter what the future brings, this moment is perfect. My mind races with all the possibilities for the day. A few of the most attractive ones are:make biscottiorder sausage casings and peruse recipes for exotic sausagereorganize the freezer so types and cuts of meat can be better organized (and three-year-old riced cauliflower can be humanely disposed of)piece Patrick's quiltfill frit orders from my Etsy shopchat with distant friendsdo a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight!Of course, even in the perfect life, there are the petty annoyances like helping the child cancel the gym membership she forgot to take care of before heading off to school (I have to do it in person), and pay bills. But in the minor scheme of life (much less the grand scheme), these things are so tiny that they won't even make me twitch. I may even make croissants! Never before have I had the time to really focus on making them, and now I want to master them. To help me out, a present from Dave arrived yesterday--a 16\" x 20\" marble slab for rolling pastry--and it's already in the freezer! Also yesterday, I mastered pie crust. Seriously! I think I posted this once before, but it bears repeating now: In seventh grade we all had to give presentations showing how to do something. I made a pie crust. For all of my life up until now I used my grandmother's recipe (oil--not butter or lard--and ice water) and method (rolling it out between sheets of waxed paper).  While others moaned and lamented the difficulty of pie crust, I smugly basked in my superiority. The crust was good in a lean way (my grandmother had MS and controlled it by strictly limiting animal fat), but when I shared it with Dave early in our marriage, he was not impressed. And years (decades) passed.Then Dave introduced me (literarily, not literally) to Stella Parks and her book BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts, and my perception of pie crust changed forever. Her piecrust recipe--which uses butter, a laminating technique similar to the one used for croissants, and abundant flour--is a game changer. The first couple of times I made it it was good. Or at least, it was okay. It wasn't stellar (get it? Stellar? I crack myself up), and I attribute that to two things: 1) I didn't follow the recipe exactly (right down to the size of the butter cubes), and 2) I didn't give all of my attention and focus to the texture of the dough--both in terms of what I wanted it to be and what it was. Pastry is precise. You don't throw things in, and taste, and modify, and expect to create something perfect every time. Sunday I made two crusts (I meant to make one, but I accidentally doubled the water needed so I made two), and I was precise (in spite of the water snafu). I kept the butter big. I didn't overwork or soften it in the mixing, and I folded the crust just so before chilling it and rolling it out. Dave made her Frankie's coconut creme pie recipe (also from BraveTart) and a bacon and cheese quiche with them yesterday. The remains of the pie are shown above. No, we didn't eat it all! We gave half to Zaga and Dan. I haven't tried the quiche yet, but will have it for lunch today. The crust was no kidding the best I have ever had anywhere. Crispy, layered, buttery, salty, a hint sweet, light, flaky... you get the idea.All this talk of food has made me hungry. Good thing I start every morning with a 30 minute walk!"},
{"title": "Timey Wimey", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2023", "text": "I sip water as I listen to The Dave Brubeck album Time Out, and I ponder the essence of time. This morning I have already gone on a walk with Zaga and Rémy, and made my list of tasks and schedule for the day. My list yesterday was HUGE, but I got through it, and it didn't require a Herculean effort. My efficiency yesterday got me to wondering why I have been so ineffectual over the past 10+ years. Really, my effectiveness started going downhill as soon as I met Dave...I clearly remember lamenting how I couldn't get anything finished anymore after we moved in together. I did even less after Jessie was born, and less still when my mother moved in with us--partly because my mother started doing a lot of the tings I wasn't managing anyway, but also because I just couldn't. I have beaten myself up for years because I kept thinking I was just slacking, and I felt guilty about it.Yesterday, as I moved smoothly through my chores, I realized that it wasn't that I had been doing less for the past 28 years, it was that I had been doing unacknowledged and unappreciated (by me) other things instead. I am not only \"retired\" now (we'll see how long that lasts!), but I am also an empty-nester, and a woman in a solid relationship built over the past 28 years. A relationship that doesn't take the amount of time anymore that it took to build it. The amount of time and mental energy I am spending on things other than the ones on my \"list\" (chores and creative) is almost nil. THAT'S why I'm getting done: because there are no longer things that are not on my list for which I am still holding myself accountable.The fact is, people take time. Whether you are actively engaging with them or not, the people around you take time and mental energy. It may be naive, but I never took that time and energy into account when I was planning what I would get done in a day and madly scrambling to (fail) to accomplish it all--even though I was often (mostly) exhausted at the end of every day. I do not believe it's because I am more efficient now than I used to be. Instead, I think it's that I have fewer things pulling on my mental energy... and maybe that I'm not as overweight as I was for, oh, the past 28 years (try carrying a pack with two water cooler bottles full of water all day and see how much energy you have). Damn! I was mean to myself for no reason! I criticized and denigrated myself ,and felt small and bad because I didn't clean the kitchen and wash the dishes every night like someone in every other household did. Dave does the cooking, I'm supposed to do the cleaning. I have never managed it on a regular basis till very recently. When I started putting away the food, straightening the kitchen and loading the dishwasher every night right after dinner, I thought it was because I was finally growing up and becoming the adult I should have been by 30. But then I remembered that I was always more successful at these tasks in Montana. I blamed not doing it on being overwhelmed by the house here, but it was the number of people in the house, not the house itself.Wow. This has been a long ramble about time, and I'm not sure I've quite noodled it all out, but I think I'm on the right track. But the list is calling, and the time allotted for posting is over for the day. I'm going to check in with the rest of the world and then go put away laundry."},

This is the song I want played at my funeral. I'm listening to it today less for that particular song and more because Dave and I just got home from a big screen showing of La La Land, and I'm feeling jazzish. Think I'll move over to \"Take Five\" by the Dave Brubeck Quartet now. What has Ryan Gosling been up to lately? Has he retired too? Oh yes!

I still have a pie crust to make, a dog to walk, yoga, meditation, a loom to dust and put together, and a quilt to work on. Time is really screwing with me right now. Tuesday it flew by, Wednesday was very slow, Thursday was just right, Friday I started to feel behind or slow myself, and today? Today is a hot mess... but only if I let it be.

Could the morning get any more surreal? No I don't have a gun...The truth is, as I sit here reflecting, I can't remember how long it's been since I've been this consistently happy. When I wake and realize there is no potential conflict ahead in my day, I feel the physical release in my shoulders and in my breath. And then I get the buoyant bubble that rises through my body and bursts forth in a smile. Life is good. Really, really good. Sure, I have my share of first-world problems, but they are just that: less than dandruff on someone else's shoulder.It's too bad that leaving a job is a bit like getting a divorce: The friends always get divided up and you never know if they just weren't friends in the first place, or if there is some other pressure in their lives that makes them choose not you. Whatever it is, the constant thread connecting me to the majority of the people who have been in my life for the past several years has snapped: I no longer have access to Slack (the texting/communication app used by everyone at d.w). And I find myself thinking, \"I need to post to yoga pod to see if anyone else had as much difficulty with the asanas as I did today!\"... and I can't. I am no longer on it. But those thoughts are momentary regrets, less substantial than the ash of last night's fire. In the bigger picture, the sun is shining, and the world is my oyster. Today I work on the lovely quilt made from Crown Royal bags for Patrick, meditate, walk the dog, do yoga, blog, check in with friends, do some paperwork (including signing my exit papers--Free! Free!), and end at the movies (\"Plane\" with Gerard Butler) with the love of my life. I know I said the music references were done, but \"The Finer Things\" by Steve Winwood came on as I wrote the last paragraph and I just can't ignore the obvious message the universe is sending me?

Listening to \"If We Were Vampires\" by Jason Isbell and the 400. This is one of myfavorite songs, and a poignant call-out to where I am--where we all are really--in life right now....If we were vampires and death was a jokeWe'd go out on the sidewalk and smokeAnd laugh at all the lovers and their plansI wouldn't feel the need to hold your handMaybe time running out is a giftI'll work hard 'til the end of my shiftAnd give you every second I can findAnd hope it isn't me who's left behindIt's knowing that this can't go on foreverLikely one of us will have to spend some days aloneMaybe we'll get forty years togetherBut one day I'll be goneOr one day you'll be gone...And \"Turn the Page\" by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band just came on. Man, Spotify is really messing with me this morning!So what does one do with a bunch of new free time on her hands while waiting at the fork in the road for a sign on which direction she should go? She meditates. Does it go well? No, no it does not. I get no effing birds. Let me explain...I got Dave a Muse for his birthday, and he loves it. So I got one for me at the end of the year. The way it works is that it reads your brain waves and gives you auditory feedback on how calm you are as you listen to waves, or rain, or a river, or (mostly) something else to do with water. As your brain calms, the water sounds gentle. When you get really calm, you hear birds. When we meditate together, Dave turns on birds only so we aren't drowned in water sounds. What this means for me is that I hear waves crashing against rocks in a hurricane from my app and Dave's sounds like he's in an aviary.Dammit, I FEEL calm! And, yet, yesterday I got one lousy bird. One! And I was only \"calm\" for 5% of the meditation. Is it the caffeine? Should I meditate before coffee? I don't know if I can do anything before coffee--anything that requires staying awake anyway. Or is it just me? Am I wired all the time? Two days in a row, three birds total. Grumble, grumble, grumble. This morning's music is really funny--\"Straight To Hell\" by Drivin N Cryin just slid into \"Ruby and Carlos\" by James McMurtry. For those not familiar with the songs, the lyrics go from \"As we walked into the sunA new days promise hadBegunWe'll make it aloneWhether you like it or notI turned and shoutedHelp me motherI'm going straight to hellJust like my mama saidI'm going straight to hell\" to \"...And holding back the floodJust don't do no goodYou can't unclench your teethTo howl the way you shouldSo you curl your lips aroundThe taste of tears and the hollow soundThat no one owns but youNo one owns but you\" Okay, so maybe I'm not as calm as I thought I was. As I finishing writing, \"Sweet Jane\" comes on. (Sadly by Mott the Hoople and not the Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground version, but the lyrics are almost the same. Unlike the Cowboy Junkies version. They seem to have missed the point completely.)\"...And there's always some evil mothersThey'll tell you life is just full of dirtAnd that women never really faintAnd that villains always blink their eyesAnd that children are the only ones who blush'Cause life is just to dieBut, anyone who has a heartHe wouldn't want to turn around and break itAnd anyone who ever played their partHe wouldn't want to turn around and hate it\"I'll take it."},

{"title": "Perception shifts in life", "date": "Tuesday, January 10, 2023", "text": "The view from my deskThe days of coffee and music to start my post may have come to a close. I already drank my coffee while walking the dog, and I am happy in the quiet as I sit at my desk and ponder life. This blog is supposed to be about creativity and living a creative life. But right now, this minute, I don't feel creative. I feel... Old? Still? Poised? Finite? All of those are true, none of them are bad, and none of them catch the full essence of this stage, this transition I am at in life. There really is something unique about the moment you truly acknowledge that there is more--probably MUCH more--behind you than ahead of you. Some special people probably go through life knowing that every moment counts and making the most of all of them. But I bet the majority are like me: blithely rushing ahead from one flower to the next with not only no concept of the limited scope of our lives, but with a blatant complacency that there is all the time in the world. This isn't the first time I've had a shift in my perception of life. The first was in my 20's or early 30's when I thought of all of the stupid, dangerous shit I did as a teenager and into my 20's, and was both appalled at my naivety, and grateful for my luck. I went from \"I am immortal, nothing bad will ever happen to me\" (the belief of all teenagers who get into cars with strangers, drink and drive, ride motorcycles at high speeds with no helmet on, party recklessly, and do a plethora of other really (really) dumb things) to \"I have to be careful and keep myself safe, then I will live a long life\".The next time I started to see my place in life differently was as I approached 50, and I realized that there were doors that were absolutely closed to me. I would never be a doctor, or an astronaut, or serve in the military. Not that I wanted to do any of those things, but the idea I had had my entire life that I could do anything and be anyone I wanted was no longer true. Physically I could not go through a medical residency (that was more for my weight at them time than my age, but the feeling was the same). Nor would I be allowed to train to be an astronaut, or join the military: I was too old. Over the next decade, more and more doors closed. That I would never be a landscape architect was one that really stung. And it wasn't that I couldn't become one, it was that I believed I did not have the time left to build a successful career at it--I would be starting all over and losing all the life experience points I had gained up to then.In spite of some negativity, those previous shifts felt more like a progression in life--a narrowing of focus if you will, whereas this one feels more like a readying for the end. How morbid! But, while it is my intent to live a full, active life till I'm at least in my nineties, I realize that I might only live to 67 or less... What if I only have five more years? There is so much left to see and do--and I don't mean things that will be left in my inbox. I am done caring about those. No one gets everything they're supposed to do done, or finishes every project they've ever started. But I think everyone wants to lie on their deathbed and think \"I did everything I needed to do\". And it will be hard to do that if I keep wasting my time on unimportant goals and unappreciated work. But it's hard to let go of the safety net! It's hard not to be afraid of ending up unable to support myself (a truly unrealistic possibility). Some part of me feels that I have to look for another job, and to use my skills for making money. But I want to be what I perceive of as selfish and spend my days doing the bare minimum of responsible things, and the absolute maximum of things that give me joy. I don't want to be \"responsible\" and get another job where I will be undervalued and unappreciated by a younger generation who is as blind to my worth as I was to those who came before me. I am still energetic, vibrant, smart, resourceful, dynamic, and soooo experienced. I have a lot to offer to a new employer, but do I want to? Where is this all coming from you might wonder. Well, I applied for unemployment for the first time in my life yesterday, and part of the process is looking for a new job. I did my duty, and while there were mostly positions that would not interest me in the least up on the job boards, there were a couple I felt drawn to--and one I even applied for. What if they call me? What about the creative project I have been hinting at and planning for? What DO I want to be when I grow up?!?"},

I wasn't much of one for a schedule when I was \"working\", but now that I am not it, I can see that it would be very easy to fall into sloth and sloven.

{"title": "A New Beginning", "date": "Saturday, January 07, 2023", "text": "Coffee in a lovely mint green and bronze ceramic mug, nothing but the clacking of the keys for music this morning. My new companion Rémy lounges regally next to me, waiting till we go for walkies. Today I opened a blank page in this blog for the first time in almost a year and a half, and fell right back into the comfortable pattern of many years ago: what coffee mug was I using today, and what music was I listening to. When I began blogging almost nine years ago, writing was really, really hard for me. I was self-conscious as I had been told my writing wasn't good by both my undergraduate and graduate mentors, so I believed it wasn't any good. But I started the blog because I had just been offered a book contract with a well-known publisher, and I needed to start exercising my writing muscle daily and getting stronger so I could tackle the book. I started with that opening sentence because I found that once I wrote  \"Coffee in the...\", it would unlock my mind and my fingers and I could go on with the rest of the post. Pretty soon, daily blogging became an addiction, and I discovered two things: 1) I loved to write, and 2) it mattered less that my grammar was perfect and I had just the right number of commas in my sentences than that my message was clearly and engagingly communicated. I went on to write the book. Then a few years later, another. Later still I took a technical writing job. Now I have come full circle back to the blog to help me with another project similar in size and impact to the book. But let me back up a bit...When we moved to Austin several years ago I closed my teaching/retail studio in Atlanta and focused desultorily on my studio work and gallery relationships from Austin. I plodded along, but the joy had left  glass for me, and making the same pieces over and over again was not satisfying. When a shiny object in the form of a new endeavor, a new project--one that actually paid a living wage--presented itself, I reached out and took it. And it was good for awhile. But then it, too, became more and more of a daily grind, and less and less of an adventure. Finally, the only thing that was keeping me in it was fear of losing the income--and the occasional challenging project that made the politics bearable. I considered taking a second retirement (having officially retired from studio glass work to grasp the corporate shiny object), but the aforementioned fear held me back. Last week the choice was taken from me, and I found myself... free. And really, really happy and at peace for the first time in over a year. That was unexpected. I thought I'd be angry, and hurt, and stressed about money, and feel like there was something wrong with me--and I was and did--for about an hour. Since then, it's been nothing but up.I breathed in and thought about everything I would do with my new free time. I would get caught up on the things I needed to do in the Austin house (like unpack and take back the garden and yard), and in the Montana house (like finally sort through my mother's things  and transform the house from my parents to ours). Between the have-to's, should-do's, and want-to-do's, I had enough to keep me busy for the rest of the lifetime I have, and I was energized. So of course when someone suggested I take on a new project, I jumped at it. As in my very first post, I am going to remain mum for now on exactly what the project is. I don't want to tip my hand before I'm ready, or to jinx it. I will say that it is a culmination of everything I have learned and done over the last 50 years. And it has to do with glass. And it is about sharing knowledge. And it is full of passion, and joy, and verve, and poetry. Most of all, it is me being comfortable in my skin, believing in myself, and knowing my own worth.Stay tuned..."},

For those of you who are curious and aren't lost, read on. For the rest, skip to the next paragraph. For the pattern I am using, the repeat is 23\" wide. This is an awkward, indivisible size because the next step is to cut the lengths into even smaller strips--3.75\"-4\" in width. These strips will then be cut into equilateral triangles with the aid of the lovely device above right.The goal of all the pattern planning and laying out and cutting is to get sets of six identical pieces of fabric to arrange into hexagons. You can either put the triangles in each set together randomly (pick one of the points and use it as the center of the hexagon for each piece), or you can be like me and try out all three combinations for each hexagon, taking pictures of each in order to decide which of the three you like best. Then you pin them together and set them aside to sew.  Last night I put together 43 hexagons. Tonight I finished the last 27. I wish I hadn't finished listening to Kitchen Confidential over the weekend (read by Anthony Bourdain himself) as that would have been a perfect accompanying activity for laying out hexagons. As. it was, last night I watched See, a series set in a dystopian future where all human are blind, and tonight I indulged in three episodes of Clarkson's Farm. Dave couldn't get through either of them with me--and you can see why with Clarkson's Farm featuring Jeremy Clarkson nattering on about planting crops, raising sheep, running a farm stand, raising chickens, planting trees, the bloody regulations, and irrigating--all from the perspective of someone who has no background in farming, no patience, and very little ability to listen to the advice of the people he hired to advise him. If you don't know who Jeremy Clarkson is, look him up. A less likely English farmer you would be hard pressed to meet.But back to the hexagons. Every part of this quilt process so far has been magical. When I sit down to sew all the fiddly little pieces together, I may feel differently,. But I don't think so. Each hexagon is a tiny work of art--and no two of the sixty I cut are the same. I think opening up each one of them to sew it together is just going to be another ooh-ah moment.I close with some of my favorite sets. Each of the pictures in the sets of three is made by turning the triangles in the hexagon in a different direction. Sadly, only one of the three will be realized as no two sets are alike.I guess I should have taken the pictures on a plain background instead of my ironing board cover..."},

It's a cold, rainy day in Montana--unusual for August but very welcome. It is a good day to snuggle up and watch old black and white screwball comedies from Criterion--and to cut quilts... and maybe shirts. It's amazing the things I find in the oddest places! Last week I was lamenting not having the pattern I use to make Dave's shirts. It's out of print, and a friend suggested I look on eBay for it. I did find one in Australia for about $30 (item and shipping), but I have two copies in Austin, and since I'll be there soon for a week, I decided to wait and bring one back. Then today as I got ready to cut strips for my quilt, I opened a box of sewing supplies and found two copies! I also found my mother's serger (I serge all the edges of the shirts) so I am in business! Before this post--and my time--gets hijacked (again), I am going to hold off on the shirts and stick with the quilt. The technique is over 20 years old and is called by several different names: Stack and Whack, One Block Wonders, and Kaleidoscope Quilts--just to name a few. The premise is that you can make an entire quilt top out of one fabric, and it will be complex and unlike any other quilt that could come out of that same piece of fabric. It can be as symmetrical or asymmetrical in design as you wish. This is not your grandmother's wedding-ring quilt. (Which is not to say I don't like wedding-ring quilts--I love them. I just don't think I'd have the patience to do one.) I like projects with tension and abstraction to them, and this quilt really fits the bill.It's also interesting because it's all about geometry--equilateral triangles made into hexagons to be precise. I won't go into the hows here--you can look up videos on You Tube or buy books if you want top know more. I bought two books by Maxine Rosenthal et al (shown here) and am using the fabric I posted a couple of days ago (shown again at the beginning of this post). I also used the Design Helper tool on the one block wonder website to see what my fabric would like. Below is what one version of the quilt in my fabric would look like when run through the Design Helper. Got to get cutting now. More pics and a longer, more thoughtful description of the process and my experience with it later. ...Come to think of it, maybe I do! Definitely time to look in the garage. I was cleaning up the sewing area here in the basement and I found a large, green, garbage bag under my cutting table. A wave of foreboding swept over me, you might even say my blood ran cold. Let me back up a bit.Early in July--not too long after we arrived from our annual migration from Austin--my cousin and his children came to Polson for a visit. Evenings, as we'd sit in the cool of the basement watching tv or exchanging stories of the day, Charlotte (the daughter) would run about the room chasing after little moths. When she'd catch one she'd exclaim with joy as she squished it. The moths looked like India meal moths or wool moths--but I couldn't figure out what their food source here could possibly be. When our guests went home, I still saw the occasional moth, but apart from squishing them myself, I didn't do much of anything about them.For a little background: I had a horrible infestation of wool moths in my fiber studio in Austin a couple of years ago. I NEVER want to go through that again! I had over 300 lbs of raw wool and roving and who knows how much yarn. The two easiest ways to kill moths, larvae, and eggs, are to heat them over 120 degrees F for more than 30 minutes (the dryer works well), or to freeze them for 72 hours to two weeks--depending on your source. I could not imagine tryin to run all that through the dryer--and potentially getting eggs and larvae everywhere. Instead, I got a new chest freezer and used it (along with our giant freezer and smaller freezer in the laundry room, and the bottom-of-the-fridge freezer in the kitchen) as a fiber de-incubator. I bagged and cycled all my infested yarn, fleece, and roving through them in multi-week stages to freeze everything dead. Since then I have been vigilant for their return, but nothing yet. Flash forward to today. I gingerly peer into the garbage bag and immediately slam it shut (you can slam a plastic bag shut if you really put your mind and hands to it). Then I race outside and open the bag again. As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, a flutter of small brown and white wings lift towards my face. I pull back and start removing small white plastic grocery bags covered in moths--many of the bags were more hole than bag--and throwing them to the ground. I finally upend the bag and dump a slurry of moths, chewed bags, and... sand to the ground. Only it isn't sand. It is what the moths turn raw fiber--in this case yak fiber--into over the course of three years. There is still the occasional fluttery critter in the house--and the birds are feeding well outside--but I feel confident that the sweaters, socks, and other apparel knitted by my mother and my father (which is still in the house) is safe. Mostly because they preferred to knit with acrylic rather than wool. I never thought I would be grateful for that choice, but here we are."},
{"title": "An end and a beginning...", "date": "Saturday, August 07, 2021", "text": "Coffee is a large iced latte with no sweetener in a McDonald's go cup, my music is provided by the water in the fountain next to me. It feels both poignant and fitting that I start this post with the same cadence I used over 15 years ago when I began writing this blog.  (Sidenote: Does anyone even blog anymore? It feels like everyone who is compelled to write puts it out on Medium. Bleh. Too many lurid peeks into other peoples' dysfunctional relationships. No thanks.) But writing here feels right as it is official and out in the world (and if I'm honest it really has been true for awhile): I am no longer a working glass artist. Life in pandemic times caused a major evaluation of my life and its parts, and I decided to go on to the next chapter. I am selling all my kilns but one. I already sold my sandblast cabinet, and now I just have several hoarder's crates of glass and other misc supplies to sell. No, no I am NOT selling my flat lap grinder--don't even ask. I am selling my pottery kiln (which I shamefacedly admit has never been fired). It's a studio-sized behemoth I got as a sweet deal as a-scratch-and-dent sale from the manufacturer when I was a dealer for them. The kiln is neither scratched nor dented, but the box it was shipped in arrived damaged at the school that bought the kiln so they refused delivery. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought it... Yes I do. I was in Atlanta, I had space there in my studio to set up a ceramics area, there was nowhere else close to drive to do it, and I was annoyed at Spruill Cneter for the Arts and unwilling to give them any more of my money to take classes there. I also had a friend who lived nearby that I potted with and she was keen to set up our own area too. I have no such circumstances in Austin, and I do have a good arts school near the house where I can take classes and use all of their equipment when I get jonesing to put my hands in the clay. So bye-bye massive ceramics kiln!It's time to take the website down, and to put up a notice up that the artist from Siyeh Studio has gone on to her next chapter. It is weird: A major part of what defined me for the past 36 years was my identification as a glass artist--whether part time and yearning for a full-time career, or full time and wondering why I had ever thought it was a good idea. Now... I am an artist and a craftsperson, but not a \"working\" either of them. I am happy to say that I have FINALLY--for me--resolved the distinction between \"artist\" and \"craftsperson. Everything I see and often what I hear, evokes a vision in my mind of something else that it could be, should be, wants to be--or just inspires. Colors, textures, materials, clouds, songs, wood, textiles, rocks, gems, shells, paper, huckleberry compote--they all come together. I see them all extended, aggregated, reduced--transcendent. That's the part of me that is an artist. Realizing the visions in my head? That's the craftsperson, and in most instances I fail. There are many, many things in my head that I cannot realize. It is frustrating and disheartening, and the way it is. On the bright side, I see the work of other artists and craftspeople and I no longer want to make what they made for myself. Now I prefer to buy the work of others and admire it for what it is instead of thinking \"I could do that.\" I am not driven to be able to do everything. I used to be driven to do everything except draw or paint--I always knew that those two were beyond my abilities to master, and I didn't love them enough to be willing to be mediocre at them. Same with dance and music. It takes time, focus, pain, and hard work to master those disciplines, and I could never see myself giving any of that to those disciplines. For the things I do choose to create, the prospect of the production of mediocrity somehow doesn't bother me. I can see something beautiful in my creation even if it isn't technically masterful. I can feel the connection of the muscle memory in my hands with the vision in my head. This object that I just finished may be only okay, but the next one will be better and then better. I have the relationship with the muscles and nerves in my hands and the focus required to realize my visions of some things. Typically the things I do well at are things combined of objects that I already find beautiful. I see a selection of fabrics and a quilt appears in my head. I see gems and stones and a complex necklace in silver, gold, or copper coalesces in my brain. Glass still inspires me as much as did when I started working with it over 36 years ago, but now I have circled back to my first glass love--stained glass. Fusing no longer pulls me, and I don't have the patience for casting (too much time waiting for something to be done and too little time with my hands actually on it).Wow. This was supposed to be a post on a quilting technique I just saw for the first time last week when I was buying batik fabric for more shirts for Dave. I fell into my own vision of a quilt using this technique, and I have given myself up to the rabbit hole. Ah well, there is always tomorrow. Today it is time to cut! I end by popping up a visual teaser for the quilting project at the top of this post."},
{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Monday, January 14, 2019", "text": "Pippin the new cat with JessieHas it really been over a year since I posted every day? Yes, yes it has. The last time I posted was June 24 of last year--the day I cut the end of my finger off while in hot and heavy pickling mode. Since then I have had three ER visits (not finger-related), one heart surgery, two hospital stays, two times having my heart stopped, a new cat addition to the family, and I'm finally writing again! That's a lot of happenings, and I don't want to talk about any of it (except maybe the cat). What DO I want to talk about? Fiber!A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away (Montana) ... I bought a spinning wheel and fell in love with spinning exotic fibers--alpaca, llama, yak, camel, etc. Rovings (fiber for spinning) from these animals are expensive, and I quickly discovered that it would cost many hundred dollars to buy enough luxurious softness to spin into yarn to knit into a sweater for Dave. Then I hit upon on the seemingly brilliant idea of buying raw fiber, having it processed at a mill into roving, and then selling half of it to pay for my own habit, er, projects. Yak crack, if you will. Thus the business Farm2Yarn was born. Sadly, it has remained in it's infancy ever since. What can I say? I am a easily distracted by new, shiny ideas (can you say squirrel?).The alpaca/silk blend sweater I spun and knitted for DaveBut Farm2Yarn is back on top of my list, in my sights, and on my radar. It currently shares top billing with Siyeh Studio Glass (my production work--not teaching or selling supplies), and contract technical doc writing (most recently and I hope again soon for data.world). What do all of these things have in common? They are each and every one activities that count towards What One Does For a Living. Both Siyeh Studio and Farm2Yarn have nascent business plans (I might even finish them this time instead of starting with a plan but then chucking and winging like I did the last few times), and I have determined an amount of technical writing that I would like to do to fill that niche of my esprit.Why so many different things? How will I ever do any of them well splitting my time like that? Besides being easily lured (shiny!), I am also easily bored. There are too many wonderful things one can do with one's time to spend \"full time\" on one thing--for me at least. So this week--with this morning taken out for jury duty--is devoted to dyeing fiber for an upcoming fiber event where I am a vendor, and preparing materials and communication for an upcoming glass show where I will have a presence in the form of a SALES REP (how professional is that?). I have already given data.world a nudge that I am ready to begin a new writing contract the first of February, and I hope my nudge bears fruit (Hire me! Hire me!). In the meantime, Glass Incarnate is going to be split into tales of the trials and tribulations of running a retail fiber materials business, a wholesale art glass production business, expanding my brain while writing for a (partial) living, cooking with the Instant Pot, and maybe some tales from the dark side if my heart starts spluttering again. Whee! Let the wild rumpus start."},
{"title": "Day 2 of Pickling/Preserving, and a Trip to the ER", "date": "Sunday, June 24, 2018", "text": "The bounty of the day!With the few good fingers I have left on my right hand (two), I begin my post. Aaaaand there's already blood on the trackpad. (sigh) Time to change the fingertip bandage on the thumb again. BRB.Today is another canning day for me. I still say \"is\" as I have 10 lbs of cucumbers and 1 pint of morels sliced, resting in salt, and ready to pickle in the next hour and a half. I am running late because my day was unfortunately interrupted due to an accident with the mandoline. More on that later.The day started with rhubarb chutney. About 30 minutes into cooking the chutney it became apparent that you can't make rhubarb chutney from frozen rhubarb as it has very little structural integrity to start with so maintaining a good structure is an impossibility. So I called Dave over to get his opinion. First thing he did was stick his finger in the pot and taste it--something I had not bothered to do yet. \"Yum\", he said. \"I can taste this on a pork tenderloin.\"\"So, sauce?\", I responded.\"Oh yeah\", he said. Then we went back and forth a bit on how much more it should reduce, whether I should strain it or leave the vestiges of rhubarb, onion, raisin, and spices in it. The decision was leave in, and thicken a bit more. I ended up with three pints and 7 half-pints of incredible rhubarb chutney sauce that sealed perfectly after canning. Then I moved on to the rhubarb syrup. That was a genius move as I am--post ER and six stitches--enjoying a rhubarb sour made from Bulleit rye, lemon juice and some of the afore-mentioned rhubarb syrup. I only got two pints of the syrup from about two lbs of rhubarb, and it's pretty thin, but boy is it yummy! One pint has already been cracked open and put in the fridge after we used the left-over two ounces for the first two sours. But I'm getting ahead pf myself...After the syrup, it was after noon and time for the cucumber pickles. My goal was a double batch of bread and butter slices and a double batch of garlic dill spears--16 pints total. Oh, and one pint of pickled morels that didn't get used up in the beef stroganoff last week. It being Sunday, Dave had a hankering to take in a movie. When he asked if I'd mind if he went to a matinee of The Incredibles 2, I assured him I wouldn't (we all saw it on opening day, he just wanted to go again), but I did ask him if he would mind walking down and I would pick him up after in case I needed to run to the store in mid pickle. Boy was that a serendipitous choice!So Dave left and I started slicing pickles. I was lamenting not having a wavy pickle slicer when I glanced over and saw my mom's old mandoline. \"Well\" I thought, \"At least I can have perfectly sized 1/4\" slices.\" And thus, like Alice, I fell down the slippery slope to the rabbit hole. Dave had said many times in the past how dangerous mandolines were and how he'd be happy to check me out on it if'n I wanted to use it. \"How hard could it be?\" I mused. It was surprisingly easy! In fact it was so sharp that I thought I wasn't pushing down hard enough and the cucumber was just sliding over the top of the blade. When I looked underneath and saw the perfect little 1/4\" slices I was very happy and started slicing back and forth really fast, congratulating myself on how efficient I was and how I was goig to show Dave the great job I did with the mandoline... and as quick as that I knew I had gone right through my finger with the preceding slice. I looked at the blood welling from the top right side of my ring finger and the flat spot where there used to be tip...But I'm good in a crisis. I washed it off, covered it in paper towels and lifted the mandoline to retrieve the missing part. There it was, a slice with a good bit of fingernail still attached. That's how sharp the mandoline it: I went right through 1/4\" long section of fingernail without even slowing down. I picked it up, put it sloppily back on the end of my finger, and thought about what I should do next. Should I just bandage it tightly on and hope it grew back together, or should I go to the ER to see if they would sew it back on? In the end I opted for the ER. I also opted for not calling Dave as I reasoned there was nothing he could do other than be stressed and wait, and he might as well enjoy the movie and I would pick him up and he would see me again when everything was fine. In hindsight that was a bad choice and what he was most upset about. (We live five blocks (1/2 mile) from the hospital and it's only another 10 blocks to the movie theatre.)My fingertip sewed back onIt was a busy day in the Polson ER, but I didn't have a long wait before the doctor came in, shot up my finger with novocaine, and had me wash it. I was fine until then. But when she had me walk to the sink and scrub my hand and stump (okay, long stump--I didn't lose that much!), I got hot, nauseated and light-headed and had to lie down. In my defense, I had eaten anything all day and it was A LOT of blood (and gore. Think the slices of people that they have in the Museum of Science and Industry in Hyde Park in Chicago...) The doctor finished cleaning the finger up and then sewed the tip back on with six stitches. I didn't feel a thing. She said the nail bit would fall off on its own and she didn't want to pry it off .When she was done she said to take ibuprofen for the pain, then the nurse bandaged me up, gave me a tetanus shot with a whooping cough vaccine in it, and they sent me on my merry way.When I got home I still had half an hour before I had to go get Dave from the movies so I thought I would finish the pickles. The first step was to wash the mandoline--not to use it, mind you. I had already decided to use a knife for the rest of the cutting--perfection be damned. However when I turned it upside down I saw that there was blade storage underneath, and in it was a wavy pickle blade! I could not resist. I gave in to the temptation and switched out the blades vowing to be VERY CAREFUL and to go slowly. That mostly worked out for me. I say \"mostly\" because when I was almost at the end of the cucs, my hand slipped and I rammed my thumb and middle finger into the blade. I didn't cut through or slice off anything so I just bandaged the fingers up, washed the mandoline off again, and calmly cut the rest of the cucs. When I was done I washed the mandoline, salted and refrigerated the cucs, and headed off to get Dave.After taking the bandaids offthe index and thumbWhen we got home I (against his wishes) cut the remaining cucumbers up into spears for garlic dills and salted and refrigerated them. I didn't take any pain reliever in pill form, but Dave did make me a rhubarb sour from the extra rhubarb syrup that didn't fit into the jars to can (as noted above). He had one too (probably to steady his nerves--a side effect of being married to me) and they were so good that we opened one of the jars of rhubarb syrup so we could each have another!After dinner I made the brine and jarred up the pickles before processing them (and the lone jar of morels) in hot water baths. Now it's after 11, I am still not in pain, and I am toddling off to bed for a well-deserved rest. Oh, and I've decided what to call my pickles: Brenda's Bloody Good Pickles!"},

As I post, I listen to the satisfying pinging of the lids as they sea to the jars, and I try not to dislodge the cat on my chest. I last made pickles when I was 17 and I remember making quarts and quarts of garlic dills. Today I made four pints of pickled beets, one pint of pickled carrots, one pint of pickled beets and carrots, and three less-than successful half-pints of pickled strawberries. I can already tell the strawberries were less than successful because when I look at the jars I see mostly liquid with a few berries floating on top. Looks like my berries pretty much disintegrated. But I bet the liquid in them will make some interesting cocktails!All the recipe books and web recipesThe main reason it took me so long to make so little is that I just couldn't settle on recipes. Last time I used my mother and grandmother's garlic dill recipe and that was that. No fussing about which spices to use in my pickling spice, which vinegar to use, which sugar and how much. Today was just fraught. At least three times I picked a recipe that really looked good and made it all the way till the final review before noticing that it was a refrigerator pickle recipe. I don't want refrigerator pickles. I want hot-water-bath processed pickles that will last a year or so. Unfortunately recipes that fit that criterion also specifically written for carrots, beets and strawberries aren't thick on the ground. But as Dave (and his t-shirt) like to say: I improvised, I adapted, I overcame. (Really, he has that on a t-shirt now).My first pass at pickling spiceThe biggest challenge came after I got all the jars full of produce and brine and I couldn't get the hot water bath to boil! We have a Jenn-Air range with one of those flat electric tops up here in Polson, and I don't think it made enough contact with the bottom of the huge canning pot for the water to boil. So in the middle of canning I made an emergency trip to Walmart to get a smaller stock pot for the hot water bath. When I got home Dave remarked that I could also use the gas burner with the propane tank on the back deck... The stainless stock pots I got at Walmart will make nice dye pots. I used the canning rig on the gas burner--just like my mom, grandmother and grandfather used to do.Results from Day 1Tomorrow I will make traditional garlic dill and bread and butter pickles, pickled morels, and a whopping big batch of rhubarb chutney. I hope it to get a better showing in output than I did today!"},
{"title": "The Child is Traveling", "date": "Saturday, June 16, 2018", "text": "Inside the C'mon InnJust back from Missoula after seeing the child off to Atlanta for two weeks. Because her flight was at 6:15 this morning, we stayed overnight at the C'mon Inn (as it is Jessie's favorite for the indoor pool, multiple hot tubs, and overall cool decor--it's also close to the airport and we had a two-room suite) and I took her to the airport this morning.I swear I must be flagged by Missoula TSA. Last time I was taking Jessie to the plane there I got into a \"discussion\" with the person checking id's as there was only one person checking ids and there were probably nine people standing around by the luggage carrier and the screening machine all doing basically nothing. Meanwhile there were two long lines of people--one TSA pre-check--which J was not, and one regular, waiting to get through the id checkpoint. As long as there was anyone in the pre-check line they got to go in front of the non-TSA line--even if they just walked up to the line. After watching person after person get to walk up and go in front of our line, I finally asked to talk to a supervisor. Nothing happened other than more \"discussion\", but that's how things go.The old and the new in downtown MissoulaSo that was last time. This time we waited in the ticket counter line for over 20 minutes (just to drop off baggage--we had already checked in) because for some reason everyone who checked in at the kiosks then had to go through the main line and check in again. And there were only two agents. Today I kept my cool figuring they would just have to hold the plane if they ran late checking us all in. We were the last ones checked through before they closed the counter as it took our agent awhile to print me out a pass to go to the gate with J. You'd think I would have learned my lesson from last time. Don't go to the gate!Missoula has special crossing signsWe got to the id checkpoint and sailed through. We took off our shoes, and placed everything in bins. I had been careful not to wear one of my Holy Clothing dresses because even if that's all I'm wearing (I know, TMI) it always sets off the photo machine thingie where you have to stand with your hands up and then they have to pat me down. This happened to me so many times that I got a known-traveler number just to be able to always have TSA pre-check and avoid those scanners.The baleful mooseBut you don't get to use your KT number when you're not traveling, so I wore knit capris and a tank top. Even so the scanner saw something in my \"groin area\" so they had to pat me down. Then they tested my hands for explosive's residue and... THAT scan came back positive! (WTH?) At this point I told Jessie to just go on up to her plane as I had no idea how long the rest of it was going to take (they offered to take me to a private room for the next part, I refused). Then another person gave me a REALLY thorough pat down followed by a detailed examination of the contents of my purse (wallet, phone, keys) and a wipe down of my phone to check it for residue. I held it together, remained quiet and polite (mostly), but this procedure really makes me come unspooled and it happens to me all the time! Luckily I did get up to the gate in time to give Jessie a hug and a kiss and to see her off. She was the last one on the plane and they closed the gate behind her.Goodies from the farmer's marketWhen I left the airport I stopped by the Starbucks across from the motel for a venti iced latte. There were--no kidding--five sheriff's cars in the parking lot at 6:15 am. The girl at the window said they come there every day at the end of their shift. So if you're ever in Missoula at 6:00 am and you need to go somewhere really safe, hit up the Starbucks on Reserve and I-90. After grabbing my latte, I hied myself back to the motel for a couple more hours of sleep snuggled in with my warm, snoozy spouse.One of the hanging basketsI had been looking forward all week to going to the Missoula Farmer's market, but it was cloudy and damp when I took J to the airport and actively raining when Dave and I got up. I went back and forth on should we stay or should we go (we didn't have jackets or umbrellas), but decided in the end that we are hardy folk and don't need no stinking umbrella's. Off we went to the Old Post for breakfast with Steve Adler. Above our table was the obligatory moose and he gave me the stink eye all through breakfast.Hanging basket and other flowersWhen we were done, we hit up the liquor store and then headed to the farmer's market. It is worth noting that Montana is an interesting state when it comes to liquor stores. While you can buy packaged liquor at bars and some stores, it is all distributed to the bars and package stores through the state-run liquor stores so you can only buy what the state decides to carry. It's great if you're looking for a local huckleberry liqueur or spiced gin (we have a plethora of western Montana distilleries), but if you want Luxardo sangue morlacco or Creme de Violette, you're out of luck. I'm just going to have to see if I can get some of our upcoming visitors to bring us some.Anyway, at the market we bought by a pound of lovely, fresh, morel mushrooms, little carrots, tiny cukes, red bibb and oak leaf lettuces, colorful little heirloom tomatoes, and local chorizo and brats (not children, German-style sausages). I even got a few purple and sweet basil plants for the garden. All this was after going to the Polson Farmer's Market yesterday and loading up on hanging baskets and flowers for the deck (already planted, thank you very much).Tonight we are having our neighbor Arlene over for dinner. Dave is going to make beef stroganoff with the shrooms, we're going to have Kir Ursine (like Kir Royale but with huckleberry liqueur and sparkling wine) with a smoked salmon dip made from local sockeye salmon to start, and strawberry sabayon for dessert.Speaking of food, it is the summer of the preserve for me! I am going to make small-batch pickles of various vegetables, and preserves, compotes, jams, and chutneys from the bounty of the local markets."},
{"title": "Epiphany", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2018", "text": "Some of the yarn spun from the various breeds I've processedLast winter (not this past winter but the winter before) I took the first level of the Master Spinner program through Olds College in Alberta. I took it off-campus at Spry Whimsy in Stoughton, WI and am very much looking forward to taking the level two class there in October. I was supposed to have my coursework for level one finished and in to my instructor for grading this past February (one year after the class was held). I failed. I failed so utterly and completely that I failed to do anything other than buy fleece (because I love to shop) by February. So I applied for and received an extension till the end of June. The end of June is hurtling towards me, and I *could* get everything done. It would cost me (and by extension my family in terms of my time and attention), but I could finish. And I have been working hard to do so.Earlier this week I was chatting on Facebook with another woman from my class who is also pushing till the last minute (though for much better reasons than mine), and she made the comment that if I am running short on time I should pick and choose what I can get done. After all, I only need to PASS. So I sat down this afternoon and I figured out how many points are assigned to each section, where I am on each of them, and what I need to do to PASS. What interests me most in the course (almost entirely) is the spinning, and I have that all but done. With one more day spent writing, I could have over 50% (passing) of the coursework done and send it in for grading without even having to do the natural dyeing section or the final project. I could even get those done by the end of next week if I wanted to.In the spirit of winnowing, I also looked at the various sections and picked out three that I would definitely skip as they are writing only and I don't even WANT to do them--yes, I could regurgitate the facts in my own words, but why? And as I sat working through everything, I flashed back to what Jessie and Zaga have both been asking me for the past two months as I have fretted over the deadline: WHY? Why am I doing this? My answer to them was because I want to. I am taking these courses because I want to learn. Because I want to increase my proficiency in spinning to where I feel that I am a Master Spinner. But do I need to turn in the homework to get someone else's validation in order for that feeling to occur? This past week I have been finding myself cutting corners and doing the work \"well enough\" to get a decent grade. But the end goal for me is not and has never been a grade! I am not competing against my classmates and other people in the program to see who can get the best score or a perfect score. The only person I want to please is myself, and I am pleasing me by the acquisition of knowledge.So why I am doing the coursework to turn in? Why not use what I learned from the course as the basis for my own ongoing breed study binder and the beginning of a natural dye book? Why not make myself samples of worsted and woolen and identify the qualities of the different parts of a sheep's fleece and record information on them for a later benefit to me? Why think about/work towards on the grade AT ALL? I know, it's blindingly obvious to you, but it was quite an epiphany to me!Tomorrow I am going to call Olds College and inform them that I want to audit the course. Auditing costs the same as taking for credit, and I don't get a certificate at the end. BFD. I am not doing this for the certificate. Then I will continue with the work I have been doing on the qualities of the the fleeces of various sheep breeds. I will have a natural dye day or two. I will process all the different kinds of sheep fleece that I bought (and brought to Montana) but didn't do because I didn't need them for the course because they only wanted 10 and I got 20. Now the breeds I have will be a foundation for working with ALL the breeds (that a girl! I have always been an I-must-have-all-the-colors crayon user).Deep breath in, deep breath out. I have the answers to at least one of life's questions."},

I begin today's musings with that post snippet as it serves to highlight just how much has changed for usin the past three weeks!Driving through Polson along the lake our first evening back\"It's a balmy, hot day scouring wool for me. I'm in the wet studio at the house (aka the greenhouse) and I have the door to the outside--where it is 91 degrees F--wide open. Inside the studio it's 96 degrees in the shade. But I'm not working in the shade. I am smack dab in the middle of the room in bright sunny sun. Even the glass studio is cooler than the wet studio today. But I have to get these fleece samples all scoured and set out to dry today so I can sort and scour a whole fleece tomorrow. I hope I've processed enough of each of the samples. I didn't want to do it all as I might need more raw fleece for another one of the projects, and I only have to spin 20 yds from each sample. That's not very much to spin, but I also have to spin enough to weave two samples on a pin loom. Guess I had better spin up a test fiber to see how much I really need for 20 yds and the tow little woven pieces...\"In the weeks following that post the temperatures climbed higher and higher and stayed there. By the first of June we had already had 100 degree days and nights where it didn't get below 74. Welcome to Austin in the summer. Then one week ago we (the Griffiths) went through a total reset. Today marks the end of our first week in Montana and so much more has changed than just the weather--though that's dramatic enough on its own. No more 100-degree Austin days: It has been sunny and warm all week in Polson (till today) with days in the 70s and nights in the 40s. Ahh to snuggle under the down comforter again! It's been very hard to get up in the mornings. By the time we left Austin I was getting up at 6:30 or 7:00 so I could work outside and beat the heat.Fresh snow in the mountains this morningThis morning when we woke it was 48 with a high expected of 55. There was fresh snow on the mountains and a nippy wind blowing through town. Dave and I took advantage of the coolness to walk down to our local coffee shop: Blodgett's Creamery and Coffee Saloon. It's three miles round trip, down hill on the way and uphill on the way back. (Not, as legend would have it, barefoot in the snow up hill both ways!) There are two photos on the wall of the coffee shop taken by my great grandfather, RH McKay. Only one of them is dated, but it is 96 years old.Photo of the lake by my great grandfather in 1922Photo of Polson taken by my great grandfather--not sure of the yearThe front garden is in serious need of weedingNow I'm cozy on the couch under a blanket and posting before putting a piece in the kiln and getting back to my spinning coursework. This week I need to start weeding the garden, plan the restaining of the front and back decks, begin cleaning out the garage and the back patio and getting the last of my things out of the metal building up at the lake property. While there are no bees and is no pond here, my routine is pretty much exactly what it would be if I were still in Austin--and I have no less to do. But it feels totally different! There is a huge break caused by the exhausting two-day drive up and the total relocation of household. It's still a household, and thus it's still a lot of work, but somehow it feels like starting from scratch with no backlog, no baggage, no stressors. Time stretches expansively in front of me--just like it did two years ago when I moved to Austin. There is something awesome and liberating associated with this not-vacation travel. Like on vacation, time slows to a crawl and it feels like you exist in a vacuum.Then there are also the beautiful surroundings. Austin is lovely and our house there is beyond wonderful, but I am a mountain girl at heart and it makes said organ sing to be back in the midst of them again. I won't miss the cold and snow of winter here, but there is no place better in the summer. That said, I wish I had had the plumber verify the connections for the propane stoves upstairs and down so we could have some heat today, but my blanket is cozy and we have a space heater. And there are martinis, albeit in wine glasses..."},

Then this past week I traveled with a good friend who likes to read my posts and always comments on them and he got me thinking about starting up again. Then today, out of the blue, another friend texts me to say that she misses my daily posts and asks if I have any plans to start up again. Yes! Yes, I say! Let's jump back into the whirlwind! This post is going to be kind of all over the place as I stream-of-consciousness my way back into posting so hang on tight.Life is, indeed, a whirlwind right now. The image at right shows my to do lists for today and the rest of the week. Everything in the Today column was completed save for setting up the fleece sorting area and beginning to process the fleece. Whew! Not only are we preparing for the annual summer exodus to Montana, but I also have one month to finish the Level One Master Spinner coursework and send it in for grading. In order to finish it I need to (shameful admission) start it... It's also the end of gardening season in Austin (I can't work in the garden when it's over 80 so early mornings and evenings are it now) and the weeds are busting out all over.I still have the automatic watering system to set up in the garden beds, plants to get in the ground, weeds to get out of the ground, and mulch to succor the plants and defend against the weeds. (I really wanted to use the word \"excoriate\" in that last sentence. I don't know why. I have never used the word before, but it popped into my head and wanted out. I even managed to spell it correctly on the first go. But when I looked it up [I often think of words with which I have only a glancing acquaintanceship], it means to criticize or skin (isn't it a great word?) and can in no way be associated with mulch. Unless you have really snarky mulch, which I don't.)Don't even get me started on the pond! I have the entire filtration system to rebuild and an auto-fill system to set-up--not to mention the automatic feeder for the fish. And then there are the bees. I have two hives and Zaga has one. They are all going gangbusters and I can actually see getting some honey out of them this year. I inspected the hives today and they are bursting with nectar and brood. I almost thought I shouldn't feed them because of all the nectar, but I went ahead as they're popping out babies as fast as they can and I want to make sure they have enough to feed them.A couple of weeks ago I had a REALLY bad day and had a woman back out of a parking spot at Walgreen's into the side of my Odyssey. It was an opera worthy of Wagner, and we ended up all waiting over an hour in the rain for the police to show up. Now today I finally get to take my car in to start the process of getting it fixed, and the bodyshop can get me in Monday--but the need the car for at least ten days as it's a \"really intensive labor process\". I guess so. Unfortunately, they can't guarantee to be done before we leave for Montana so it's not getting fixed before we go. What a hassle!!Other exciting news of the past few months is I have lost 21 lbs! I even won a month-long biggest loser competition at my gym. I'm hoping to take up regular swimming in Montana this summer (both in the lake and at the aquatic center) so I can keep going down.Now, as so often happens when I post, my eyelids are beginning to droop, and I yearn to snuggle up in bed and drift off to sleep till morning when it will be time for a piano lesson, a workout, and lunch with Zaga, followed by a lot of wool scouring and a little glass work. Life is Good."},
{"title": "I Have Been Doing!", "date": "Sunday, February 18, 2018", "text": "Sometimes you think about doing something. Sometimes you write about it. This past week I have been doing it. I have five projects in five different disciplines in progress and it feels GREAT! I also continue working weekly in a sixth discipline with a steady stream of projects coming from it. No, I haven't put my tax stuff together for our accountant yet. No, I haven't worked on my website or inventoried my extra glass studio materials preparatory to putting them up for sale online. No, I haven't done more than spot cleaning on the house in, oh, forever. But I am creating! This post is a celebratory drive-by of the creative fruits of my... fingers.It's Sunday night, the wind is howling outside and the wind chimes practically have a symphony going on. Dave and Jessie have both gone to bed, and I'm sitting on the couch, rubbing my hands together and chortling at all the piles of creation nestled throughout the house (and car--all my wood lives in the minivan between Saturday woodworking classes).The oldest continuously worked project is my spinning mash-up. In addition to the three bobbins on the table and the two spinning wheels with half-plus filled bobbins, I also have a good amount of plied yarn that I began knitting into a sweater earlier in the winter. I'm going to tink (unknit or knit backwards) the sweater and skein the yarn back up till I find the project I want to make with it. I still haven't found one that matched the yarn perfectly so I just keep on spinning.Moving on through the fiber projects, I have finally finished warping the little table loom I got at spin-in (and correcting mistakes in it, and correcting again, and again...) and I have begun weaving dishtowels. I don't know why, but I am completely taken with cotton dishtowels right now, and as Mimi is an eight-harness loom, I am able to do several complicated pinwheel patterns all from the same warp. The first one has brown and white bands in the warp and the weft that make up the pinwheel pattern. As is the nature of weaving, all the dishtowels from this warp will have brown and white pattern stripes vertically, but I'm planning to swap out the brown for seven other colors for the rest. The dishcloths will measure about 16\" wide by 18\" long when they're finished.The last of the fiber projects is a five ft by five-and-a-half ft fuzzy blanket I am making on a knitting board for Jessie. This project, like spinning, is a great in-front-of-the-tv activity. I started it last night while we were watching the Incredibles, and I worked on it for about another half hour this evening. Jessie picked the colors and is really looking forward to having it. I knitted her a similar one a year or so ago with traditional knitting needles... or maybe I crocheted it. I don't remember. Anyhoo, that one had a wide-open lacy pattern and this one--per Jessie's request--will be pretty solid.Last week I also started back on the silver locket from the intermediate silversmithing class I took, and I tube set my first stone (the topaz--Jessie's birthstone). This week I hope to finish it by riveting the little silver stamped plaque inside, and tube setting the last two stones--sapphires from Montana. One of them is one I mined, and it's going to go into the remaining large tube (sapphire is Dave's birthstone). The other one is a tiny stone that will go into the little tube on the front of the locket. The blackish rainbow color of the metal is from liver of sulphur. I dipped it last week during open studio, and I'm still trying to decide if I like it.Finally, I took a big step towards finishing the gaming table yesterday. It was a long, laborious, tiring activity, but I used the bandsaw to cut all the channels for the bridle joints at the top corners of the table, and dry-fitted them together. Next weekend is the glue-up for the top, and finishing the legs so I can do the mortises and tenons for the table apron. These pictures all show the curly pecan top rails of the table. Two of them show the bridle joints in the corners when they're together, and the other one shows the channels I cut for the joint. Right now they all protrude a quarter of an inch from each side and have sharp edges. The edges will be rounded down and maybe even shortened a bit when it's finished.The final discipline is ceramics, and I swear my wheel-throwing is just improving by leaps and bounds! This past class I threw a pot similar to the leftmost one in the photo. Then I made two fitted lids for it. Jennifer, our instructor, recommends always throwing two lids in case one doesn't work out. When the vessel is bisque-fired, it'll have the lid in it to help prevent warping and uneven shrinking between the parts. Also new in my repertoire is the drinking glass in the middle of the photo. It's not huge, but it's the tallest cylinder I've thrown to date. Looking forward to trying a teapot this week.Now off to join my dulcetly snoring spouse. Tomorrow, taxes. And feeding the bees. And working out. And weaving, and knitting, and spinning..."},
{"title": "The Same Day Over and Over Again", "date": "Tuesday, February 13, 2018", "text": "It's cold, it's grey, and it's been a long time since I've posted so I'm staying tucked under the down comforter for awhile blogging until the house warms up. We watched Groundhog Day last weekend and it just occurred to me that the day Phil Connors had to live over and over again for more than eight years was a day just like today ... I would have gone mad. Everything I do is based on time and continuity and almost nothing is completed in a day. Think about it. If everything starts over each day, projects would reset and couldn't be continued. Whatever I put into the kiln would be gone. If I got the loom warped, it would be empty the next day. Even if I did manage to finish something, it would be back in its original pieces the next day. Gah! What a horrible thought! Well, except for ceramics. I'd become a lot better throwing clay if I just practiced and wasn't focused on a finished piece. Of course I'd never learn anything about glazing at all since I'd never get tp see a piece come out of the kiln.There is nothing to do in the garden in February--and even if there were, how depressing would it be to weed the beds and find all the weeds back the next day! Any renovations to the house would also disappear by the next day. I'd have to change everything I love to do. On the plus side, the house would never get dirtier (or course it wouldn't get any cleaner either). I'd know exactly where Baxter was going to pee at any given time and be able to get him outside first so I'd never have to clean that up again.So if I had one day to live over and over again, how would I spend it? Could I work out and get completely into shape? Considering that Phil destroyed his body several times and it came back undamaged and unchanged the next day, probably not. He was able to learn the piano though, which requires building muscle memory. Hmmm. That piece of continuity is a little bit squiffy. And at the end of eight years for me it would only be a day for everyone else so I'd have to look physically the same. So what _would_ I do?Well, I could read a lot of books and watch a lot of movies. I could become fluent again in French. I could learn Japanese and Arabic and renew my relationship with Russian. Oooh, I could start saxophone and zoom ahead in piano! I could master making bread! That's it! Eight years of the same day over and over again is all about practice. It's about infinite resources and do overs. It's not about completing anything. Instead, it's about the journey.So what makes it different, really, from eight years of real life? Don't some people say life is about the journey, not the destination? Well for one thing, in life there are consequences to your choices in the journey--just like there are endings to the projects. I skipped over all the doing-stupid-stuff-for-fun-because-there-are-no-consequences things because while they might be entertaining for a little while, they'd get boring fast. In life there isn't infinite time: Any things you choose to do mean things you don't get to choose. Life is a lot of this OR that, not this AND that. In life there are chores, all the pesky little things like housework, taxes, doctor's appointments, and such that keep you from spending all your time learning and practicing.And real life has now intruded on my musings requiring me to get out from under the warm covers and go work out. Japanese, Arabic, and saxophone are going to have to wait."},
{"title": "Days, a Week, and Energy", "date": "Sunday, February 04, 2018", "text": "I love Sunday night. The previous week has ended and everything gets to start anew Monday morning. I don't really have a concept of weekend vs. weekday anymore. I realize that for Dave and Jessie there is a clear distinction between the two, but all days have the same potential for amazing fun and adventure for me. The time segment of a week still exists, and individual days mean different things: Monday and Wednesday are workout days, Wednesday also has a piano lesson, Thursday has ceramics class, now Saturday has an informal furniture-making/woodworking class, and Sunday night is time to bask in the plans for a new week, but weekday and weekend not so much.I used to hate Sunday nights. When we first moved to Austin in '98, I was working as a software engineer for Business Objects and I traveled every week to client sites. I flew out Monday morning, flew home Friday evening, and cried every Sunday afternoon in dread of the upcoming week. Now it's Jessie's turn. I watch her withdraw and get blue starting Sunday afternoon/evening. I wish there were something I could do for her to make it better, but this is one of those things she's going to have to figure out on her own.This week I have noticed something else about Sunday: it's the day when my energy is the lowest in the week. Last Monday I did my first B12 injection myself and it was an incredible day. Tuesday and Wednesday I felt like I had more energy than usual, and Thursday I was back to normal. Friday, however,  I started falling asleep whenever I sat for any length of time, and today I got up late, took a nap in the car, and another one later in the afternoon. I have no doubt that I'll go right to sleep tonight. I wish the B12 was more time release--or that I took injections more often!I mentioned above that I'm taking an informal furniture-making/woodworking class on Saturday. Yesterday was my first one, and I prepared for it by finishing my games table design Thursday night and then going down to purchase wood at Berdoll Sawmill on Friday afternoon. Last summer I went to Dupuis Lumber in Polson for the blue pine slabs and rough sawn lumber for a bed and desk. I loved it there and never thought I would find anything like it in Austin, and then I found Berdoll! They specialize in sustainable native Texas hardwood natural edge slabs. The picture of their staff at right was taken next to a set of walnut slabs from one tree.For the games table, I chose an 8\" wide 8/4 board of curly pecan, another 8/4 pecan board for the legs, and some 8/4 mesquite for the apron and accents for the legs. I'll use maple plywood for the top and the bottom. While I was there I lusted after the mesquite slab at the top left of this post. It's 93\" tall and 63\" wide, and I think it would make the most incredible corner desk! There was a desk in their office that was also made from a slab and I was impressed by the artistry of the edges. In one place there should have been a cut edge, but instead it looked like it had been wind and water sculpted. I asked about it and was told it had been carved to look like that. Maybe if they still have the mesquite slab I like when I finish the games table, the liquor cabinet/bar, and the bed..."},

It's been a week since I last wrote, and it was a full one. The time in Destin on the hand spinning retreat was magical: full of friends, fiber, and dirty martinis with three olives. Since I've been back the weather has been warm so today I puttered with the bees a bit, started cleaning the pond, and took the dogs to the dog park. Yesterday afternoon I played hooky with Dave, and I worked out Monday and today. Though I haven't been as thorough as I might have been entering all my food data into My Fitness Pal, I have eaten well all week. Piano has also been played, I began design on another woodworking project--a bar/liquor cabinet to go with the games table--and I have done a bit of spinning. Oh yes, I've also made and shipped three glass orders!Anya and IBut all of those accomplishments pale in comparison to the big news of the week (actually I think the big news of the week made everything else possible): I have begun giving myself my own B12 injections! I did one at the doctor with the technician on Monday (in my right thigh) and went straight from there to workout. It was a leg day, and I think the leg workout really pushed the B12 into my system faster as I was zinging with energy all the rest of the day.Elke and Ann LynnToday is hump day and we begin the downward slide to the weekend. Tomorrow is ceramics class (and I have another glass order to make for shipping Friday), and Friday is a crafting morning with Becky and dogs-to-the-groomer day (whew! they are smelly!!). Saturday I'm supposed to go to a woodworking bring-your-own-project workshop at a local woodworker's studio, and I'll go if I can get further on my table design and pick up the wood Friday. This weekend is also when I'm supposed to start perennial seeds for the garden and I haven't even decided what to grow yet!It is a good lifeLynne"},
{"title": "An Unintended Project", "date": "Tuesday, January 23, 2018", "text": "I made no resolutions this year. More specifically, I didn't resolve to get in shape, eat better, or lose weight. That way, experience has always shown me, lies madness. And yet...I just got home from an appointment with a nutritionist. I went to see her because I wanted help managing the food component of my diabetes. As part of the consult it came up that I would not be averse to losing weight. Not averse to, but pessimistic about the reality of. Carla, however, was a bubbling font of optimism, and I left the office with sample meal plans for breakfast, lunch and snack--I'm not messing with Dave's cooking other than to add more vegetables for me and have slightly smaller portions of his scrumptious entrees. Surprisingly, I can actually see myself losing weight by following this plan. Well, I guess that's not so surprising: you can succeed with all weight loss plans if you follow them! What I should have said is, I can see being able to easily follow this plan without too much effort, and If I do, I'll lose weight. Oh yes, I'll also better manage my diabetes.In the past when I have dieted (aka paying attention to what I'm eating and counting/measuring it) I have wanted to restrict my intake such that I would lose at least three lbs a week and preferably five. Why do it if you can't do it quick was my younger self's motto. Realistic much? I approached working out the same way: 3-5 times a week, an hour a time. I'm an all-or-nothing, balls-to-the-wall kind of girl. And I failed at eating to lose weight and working out. Repeatedly.But now maybe I'm older *and* wiser. The eating plan Carla put me on balances my carbs throughout the day and is targeted for a weight loss of 1 lb a week. While I'll barely notice that weight loss, looking at the foods I'm supposed to eat, I'll barely notice a change there either! The big rule for the diabetes is to eat carbs at every meal, and to always offset them with fat and/or protein. Her idea of a good breakfast for me is an egg, two slices of toast, a quarter of an avocado or an oz of cheese, a cup of milk, and a cup of raspberries. Wow! this morning on my way out the door I grabbed two mini croissants and two pieces of Laughing Cow cheese. According to her plan I'm about 238 calories short for the meal... Happy Day!So now I have My Fitness Pal on my phone, and I'll start tracking my food and carbs to make sure I eat well and regularly. Oh yeah, and I might lose some weight too! Oh, for that working out thing? I go to the gym 1-2 days a week (I shoot for two) and work with a trainer who kicks my butt. Maybe 2018 will see less of me than did previous years!"},

For myself, I hope it will be if not boring, at least really calm. I hope it includes sleep and avoids deadlines. One of the first things it will contain is a hand spinning retreat in Destin. I will get to see old friends from Atlanta and I'll do nothing but sleep, eat, and spin for four days. What a great reset that will be! And I'm not even going to exhaust myself getting there this year as I'm going to fly this time.While I'm there I'm going to finish up the spinning project I started last summer which got derailed with the onset of summer's medical issues and then the Fall and Winter of Great Endeavors. It's the mash-up of a bunch of different hand-dyed rovings from which I was going to knit a sweater. I started a sweater but don't like it so I'm going to tink it (that's knit it backwards) and make one of the knit swirl coats instead. I think I'll do a slightly larger version of this one. I like the drape, I like the flow. This will be a good match for the colorful yarn I'm spinning.This is a bridle joint on the top corners of the table edge.Sexy, huh?Yesterday Dave, Jessie, and I finished the new layout of the sitting room which henceforth is to be called the Game Room. Today I puttered with the plans for the game table and picked up a few small tools I'll need. Tool shopping is always a treat, and since I finished the data.world gig I had a little spare cash. I thought I was going to do a square version of the one from the Wood Whisperer Guild, but it's just not quite what we want. So instead it looks like I'll take the features I like from it--the top frame with the bridle joints in the corners, the lifting mechanism to remove the inset table top,  and the tapered legs--and I'll pull other details in from other designs. It means I'll have to go to Sketchup to do the design, but we'll get exactly what we want.There's a new urban lumber mill here in Austin that mills downed trees and I'm excited to be getting my wood from them. Their philosophy is pretty cool:\"Harvest Lumber Company produces quality lumber with wood waste from Central Texas. After years of seeing countless trees being mulched and plenty of buildings being demolished, we felt a call to save this material. As two professional woodworkers we were excited to develop a wood processing facility that could mill, dry and retail this precious material. As stewards of the environment and longtime Austinites, we felt drawn to make a positive impact in our community. Our transparent operation located in Central Austin demonstrates real recycling at work and offers a variety of products for sale to the public. Harvest Lumber Company provides resources and guidance to both professional and novice woodworkers.  We look forward to helping you begin your next woodworking project.\"But now, to bed.

Kali the Destroyer, mother of all things, that from which all things come, time, and death.Today Dave and I worked on a reset of the house, putting away Christmas and cleaning. I had such high hopes for what we'd accomplish, and we only got through about half of my list. That's not to say we didn't do really, really well, but I was overconfident on what I thought we'd get to. I think Dave did a lot more than I did and he was very happy with our progress.I took a break midway through the cleaning frenzy to suit up and check on the bees with Zaga. We looked at her hive first, and it was great. Then we looked at my top bar hive, and the combs were mostly empty of honey and larvae. I did find the queen, but they need fed. The Flow hive was next up and they had bountiful combs of capped honey and a lot of activity. Then we went to the hybrid. It was eerie. There were a couple of dead bees, and some bees who had died while chewing their way out of the cells (hatching). Other than that the hive was stripped clean. There were no bees, no honey, no larvae, just wax. The next hive was the Lang hive of the gentle golden bees, and it was the same as the hybrid: a few dead bees, and everything else looked like a bee ghost town. I was pretty upset by this point, but shouldered on to the last hive, another Lang. Like the top bar it was almost devoid of honey, but there were bees, and I think I even saw some larvae. I didn't take all the frames all the way out. I looked just enough to see that they were there and really needed food. So I mixed up a couple of entrance feeders with 2:1 sugar syrup, and I am starting to feed them.Now it's the end of an evening spent en famille with Dave, Jessie, and Dave's parents who are visiting through Monday. Everyone else has gone to their nests to settle down for a cozy night of sleep. I want to do the same, but first I thought I'd take look forward through the spring until we go to Montana. What is next? Nothing really for this week other than getting ready for five days at the January Spin-In in Destin with a couple of friends. I got a notification today that I was not selected for the Austin Fine Arts Festival this spring. My Master Spinner Level 2 class has been moved from February to October. I'm at a bit of a loose end! Maybe I'll just enjoy it and drift along a bit not planning or thinking about anything... Yeah, right. I hope I have more energy and enthusiasm tomorrow. I need my groove back!"},
{"title": "I Welcome the New Year at Last", "date": "Monday, January 15, 2018", "text": "It's 59 degrees outside and dry, and school is cancelled for tomorrow due to weather... In the school district's defense, I had a doctor's appointment in the morning which has also been cancelled as they expect to be closed for weather too. It's supposed to rain starting soon, turning into snow and ice as the temperatures plummet by morning. With the hill at the end of our street, if the roads are icy, we won't be going anywhere tomorrow. I wish I had done my kiln loads today when it was 65 degrees out and thus warm in the studio too. Tomorrow and the next few days are going to be miserable.As mentioned in yesterday's post, the fashion show is over. I am also coming to the end of the data.world doc project--Dave would like me to be finished writing and him to be finished reviewing my writing by tomorrow. Oddly enough, I think I can make that goal. Then what? My in-laws asked me the other day what my next big project is, and I didn't have a specific one in mind, just a feeling I wanted to get down into the wood shop. I also need to finish my coursework for the level one master spinner course by the end of February, and I'm headed to Destin for a five-day spinning retreat in a week. SO it looks like wood and wool are on my horizon.But more important than anything I'm winding up to do is stopping and relishing this moment of being DONE. I'll be honest, I have come to dread the holidays. There's too much going on at the end of the year and too much pressure to connect with friends, family, co-workers, and the world, and to celebrate your relationships and good feelings. Even this year when I managed to keep Christmas down to a dull roar with two presents for Dave, two presents from Dave, and fewer presents than previously for Jessie, it still was too much. I thought the cruise would take some of the pressure off because we wouldn't be back till Christmas Eve, but that wasn't the case. Between the art fair, starting the SQL docs, getting sick on the cruise, all three of us sharing a room on the cruise, Christmas, and the fashion show I have been stuck in a time of no personal time and no personal space. But now time is coming back to me.On the idea of wood projects, Dave and I were discussing what to do with the \"room\" at the far end of the downstairs. We call it a room, but really our downstairs living area is one big room with the great room at one end, a dining room squeezed in between it and a kitchen, and then what we're calling a sitting room at the far end. Right now there is a piano, a couple of comfy chairs in front of the fireplace and a couple of bookcases in that room. And we never use it. In the interest of using it for more than piano practice and lessons, I proposed moving one chair and the bookcases out, moving the games cabinet in, and putting a 2-4-person games table in the middle of the room. We have been enjoying playing games of an evening, and this way we wouldn't have to worry if the dining room table was sticky. Dave thought my proposal was marvelous, and guess who's building the games table? As I am a member of the Wood Whisperer Guild I checked to see if there were any plans for a games table there, and, huzzah! Now I have plans! Though I think I will modify them some as we just want a 3.5 ft square pedestal table. We do want a lot of bells and whistles though including a cloth-covered, recessed gaming surface, cup holders, individual play surfaces, and modular accessories like dice trays, surfaces for plates of food, etc.On a smaller scale I have decided to take all the remaining redwood from the old deck that's still piled in front of the garage and cut and plane it down into smaller pieces which I will use to build little redwood boxes and other small items. I like boxes and I want a project where I can practice skills like dovetailing, routing and inlay on a small scale. As soon as it dries up outside, I'll get right on it!"},
{"title": "A Rundown on the Runway", "date": "Sunday, January 14, 2018", "text": "We have had several days of ups and downs here at the Griffith abode, and I have been pondering how to relate the events in this forum. I still don't have an answer, but I need to move on it or forget about it. I still don't have photos, but I will soon.The last time I posted was last Tuesday in the wee hours of the morning. J and I had worked all day Monday, and it felt like we were finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And then I wrote about finishing and switching gears and how good it all felt, and fate stepped up to my challenge and said, \"Take this!\". Tuesday I went in to data.world, kicked ass on doc, and everything was great. Jessie had rehearsal again until 8:00 that night, and came home to say the white dress was too big and needed to be taken in. Ugh. As it was lined, it meant taking in both the dress and the lining.And thus began the descent into madness as from there on I lost track of time. Couture problems gleefully manifested daily as the rest of the week passed in a haze of late nights, too-full days, and unending sewing.To finish the story of the white dress: Jessie pinned the dress on the model to mark where it needed to be taken in. The pins started to come out and were replaced by someone else with safety pins but on the other side of the dress. No, I have no idea how something could be both replaced and on the other side. By the time J got home, the safety pins (which didn't close properly) had started to come out. J had a pretty good idea (vague recollection) how much the dress should be taken in. I was dubious as taking in a form-fitting dress without exact requirements just sounded hazardous to me. But we had to do it because there weren't enough rehearsals left before the judging to refit. So we took it in, and this time we also hemmed it up. The next day when the model tried it on it was too tight. So it had to be let out, but we had cut the extra fabric out after taking it in as it would have been too bunchy under the dress if left in. The next step was to rip the sides out up to just above the waist, add in triangular panels to the dress and the lining, and hem it up again. And then there was still the ruffle to finish and the issue of making it fit better into the line (no blue, you see).And then there was the blue ballgown. We turned it inside out and Jessie serged the entire hem together except for one small area to pull it back through right-side out again. Then we went to bed. J headed off to school the next morning, and when I got up I went to turn the dress right-side out so I could bring it to her rehearsal at the end of the school day.Good thing I didn't wait till I was ready to leave as the physics of inside out does not work that way. In my defense, this is not a rare dressmaker error, and I still don't know why exactly, but for some reason if a lined dress is sewn together at the neckline and then down the back around the zipper you can't turn it inside out to hem. I have pictures, though they mostly look like a big wad of blue and god satin so it's hard to see that what I ended up with after pulling the dress right-side out again was a moebius strip. As I had gotten Jessie into the mess by telling her how to do the hem that way, I figured I should fix it. So I spent over half the day redoing it. I cut off the serged hem with a rotary cutter, turned the dress back right-side out, and went to the mass mind for a way to hem it inside out. Turns out you need to start with the dress right-side out, pin the hem that way (wrong sides together), then cut a slit in the lining and pull only the bottom of the dress through it. At this point the bottom is inside out and the top... isn't. Then you repin the hem in exactly the same place but with the right sides together. THEN you can serge it all the way around, pull it back through the slit in the lining, sew up the slit in the lining, and Bob's your uncle.Fast forward to Friday, the day of dress rehearsal and judging. J was still sewing right up to a half hour after we were supposed to leave the house to get to the performing arts center (and then more in the car on the way). We got to dress rehearsal late, but Jessie and Isabelle's line was next to last so it all worked out. She finally finished at 9:30, and when I picked her up she was jubilant: The judges had told her everything was perfect, she couldn't have done better, and they asked her what she wanted to do in the fashion industry... The only cloud was that they didn't gush as much over Isabelle's part of the line--though they did say how well the two blended and you couldn't tell it was two designers.And then it was Saturday. The clothes had been left at the performing arts center Friday night after judging in preparation for the show. No last-night/last-minute sewing, everything was done. The show began and the clothes were edgy, and the models (all McCallum students who had auditioned to participate) were as bored and aloof as any professional runway model could ever hope to be. The show was two hours long and featured the work of twelve student designers (and one design team--Jessie and Isabelle) shown by 29 or so models. Jessie and Isabelle's line was next to last, and it looked good. Neither of J's dresses were as wow-factor from far away as they had been up close, but they were clearly well-made (and the judges had examined all of the lines up close for quality of workmanship). Jessie is a demon for top-stitching and precision seams.At the end of show the awards--1st to 3rd places--were announced. J did not place. I recognized the designer of one of the winning lines as she was towards the end too, but I'm still not sure who the others were.As a parent, my heart ached for my child who didn't understand why she hadn't even placed. Why, she wanted to know, had the faculty advisor in charge of the show told her that they were being judged on the both the quality of the work and the design, when workmanship didn't seem to matter at all? Some of the pieces weren't even hemmed, they were just cut off. Nothing was lined, seams were crooked all over the place, why didn't this matter? Why had the judges said everything was perfect and couldn't have been done better if they weren't even going to place her? Other designers had said how harsh the judges had been about crooked and poorly done seams, and she wasn't given a single criticism, why?As an adult and an artist who has spent the past 20 years in the creative world, I could see why the judges might not have picked her. Jessie is too grounded in the effort it she puts in to doing something--a combination of passion and keeping going until it finally matches the vision of her internal eye--to understand that it doesn't matter what it took to beat the materials into submission to achieve the goal. What matters isn't what the artist sees--it's what the audience sees. If the piece--be it clothes or a painting--makes the viewer think the maker was an artist and the work was inspired by a vision, that's what counts. The blood the artist may have poured into it doesn't. It often isn't the work that counts, it's the facade of its artisticness. The life and work of Vincent van Gogh provides a perfect example.Not that I want Jessie to end up like Van Gogh. What mattered last night, today, and going forward is how she feels about her art and her craftsmanship. The only person she needs to please is herself. She has a right to be annoyed that the criteria she was given for success in this show were misrepresented, and that the judges weren't more helpful in their critique of her work. But she shouldn't be discouraged because her work wasn't acknowledged as she thought it should have been. The only validation that matters, the only criticism that matters is her own. She needs to keep listening to and following her own inner voice. And I hope she participates again next year."},
{"title": "Project Runway", "date": "Tuesday, January 09, 2018", "text": "I feel like I am living Project Runway...After a marathon couture session that spanned from yesterday at 1:15 pm to 2:30 am, and then again from 9:00 am to 4:45 pm today, Jessie and I declared victory on her line for the fashion show this Saturday. I wish I had pictures. I kept meaning to get pictures, but it just hasn't happened. Tomorrow. The blue ball gown fit the model perfectly--it took two people to zip her into it, but once she was in nothing was moving around or falling down. Likewise the male models' clothes fit as if they were custom-tailored for him--which, of course, they had been. The model for the white dress was not at rehearsal tonight so J didn't get to fit her. Overall it the reception of the clothes by the models and the other designers, and the fit was so great that we are taking the night off.The night off for me is being spent switching gears. I have put down one intense all-consuming adventure for another: Tomorrow I begin the end of the data.world SQL docs. I am shooting for Friday for everything to be written, though I may take a couple more days to read through them again for a fine-tune and the last clean-up.Switching gears is going to be accomplished with sleep. Sweet dreams are made of these.I sip a cup of Evening in Missoula--a wonderful herbal tea from Montana Tea and Spice Company--and await my next turn pinning. Jessie sews, I pin, and the couture goes on. We're still not done and everything was due today, but we are almost there! The shirt is done save for the buttons. The pants are done save for the hem and the button on the fly. Jessie is sewing the vest and the lining together and as soon as she finishes we'll turn it right side out and do the last two seams. Then there'll be nothing but the button holes, buttons and topstitching. That leaves the white brocade dress which has a little gold shoulder ruffle to sew on, a hook in the back, the hem (after the fitting tomorrow) and some gold and blue glitz. And then there's the Great Big Ballgown. The skirt lining is pinned to the bodice lining, waiting for J to sew.Both cats are on the table with the sewing machine trying their best to help J. Kaiju thinks the best way to help her is by lying on whatever she's sewing. The little kitty thinks moving thread, pins, fingers, whatever, is the best cat toy ever and made for her claws. When helping Jessie sew pales, she'll turn her attention to Kaiju and they'll commence WWIII (with vocals!) on the table. Eventually they'll get tired and Kaiju will sleep (with much disgruntlement NOT on the fabric being sewed) on a nice woven alpaca rug I haven't finished on the sewing table and Pavlova will curl up in a little wicker basket on the other side of the machine. As we have now been sewing going on 11 hours, there have been many sleep and play cycles.----------------More time has passed. More seams have been sewn. Still not finished. Tomorrow. Please by all that's holy. Tomorrow."},
{"title": "Couture and Shoes", "date": "Saturday, January 06, 2018", "text": "Jessie got a package in the mail today. It was the pair of shoes she bought for one of her models to wear in the fashion show next weekend. They are gorgeous, and they were only $25! They're dark blue velvet and they look a lot like the ones at left, but they have a strap around the ankle. $25! And even more surprising to me is how did I miss this curved-heel trend? It seems to have come and gone and I never even saw it. After seeing J's shoes tonight, I looked for new curved wedge shoes online and there were none to be found. I looked on eBay, and there are tons--most of them for $15-$30 a pair. What's with people? I think this is the coolest style ever--I'd even wear them (even though they'd make me about 6'5\" tall). I looked around a bit more on eBay and found these two pairs lower left--one sandal and one boot, and I am in love. They're even both available in my size--but not for $25 a pair. Sadness.So we sewed today. Though that doesn't sound fancy enough for what we actually did. Let's see, how about we tailored today. That is more accurate anyway as we really did do a lot of fitting on the dress form. I didn't get any pictures of our in progress as there was no good finished point. Tomorrow. We cut out the pants and the shirt for the male model, Jessie sewed the lining together for the bustier top on the blue satin dress and increased its rigidity and structural integrity by adding a heavy-duty stiffener (sew-in interfacing) and boning. We'll probably put more boning in tomorrow too. Tomorrow, tomorrow. It will all come together tomorrow.  We'll finish the dress, the shirt, the pants and the vest. If I write/say it enough, I'll start to believe it. If I start to believe it, it just might happen.Now I believe that the inside of my eyelids are calling me and I must go. But, damn, I really like these shoes!! I think J should get the gold ones for her model in the white dress to wear. I kind of wish that I were 20 years old, 5'nothing, and weighed 90 lbs. Then I could see wearing shoes like these without killing myself. Like the spine heels (really, as in spinal column) of the ones above right. Seriously badass shoes."},
{"title": "Ahhhhhhh", "date": "Friday, January 05, 2018", "text": "I slept until 12:41. PM. Oh I got up at 9:00 or so and took a shower and had breakfast, but when I went back to bed to read, I fell back to sleep. The rest of the day was spent dozing, drifting, not touching my laptop, NOT planning, barely thinking. I did dream a bit of wood. I am getting restless to work on the bedroom furniture (bed and desk) I planned last summer. Trouble is, my current plan requires assembling the bed (permanently) in situ so I can't really do it till we've had the floors redone (carpet replaced with hardwood). I hate time binding.Tomorrow it's back on task with the great sewing project. The goal right now is to have everything done to fitting stage by Monday. Looks like I'll be getting up early to prepare the fabric (get out the patterns, plan the layout, start the pinning) so we I roust Jessie from bed we can dive right into it. She has turned out to be an amazing seamstress with great focus and attention to detail (her seams--even on satin--are amazingly even). She was surprised when she saw the other entries for the fashion show that hers were the only ones that are lined. I think she's getting a lot more help and direction than the other girls are--which makes me feel a bit bad. They are really trying to \"win\" too. I don't know what this \"winning\" is all about, but apparently there are judges and one of the collections \"wins\" the show. Whatever. Next Saturday night it will all be over.Next Friday the SQL doc will be pretty much done and we'll present at Show and Tell on the 19th after it's been live for a week or so. I'm pretty psyched.Now, though I slept the day away, I'm tired and it's time to go snuggle the spouse. Pictures throughout the weekend of the fashion progress."},

Our water situation is fixed and nothing else (knock wood) is broken. I cleared it with everyone from data.world to my child--heartily encouraged by my spouse. Whoo hoo! Tomorrow I am sleeping in. When I do wake up, it will be to eat and go back to bed. I plan to spend the entire day in bed or in the bath reading Dragon Blood, a new book from one of my favorite urban fantasy authors Eileen Wilks. I am also going to nap A LOT. When my family gets home from work and school, I will get up and hang with them in my jammies for dinner and a movie, but that's the most active I plan to be. Maybe I'll even kick the last of this cold.Then I'll be fresh for another weekend of sewing, followed by a week of SQL during the day and (maybe) sewing at night. Both of these projects will come to an end next weekend and then it will be on to something as yet undetermined."},

I got home from a morning in the office today to find we had no water. When I went to switch to reserve I found that it had never been switched back to normal from the last time we had it in reserve so we were truly all out of water. When I looked on the water meter it said we had run through 1275 gallons today. Whoopsie Daisies!So I started looking for running water. I couldn't find any, but a call to our water system maintenance people led me through troubleshooting enough to find out that we were leaking a steady .3 gallons a minute--all that our RO system produces--and the leakage was somewhere after the water left the well house (thank heaven as there are so many pipes snaking every which way around tanks and through complicated equipment inside the well house that it would be a nightmare to find a break in there).After walking all around the house twice and checking every hose bib to see if they'd been naughty or nice, I ended up back at the well house. Sure enough, right where the main water pipe exits the building--where the contractor was working this summer--the crappy old insulation had been removed from the pipe and never replaced. An old pvc valve in the pipeline had cracked open (rotted plastic and water pressure no doubt) and when I had the water on, it was gush-trickling from the break. I booked a plumber for tomorrow morning, I bought 10 gallon jugs of water from the grocery store for our renter and us, and now we hunker down and pretend we live in a house with no running water because, well, we do.This little water snafu was just the cherry on top of the sundae that my last quarter has been. A quarter! When I said at dinner tonight that I hadn't had a break for several weeks--not since I started this SQL doc project--Dave pointed out that right before the doc project I had A Fair of the Art. So really I haven't taken a day off just to veg, sleep, and read (even on the cruise) for *13 weeks*!! That's over a quarter of the year! I seriously need a day completely off, and I am looking forward to having one after next Saturday, January 13--Jessie's fashion show date.For now I console myself with going to bed and snuggling my comic-book-wielding spouse. It's going to be another freezing one tonight so there is no place better to be than under the down comforter. But that'll be after I use some of the purchased water to handwash my child's pants so she has something to wear to school tomorrow."},

I built a fire for the fourth straight day in a row today even though Dave went in to work and only Jessie and I were home. I just couldn't get the house warm enough without--and I was wearing fuzzy thick pants, a sweater, and fleece-lined slippers.

We are going to rise as a nation and overcome hatred, bigotry, and fear--or die trying. And I don't plan on dying any time soon.On a smaller, more personal level, I plan to be happy this year. That sounds kind of like a resolution, and this would normally be my resolutions post, so let's do that!So what about the coming year, what resolutions will I make for it? Ooh, I have an answer for that question! None!! I make no resolutions this year. I plan to take up no new activities. For all y'all rolling around and guffawing on the floor, tears of laughter streaming from your eyes, get over it. I will continue in some of the disciplines I either picked up or expanded this year, and I will let go most of the activities I aimed to do this year--whether I succeeded or failed at them. First on the list of goodbyes is the 365 Project. It was fun. I finished--I took a picture* every day of the year for 2017, and I'm done. I've also decided that I'm neither mindful nor interested in being mindful. I am not going to try to spin for 15 minutes or anything else every day--except blogging. This is one activity I will continue.I'm also not going to try to bake bread or make pasta regularly this year. (I think that particular resolution bit the dust some time in early February.) I'll continue to work out until I don't. I'll continue to strive to eat better, but I will not diet.I will live, I will love, I will never give up, and I will never surrender. That is 2018 for me. Happy eight (lucky) year to all of you, and I hope your resolutions are as positive.*Or to be more honest, took a picture almost every day and had a couple of pictures taken for me by my photographer daughter when I was flailing."},

But I've got my love--and a hefty eggnog with Johnny Walker Red in it (thank you Todd)--to keep me warm. This great house with its masses of windows is impossible to keep warm when the temperatures drop below 30. Today, New Year's Eve, is our traditional day for watching movies. We have spent every New Year's Eve that we've been home for the past 22 years watching up to six movies. but not today. Dave and I did watch Hellboy tonight (brought on by our recent viewing of Guillermo de Toro's The Shape of Water), and we resolved to take a day soon where we can all veg out and watch our movies together.Today I wrote SQL doc and worked with Jessie on her dresses. She's still on the gold ruffle on the white dress. Until she gets the ruffle done and the dress off the mannequin (it's pinned on with the ruffle), we're not going to be able to start the bodice of the blue gown. We have a pattern for the blue gown and the pattern should fit her model, but J wants to modify the bodice to make it strapless with stiff sleeves draped over the arms, and I'm thinking a back zipper would be better than a side zipper. But enough of sewing--I need to think of something else for awhile. No, not SQL either (although it felt good to knock out the rest of the aggregations pages for the reference section).Everyone has their little superstitions, and I have always had one about dates with seven or eight in them. For me, seven is momentous, and eight is lucky. Momentous is like the Chinese curse, \"May you live in interesting times\". It's a rollercoaster of jumbled up big things. 2017 lived up to being a true seven year as we just closed our eyes and hung for dear life.In 2017 I embarked on a great new friendship, had serious health issues, saw my beloved uncle married at last to my beautiful aunt, and entered into a new stage in my relationship with my daughter. There was upheaval and turmoil with the contractors. A botanical garden came into existence in our yard which is now inhabited by bees and fish. The glass studio in Atlanta sold and we moved everything in here. We put in a wood shop and started renting out the apartment. We didn't get the bathroom remodeled or the bedroom floors redone, but those will happen in time--we're not in a rush.It feels like all the big changes we're going to do now are done. The year ends with a gentle exhalation, and the pop of one last low-burning ember. Outside I can hear the wind scream and howl (really), but we and our four-legged family are all snug inside.

I live in a sweatshop in the garment district of Austin--at least it feels like I do. But Jessie is working just as hard as I am, and I am so proud of her! She is staying positive and cheerful even though cold rooms (the fabric studio), and sewing--much less sewing all day--are not at all her things. She has also contracted my cold (as has Dave) so she's pretty pitiful.Today on the Great Dress Front we had to completely redo the gold shoulder ruffle because we determined we needed a shoulder strap to sew it to, that it just wasn't going to support itself and stay together. J has been working on it since 10:30 this morning with a short break for lunch and a longer break for dinner and Jumanji at the Alamo Drafthouse (hey, all sewing and no movies make Jessie and Brenda dull girls). J also finalized the deep blue satin gown. I posted pics the other day of J's original design and the red gown gown she also liked for the sleeves. She really wanted big swooping curves along the bottom of the dress--as opposed to a bunch of little ripples. My best option for getting that kind of stiff curves was to put a stiff plastic cord or vinyl tubing all along the hem. She didn't like that idea. We found a a vintage Vogue pattern from 1957 at JoAnn Fabrics last night and she decided she wanted the skirt to go out like it did. I told her that effect was achieved with a crinoline. She said a crinoline sounded cool, but then I reminded her that if she made the skirt shorter in the front (she really wanted to see the gold lining) she would see the crinoline instead of the lining.We went round and round on the design and she finally ended up with the sleeves and top of the gold gown above, and the skirt from the Vogue pattern at left--but extended all the way to the floor. The skirt is heavy deep blue satin with a soft gold satin lining. I had to go back to JoAnn's this afternoon and get several more yards of fabric as we barely had enough for the godets (the wide panels in the skirt between the front panel and the side panels and between the back panel and the side panels. They make the skirt a complete circle. Tonight I found a ballgown crinoline on Amazon (of course they have them!) with prime shipping and when it comes we're going to add gold netting to it (it's white). So at the end of it all, the skirt will almost be as big as the red one at right. I haven't sewn anything this big and extravagant since my wedding dress (and I'm thinking it paled in comparison--even with the lace bodice and the boning)."},

There was only a tiny bit left in the first bottle, the second bottle was empty, finally the third bottle had rum.

We're closer! And farther away! Why is the rum gone? Tomorrow we're hitting the ground running like marines on the beach. We put together our plan of attack tonight, synchronized our watches, and at oh nine hundred tomorrow, the sewing begins. Before the sewing, however, is a run to Home Depot by Dave for a space heater to fill in for the split wall unit in the fiber studio that went on the fritz today. It was originally a screened in sunporch off the house and is not tied into the home HVAC system. It also has patio doors (six sets of them) on both long sides of the room which do not keep the heat in and the cold out well at all. On these 44 degree days, we'd freeze without a space heater.Tomorrow, pictures of dresses. Please, God, plural dresses!"},

Unfortunately I did not get the SQL documentation done for data.world before a prior commitment--helping Jessie with her fashion show pieces--came due. Now I'm working on both (alternately) pretty much from when I get up in the morning till when I go to bed except for mealtimes and posting. Oh and showering. I am trying to stay hygienic through this difficult time. I am left with very little thought or energy for anything else.

Today I have mostly lost my voice, and I felt like death warmed over. I had a piano lesson at 9:00 (the first one in a month) and I tried to play my warm-up. I say tried, because I could play each hand separately, but when I tried playing hands together, I sounded like I was learning chopsticks. My brain was all all fuzzy. After piano I worked for a bit with Dave on the SQL documentation, and I felt like the entire time I just sat there and looked at him with a bemused look on my face.Then it was time to sew. And it went surprisingly well! A couple of hours into the process we decided we really needed to line the dress. So while J practiced piano and had her lesson, I ran to the fabric store and picked up lining and boning. As I was paying, the sales clerk said, \"Oh you're not 55 so this won't help you\", and when I informed her I was 56 she gave a 20% off everything coupon for Joann Fabrics on January 3. Hey ho, my first official senior's discount! When I got home and we got back to sewing, J cut out the lining and the dress, added the dart lines, sewed the lining pieces together and almost sewed the dress pieces together--all before dinner. Tomorrow we make the final decision on to bone or not to bone (the model wearing the dress has a 32\" bust, a 25\" waist, and 30\" hips--I don't know how much structural support she's actually going to need), and we sew the lining to the dress. Then come the zipper and the gold flounces/ruffles. I don't know quite what to call them as ruffles is too frilly a word, and flounce is too floppy. These puppies are going to be wired up and have some serious structure. I don't want to take this dress too far as my dressmaker's form has 35\" hips so the dress is already too big for the model and we'll probably have to take it in. If we wait until the lining is all sewn in it'll be a helluva job to size it down. I hope J will be able to try it on the model first thing next week so we'll have time to resize it.In a perfect world we'll start the second dress tomorrow. J made some modifications to her original design now that she has learned a bit more about the form and structure of clothes--and what makes them stay on the body without scotch tape. Now she wants something more like the top of the dress on the right. In blue satin. She's surely learning to sew on the hard stuff! And the model for this one has a 36\" bust and a 27\" waist. She's going to need some support..."},
{"title": "I Put on a New Hat", "date": "Tuesday, December 26, 2017", "text": "Today my cold is much improved--and none too soon as today began a new creative endeavor for me. Well it's not my creative endeavor exactly, it's my daughter Jessie's. She decided for some strange reason to participate in the art department's fashion show this year. I am still puzzled as to what inspired this fantastical adventure, but we're on it now! I get that she likes to draw models with fancy haute couture clothes. But she doesn't sew. She made a pair of pajama bottoms in middle school and hated it. Now she's not only signed up to do the designing, but also the pattern making, sewing, embellishing and fitting of two evening gowns. In a week. With no one to help but me and You Tube. Thank heaven for You Tube! How did we learn before it? Sure you have to sift through the chaff, but there's plenty of wheat to be found.I grew up sewing. My Mom made all of her and my clothes and a good portion of my father's. But my Mom never had a dressmaker's form so I never learned how to use one. I learned how to sew with pre-made patterns. You picked the pattern, you picked the material. You laid it out, cut it, and sewed it together following the instructions. Almost nothing i ever made fit the way it should have or turned out looking as I had envisioned it. Probably because I never made the connection between what my hands were doing and why they were doing it. I just followed the instructions, I didn't try to understand why they were written as they were. I learned to cook the some way. I followed directions without questioning the reason for each step. I never tasted as I was cooking, and I didn't try on as I was sewing. It's no wonder I wasn't very good at either.As I've gotten older I am more inclined to color outside the lines. When I decided to make my wedding dress I went looking for a pattern, but I couldn't find anything I liked. However I found the top I liked on one pattern and the skirt on another. My mom said she would help me combine them, and then she also did all the hand sewing on the heavy lace for the bodice and sleeves. A few years later, the first time we moved to Austin, I bought a dressmaker's form and made a long, formal gown of bronze and black raw silk. It was stunning, and the learning process bumped my clothier skills up a notch. Now I am very conscious of what I am doing each step of the way through a process and why. And it's a good thing too as nothing I've done is anything compared to this first lovely swan dive of my daughter's.She is creating off of nothing but a sketch that was a vision in her head, and she's going to turn out a fitted garment for a model to wear on the runway... Breathtakingly audacious. SO how did we begin? We got a dressmaker's form and started draping a dress. At the end of the day we have pretty much refined our first stab at  draping a pattern (we draped, we turned it into a paper pattern, we cut out the dress from sample fabric and sewed it up, and now we're repinning it and refining the lines. Tomorrow the goal is to complete the white brocade sheath and start on the gold ruffly shoulder and and trim around the bottom. Oh yes, and maybe to start beading the band for the neckline..."},

J remarked (several times) that Dunkirk seemed like an awfully odd film to show on a ship. After all, all those ships sinking.

I also need to be seated fourth or farther down the table so I don't have to decide first. With those caveats, blackjack is a fine game. I played a bit tonight and after I had 2.27 times my original stake in front of me, I cashed in and walked away. It was a far cry from my walk of shame back to the room last night. Tomorrow is the spouse's big gambling day as he has the Hold 'Em finals tournament at 9:00 pm. Prize? Free cabin on a cruise next December for the cruiseline-wide finals and a chance to win $100,000.

{"title": "Craps is Not For Me", "date": "Thursday, December 21, 2017", "text": "At the end of a two-trip-long experiment, I have determined that gambling is not for me. I used to like blackjack--and I still do to some extent--but as entertaining as it is, it's not worth the cost of playing in a commercial venue. And as much as I love Zaga (and love watching her win consistently), playing craps is the same. It's fun, but I'd rather spend the money on some other form of entertainment because as sure as goddess made little green apples, the money will disappear when I play.Outside of busting out at craps, I spent the day working on data.world doc and trying to get over the cold I picked up on Day 1. I heard tonight that there are 91 people with the flu on the ship. That's over 2% of the ship's guest population, a number that seems pretty significant to me. Of course I don't know if that's diagnosed instances--in which case the actual number could be quite a bit higher--or even just speculation. The ship IS a floating petri dish after all, and they are not being nearly as aggressive with making everyone use the antibacterial gel at the entrance to the buffet as they should be. We don't have it as bad as the two Royal Caribbean ships in the past few weeks which had outbreaks of norovirus, but, hey, there are two more days left on the ship. Anything can happen!Tomorrow, Cozumel for some and more doc writing for me--along with several hours with the J doing whatever she wants to do (arcade games, Johnny Rockets for burgers and shakes, the water slides and pool, just hanging, whatever!). Tonight, my eyelids. G'night all, sweet dreams (and no bedbugs)."},
{"title": "I Made Chocolate!", "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2017", "text": "The port at RoatánToday was our day in Roatán, Honduras, and it was also the only departure we're going to make fro the ship for the duration. After rising and breaking our fast at the buffet this morning, our group split into two and Jessie and Zaga went to see the sloths and then do some snorkeling on the reef, and Dan, Dave and I went to the botanical garden for a hands-on chocolate making demonstration.To get to the gardens we had to cram our large American bodies onto a small Japanese bus. I was unfortunate enough to get the seat over the wheels so my legroom was non-existent. I put my feet on top of the wheel housing with my chin to my knees and off we went. After our arrival at the Carambola Botanical Gardens, we took a walk up to the covered outdoor teaching area (good thing too as it rained in the middle of the demo) passing by cashew, mango, coconut, and cocoa trees. The cocoa tree is very interesting as it only grows 7-10 feet tall, and the fruit is born on the trunk--not the end of the branches. Flowers come out of the trunk, and after they're pollinated they turn into pods or fruit about the size of an oval baseball or softball and they just hang there on the side of the tree. When they are ripe they turn yellow and they will ripen on the tree or off.Once they're ripe, the natives cut through the thin skins (much like you do with a pomegranate) and crack them open. The seeds, or beans, are covered with a white, slimy goop that the natives like to eat. When ripe it's supposed to taste like a sweetish citrus. The one we tried today wasn't quite ripe so the white was firm and pretty bland. After the beans are removed from the ripe fruit, they are fermented on banana leaves for about a week. After the fermentation is finished, the beans are roasted. We started our process today with roasted beans.Cocoa fruit growing off the trunk of the treeOur native demonstrator was a grandmother who has made chocolate all her life. She requested two volunteers and I made sure I was one. She reheated the roasted beans in a dry skillet until they began popping like corn, and then we took them and removed the papery skin coating on them. Apparently the skins are boiled ot make a great relaxing tea. After all of our beans were peeled, we took a hand-crnaked grnder which was clamped to the table, and we put the beans through it. This point in the process was another continuity break for us as the beans (now called cocoa nibs since they're out of their skins) are run through the grinder up to 19 times to turn them into paste. To save time, we did the first grind on one batch and the last grind on another that had been prepared for us.Then we added melted cocoa butter and powdered sugar to the bowl of chocolate paste and set it in a bowl of water on the stove. The goal is to take it to 122 degrees F, but their cooking thermometer was broken so our demonstrator just told us when it was done by looking at it. After heating, the bowl of paste is put into an ice water bath and the chocolate is stirred until it's cooled and stiffer (but still moving). Then it's heated one more time before being poured into molds. This process of heating, cooling, and reheating is called tempering, and it prevents the cocoa fat from separating out, prevents the greyish bloom, and gives the finished chocolate its dark, even, glossy color.We didn't add anything to our chocolate, but if we had wanted milk chocolate we would have added powered or condensed milk after the first heating, and nuts after the second heating right before pouring. We finished by pouring the chocolate into candy molds to cool. The cooling process takes 40 minutes so, after a lovely lunch of chicken with rice and beans cooked in coconut milk, and plantain chips, we were given some of the chocolate from a previous class that was already chilled. Then we piled back onto the bus and headed the short distance back to the pier. The rest of the day was spent napping and relaxing. It was incredible.I know it didn't happen unless there are pictures so tomorrow I hope to have pics of me making chocolate!"},
{"title": "Things to Take on a Cruise", "date": "Tuesday, December 19, 2017", "text": "In my normal blithe fashion, I approached this trip with an if-I-forget-to-pack-it-I-can-always-buy-it attitude. Hah. So this post serves both as a cautionary tale and as a list for me for next time.This ship may cruise from the US, but it's a European ship and almost all of the electrical outlets (except for the two in your stateroom) are European. If you plan to spend extensive time on a laptop, say, writing SQL doc, you should bring an adapter. We have several, I just didn't think of it. We only found two US-style outlets onboard, and they were't in places you'd choose to sit for an extended period of time.Sunglasses and sunscreen seem like an obvious item for the list, but I managed to forget them. While I could buy them onboard, my thrifty heart refuses to pay the vig. So I stay out of the sun and squint a lot.Last, and most important for the aging population, I brought my daily meds (of course), but I did not bring a full pharmacopeia. Alka Seltzer--never leave home without it. At 3:00 am I woke with the worst heartburn EVER and when I rummaged through my toiletries bag I discovered there was no Alka Seltzer. So I dressed and toddled down to the promenade shops. They were, of course, all closed. So I went to the front desk and rousted the clerk from the back. No they didn't have antacids, but I might could get them from the vending machine in the medical area on deck one. But the vending machine only takes quarters. The desk clerk helpfully offered to change money to give me quarters, but I didn't have any cash,  just my seapass. Apparently the only transaction that can't be done on your seapass is getting quarters for the vending machine for medications.I didn't want to go through getting quarters if they didn't even have antacids so before going to my room for cash, I headed to the the morgue, er, medical wing on deck 1. The bottom of the ship. There is a morgue, it's located next to the medical office. There I was, on deck 1 at 3:00 am next to the ship's morgue. If the zombie apocalypse was going to start on the ship I was surely poised to be its first victim. There were no zombies, but there were antacids and an Alka-Seltzer-like fizzy tablet, so I trooped back up to my room on deck 7 and got a couple of dollars to change for quarters, then back to deck 5 for change, then back to deck 1 for meds, then back to deck 7 to drop exhaustedly into bed while swearing never to forget the Alka Seltzer again!Another entry in the pharmacopeia never to leave home without is colds meds--Dayquil, Nyquil, Chloraseptic, and cough drops. Dayquil and Nyquil can be found in the general store for ruinous prices, but Chloraseptic and cough drops arenot to be found. Zaga and Dan, of course, were fully prepared so I got Dayquil and Nyquil from them. Zaga also carries Oragel for tooth ache. I would add Alleve, heavy-duty pain meds, and Imodium just to cover all the bases.Last, but not least, though it is ubiquitous throughout the ship, I would carry my own little refillable bottle of hand sanitizer hanging from my lanyard wth my seapass. On a floating petri dish there's no such thing as too much hand sanitizer."},

There was one group of men who all had wonderful Christmas suits. I asked the two gentlemen at right if I could take their picture and they were happy to oblige. What fantastic suits!Today was all about food, and drink, and gambling. Dave entered the first hold 'em tournament of the cruise and won! He now advances to the finals on Saturday. Dan, Zaga and I entered the first black-jack tournament and Dan won his round, but lost the finals today. That tournament only went seven hands per round so it wasn't just about winning, but winning big, fast. Then Z and I sat down at a regular blackjack table and we both were up very nicely from our stakes when we left the table. That was all before 5:00 pm...After dinner Dan, Z, and I headed back to the casino for a few hands of blackjack (we had a table all to ourselves) and then Z and I went off to (finally!) play craps. It was the first time today the table was open. I threw a really long streak, and Z and I both walked away from the craps table up even more! Jessie ice-skated during the teen skate tonight and Dave and I watched, then we went for family ice cream (I watched them have ice cream and had one spoonful of J's). Now we're back in the room and it's time for lights out.

As D, J and I are all sharing a (very small) room, there was no way to stay up and post last night without keeping everyone else awake so I deferred till this morning knowing I can back-date. It's not really cheating as the post is about yesterday...The key to a successful cruise departure is to get to the port an hour before sailing because by that time all the lines are gone and you can pretty much walk right on, to reserve your special dinners and buy all your beverage and wi-fi packages in advance so you don't need to struggle through the crowds to do that when you arrive, and to take a carry-on with a recreational devices. Then you get an adult beverage from the bar, take it to your stateroom and sit out on your balcony enjoying it while the ship gets underway. We succeeded at some, failed at most. I'll know better next time.The best part of the day for me was the mystery theatre dinner. The main action took place in a lounge before the dinner and Dave was selected for audience participation by having the mob guy's floozy sit in his lap, play with his hair, and call him Bob. Repeatedly. Then we went to the Italian restaurant on the ship and had a wonderful meal family style while trying to figure out who done it (and watching \"Sally\" fondle \"Bob\" some more).When we got back to the room we had an interesting shock: Instead of having a pull-out bed for Jessie, there is a bunk bed that comes out of the ceiling over the top of our bed. What 16 year-old do you know who would like to sleep right about her snoring parents? The J opted to take the pillows and the bedding from the bunk bed and to sleep on the couch. Poor thing, When I got up this morning she was asleep on the couch with pillow under one ear and over the other. At breakfast she confirmed I snored VERY LOUDLY. I'm going to try to find her earplugs today."},

But in between the two was a good solid night's sleep with no four am wake-up calls to let out dogs. They either didn't need to go out, or they peed in the front hall. Frankly I don't care which. Sleep was more important last night.Today began with putting together all the gift baskets for my secret pals and loading them into the car. Then I had a short ceramics class--I had three pieces that had been bisque-fired that I needed to glaze and that was all I did for class today. Because I finished in ceramics early I was able to get in to Discount Tire and get two new tires before I had to pick up Jessie from school. She had early dismissal today because of finals and she was released at one. I dropped off my secret pal gifts in the office, met J at the car, and took her for a quick Micky D's lunch before running her home and then hying myself to data.world for another afternoon of doc writing. Names were taken, butts were kicked.It's ten pm, and I'm still coherent. I consider today a win. Tomorrow I will be at d.w all day. No interruptions. No breaks. No time off for good behavior. I don't know how far I'll get on the docs, but I know it won't be as far as I want. I can't complain though--this has been a pretty great fall for accomplishing things on time and under budget (where budget is applicable). There are a few things on my to-do list that I really should get to before heading off on the high seas, but there is nothing urgent that can't wait till the week after Christmas. Or later--that week is scheduled to be The Week Of High Fashion and Sewing... the arrival of 2018 is actually going to be a relief.As I previously mentioned, I mailed all my Christmas gifts the other day, and now I am on tenterhooks waiting for my sister-in-law's gift to get to her. I thought it was a brilliant gift idea and I spent a lot of time, effort, and care on it. But now that it's off in the mail, I can't help but think she's going to open it and say, \"What was she thinking?\". I can't go into detail now because I don't want to give the surprise away in case she reads this post, but suffice it to say that the the first indication there might be a problem was when Dave and I got into his car at the end of the day on Tuesday (the packages has been in the car all day) and drove the packages to the post office and UPS for shipping. We both kept asking each other, \"What's that smell?\", and we finally figured out it was Jan's present. When we got to the post office I took the set of packages for there in and dropped them off, then I carried Jan's box next door to UPS and dropped it off. When I got back to the car Dave was appalled that I had actually mailed it. I don't know what he thought I was going to do, open it? It was meticulously packed and needed to be shipped then in order not to spend a weekend in transit (the contents are perishable, don't ya know). And I'm sure most of them are fine. But it was a bit smelly. I called her today to let her know it was on the way and to advise her to open it right away. And maybe outside.Okay, bedtime for all good little boys and girls and me."},

I to data.world for the entire day today hoping that proximity to genius would make my brain spin faster. My brain, however, chugged along at its normal pace and I found myself inordinately distracted by the conversations and goings on around me. *sigh* Tomorrow I take headphones. I did have a lot of fun, however, asking Dave questions on Slack, and if he didn't answer me in what I considered was a timely enough fashion (immediately), I would lean a bit to the left and pointedly stare at him waggling my eyebrows until he took the hint. More seriously, it was also good to be there to participate in project meetings and to do more meta-data brainstorming. My biggest take-away from the meetings and the day was that shipping on time is the most important thing I can do, and \"on-time\" means before the end of the year. Sadly I keep coming up with bits and bobs of expansions that would greatly improve the end result, (exercises, for example), but there is no coming up with more time. My time is already restricted as I have to spend the week between Christmas and New Year's helping Jessie (teaching her how) to create her fashion show pieces.We'll see what I can do with the rest of this week. I cleared everything but my last ceramics class Thursday morning (and getting new tires on the minivan) off of my schedule for the week, and I shipped the glass orders and all the Christmas presents I had to mail today. I'll wrap our Christmas presents and stocking stuffers when we get back on Christmas Eve, and I'll clean the apartment in the morning on Boxing Day before our guest arrives. Somehow it will all work out, and I WILL get a vacation and all the rest and relaxation that comes with one, and I WILL meet all my deadlines. Dave is most insistent that I get a vacation as when Momma isn't happy, nobody's happy.Happiness tonight is going to bed so my spouse can stroke my back while I fall asleep. He's a keeper!"},

You find yourself making basic errors well-below your level of knowledge and experience, and you can't seem to grasp even low-level concepts. I had that day today. It was supposed to be a solid writing day--and I put in the time--but I ended it with one page written. I think. Maybe I wrote another. I don't know. I don't know if I wrote it completely last Friday (or whenever Dave was helping me write complex SQL queries to join the tables in my dataset), or if I only started it then and mostly wrote it today. *sigh* I feel my brains leaking out my ears as I sit here. Tomorrow I'm going in to the office all day and I hope I absorb smartness and savvy from the air and people around me. And tamales. Apparently the office orders lunch in on Tuesday and it's tamale day.On fronts other than writing, however, it was a solid (if somewhat lethargic) day. I worked out. I packed two glass shipments that I will mail tomorrow. I packed three Christmas packages also to go out tomorrow. I didn't make it through the bills, but I will hang the stockings by the chimney with care now, and then I'll head off to clean up dog pee on my way to bed. Thank you Baxter."},

Everything that needs to be purchased, wrapped, packed, mailed, or delivered must be done before Friday. My tech writing gig must be almost finished. My glass orders must ship. And my normal, full life must occur simultaneously including working out, taking the dogs to the dog park, going to ceramics class, taking a piano lesson, and dealing with home repairs (a water leak from the second floor bathroom). There are bills to be paid, new tires to acquire, prescriptions for refill, and a car to go in for service before taking it on a long drive. And there are five days. Five. I am not counting Saturday right now as it's going to be a catch-whatever's-left day. Breathe. Don't chase the squirrels. Don't go down the rabbit holes. Don't get stuck on the hamster wheel (also known as squirrel-caging). I think Dave's worried about me. But he shouldn't be, for I have list!Tonight we saw The Shape of Water, and it was every bit as wonderful as I had hoped it would be. Too often a movie with a seemingly  beautiful, complex story in previews is rendered banal, trite or shallow as a full feature film due to poor writing, poor acting, poor direction, or a combination of the above. As with Three Billboards--my other recent favorite--everything about this movie is perfect. Del Toro is hands down my favorite director working today. One of the things I love most about his films is his intentional attention to color.The following is from an interview he did did with the folks at Loot Crate:\"For our readers who are studying film, or are interested in filmmaking: What are the universal aspects of your craft that you feel apply to everything you do, whether it’s a period love story like this or a big, futuristic action film like Pacific Rim?Well, the same very, very careful and minute color-coding, texture and shape coding, the same impulse… to use audio-visual language to tell the story, other than just the screenplay. [The type of] dramturgy that you can share with theater and TV, you can use to tell the very language of film, and tell the story. When we color-code we do so for content, you know? Not for looks. We assign each color in the palette a specific reason to be there.  For example, in The Shape of Water, blues and cyans are [Elisa’s] apartment, because she’s a creature of the water. Every other living space – Zelda, Giles, Strickland – all of them are color coded for daylight, in ambers, oranges, yellows. They immediately exude daylight. We use green for the future, very pointedly, even in the dialogue. And then we use red for love and cinema: Only for the theater seats, the theater door, and her clothing once they fall in love. And I could walk you through a very different use of the same colors for example in Crimson Peak: red signifies the past, the warm colors are for America, the cool colors are for the old world.Are there films, or even artists, that have used a similar strong approach to color or light that you feel influenced you in a big way?The moment I felt it gelled was very early on when I was a kid, I read an interview with Fellini. He said, very pointedly, “When I went from black and white to color, I wanted to make color tell the story. I wanted it to count for something.” And I thought, that’s true, and the same applies to light, color, texture, everything.  Every time you’re using an audio-visual grammar, there are directors that use it almost in a casual way, and there are those that use it in a painterly way. And when I say “painterly,” I don’t mean “pleasant.” But actually, as part of the energy of the painting. If you have a sunset by Van Gogh, and a sunset by Turner, and a sunset by a classical painter, they will be completely different, and they could be depicting the same moment. The thickness of the paint, the boldness of the stroke… the color palette they use. They are read in a way that we don’t read film, but I try to write it in that way. I try to write it in a painterly way.\"Such a beautiful movie and one that I know I'll see more details in the next time I watch it. Makes me think I want to pick Crimson Peak as one of my choices for our New Year's Eve movie fest this year..."},

I took three years worth of the raw intake and outcome data from Austin Animal Center--a no kill shelter here in Austin--and put it up as a dataset in my workspace on data.world. From there I wrote some queries (with help from my spouse as a SQL refresher) that I'll use to make new tables, and the documentation I'm writing for data.world will go against this dataset. What does it say about you when you rush through your day (laundry, delivering a loom, Christmas presents and decorating, and making glass for orders) so that you can finally get on the computer and play with SQL? I'm honestly finding it as addictive as I did Diablo when I first started playing it. (Whatever happened to...?)This is the last weekend at home before we go on vacation so I'm trying to get the house ready for the house sitter, the apartment ready for the renter, and Christmas presents ready for us so I don't have to wrap everything on Christmas Eve when we get back. This week is my big push for the tech-writing gig and I really want to do the minimum possible on non-writing activities during the day. But the dogs need to go to the dog park, bills need to be paid, orders need shipped, I need to work-out (I know, right?).

The way this tech writing gig has worked over the past couple of days is that I get in an hour or so in the morning, a couple three hours in the afternoon, and then three four hours after dinner. It gets me a decent number of hours (especially given that I haven't had any full writing days yet), but I am pretty wound up by bedtime after the hours of intensely focused work. Tomorrow is the first full, uninterrupted, otherwise-unscheduled, writing day and I am looking forward to it. Much of my first day was spent installing software, getting accounts set-up, and beginning the organizational process. I also did a lot of concept review. Yesterday I didn't feel like I made much headway, but today I finalized the structure I'm using for the docs, the meta data, and the individual page format. Now I feel like I'm moving forward on the real meat of the writing.Enough about work though. The real topic of interest tonight is snow! I have seen snow in Atlanta, and ice in Austin, but I have never seen fluffy white snow on the ground in Austin before. Dave said our botanical garden in the snowy night is beautiful, but I didn't make it out to see it--too busy writing. In typical southern fashion, school is closed tomorrow and Dave's company is suggesting employees stay home in the morning until the risk of icy roads is past. So we'll all be cozy together. We had a big fire tonight to celebrate winter and snow, and I think I'll go ahead and have one going all day tomorrow. There aren't that many times here where a roaring fire is more than decorative, but we're in one now.Speaking of time, it's time to make my way under the down comforter so visions of SQL can dance in my head."},

The rest was spent working on learning a skill (piano lesson), being healthy (working out), and being a good parent (having lunch with my child and taking her out after school to photograph architecture for her photography class assignment). Tomorrow I have more time to devote to writing so I can get past the first page hump.A first page doesn't seem like much, but when you are learning a new writing platform and tweaking your outline for the rest of the doc, a lot else gets done along with the first page. Tomorrow will see me writing example queries against my test database and finishing the format for the next major set of pages.

At 1:00 pm I attended the kick-off meeting for the project and signed a six-page independent contractor agreement. When I got home from the meeting (3:00), I added Data.World to my heretofore unused Slack account, installed and configured Atom (per the website, a hackable text editor for the 21st century), and added a new Data.World shared board to my Trello account.

After dinner I wrote the complete outline and hierarchical structure for all the docs--really delving into what I need to write to successfully complete my contract.

Tomorrow I start a career as a full-time, contract, technical writer! Oh it's not a long contract--only a couple of weeks--but if it goes well, I can see myself eventually taking on more contract writing. I'm not quitting glass anytime soon--or giving up on my other creative pursuits and projects--but it's time to take writing out for a spin again.Today we (Dee, Todd and I) unloaded the minivan after the weekend's art festival and then I took it one step further and vacuumed it out since all the removable furniture (including the center console) was out. Then it was time to take them to the airport so they could fly home to Atlanta. My afternoon was spent curled up with an old romance novel I first read in the 1970's by Kathleen Woodiwiss and a nap. I gave myself an afternoon off--free from cleaning, bills, email, or work of any kind. It felt great, and now I'm recharged to start anew.The art festival was a really good experience, and all that remains is a wrap-up meeting and sending an evaluation form to all the artists and vendors. All in all it went much more smoothly than it had any right to--and it was because there were a lot of parents and students volunteering to help out. Students set up and broke down the cafeteria, unloaded and reloaded artists' cars, and worked the Students Making Films table taking donations, and selling food tickets and bottled water. Meredith, Carlotta and Kim did graphic design, Facebook and Twitter feeds, Jason managed all the set-up and show logistics, and Ken wrangled musicians and student volunteers. The show would have failed without them. We also had all the other parents who signed up to work shifts at the table with the students. I'll admit it--I overstaffed. But I figured it was better for students to be a bit bored for a couple of hours than for the patrons or artists to have  long wait for service. I have had first hand experience of just how bad things can get when a show is not properly staffed and logistics is run badly (and not just for one year--can anyone say Chicago Tardis?).So now to bed, but eager to Let the Day Begin tomorrow."},

One of them only did yesterday, the cotton candy vendor didn't come back today either, and the face painter never showed up at all. Nor did she let me know she wasn't coming Nor did she reply to my email and text messages asking her where she was. I was polite, but unless she had a major emergency, her behavior was pretty bad. All the artists I spoke to had mostly good things to say about their experience. Now it's all over but for the artist evaluations and the wrap-up meeting.Tomorrow I am declaring a day of rest and doing nothing more than unloading the van, taking Dee and Todd to the airport, and firing a kiln load of glass. As I look at that list it doesn't seem like much of a day off after all... But it's what I'm going to get as I start a new tech-writing gig for two weeks on Tuesday. Yep, that's right I am trying out a new profession, and if I like it, I'm going to expand on it! The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that it is going to have an impact on what I do for Christmas. I had a bunch of presents I was going to make for family, and now it's going to be tough to find time.I could have made Christmas in the evening, but I found out last night from my child that her designs for the fashion show were to be finished by last Thursday. We just went and bought the fabric today. I also coaxed out of her that the girl she was partnering with did her own designs and sewing. Originally the deal was that Jessie would design and the other girl would sew. Guess who's doing the sewing now (and before December 13th)?The first dress is a form-fitted white brocade sheath with large gold ruffles over one shoulder and around the hem and a beaded band around the top. Like this one, but fancier, and sleeveless. The second is a v-necked, sleeveless blue satin with a gold lining under the skirt and a stiff interfacing in the skirt. It's somewhat like this red one, but has shoulders and a beaded lace shawl (which also needs to be made).I don't have a pattern for either of these dresses--I have sketch. A couple of sketches, and a week and a half. This is going to be a challenging project! Then there is the men's suit she needs to make as the last piece in her collection. We're going to do it next, or her work partner is going to have to do that one for her.Now I drag myself to bed and hope for ten straight hours of sleep."},

The emerging artists at the festival were so cute I just wanted to hug all of them. I did some mentoring, I did some shopping (from all of them). It was a good day. The only down note came when I discovered that I had put the wrong hours on the website (!). I had 10-4 Saturday and 11-5 Sunday. Thanks to this faux pas, Meredith had the wrong time on the poster, and I had the wrong time on the postcard. Oy. So we left it up to individual artists and vendors as to whether they left at 4:00 or stayed till 5:00. They split about 50/50, but everyone was gone by 4:45.Organizing a show is an incredibly difficult endeavor--especially with only two months from conception to inception. I was awake at 4:00 and and had to get up and take my phone into the bathroom so I wouldn't wake Dave and I could add things to my list of all the things I needed to take and do today. Tomorrow will be a much more low-key day. I'll take Jessie shopping for her Fashion Show project fabric tomorrow morning before heading to the At Festival. There is another project I have just added to my plate and that is seamstress for my daughter's two fancy dresses for the Art Department Fashion Show in January. Jessie designed two dresses, and other girl on her team is supposed to sew them. I have a feeling I might be picking up that slack a bit.I would love to write more both about the art festival and about the fashion show project, but I have already fallen asleep 3-4 times during the course of writing this post.

Christmas is coming, I start an intense two-week technical-writing gig next week, and then we head out of town for the week before Christmas. Hot mess is probably putting it kindly. On the other hand, I am still consistently throwing the best pottery I have ever done, and I no longer have the fear that's it's accidental and I'm going to wake up and not be able to do it again. I can finally feel the clay--not feel the sensation of the clay in it's state of inertia, but actually feel the intention of the clay and know where and how to move my fingers to make it do what I want. It's a heady feeling.Tomorrow I get up and unpack all the work I moved from Atlanta and the work that Todd recently made and shipped here. Then we'll go through it and decide what to take to the festival this weekend. Then we'll dig through everything to find display furniture and maybe stands and table cloths. At some point we're going to have to price it. And I should probably have business cards. Oh fan me, I feel another hot mess coming on.Though I am a bit embarrassed that recently the blog entries are barely longer than Facebook posts (and some of them could almost be tweets), I am nonetheless to tired to write more.

I have a Christmas present or two in process--and I still hold out hope for finding the rice bowl I made Jessie for her birthday, oh, quite some time ago. I understand it can take a long time to fire pieces, but come on! It's been almost two months since I put it in for the glaze firing! The school has a very clear No Production Work policy, but there are definitely people who are making quantities of pieces to sell. It's very frustrating for those of us who only make a couple of pieces a week--at best--to not have our work fired because some people have way more than their fair share of the kiln space. I know I sound whiny, but I made that piece last spring and put it in to glaze the second week of last session so I'd have it in plenty of time for Jessie's birthday the first of November, and it still hasn't come out. I hope the one or two Christmas presents I made can actually get fired in time.I can't believe it's already 11:00!

He was wearing a shirt too, and it was nice, but the rest of his ensemble was extraordinary. And then he sang. He had the most beautiful voice! I wish I had caught his name. It's not on the program. Man oh man, he rocked those leather pants! And his voice! He really had personal style and charisma, and he had the audience howling for more.The rest of today was pedestrian in comparison.

{"title": "A Thing of Beauty", "date": "Sunday, November 26, 2017", "text": "A few days ago I posted that I had had an epiphany about what constitutes art. Tonight I went to see Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing Missouri with my spouse. I am so overwhelmed with the sheer beauty and artistry of that movie that I am compelled to finally put virtual pen to virtual paper about art.Some people might claim that something is \"art\" because it evokes an emotional response in the viewer. It isn't about beauty, it's about the message and the visceral reaction. There is a scene in the Square where a floor cleaner accidentally sweeps up some gravel that is part of an exhibition made up of piles of gravel on the floor. The message that goes with the exhibition is that \"you have nothing\". Okay, fine. The artist had an idea that (s)he wanted to convey about the superficiality of our consumption-based lives or some such. And it might be a valid message. And the piles of gravel might be thought-provoking. But it's not art. An article in the Telegraph about the film just after it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year mentions the same scene and ties it to real-life:\"In one scene of the film, a cleaner sweeps away an art installation by West's character.It echoes a real-life event in 2001, when an installation by Damien Hirst was thrown away by a cleaner at the Eyestorm gallery, London, who had mistaken the piles of full ashtrays, empty beer bottles and newspapers were the remnants of a party the night before.\"Yeah, okay. ashtrays, beer bottles and newspapers arranged artistically are not art. They can be (and probably were intended to be in that instance) artistically arranged to maximize the statement--but that still doesn't make the installation art.So what makes art? I believe that in art you can see the anima, the spirit force, the soul of the artist peeking through. There is something of the artist in the art--something more than a message. An installation can be as slick and polished as wet marble in its presentation, but that doesn't make it art. In fact the whole notion of an installation flies in the face of art to me.And yet there was art in the movie The Square. It wasn't all mocking of modern art. The protagonist was a man who clearly believed passionately that the installations in the museum were art. He was sincere in his attitude that the art was in the presentation of the message. But a statement alone, a message alone is not art. Art can make a statement, but there has to be some art there, not just the statement. The movie was art--it had soul and life and humor and pathos. It made a statement about art in an artistic way.Three Billboards is also a piece of art. The acting, the direction, the script, the music was all beautifully interwoven. I'm listening to Just Walk Away Renee by the Four Tops (one of the most powerful musical pieces in the film--and that's saying a lot as it's up against Townes Vandt and a beautiful operatic piece) right now as I write. I don't know if the movie has a message per se, but it pulls your heart from your body.

I did not enter a store. In other shopping news, we didn't get around to buying a Christmas tree, but I'm going to roust everyone out of bed in the morning so we can beat the crowds and get one tomorrow. And that's enough about shopping.This past week has been a time of profound thought for me, but my thoughts haven't done more than swirl around in my head and peek out a bit in my writing. I'm not sure if it's that I'm still processing them, or if I'm just too tired to reformulate them coherently at the end of each full day, but I need to get at least a couple of them out before they fade back into obscurity. The first big one is that I am finally able to articulate why I don't think piles of gravel arranged on the floor in a grid, or an led light cable put into paving stones (both in the movie The Square) are art--even though they might be in an art museum and have a fancy artist statement behind them. I have also (finally) fully synced my mind with both my body and my anima, and it is not only the most liberating feeling, but it also affects my every interaction with people around me.Both of these streams of thought and the resultant realizations are worth exploring here on virtual paper. Tonight, however, is not the night. Maybe I'll post earlier tomorrow. I wish I weren't so tired and the spouse weren't waiting for me, but I am and he is. I wish I had time to puzzle through that last grammatical construction a bit more (subjunctive in English) as he weren't feels much more awkward to me that I weren't, but I believe both are correct."},

It was a good day, it was a good trip. I was somewhat reluctant to come (even though it was a big thing to get the invitation) because I was hesitant to leave my family right before the holidays. But this trip was an unexpected growth experience for me. On it I returned to my jubilant younger years when I loved to meet people and socialize and spend time with them. I contrast this pre-Thanksgiving time with last year's ore-Christmas time (the holiday party for Dave's company) and it's not just night and day, it's a different time stream. Last year I remember not wanting to talk to anyone and going off to basically hide in a corner while my husband trooped up to sing karaoke with everyone else. Talk about a reversal of roles! This year (this trip) I was enthused to meet new people, learn their stories, probe their ideas, experiences and philosophies, and to share mine with them. It's hard to reconcile myself then and now as being the same person.So now I go home to my family whom I missed a lot even as I was having fun, and to socializing again--this time with known friends. Thanks to the past couple of days, I feel much more confident in my ability to enjoy it and not stress out. Thank you Zaga-Jackie for inviting me on this marvelous adventure!"},
{"title": "Las Vegas Love or Hate", "date": "Tuesday, November 21, 2017", "text": "If someone asks you what you think about Des Moines Iowa, you may or may not have an opinion. But everyone, it seems, has an opinion about Las Vegas--and a strong opinion at that. There are many things about Las Vegas that I dislike, but also many things I really like. What I like most about Vegas is the humanity. This is a sybaritic town devoted to enjoyment and pleasure so the majority of the people who live and work here are in a service industry. All around you all day are waiters, receptionists, store clerks, dealers in the casinos, valets, housekeeping personnel, and a host of others working day and night to make sure we visitors have a good experience. What I have noticed the most this visit is how happy and friendly the vast majority of them are. Maybe it's where we're going and what we're doing (craps seems like a very happy game for the most part), but the dealers last night all went out of their way to help Gina and me learn craps--even reminding us to place specific bets and to turn some of our bets off at certain points in the play. All of our waiters, receptionists, store clerks, spa personnel--everyone, in short--has been smiling and friendly. This is not a place where the surly make it. The other people you trip over everywhere are the tourists. I could happily sit and people-watch here all day. This is the world's great melting pot with all races, ages, and sexes represented.I could talk about the disproportionate number of homeless people and drug addicts here. I could focus on the extravagant waste of water and resources that go to support this town in the desert. Both of those are real, but so is the contented joy of the people I have interacted with over the past day and a half. There is a good side to Las Vegas, and I am enjoying it to the fullest for these few days. I wish I weren't so happily exhausted because I could make a much more compelling case, but my eyelids have closed so so must the laptop."},

I am in Vegas till Thursday morning with my friend/neighbor Zaga and a bunch of her friends. Tonight was just Zaga, another friend of hers from Boulder, and I. We hit the buffet about 4:30 for dinner, and then went into the casino to play some craps. Zaga already spent an evening teaching Jessie and me the rudiments of craps so I could maneuver my way around a little. I must say it was exciting! I got to throw the dice a couple of times and the first time I had a really long streak. I managed to throw an all small roll and there were two people betting on it. It pays 34:1 so I was pretty popular for a moment!Back in the room I took this picture of the bathroom. Directly in front of me at the end of the tub is a window that looks out into the main room and then out the window to the Strip in the distance. To the right _in the middle of the mirror_ is a television! In the mirror! The shower is behind the glass door ahead front left, and the toilet is in another glass-doored room just opposite the shower. What incredible luxury. I can't help but be impressed.But back to craps. I like craps. I know that it has the worst odds for players and is considered by many to be a sucker's game, but it's great entertainment when a shooter is on fire and everyone is betting on lots of different numbers and combinations. I won a ton tonight on hard six and a couple of times on hard eight (two three's and two four's). I love the way everyone at the table cheers for each other and gets into the superstitions of betting and rolling. Tomorrow I'm going to take my $3 in winnings out for a spin. I even have a marquee card which the casino uses to track how much you play in order to decide who should get comped rooms and meals. We're in comped rooms now--thank you Zaga!Now sleep before more food, drink, gambling, and excess."},

Tonight we were so privileged as to have four wonderful people from Atlanta arrive at our door on their way west to the Grand Canyon for Thanksgiving. It has been so long since we've had such a lively crew sitting around the table laughing and sharing stories and wine over a good meal. Tomorrow morning they are off for a 10 am showing of Justice League at the Alamo Drafthouse, and I leave for Las Vegas before they get back. But I'll see them for breakfast. Jessie is going with them to the movie even though she's already seen it.So Las Vegas! I have been invited by Zaga to join a small, eclectic, dynamic, opinionated group of women on their annual Las Vegas Thanksgiving revelry. I'm only staying till Thanksgiving morning and then coming home for the rest of the holiday with the family, but I have a feeling the three days I'm there are going to be a wild ride.For Thanksgiving my spouse asked me to curate a cheese and charcuterie plate to take over to some friends' house for dinner. I may have gone a bit over board. I have 19 kinds of cheese, three kinds of thinly sliced smoked meat, two kinds of sausage--duck and wild boar, two pâtés, three fruit spreads, three kinds of pears, two kinds of apples, four kinds of olives, three preparations of almonds (including marcone almonds in honey), three kinds of crackers, pumpkin seeds, ginormous grapes, and a pomegranate. I think there are six adults and four kids. We'll be having another games night/party (or five) (or ten) with the leftovers.As I think of how to layout this marvelous spread of munchies, I picture a 7 feet long 2 X 12 plank of some interesting wood (maybe blue pine!) that runs the length of a dining room table and has a beautiful inlay pattern in it. Everything would be laid out on the plank and would meander the length of the table. Oh that would be so cool! But not this time. At least not for the inlay..."},

I love Saturday because it's an everybody's-home day and it feels like we start with a blank slate. For me Saturday is both the end of the week (because you feel like you get to enjoy yourself after finishing a hard week) and the beginning of it (because the hard week is in the past and it's all green grass and high tides forever in front of you).Next week is not a normal week. It's Thanksgiving week. The week of giving thanks for all our many blessings. It's also a time when we make too much food that we couldn't possibly eat in a week of Sundays, some of us shop till we drop, and others of us begin the Christmas decorating. It is the beginning of the most stressful season of the year. It's a season full of excess--in fact it epitomizes excess: Excess in eating, drinking, spending, decorating, and celebrating. This year I dread it. I don't feel physically well enough for the ordained whirlwind--especially with all the restrictions I am discovering I have with eating and drinking. And yet I also don't want to give up the traditions I have held onto from my family--many of which involve excess. It's a conundrum.Tomorrow the family needs to sit down and put together a plan for what we're going to do... no, that's wrong. The family is not the problem--I am. So here's my plan. Here's what I'm going to do. We have been invited by friends for Thanksgiving. Dave will cook a little, but we'll keep it low-key, and our fridge (and ourselves) will not be overstuffed at the end of the day. We'll get our Christmas tree the day after Thanksgiving, and trim it and decorate the house on Saturday. What we get done Saturday is what all we'll do and the boxes will be put away until it's time to take it all down. There will not be what seems to be unending decorating for Christmas. I will pick a thoughtful gift or two for those I love over the next couple of weeks, and then I will stop. I won't keep frenziedly buying right up through Christmas Eve. None of us need more STUFF. I'm not going to try to make everyone something from my hands.I don't have to make this stressful for me or anyone else. Let's see if I can stick to that resolution.P.S.--The workout wth the trainer went GREAT today! I'll see her again next Friday. After getting the Christmas tree."},
{"title": "Bacon Ice Cream and Turducken Burger", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2017", "text": "We come down to the last day of the work week heading in to the weekend before Thanksgiving and a week-long holiday (9 days with the weekends) for the J. Today was a day with many moving parts. It started with dropping the J at school and going to ceramics class at the Art School at the Contemporary. Then I managed to get home for 15 minutes for a quick bite, and off with Zaga for a haircut.Zaga took me to the person who cuts her hair, and when we arrived the first thing I noticed was that all the signs on the wall were in Korean. The second thing I noticed was that everyone in there was Korean--customers and staff. The guy who cut my hair did not speak any English. Zaga said she used Google translate to communicate with him, but the receptionist came and interpreted for me. Eugene, the stylist, did not wash my hair or even wet it--he dry cut it. Zaga compares him to a hummingbird lighting on your hair for a snip here and a trim there. It took him an hour, and at the end I had a third less hair without losing any length! He was pretty amazing--and never said a word to me. I like the cut  and am looking forward to seeing what it does after I wash it. There are so many different length layers that it might go all curly on me.After the haircut was a full leg wax. It may sound silly, but because I'm starting to work out tomorrow and want to go in the pool and/or the hot tub at the gym, (I know, TMI!) I had to have the hairs on my legs ripped out from the roots. I probably wouldn't have even mentioned it here, but I spent almost the entire time on the table processing a UPS shipment of work from Atlanta to Texas for the upcoming A Fair of the Art. First I had to talk to Todd (I didn't scream at all). Then I was on-line on my phone entering the shipment. Then I had to call UPS to arrange for a pickup. I'm afraid I let loose a bit of a shriek squeak in the ear of the UPS representative when my esthetician was over enthusiastic about how much she could take from one (very tender) spot at once.As parts were moving, Zaga dropped me off at the waxing salon and drove my car home for me. Dave picked Jessie up after school (a couple of blocks away from the salon) and they then came and got me so we could go see Justice League. Both in between haircut and wax, and wax and movie, I could've made it home, but then I would have just had to turn around ten minutes later and go back to the same area of town so it made more sense to do it the way we did. However it meant I/we had an hour between activities to hang out. Zaga took me for ice cream after the haircut at Lick and I had a scoop of the roasted beets and fresh mint (Clean, crisp garden mint flawlessly complements the slightly sweet, earthy flavor of roasted Johnson's Backyard Garden beets), and a scoop of breakfast bacon (Maple syrup adds a sweet contrast to the smoky delicious pepper bacon from our friends at Salt and Time). I kid you not; those were the flavors and the were INCREDIBLE!After the wax Dave, J and I went to HopDoddy Burger Bar for dinner. I had to have the special burger: a turducken burger on a stuffing roll with cranberry sauce, tempura green beans, and fried onions, with a side of gravy. Apparently HopDoddy is also in California and this burger was featured on a local tv channel there. This was definitely the day of weird food for me! After dinner we strolled a couple of doors down to Dragon's Lair comics and games and payed a couple of games of Tsuro--they have a couple of demo-the-games tables. Dave and J each did a bit of shopping comic and book shopping too, and then it was time to head to the next parking lot down for Justice League at the Alamo Drafthouse Anderson Lane.When we got to the theater and I got out my phone for the electronic tickets I discovered that the cherry on top of a really surreal day was that I had managed to buy tickets for two different movies at two different Alamo Drafthouses for the same time tonight. We saw Justice League--and really loved it--and we got rain checks for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. What a day!"},
{"title": "Friends", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2017", "text": "Ah it is good to have friends! Friends near, friends far, friends never met but greatly, gently supportive! Dee, I hope you are coming out SOON. Bill, it is the busiest time of the year for a handcrafter (gifts to make, doncha know) so I'm not sure if I can devote a whole week to the glass studio--but I bet I can dedicate two more days to the jewelry studio and get it done in that time. Ellen, I haven't even managed to divest myself of the baby sweaters (four of them) I started for Jessie before she was born. I don't think I have a chance of getting rid of crafts yet untested. Alex and Lynne, I don't know if I can do things one at a time, but it's worth a try.‘Shifting Sands’ (Detail) – 2012 by Steve Royston BrownMy biggest problem is that I have a large passion* for EVERYTHING I do--why else would I do it? I still thrill to the feel of thick, rough paper and the vision of it cut, ripped, punched, and stitched into books. I avidly watch woodworking and jewelry videos and dream of the pieces I want to make using the techniques I learned. I itch (no pun--really) to spin my own fiber into my own yarn, to knit into a sweater or coat of my own design.There are still several batik fabrics I have to sew into shirts for Dave, scraps from them to make into a quilt, and worn out shirts I made him years ago to weave into rugs. A corner of the jewelry studio has been set aside for enameling, and a corner of the glass studio has been set aside (in theory it's there, under mounds of boxes) for ceramics--including a studio pottery kiln. Isn't it sad that the only passion I don't really have anymore is fused glass? I am over glass blowing too--too hot, too heavy, too steep a learning curve. I am still interested in doing some casting, some 3D screen-printing ( à la Steve Royston Brown above right), and some stained glass pieces, but sadly I don't have new directions driving me in fusing.And then there are the combined media--wood with steel and copper, wood with glass and enamel, fiber with glass, silver and copper with glass, glass with stone...Lucky for me I haven't taken on anything new in the last 24 hours that's going to take up more of my ever-dwindling time. Oh wait... Because of health and weight issues and the urging (nagging--mostly because of yesterday's post) of Zaga next door, I joined a gym today. Costco had a 50% off membership for the 24-Hour Fitness near me, Zaga belongs, and (yet more theory) we're going to work out together a couple (three?) times a week. Oh yes, and because I went by myself instead of with Zaga, I got talked into some sessions with a personal trainer to get me jump-started. Working out starts Friday...But in spite of all the tearing of hair, rending of garments and salting of fields--no, wait, that was something else (and we haven't even talked gardening or BEES lately!)--I am feeling better today about my journey and actually living long enough to fully enjoy all of it. Really, we're talking weeks of dedicated work--not years--to get all my spaces set-up. It just feels like years right now. Today I was happier--even though I still didn't make anything--because I went through two on-line jewelry video classes. Maker porn always gets my engine going and makes me happy. Tomorrow is pottery in the morning so I will make tomorrow, and Friday morning Becky and I are going to do a virtual craft morning. We used to get together one day a week (when we could manage it) in Atlanta to do some craft activity, and Friday we're going to FaceTime it. I'll be in the jewelry studio.Franzeska, if you're reading this, you should come visit for a long weekend so we can play in the studio. I do still have a passion for teaching and sharing glass, and maybe helping someone else down that road will reignite my spark.___________________*or at least a medium passion."},
{"title": "Closer to Death", "date": "Tuesday, November 14, 2017", "text": "It was a good day and a good evening, but without even having to squint I can see myself dying before my work spaces are all set up and fully operational. What a depressing vision. Up until today when I thought about the future I'd see myself strolling into a studio in the morning with a mug of coffee, steam from it dancing with the dust motes in the sunlight coming in through the windows. I'd sit down at a fully-equipped and organized bench with all my tools and materials in place and ready for me to make something. At the end of a long artistic day, I'd put away my tools and leave the room clean and ready for next time. I wouldn't have to clean, straighten, unpack, organize and set-up for hours before I could get to the creativity part. I wouldn't have to wend my way through stacks of boxes and unsituated shelving racks to get to my work table, sewing machine, pottery wheel, table saw, jewelry bench, loom, etc. The only pick-up-and-do-ready things I have going right now are spinning and knitting--and that last one is iffy. Everything else can be done in the middle of a chaotic mess or not at all.As I was driving back from dropping Jessie off at school this morning (she finished shooting her film, Yay!), I thought about what I had planned to do each day for the past few weeks, and what I actually had done. There was a remarkable pattern to the data, but the pattern was not in what I had planned matching up what I had done. No, the pattern was that each day I had planned to do some studio/workspace set up so I could then do some creative activity in said studio/workspace, and each day I had put off doing the set-up in favor of something else so consequently I never did any creating either.Even in Atlanta, I never had my studio completely set up the way I wanted.Now I have four studios and one tool space to unpack, organize and optimize. At this point it's more likely that I will quit doing an activity before I have the area and all the tools and materials I've collected ready. That's especially true in the glass studio. Even after selling off huge swathes of hoarded materials, I still have far more than I could use in a lifetime. I need to continue to sell the excess off--yet one more thing between me and actual creating.I have reached a special place in life (a new special hell): the place where you see that the stash you've accumulated for special projects is measurably greater than the time you have left in your life. Every crafter faces that moment, but not every crafter has to face it for glass (for stained, fused, and torch-worked projects); spinning fiber; knitting and crocheting yarn; book-making papers and cords; weaving yarn; jewelry findings, stones, and metals; scrapbooking supplies; rubber stamping and card-making supplies; wood; sewing/quilting fabric; Kumihimo thread; clay and pottery tools; and soap/bath product ingredients and packaging.Dave said a few months ago (and I think I wrote about it here) that it's time for me to divest myself of all my moribund hobbies. But I hadn't thought of them as anything approaching moribund until today. (Heck, when he said it, I didn't even know what moribund meant.) Now I see that they are moribund in part from the inertia caused by their individual masses. I have to find the tools before I can use them, and it seems I spend all my time looking for them and then deciding where to store them.Good thing we had cheese for dinner tonight (really) (we had a cheese plate) cause I have obviously still got a lot of whine to go with it. Wish I could think of a way to get through the inertia."},

Suffice it to say that no filming happened after school today in spite of my having picked J up from school so she wouldn't have to wait through a long bus ride to get home before she could film. Now we're at the point where I am keeping her home tomorrow morning for first period (which happens to be her AV class) so she can film. The reason she couldn't film today was that she didn't have the light. Tomorrow she is going to start from scratch (I believe even with a new script) (!), and it will be all done. Then I will take her and all the equipment (lights, sound, camera, etc.) back to school. Whew! I hope tomorrow's post is interesting and can report the end of the film."},
{"title": "Filming, Pizza, and a Hot Tub", "date": "Sunday, November 12, 2017", "text": "Kaiju by JessieThe big question of the day is, \"Is the filming done?\". And the answer is, \"No. Of course not!\". We're not even on the same script anymore (though the falling-backward-into-water-scene from an early iteration of the original script is back in). I'd say about half of a 2-3 minute movie is filmed, and it took all day. Tomorrow or Tuesday night the last half (including the falling-back-into-the-pond-while-wearing-the-camera shot) will happen.Jessie and Jig selfieThe biggest thing to come out of the filming is Zaga and Dave's reaction to Jessie's reset of the hosue. She left a few knick-knacks, but she was pretty ruthless in doing away with clutter. Almost every surface is empty, and to me that's just wrong. Zaga and Dave, on the other hand, thought it was incredible and wanted to know if we were going to keep it that way. Snort. The only reason to have surfaces is so you can put something on them. What use is an empty table I ask you? Besides, now I don't know where half of my small stuff is. Jessie said she'd put it all back, but I can see that job is squarely in my future.The evening ended with familial pizza-making (mine had alfredo sauce, mozzarella, thin pear slices sauteed in butter and turbinado, prosciutto, roasted pistachios, cream cheese, and a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar. Mine was the clear winner for perfection of flavors. After dinner (and an episode of Stranger Things), I went over and hot tubbed with Zaga for an hour. What a perfect way to end a day!"},
{"title": "It's All About the Film", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2017", "text": "Today is a cinematic day, and it has been filled with hard lessons. I left my day kind of fluid and unstructured so I could help the J if she needed it. She told us at breakfast that she wasn't going to shoot during the day because she wanted it to be dark outside for all the indoor shots, and she needed access to the neighbors' Porsche for the outdoor shots. They weren't home today so she was planning to do the outdoor shots tomorrow. I asked her to please go through her shot list and her plan for filming to make sure she had everything she needed and to maybe do some test filming during the day to avoid last minute snafus as much as possible. She got rather exasperated with me and defensive when I pushed her for details. I tried and failed, to convey to her (with my decades of hard-won experience) that she needed to not leave everything till the last minute thinking it would work out and she had everything covered. So I too my friend Mike's advice, I stepped back, I breathed through the impulse to push (more) and I left the room.I spent my day cleaning and unpacking in the studio. We have owned this house for 25 months, I have lived here for 16 months, and I am still not even close to unpacked! There is still a substantial number of things I have been looking for and can't find. A friend told me once that I would never make it as a military wife as you have to be able to unpack and get settled quickly. I'd still be putzing around unpacking when it was time to pack up and move again. Of course if I were a military wife I wouldn't have so much STUFF. Tomorrow I plan to keep working out there and, though I don't have a specific stopping point goal in mind, I hope to get a LOT done. I also have to stay out of the J's way. Her father has that one down: Every time I start to talk to her about her film or her homework, he \"leaves us to it\" and goes into the bedroom. Right now we're both hiding out in there while she does a bit more filming tonight.At Jessie's suggestion, Dave and I went on a date night tonight so she could film in peace and privacy. She said she doesn't even like us in the next room when she's practicing piano or having a lesson so she really didn't want us around while she was filming. The plan was a movie, then dinner, then pick Zaga up at the airport at 10:00. As with Jessie's plans, ours went a little wonky too. I picked the movie: The Square, a Swedish film, this yea'r winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes. I didn't pick it because it was an artsy fartsy foreign film, I picked it because of the trailer. I didn't realize it would be in Swedish (as it didn't really sink in when I watched the trailer that it was a Swedish film and artsy fartsy. I also didn't realize it was two hours and 20 minutes long which completely screwed up our plans for dinner and getting Zaga from the airport--we managed neither. Luckily there were Twizzlers and Uber (one for us and one for her).But about the movie... I LOVED it. It was beautifully shot, witty, articulate, funny, poignant, and completely non-Hollywood. The characters were oddly real and believable--oddly because they were, well, odd. I hadn't realized how many of the movies I look forward to seeing at the cinema are from Marvel or wish they were. Had it come from Hollywood, this film would have been pared down to under two hours. Maybe an hour and a half. But it was better for the slow, thoughtful pace. It didn't feel pretentious or full of itself in any way, and the lead actor gave one of the most amazing performances I have seen in a long time. It doesn't hurt that he is also 6'4\" and handsome à la Pierce Brosnan in the Thomas Crowne Affair. As is often the case with life and European art films, the end wasn't so much an ending as a stopping point, but that's a statement too, isn't it?I'm not going to write any more about Jessie's film and filming process tonight because it's still a journey. I don't know if it will ever be a destination, but she will get through the journey and I hope there will be lessons learned and wisdom acquired. That's all I can ask for as a parent."},

Today has been a waste of time--and I didn't even enjoy it! If you know up front that you're going to feel crappy all day, you can snuggle into bed in your jammies with some hot tea and ice water, and read, sleep, and knit as feels best. The problem comes when you get up in the morning, get dressed, and try to get things done--all the while hoping you'll feel better soon, but you never really do. Now I'm hoping that today was a one-off day and tomorrow I'm going to be back to my perky, energetic, not-nauseated self. If not, maybe I'll at least be less whiny.Tomorrow is Saturday and J is filming her noir film for class. It's already a couple of weeks overdue, and I am worried that she's going to run into problems that she won't be able to solve quickly enough to get it all filmed in two days. But I'll try to stay optimistic. I think it's also better if I don't plan to work on anything of my own because I can see having to do set arrangement for her all day--including moving all the furniture out of the great room for one scene. I have a feeling this is going to be quite a lot of effort for a 2-4 minute film.As today was a blur of bleh, I don't have much to say tonight. I only spoke to three people outside of my family in person today, and those exchanges took a total of 10 minutes. Oh yes, I also gave an order to the clerk at the McDonald's drive-through for the J after school. If I were Cynthia Morgan I would have a long and fascinating story about one of those three people, but they barely impinged on my consciousness. I blame the nausea.Continuing the 365 Project on Tookapic is also dragging me down. There has been a rumor flying around that the site is going to close down because there isn't enough money to keep it going even for the rest of the year. Just reading that news took the wind out of my sails for my project. How disheartening would it be to have them shut down before the end of the year, before I had a chance to do anything (like make a book) with my project? I don't even have an accurate list of the photos I've used each day as there were last minute substitutions and photos posted from my phone that didn't make it into the folder on my hard drive. I was counting on Tookapic being there. Ooh, listen to that whine! Time to pack it in and go to bed. Sleep (and time) cures all ills (and whines)."},

Every fall when the weather starts to change there is one day when you just freeze. Your hands are cold, your feet are cold, your nose runs, and you can't help but think you'll never make it through the winter if you're this cold and it's only down to 50 or 60 degrees. Well today was that day for me (and Jessie too). I have fuzzy black pants on along with a sweater and sheepskin slippers, and I'm still cold! Every time I turned around tonight Jessie was putting her (freezing) hands on my neck or up under my sweater on my back or my tummy. So I am not much longer for this verticality: it's time to get horizontal under the Mr. Big down comforter from Three Dog Down. Their comforters are hands down (hah! pun!) the best I have ever used with lots of loft and they're extra wide and long. No cover-stealing spouse is going to freeze me out.So that's the night. But what about the day? Today started with all the dewy promise in the world, but by 4:00 I was wondering where the time had gone, and why I hadn't accomplished anything on any creative projects. Or bills. Or cleaning. I gave good website, that's about all I can say. Oh and I drove Jessie back and forth to school and to the camera store.The evening was moderately better as we had a family games night and played Dr. Who Clue. I was River Song, Jessie was Clara, and Dave was Strax. There is no Dr. character, and all of the objects used are not weapons. In fact only a couple of them are lethal. I'm not sure what the backstory behind the game is, but Jessie was very happy we got it, and she even won the first game. Now I'm primed to start playing games in the evening with Dave again--Settlers of Catan (if it can be played with two), San Juan (the two-player version of Puerto Rico), and the newly acquired Five Tribes, just to name a few.The rain is coming down harder. Time to get under the covers. Maybe a hot shower first..."},

I didn't have the heart to tell her no so after Dave and I were done, I picked her up from school and we went through the Wendy's drive-through (which is coincidentally right across the street from the post office).Today was a much calmer day--and I DID get some housework done: I vacuumed and mopped the floors. I also got the first nibbles from the parents of prospective emerging artists after putting out a Call for Young Artists on Next Door.The afternoon ended with creating the back of the postcard for A Fair of the Art--Meredith, our wonderful graphic designer-parent did the front--and getting the postcard in for printing and delivery Thursday. Zaga came over for dinner (Dave made adobo chicken, yum) and then she and I sat in their hot tub drinking wine and talking for a couple of hours. A hot tub is a wonderful, marvelous thing, and I am wondering why we don't have one. We might need to work on that. We're at the point now in our marriage that we could easily buy a hot tub as our anniversary and Christmas gifts to ourselves. Maybe next year.Now some more spouse time and off to, you guessed it, bed!"},

No, this is me coming back from the future to post for yesterday, er, today! Honestly I would've posted today but I broke my fingers on A Fair of the Art. First I did all of the acceptance letters for the first round of jurying for the established artists. Then I updated the website with all of their photos and artist bios. by the time I was done with that I not cleaned a bit of my house, nor had I put away Halloween decorations. I had shipped a package UPS by flagging down a driver on the road and handing him--no, to be fair, he hopped out of his truck and came over to my minivan and unloaded the package himself--a glass shipment for Todd. I had also failed to ship a package to Hawaii USPS because I found I didn't have my wallet after getting all the way to the end of the shipping process at the counter. I diddled around for another 15 minutes trying to make Apple pay work (the postal clerk thought it did) or get my husband on the phone to see if he was close enough to get to the post office to pay for my package before they closed (he never answered--his phone was dead).After the pressures of the day (not getting the house cleaned at all was actually very stressful--it is a pit) I was very glad that the spouse suggested playing Five Tribes after dinner, even though it kept me from posting. He and I sat at the kitchen table and played this wonderful board game for almost two hours and it was PERFECT. No tv--no media of any kind. I didn't have the heart at the end to say, hey, I have to post. I figured I'd just go to bed with my wonderful spouse and post from the future.

We've decided she needs to stay up and be decorated for the season--whatever the season may be. For Christmas she'll get a little Santa Claus hat. For Valentine's she can be holding a big (bleeding) heart. For St Patrick's Day she can be eating a leprechaun. For Easter she can carry a basket full of eggs and wear bunny ears. Oh the fun I can have with this one!Today we spent all day (Jessie and I did) on a film shoot for one of the girls in her cinematic arts program. We started at 8:00 this morning and got home just after 9:00 tonight. I mostly hung out on the couch and worked on my laptop, but it was exhausting even for me. Or maybe it was exhausting giving Thor back. At 3:00 this afternoon we returned him to the rental car lot. Jessie likened it to sending a foster puppy on to his forever home: It breaks your heart a little bit. I told her Thor did not follow us home, and we cannot keep him. (Thor was the red Corvette Stingray convertible I rented for her birthday weekend.)Now it's time (again? already?) for bed.

She celebrated all of it with just her parents--not friends, no party--but I think it was just about perfect for her. We went out for breakfast this morning (she and I were in the Corvette and Dave led in the Leaf), and then we went to Dragon's Lair (the comic book and game shop) where she found some good manga books and Dr. Who Clue. Next we just drove around a bit. In circles. In a parking lot. Wink, wink. Then we came home for a wee rest before heading out again to Thor Ragnarok. Now she's chatting with Uncle Ed and Aunt Susan, and when she's done she'll blow out the candles on her cake while we sing to her. I don't know if anyone will eat any cake tonight as we're all still pretty stuffed from the movies (dinner AND a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse).Tomorrow she is is crewing a movie for one of her cinematic program compatriots, and I have to return the Corvette. It's going to break my heart. I love that car! Zaga and I took it out for a ride this afternoon while Dave and Jessie went to get her cake. I asked him if he wanted me to call and have him put on as a driver and then he could take her to get the cake in it, but he said no it's not his thing... How can a perfect, luscious, sexy, new red convertible Corvette Stingray NOT be someone's thing?!? But, whatever. Zaga and I drove out to the Oasis on the lake for a drink (diet coke for me), and we had fun valet parking the car. When we came back out, the valet had put it right in front at the end of a line of three cars: a Porsche, and *two* new red Corvette convertibles. I must admit it felt pretty cool to hand the ticket to a different, bored looking valet (who was clearly expecting to fetch a minivan or SUV for me), and to point to the line of cool cars and say \"It's the one at the end with the top down\".________________Cake is finished and it's time for bed.

For tonight I chose the fresh, powerful version performed in Hyde Park in London on June 7, 1969 when the song was new instead of the more mellow, polished version from the Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2007.The week was just PACKED with activities and deadlines and responsibilities, but I made it through. And it officially ended when I picked Jessie up from school in a 2017 red Corvette Stingray convertible (rented for one day for her birthday tomorrow). Talk about fresh and powerful. Jessie was over the moon excited, and I have to admit I was pretty jazzed too. When I was her age I also loved Corvettes--though today was my first time in one--and driving on 2222 in it with the top down, the sun shining, and the tunes playing was magical. It might have triggered a mid-life something in me. It's not a crisis as I don't feel like I have missed out on anything and thus have to change my life drastically before it's too late, but there was definitely a feeling of having automotively settled over the past 18 years. I am on my third Honda minivan for criminey sake!Thank you Zaga for the photo...That Corvette... It rumbles. It roars. It doesn't screech or whine. It's low, and throaty-sounding, and more enjoyable overall than any car I've ever ridden in. I was a little intimidated when I first drove it thinking it would be drive differently than other cars and I would have to be careful not to accelerate too fast or turn too sharply. I guess I was expecting it to be a lot more responsive than it is. Maybe the rental place has some kind of child safety device on it dumbing it down so that renters don't do anything stupid. In any case, it wasn't tiring to drive (as a super responsive car could be), and it fit me like a glove--once I was able to get into it. It's about 6\" off the ground, the seat has a deep recessed bucket surrounded by door and console, and let's face it I have old knees and a less-than-trim silhouette. Getting out is even more... fun. And yet, in spite of the difficulties getting in and out, it's a dream car. Once you're in, you never want to leave. You don't even have to go fast in it to feel a thrill. Because you're so close to the ground, going from zero to 21 gets your blood pumping, accelerating to 35 miles an hour feels like flying, and taking it from there to 50 will have your passengers white-knuckling the dash. Sixty was my top speed today. Tomorrow I might get out onto the freeway where the speed limit is 75 to see what it feels like.So here I am over the mid fifties hill and lusting after a red muscle car that doesn't have a place to tuck my purse, which holds either my daughter OR my husband but not both, and in which Gallifrey absolutely will not fit. It has about 1/3 the interior room of the Mini Cooper convertible. As Dave says, sexy as hell for a car you can't even imagine having sex in. It's ours till 3:00 pm tomorrow. Guess I better live the fantasy now or resign myself to getting a full-time well-paying job to pay for my car habit. Heck, it could be clothes, it could be shoes, it could be jewelry! But no. Like daughter, like mother. I have a car problem."},

We'll see what comes of it.Today was an extraordinary day on other fronts too. I had ceramics class this morning, and for the first time EVER, everything I threw turned out beautifully. Each piece was better than the one before it. After ceramics I took the cats to the vet, then came home and got Todd's airline ticket to come out and do A Fair of the Art with me (as an artist, not as a promoter). Next accomplishment was getting in a kiln load. On the rental front, we got another review today and then we got an inquiry from a potential full-time renter. Sweet!I ended the evening with website updates for A Fair of the Art (we have contracted with all the food trucks) and an email to all the parent volunteers. Now it's time to go to sleep.

You'd think that wouldn't be a problem, but I can't remember where many of the light switches are. Really. So we sit in the dark (or the light, depending where we were when we lost network). This is a seriously first world problem. It did keep me from firing in the studio tonight however, as I really DON'T know where the light switches are out there and I just didn't feel like futzing around to find out. Spectrum says it's a statewide problem, but Dan and Zaga next door are streaming a movie (and laughing at me) just fine. Dave just sits in the dark looking at his phone.Today I met a friend for open studio at Creative Side Jewelry Academy and almost finished the locket I started in my 201 class. I did get all the soldering done, now I just have to clean up the silver and tube-set the sapphires and the topaz. The sapphires are stones I sifted from gravel from the mine in Montana this past summer and had cut. Now I want to make pieces with prong setting for the two large sapphires. However carving out time for to work on jewelry in the next couple of months is going to be tough. I have A Fair of the Art, my own glass orders, J's birthday, Christmas (yes, I'm thinking that far ahead already), and a couple of trips coming up.Tomorrow it's ceramics, glass, and the vet--this time with the cats. Another crazy day when I don't have time to breathe and end up exhausted and slightly grumbly (like today).

They were a tad higher than they were before I went on medication. To help me see what's going on, they prescribed a glucose meter thingie for me so I can stick my finger and read my blood sugar levels. They also changed my blood pressure meds because I have the strange cough symptom that is a side effect of Lisinopril... And now I am truly old, prattling on like a geriatric about my various medications.After I escaped from the doctor's office--without having seen a doctor in the hour+ I was there, ah modern medicine!--I checked in with Todd and made the decision NOT to do ACRE next year.

I have to fix the Grim Reaper who fell over at the waist (poorly soldered thin metal), and I still have lighting issues. I just didn't have the spunk today to fix the lanterns, but I need to so something. It's almost tempting to break out one of the four panes of glass so I can reach in on that side to turn the little candles on and off (getting in through the top is nogh on impossible). Of course then I couldn't use real candles in them as it would be too dangerous. I did find some wonderful solar landscape lights on Amazon that got rave reviews (over 3,000 of them--reviews, not lights I purchased...) and were only $12 apiece so I picked up a few. I have been wanting landscape lights of the garden and the trees so these will be perfect for now for Halloween lighting, and after Halloween they will be good for lighting trees and the front of the house--with solar!Getting the lights and a few other things on my shopping list was all the work I did today. The rest was relaxation: I took the dogs to the dog park with Zaga this morning, I read and watched woodworking YouTube videos this afternoon, and then I napped (well, read some more in bed).

I am annoyed with how difficult they are to light so I'm thinking of cutting a hole in the bottom of each of the floor plates and siliconing in the battery-operated lights (the switch is in the bottom of the candle so if I cut a hole in the base of the lantern, I'll be able to turn the light on from outside).

Neither did laundry, but I could die happy if all I left undone was folding laundry (not that I'm planning to die anytime soon). I repotted a couple of orchids to flex my fingers and warm up for the day, and then I got right to organizing A Fair of the Art and sending out the next round of tasks and requests. When I was about 3/4 of the way through, I accidentally deleted my message and almost lost it. Fortunately there is thing called the Internet that holds the sum total of all human knowledge (and tons of cute cat pictures), and on it I found how to recover the deleted draft email. Whew! Then I decided that, if everything went well, there would probably be a LOT of responses to my email and I didn't want to flood everyone's mailboxes and annoy them unnecessarily so I created a Google Group for the project and added everyone to it. Screw inviting people: I don't have time to wait for people to make up their minds if they want to hear from me or not. I just added them, welcomed them, explained why I set up the group, and got on with the important email. Wheee!In the midst of My Fair Frenzy, I took some time to talk to one of my NextDoor neighbors about how to work with food trucks. He is a life-long carnie who has recently retired to Austin and is now in the concessions business--mostly with non-profits. His advice confirmed all of my hopes and suspicions, and allayed my fears. Yes, we are right to ask for a percentage of the profits--25-40% is standard and for a new festival 25% is a good place to start (everybody wins). In order to determine what 25% is, we sell $.50 tickets that are used to pay for food, and the food trucks don't actually take cash. At the end of the festival we pay them for the tickets they turn in minus 25%. Three trucks is a good number for our event. Three is actually a bit difficult to me as we have had twice that many trucks apply, and I hate turning anyone down. But I don't personally have to turn anyone down! There are a lot of other people involved and we can decide on the food vendors by vote, not fiat.After the A Fair of the Art communication, I cleaned our apartment for this evening's renters. It was a very satisfying activity. Thirty-five years ago I cleaned houses and condos in a ski resort for a living. Today cleaning the apartment took me back to those times and the satisfaction of doing a menial job really well. After we finished rehabbing the apartment and when we started renting it, I had it cleaned by a cleaning service a couple of times. Today was the first day I went in and did all the cleaning myself, and I approached it from the ground up; I cleaned things that had obviously been passed over by the cleaning people (the back 1/4\" of the wooden blinds on all the windows), and at the end the whole apartment was so clean it gleamed. As I worked I kept picturing my grandmother as the prospective guest, and I made sure it would be clean enough for her. My grandmother used to make me strip off my clothes down to my underwear inside the back door after I had been playing in the backyard. then I had to go straight to the sink and thoroughly wash my hands. When I came in and put on clean clothes, I wasn't allowed to sit on the couch--only the floor. My gramma cleaned her house professionally and religiously, and if I could please her, I could please anyone. Our guests tonight: Three guys in for a couple of days of mountain biking. Sexism aside, the chance that they actually appreciate the cleaning I did: 2%. That's okay. I did it for me, not for them.The night finished with a family movie night to see Shaun of the Dead at the Alamo Drafthouse. A perfect end to a really kicking day."},

I had my last Wednesday morning ceramics class after my last 8:00 am piano lesson with a trip to McCallum to take Jessie to school in between. But those were the easy things. For big things, I finished up the web site for A Fair of the Art tonight including creating both an on-line emerging artist application and one for download. I also took in two more applications from established artists and two more from food trucks. Just as I was finishing up, I got a request from someone on HomeAway to rent our apartment... tomorrow through Saturday. Of course I haven't cleaned it since the last guests last weekend! Guess what I'll be doing tomorrow morning  (along with folding the laundry I didn't get to today, putting up the tombstones and the last of the Halloween skeletons in the garden)?In a weird bit of déjà vu, I also have to decide--or at least think about--whether I want to do the replacement show for the Buyer's Market in Philly next February. Now that Nancy Vince isn't running it anymore, I am willing to consider it. I talked to another artist today who does it and he said he had a better show there last year than he did at the last winter American Made Show in DC. That show was pretty decent for me so I'm betting Philly would be pretty good too. It's not going to be a big show--500 exhibitors max--but it might be the right thing to do. My thinking is something along the lines of make money instead of spend money. But do I really want to get back into the big show thing again? Todd said he's game for anything so it's pretty much on me. There would be no chance of driving: I'd have to fly from Austin. Work would have to be shipped out and back--and I don't have a crate for it anymore. The display crate is still in storage out on the east coast, but I was just contemplating getting it shipped back here so I could have the display materials to use for the show the beginning of December.Right now I'm signed up for the second level in the Master Spinning program through Olds College the same weekend as the Philly show. It's being held at Spry Whimsy in Wisconsin again (where I did the first level last year). If I did the show I'd have to cancel my class and change to an independent study course--which is possible for the first and second levels. I even know an instructor who I think would be willing to take me on. So I could have my cake and show it too.So tomorrow I have much thinking and doing to do, and I also have to get with the marketing team for A Fair of the Art to do a big push on announcing that we're accepting applications from emerging (student) artists and to get the poster made up. I also need to follow up on musicians with the person in charge of that and get back to the food tracks that have asked to do the festival.We are going on a little vacation right before Christmas and I am already thinking that I am really going to need it!"},

I watched, and ket working, and watched some more (and worked some more). Finally at 6:30 when I was starting to get worried I remembered that he had a work movie night tonight to see Bladerunner. And I got a taste of what it's like to be home alone in the evening (alone as in in the same house with a teenager who hides in her room all night with only a brief foray out to make herself rice and beans for dinner) while the spouse is out having fun (taking a class, seeing a movie, you know: fun). It was lonely, but I got a lot done--I can see the top of my desk again and all the mail for the past month has been opened and dealt with (though sometimes dealt with meant putting in a pile to do tomorrow or Thursday). I also got all the clean laundry put in baskets and moved to the bedroom to fold or hang up (also tomorrow). I even took the child out for lunch today because I thought she forgot her sandwich and didn't have any food. Turns out she made herself tortellini and put it in her cute little Bento box, but I took her to McDonald's anyway.I love Tuesday. It's one of the days when I have absolutely nothing scheduled but checking things off my list. Tomorrow is my last double-duty Wednesday (piano and ceramics all before noon-thirty), and starting next week I go to piano on Wednesday and ceramics on Thursday. But Tuesday is safely past the mound of tasks dumped onto Monday after a weekend of businesses being closed, and it's typically a day when I get a lot done. While I really only accomplished household manager stuff today I did take time to fantasize about setting up an enameling area in the jewelry studio. Maybe I'll actually have time to do that Thursday. Then I can finish the pieces I have left undone form the Arrowmont workshop.I love Wednesday too because it's a designated creative day. I haven't practiced piano in three weeks, but I know I'll be back on track after my lesson tomorrow. Ceramics has been difficult this quarter as I throw a lot of pieces each week, but I'm lucky if even one turns out. Tomorrow I might not even throw. I have a mug and a bowl to glaze and might just stick to that. Though I really haven't been having luck with the glazes either. Last week I got back two bowls I threw last spring and glazed a couple of weeks ago, and they were... beige. Actually more cream than beige. Just... meh. I was very disappointed. I have some underglazes that fire to cone 5 that I could use at home. Maybe I could use a couple of them and then cover them with a clear glaze. The bowl is a beautiful little piece that I made as a rice bowl for Jessie last spring. I am planning to give it to her for her birthday next week so I do not want to mess it up!The spouse should be home any minute now, time for me to curl up with a book and a glass of Viognier to wait for him."},
{"title": "Monday Floated Away", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "Wow! Monday passed very fast and with not very much action. I exchanged email with a friend of my mother's who knew her from high school, and that, combined with my fatigue from yesterday and the digestive malaise I've had since last Friday pretty, much did me in for the day. Friday, if she were alive, my mom would be 77 years old. This is the first year since her death that I have thought of her so much in the week before her birthday. Usually it's a sharp, sudden pain on the day as I remember, but not this year. This year missing her is a constant ache. Over the past two years I have managed to let go almost all of my anger at her for giving up on life and leaving us. Me. Now when I think of her, I remember her in her prime with zest and spark and life. And a wicked sense of humor. I miss her.Tonight was the last steel and wood class, and I used it to clean up the welds on my couch table frame. I didn't do anything with the top as I have a plunge router at home and will use it to level the top and bottom and to route out a river that I can fill with the black inlace resin. I just didn't feel well enough to stay for all of class tonight, and Zaga had other things she wanted to do too. So, steel. I welded! Not well, not elegantly. But I welded! at the beginning of class I thought I'd be all hot and acetylene torch weld. But no, I used a mig welder and was perfectly happy with it.Tomorrow I am going to try to catch up a bit on the projects I let languish today. Honestly I can't believe I am so relaxed and casual given that I am both putting on and participating in an art fair in under six weeks. I have a feeling things are going to get more frantic in the weeks to come. But tomorrow I do three things. I can only do three things in a day, and tomorrow I will do three: create a student application for A Fair of the Art, put up the tombstones and last skeletons in the garden, and clean the kitchen and put away the laundry. There. I have some domestic goals. Now I have an eyelids-closed goal as I so often do at this hour of the night."},
{"title": "Formula One at Circuit of the Americas", "date": "Sunday, October 22, 2017", "text": "Lewis Hamilton wins his 4th Austin F1 in five years.I am sooo sunburned! It was cloudy this morning, but I meant to put on sunscreen anyway because I knew the sun would come out, and we would be sitting on the grass at Turn 19 of Circuit of the Americas watching the Formula One cars go round and round the track all afternoon. I forgot, it did, and we did. Now I'm lobsterfied. So how was the race? I'm glad you asked. It was a social scientist's wet dream. There was the golf crowd, east side Hispanics, tech folk, yuppie families, women standing and breast feeding two-year-olds*, hippies, middle aged British women**, rednecks and the hunting crowd***, and foreign nationals (including pasty white Chinese students who probably qualified in both the geek and foreign groups). It was, in short, the perfect steamy, packed, boisterous, jubilant blend of Austin society.The prices were higher than Cirque du Soleil and _everyone_ was buying merch! The cheapest tickets--the one-day lawn seats (bring your own seat)--were $109 each. Corn dogs were $10 each. lemonade was $6, water was $4. Budweiser was $9, French fries were $7 and the lines went on forever. Baseball caps were $30 as were the cheapest t-shirts--and they sold out of EVERYTHING! Jessie talked me into trying to buy her a Lewis Hamilton t-shirt (he won) but they were sold out of all sizes but XXL. And it wasn't just because he won. Everyone was running out of everything by the end of the day. As we were squished on the shuttle bus back to the parking lot, Dave had a $1,250 Gucci bag pressed up against his face belonging to the woman standing in front of him (we had seats--go us). It's no wonder Justin Timberlake played the concert last night and Stevie Wonder played tonight (the concerts were included in the day's tickets).It was Spectacular Spectacular, and once was enough for me. I can't help but think of all the tools and materials for one of my various hobbies that I could buy for $1,250 and some woman spent that on a bag whose material looked like cheap vinyl. Unbelievable. But the important thing was that Jessie enjoyed herself immensely. As we rode the shuttle past the various expensive-ticket parking lots she pointed out the cars to me: Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche. It was amazing how she could identify them so quickly and confidently from a quick glance out the shuttle bus window. She also said she would like to be a race driver--or a stunt driver--but she still has no interest in driving a regular car on regular roads. Too boring. She also wonders how the drivers can bear to drive normally after racing.For me, I'm glad I'm home. I'm glad Dan and Zaga are home (I gave them a tour of the haunted botanical garden in the dark when we got back from the race). I'm glad tomorrow night is my last wood and steel class and I will finish my table. I'm glad the week ahead has fewer deadlines and lots of fun projects on tap (more on A Fair of the Art, and McCallum Secret Pal Gifts to name two). And I'm glad for my post-race Negroni. And I'm not even going to bed now! I'm going to curl up with a new friend's good book (Meredith Rose is a steampunk young adult novelist and she's also the designer of the poster for A Fair of the Art and her daughter is in the Cinematic Arts program with Jessie). This new friend thing is very cool and unexpected.Goodnight from the Formula One Capital of America!*okay, only one of these.**okay, only one of these too.***we didn't actually see any of these that we know of, but we heard about them attending from our horrible contractor (who was in the redneck hunting group)."},

It was a normal 8:00 am day. So I worked on docs until my eyes (almost) bled, and then I napped.Tomorrow is the Formula One United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas, and for my sins, I am apparently spending the day there. Jessie's birthday is in a couple of weeks and all she wanted for it was to go to the race. So tomorrow morning we load up the folding chairs, lots of battery-powered devices, and my knitting and we go off to watch cars go round and round in circles for several hours.

I put together the crib I borrowed from Bryon and Vanessa, and I set out a cute little arrangement of Tassimo coffees and teas, and a vase of flowers from the garden. I turned two twin beds into a king, and fluffed freshly laundered towels. I hope they enjoy their stay and write us a good review.Today is also the first major push getting the Halloween decorations put up. There is a ghostly woman, a grim reaper, three large human skeletons, the tyrannosaurus rex skeleton from a previous post, and a bunch of bat, cat, rat, crow, vulture, and snake skeletons--even an alligator skull floating in the pond. There are also a bunch of gravestones and some cool lanterns to turn the botanical garden into a ghostly fright-land. I really like the rat skeletons.Jessie helped and put almost everything into place for me, I just have to install it all (anchor it to keep it from blowing away in the wind) and put up the lanterns. Too bad I can't set them up to turn on and off automatically.

The weather alone makes me happier than anyone has any right to be. I was able to examine all the beehives today without sweating more than, oh, a quart or so. And it looks like I'll even end up with honey from one of the hives. I wasn't anticipating getting any honey at all this year so that will be pretty cool.I didn't get the Halloween decorations up today--have to do them tomorrow. Also didn't get to put the finishing touches on the apartment (like take the cardboard off the stairs leading up to it or pick up the loaner crib from Vanessa) so those will also be tomorrow.

Dave has an off-site tomorrow and I have a piano lesson followed by ceramics. It's time to get back into life. I think I said that a day or two ago. But, wow. Two weeks to wrangle over 40 artists into applying for a first-year festival during the holiday season. Sure, we're the only game in town that weekend, but artists are worried about having enough inventory for multiple shows so are hesitant to apply. So tomorrow I'll assign a bunch of stuff and then step back.

I still have to clean up my welds next week and to decide how to finish the metal (it's raw steel so if I leave it as it is, it will rust). I've already cleaned up my previous welds a lot so they are all bright, shiny silver color--not the dark grey of the surrounding unpolished steel--so I don't think a clear coat would look nice with the contrast of the surfaces. However I'm not thrilled about painting it black either. But maybe I can find a a dark greyish brown that would look nice.I also haven't decided how to finish the wood. I have a bit more sanding to do, but first I think I'll fill in the holes with the black resin. I also have to decide whether I want to route a design into the top and fill it with glass, steel, resin, or wood inlay. I most likely won't have time to do any of that in class next week, but that's okay as I have my own router and orbital sander to finish it up at home.I spent today inviting artists to apply to A Fair of the Art and contacting guilds and art groups to share our application with their members. Tomorrow night is our meeting to assign tasks and I am really looking forward to handing the marketing--including twitter and Facebook--off to other people. I hope the posters are finished as I would like to distribute them tomorrow night too so other people can deliver them.Tomorrow day I want to be outdoors a good part of the day. I have the Halloween decorations to install in the botanical garden. The tyrannosaurus rex will be joined by a bunch of other skeletons and a graveyard full of tombstones--I am going to try to get Zaga to help. We should also look at our bees. It was so beautiful out today (high of 72  or so and breezy) that it was a sin to stay indoors working on the computer. Tomorrow outside for sure!Yesterday Zaga and I took most of our dogs to the dog park (Baxter stayed home) and at the end she bathed Jig and I bathed Gallifrey. They have the coolest stands for washing your dogs at the dog park! The dog walks up a ramp, you tie its leash to a post, and then you wash your dog without having to bend way over.

I put in for a call-back when my place in the queue came up and went ahead and booked a ticket with my miles to get in at midnight tonight. When the agent called me back two hours later he cancelled my new ticket, changed the departure time of my old ticket to today's flight, got me Delta Comfort seats (which I had been unable to do), refunded the $6 charge I paid for the ticket, AND GAVE ME BACK 2500 MILES FROM THE ORIGINAL TICKET!So now I am packed and waiting for the shuttle to take me on the first leg of my journey back to my sweeties. It's a beautiful warm fall day, and I'm listening to Bob Dylan playing from the speakers belonging to the University of Tennessee art student sitting next to me working on the chalk drawing for the dinner menu board. We're discussing American music from Johnny Cash to Roy Orbison and the Traveling Wilburys to Townes Van Zandt.I am exhausted and brain dead (and NOT [entirely] because of last night's drinking!), and ready to be home. I met some people I would like to stay in touch with and see again, and I met some people I could do without. \"Yes\". \"Right\". \"Okay\". \"Uh huh\",  like every comment the instructor made was to her personally. And maybe she thought it was as she had already taken several classes with him. I was okay until 2:55 pm when I was working on my big piece and asked if anyone still have blue glue out as everyone (else) had been cleaning up and putting tools and things away since 2:00. The talker said, \"You shouldn't be doing that because the instructor wants to turn the kilns off at 3:00\"... Our class was scheduled until 5:00, and the instructor said this morning that we could work until 4:00 then clean up from 4-5. I communicated that information to her, but by then I was so rattled by her admonishment and the bustling cleaning of everyone around me that I lost track of what I was doing and messed up my magnum opus for the week. Yes, my fatigue certainly contributed, but I felt rushed and pressured to finish because everyone else wanted to be done, and I let myself get caught up in their drama. After my firing failure (overfired and fallen wires), instead of doing anything more--even grinding or polishing--I just packed everything up and left.Whatever, shake it off. I'll remember the good parts of the week and let the rest go. Now it's time to go home and wake up tomorrow morning with my honey on our 22nd wedding anniversary. I do love me that man."},

It's 11:50 pm EST and I am just now posting so clearly the evening took a different turn. Let me explain.There was an opening reception for an artist in the main building at Arrowmont tonight. I meant to drop in, but I was busy working. However one of the Arrowmont staff came through our studio towards the end of the show carrying three bottles of wine that were clearly surplus to requirements for the show, and he offhandedly asked if any of us wanted a glass of wine. When some of us said yes, he replied to go to the opening. I asked him if instead I could buy one of the bottles of wine from him. Emily and I already had plans to run out for a bottle of wine right after we finished in the studio before dinner (instead of dinner for me), and scoring a bottle from him would be even better! He replied that if we wouldn't drink it in the studio (against the rules) he would give me one. I agreed, and he gave me a very decent bottle of cabernet sauvignon. Woot!p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 6.0px; line-height: 20.0px; font: 12.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #000000; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)}I ended up staying in the studio till about 8:30 when Emily and I left and came back to the lounge of my dorm to drink the wine. We polished it off over stories of old boyfriends and life, and then Judy joined us. She brought out her bottle of applejack, and we just kept right on going. What a wonderful night! I could have been 20 something, I could have been 30 something, (I couldn't have been 40 something because there was clearly something wrong with me when I was in my forties--I blame Atlanta), but I am 50 something and the experience was timeless.Now it's almost midnight on the night before the last day (a short day) of class. It has been a good experience: I have learned a lot as Ricky Frank is (after 40 years of honing his craft) a font of knowledge. I'm not ready to go home yet, but I will be after tomorrow. I'll finish up my last few projects (I've already shopped for tools and materials), and have one more evening with my new friends, and then after far too little sleep, I'll be catching the 4 am shuttle on Saturday morning to head home to my sweeties.

Those who have a passing acquaintance with me could probably guess that I'm going for a BIG project in my enameling class. It's based on the leaf drawing shown, and I began tonight by starting the process of rolling my own silver foil from sheets of 22 gauge fine silver. I will roll them, texture them, flash them (heat them to bright silver with a torch without burning through them), and then cut one of them into the leaf shape to add to my base. I have an heir and a spare--mostly because I want to roll them finer than the rolling mill will go so I'm doing two (and sheets of paper between and on top and bottom) at a time.Before I attach the leaf (in foil, not leaf ;-) to the base, I'll prep the base with black enamel and silver leaf (not a leaf shape). Then I'll do a color wash over the leaf (the foil) and follow it up by attaching the silver leaf leaf to the base (whew!). Next come the cloisonné wires, followed by the color layering on the leaf. It's a pretty ambitious project, and I hope to bezel-set it in sterling and make a cloak pin out of it when it's done. I have two days of class let.Z is for...Here's what I've done so far--some of the pieces are color samples, some are in-process, and some are finished cloisonné.

I spent the morning bending wires and then in the afternoon I took prepped domed ovals (they already had white enamel on the front and counter enamel--the balance enamel--on the back) and added gold and silver leaf, fine silver cloisonné wire, and black enamel to them. Finally after dinner tonight I started adding color to them and I finished three before finally coming back to my room at 11:00. I say finished because I have finished firing them. They still need to be ground and polished.I have to be up early in the morning, whether I want to or not, because the bathroom for my floor in the dorm is right across the hall from my room. The door is left open, so as all the perky (loud) morning people are in the getting ready it sounds like a barnyard at feeding time. They're really nice women, but, sheesh!

Class started at 9:00 this morning, and with the exception of a break for lunch and a break for dinner I went until 9:30 tonight. Ricky Frank is a very laid-back instructor who wants us to internalize what we're doing and why so we aren't moving fast (this isn't a whip-out-as-many-pieces as you can and push to your limit kind of class). But fast or slow doesn't matter when you get into the 12-hour range.It is also very humbling to be starting something brand new and to have to suck at it just like every other beginner. Sure I work with glass all the time, and enamel is glass, but it's also metal. And it's glass in a super-color-saturated form. Between the intensity of the color, and the way the glass and the metal behave together during firing, I am having to learn a whole bunch of new principles.The cloisonné wire looked so big up on the monitor when he was demonstrating, and of course he just whipped it around into perfect shapes with walls perpendicular to the base. When I was mangling it with my tweezers and my ginormous sausage hands (everyone has ginormous sausage hands in comparison to the wire size), it wasn't easy AT ALL. I managed--after three tries--to get two wires embedded into the enamel on the top of one slightly domed piece. I should have reiterated I mangled after three tries to get two wires embedded...But I ended the day with several prepped pieces (white enamel on the front and a counter layer on the back of copper discs), a red color tile, a prepped piece with cloisonné wire embedded in it ready for enameling tomorrow, a black and white piece for illustrating contrast, and a couple of pieces with transparent enamels on silver foil to try blending.

{"title": "Gatlinburg Day 1", "date": "Sunday, October 08, 2017", "text": "On the campus at ArrowmontIn the movie The Ref (one of my two favorite movies of all time), Dennis Leary looks at Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis and says, \"I'm in hell. Connecticut is the fifth circle of hell.\" Clearly he has never been to Gatlinburg. But Gatlinburg is not the fifth circle of hell (anger). Gatlinburg is an unnamed later-stage circle. I looked up the top ten favorite activities for visitors here and five of them take place in distilleries or wineries. I'm not sure what people who come here for vacation do other than drink and shop. And eat. Moonshine and candy are the staple comestibles. Pancakes are also big, going by the line outside the Pancake Pantry. In the rain.But there is another side of Gatlinburg: a thriving arts community driven by Arrowmont School of the Arts, which was founded in 1912 by the national women's organization Pi Beta Phi as the first public school in the area. It is a nationally renowned arts and crafts school which hosts week-long workshops March through November. The beautiful campus is tucked into lush woods--we were warned to keep a lock-out for bears on the grounds--which nonetheless is right in the middle of Gatlinburg! There is a rich history of cottage crafts in the area--especially pottery which holds two of the top-ten spots of things to do in Gatlinburg. The juxtaposition of beautiful handcrafts and whiskey distilleries is jarring, and unfortunately it looks like the distilleries are getting the lion's share of the tourist dollars.Fall here is incredibly beautiful--maybe even more so today in the rain where the colors are shiny and vibrant. The mist in the Smokey Mountains and the rain make me want to settle in front of a fire with my spinning wheel (even though it's 72 degrees out). Were it not for the very commercial, touristy downtown and the people who flock to it, this place would be paradise. But it takes all kinds, and I need to be more tolerant. So what if most of the people I passed on the street today probably voted for Trump and still think that was a good idea."},

Usually I don't like to travel because I don't like people, and traveling people irritate me more than most other people. But today I slept on the plane, had a good, leisurely, lunch in Atlanta (airport), and had a perfectly lovely chat with another woman on the shuttle from the Knoxville airport to Arrowmont School of the Arts in Gatlinburg. I'm not sure why I came in today because registration isn't until tomorrow and class starts Monday. But I'll use the time to spin, work on my website, work on the Fair of the Art website, and start contacting artists about participating. I think there are a couple of other people in the dorm where I'm staying, but I haven't seen anyone. It also looks like I don't have a roommate so I don't need to go out tomorrow and buy jammies (what a thing to forget to pack).I also spent over an hour and a half on the phone tonight with another parent in the cinematic arts program. At first we were talking about the Fair of the Art. But then we got to chatting about our daughters, the program, filmmaking in Austin, networking, college, and then all the things we have in common. I think I have a new friend! Making friends is hard for me these days, what with the whole not-liking-people thing.  But now I might have two! One a year is not a bad number...Now, like almost every night as I write my post, I am tired. Sitting in a plane, car, bus, and train all day was surprisingly exhausting. Maybe it was having to be around a whole bunch of people (Get Off My Lawn!). Off to sleep in my little dorm bed and dream of, oh, something pleasant."},

I even tried it out by applying myself. :-)Today wasn't all about the web, however. Zaga and I started the day by doing hive maintenance on all of our beehives. We both got stung. Mine was when a bee climbed up under the cuff of my pant leg, got to my knee, and stung me. Zaga's was after she was out of her suit watching me when she swatted a bee in her hair and ended up smashing it to her head.

{"title": "A New Art Hat", "date": "Thursday, October 05, 2017", "text": "Last night I went to the booster club meeting for the cinematic arts program at McCallum High School. The school is part of the Austin Independent School District (public school), but they are also a fine arts academy and students can graduate with a major--in Jessie's case it will be film. The major programs are four years long and in addition to the regular requirements for graduation from the state. This isn't the only high school with a film program in Austin--you practically can't swing a dead cat without running into a high school with a film program. But McCallum is the only school with fine arts majors, and kids from all over the city apply and jury into the programs. Even though we are districted for the school, Jessie still applied and was accepted This program was the reason we had to buy a house in Austin before we were ready to move from Atlanta--we had to be in the district in order for Jessie to be able to apply.As you can imagine, equipment costs for a program like this are pretty high, and public school budgets are not. So it is a reality of life for all of the different fine arts programs at McCallum that they have to do a lot of fundraising. Enter the parent booster clubs. Last year we didn't really do anything, and the program suffered. We raised half what they usually raise and then the budget from the school district was cut in half this year. Both of these hits have left us needing to almost double the amount of money we bring in from fundraising this year. So we met last night to kick ideas around, Both of the previous events we've sponsored--a teacher's pageant and a student talent show--seem to have run their course and no one's interested in participating in them this year. We need something new and dynamic.I said, how about an auction to which the program director replied, how about a holiday artist market. Oh if only one of the parents was an artist with 30 years of art show experience... Oh, wait! So yours truly is in charge of A Fair of the Art (I love acquiring domains), sponsored by the McCallum Cinematic Arts program. It will be Saturday and Sunday, December 2-3 in the McCallum cafeteria with 10X10 and 5X10 spaces available, and the halls outside the cafeteria will have student tables. Heck, we're a fine arts high school. What better place to find fine art?I spent the day at the school today and drew up the booth plan. I also mapped out nearby churches to see if any of them are also having a holiday fair that weekend. If there are a few, we could go in together and make a map of the neighborhood festivals and publicize them together. Tomorrow I put together the initial website and the Call For Artists which needs to go out asap.Working in our favor, it seems likes the biggest neighborhood holiday art fair--The Violet Crown Arts Festival at Brentwood Elementary--won't be happening this year and they had 69 artists last year. I'm going to send out email to all of them tomorrow too to see if they might be interested in doing our festival instead.Todd was saying he wanted to do an art fair. Well, here we go!"},

She said she has heard me say I was busy or I was tired, but she said she had no idea what I really did. For a bit of context, before going to Jo Ann Fabrics I been at a booster club meeting for the Cinematic Arts program for her school and was driving her home because she stayed after to do some work. I had then treated her to a fast food dinner (Dave made fettucine alfredo and seared scallops with garlic bread for dinner tonight, but she really wanted chicken nuggets...) before going to Jo Ann. We left Jo Ann for HEB so I could pick up her prescription which I had just called in. So what do I do...glazed bowl going in to fireI was rather dumbfounded by the question actually and wondered if that was how mothers who worked in the home instead of in an outside company felt. Had I not been feeling pretty self-confident and worthwhile today, I might have been crushed. But for the first time comparing what I do to, oh, say, what Dave does during a day (coding, the occasional meeting, more coding), I didn't feel like what I do is less in any way, shape or form. I hit the ground running at 7:20 this morning and didn't get home and put tools down until 8:20 tonight. Wednesdays have been like that lately.Spinning with PavlovaPart of why I felt good about what I do is that it _finally_ got through my head that Dave spends every day doing what he loves. Sure, there are some things he has to do that he's not thrilled with, but I clean the cat box every day too. I fill out benefits paperwork and pay bills. I fix our well system when it stops producing water. I also get to spin, make pottery, play with wood and steel, sew shirts, make glass, make jewelry, weave, and donate my time to support Jessie's teachers and the fine arts program at her school. The ONLY difference between what I do and what Dave does is that he gets paid money for his activities, and I (mostly) do not. But we both get paid in satisfaction, and I don't think I am any less satisfied with my life than he is with his.wood and steel tableI do not do what I do with any less passion. I move through my day with  grace, verve, and poetry. I do not sit around smoking, watching daytime soaps, eating bon-bons, or nappping all day. I do not lounge in a hammock and read all day. I immerse myself completely in the activities I do--be they gardening or tending bees or whatever--and they are almost all aimed at making someone's life more beautiful and/or comfortable. Making someone--sometimes just myself--happy. I can live with that. I can feel strong about and proud of that.Dave's birthday shirtsI guess I would feel bad--and maybe do something different (like get a 9-5 job)--if Dave hated what he was doing and only did it to bring in a paycheck. I would have to step up and do my part to support the family even if it meant working at the Container Store or the HEB deli counter. But in our mid 50's, that isn't Dave's and my life. We are both extraordinarily lucky to be able to do what we love every single day. And that's what I need to be teaching Jessie. It isn't that you get paid for what you do, it's that you do what you love. Life is worthwhile every day if you are living it fully. If you are working now to save money so you can live and enjoy life later... that's a waste."},
{"title": "Halloween Impends", "date": "Tuesday, October 03, 2017", "text": "It's raining again. I hope Dan and Zaga made it home (across the garden) before it started. They came over tonight for some of the luscious lemon cake that Zaga made for Dave for his birthday. While they were here, Zaga brought up the idea of decorating the Botanical Garden for Halloween and maybe having a party out there...Oh I have been lusting after the 8 ft tyrannosaurus rex skeleton with the red led eyes at Home Depot, but with no trick or treaters on our street, there didn't seem to be any point in decorating. But we have at least two neighbors with small children who regularly visit the garden to see the fish and the frogs, why not to see the Halloween decorations? And why not have a party and invite our friends and neighbors?Jessie told me yesterday that Halloween is her favorite holiday and she has been sad that we don't decorate here (we did sporadically in Atlanta). Now Zaga said tonight that she loves Halloween best too. I think it's a sign. We could put out food, have a fire pit, have a big cauldron of punch with fog (dry ice) and floating (plastic) eyeballs in it. Oh this could be so much fun!! As I was looking at outdoor decorations online tonight I came across this incredible 9 ft wide spider at Home Depot that has posable legs, six light-up eyes, and makes hissing sounds. The only downside is that if I put it in the yard, Jessie would never come home. She would be totally freaked out and terrified by it. House rule: No spiders. Of any kind. I was going to get one small spider skeleton from Jo Ann Fabrics, and Crafts and she lost it over that one. Too Bad--the Home Depot spider would be SUPER scary!Zaga, if you read this, Jessie wants me to make sure you understand that if we do decorate the garden there can be NO spiders. Now to see what Dave thinks."},

After all, I still have something to say about learning as an old(er) person, today was the first day of Spinzilla, and I had a wood and steel class tonight where I used a bandsaw, a spiffy tablesaw, a belt sander, an orbital sander, a mig welder, a metal chop saw, and a right-angle grinder. In spite of all of that--or maybe because of it--I am freshly home from a post-class dinner with my spouse and I am too tired to elucidate. Good thing I'm having all these vitamin B12 shots which boost my energy. I can't imagine how I'd be feeling without them!One thing I will quickly write about is the bill I received from Travis County EMS for the ambulance ride from urgent care to the hospital. First, it's run by the county and so is a government agency--I assume somewhat paid for by our property taxes, but maybe not. Second, they didn't even turn the siren on. Yeah, they pumped me full of pain meds, but those aren't really expensive. Nevertheless, this bill epitomizes what is wrong with healthcare and the insurance industry in our country. The bill for a 12 mile ride in an ambulance with the siren off billed through a government agency was $1,061. I kid you not. When I was at urgent care for the whole kidney stone mess this summer (having driven myself there), there was no way I could have driven myself to the hospital. I was incoherent with pain by then. So urgent care called the EMS, and they came and took me to the hospital--for $1,000. How did we get to this point?!? I can see a couple of hundred dollars, sure. They pay the EMS techs, they have to pay for the equipment, but $1,000 for 20 minutes and 12 miles? (Which they could have covered faster if they had put the siren on.) It just blows my mind.Next time I'll take a hydrocodone and call Uber."},

And now that Dave has opened all his presents, I can write about the seven Hawaiian shirts I made him for his birthday. I picked the number seven because there was no way I could do 52 (I don't even have that much shirt fabric) and seven is the square root (rounded) of his age. He's a geek, it was a good choice.Last time I made him shirts for his birthday I made 37 for his 37th. Those shirts (that are still intact) are now all super soft and worn out. All you have to do is look at them wrong and they'll rip. But we're not going to throw them out. I am deciding between weaving them into rag rugs or sewing them into a quilt. I think I'll do an art quilt out of the leftover scraps from all the shirts as the fabric will be stronger and will hold up.Then I can make rag rugs from the actual shirts as it won't matter of they are soft and worn--they'll feel amazing on the feet. Or maybe I'll take one square from each of the shirts and make quilt blocks from the squares and some additional fabric (maybe more scraps), and then make rugs from the leftover material. Joy of the \"and\" Dave would say.Whatever I do with the old shirts, as I make new ones Dave is swapping out the old ones in the closet with the new. Right now he has eight new ones from me and one from his parents. I didn't manage to finish all the new ones in time for his birthday as I could only work on them when he wasn't home. So I finished up everything but the buttons and buttonholes last night before he got home from work. After he opened presents today, I did all the buttonholes and some of the buttons, and tonight while watching Jackie Brown I sewed on the last of the buttons.Now I'm too full of the wonderful lemon curd cake Zaga made for Dave for his birthday to post more. I'm going to waddle off to bed and collapse in a sugar coma. That cake was incredibly, deliciously intense!"},

Yesterday's post was boring because Dave's birthday is tomorrow and I spent all day yesterday on his present, and because it was his present and he reads my blog, I couldn't write about it. So I wrote something BORING. I spent all day today on his present too, and I Did Not Finish! But I am close enough that I can wing it tomorrow and he will be thrilled. So why, you might ask, am I writing about it now? I couldn't take not writing about it so I asked Dave not to read my post till tomorrow night. Even though he promised, I am kind of writing on code now just in case he peeks (he would NEVER peek).I love surprises. I think I love surprising other people best of all. All the time I am working on the surprise, I am thinking of how surprised the person I am surprising will be. And I chortle. I rub my hands together and chortle from glee at the existence and the imminence of the surprise. When I have the advance time to plan and execute, Dave's birthday is probably my favorite day of the year. This year I planned and I executed, and there is one hell of a present (a present squared--or is it the _square root_ of a present?) coming tomorrow. Heh. Tomorrow's surprise is colorful and sumptuous and perfect. I even have the perfect packaging for it that will keep him for having ANY idea what it could possibly be.Tonight, however, is now, and it came at the end of today. Today was rainy and grey outside, but full of happy anticipation inside because, again, working on the surprise. Today was also the day the new sectional was delivered. I am sitting and posting on it now, and I am so happy because it is tall and it supports my back! The old sectional (which was my Mom's in Montana before it was ours, and then it was ours in Atlanta before it was ours here) was soft and comfy and felt great when you first sank into it. But then your back would start to hurt, and your legs would fall asleep from the lack of support it provided, and you could barely walk when you stood up. I like this one soooo much better! The old one is being picked up by the Salvation Army in the next week, and I hope someone else (with a better back) likes it a lot.Now off to bed so I can get up early in the morning to wrap presents!"},

Now it's only 8:42, and I'm tired to the bone. (Yet another post about my fatigue! How refreshing! Not.) The month winds to a close with nary a word from our lawyer, which means (probably) that the contractor never responded to the letter the lawyer sent to him on our behalf. I guess I am just going to have to put that chapter behind me and move on--a bit less trusting, a bit more wary, and a bit more cynical. But maybe that's what it means to grow up.I started to write a self-pitying whiny rant here about trying to help people and just getting screwed for my trouble, but it wouldn't be worth the time and digital ink with which it would be written. So, instead: Spinzilla! Let us talk of happier things like gearing up for a week of nothing but... very little but... well MOSTLY spinning! There will still be wood and steel, there will still be piano and ceramics, but mostly there will be spinning. I am going to finish the mash-up yarn I started earlier in the summer so I can finish knitting my coat with it for NaKniSweMo (NoKniCoMo for moi).Tonight found me searching the Internet for public domain video footage for my child to use in her experimental film project. (This was after driving her around yesterday for several hours so she could film.) She said she had looked and had only found places (like CNN) that wanted money to license footage. I found about eight short films for her with subjects ranging from the Hindenburg exploding and atomic bomb testing to the great San Francisco earthquake. Sometimes I worry that I do too much of her work and am concerned that she won't learn to do things for herself. But then I remember my Mom who typed my papers, took me to the library so I could check out reference books, got me pills from the pharmacy where she worked so I could glue them onto poster board for my sixth-grade science project, and did a score of other things to help me with my homework. And I know I'm spot on with Jessie. I can't wait to see the two-minute film she comes up with! Now to see if she can get the rights to use the music she wants for it. I'll be getting up at 4:00 and calling the record label in London to find out how."},

I went from a piano lesson at 8:00 to ceramics where I unsuccessfully threw nine bowls. The only thing I succeeded at there was trimming and pulling a handle for a mug I threw last week. After ceramics was a run to Woodcrafters to see about a hand plane for the table top from Monday's wood and steel class. Turns out that's not the right tool for the application--I need to use a belt sander after all. But I did get some good-looking inlay resin and stone material made by Inlace.When I got home I had just enough time for a quick bowl of tortilla soup and the last of the incredible Cheez Whiz ribeye sandwich filling over tater tots. Dave came home early, we kissed in passing, and I was off to get Jessie for the biggest activity of the day: taking her to film footage for her experimental film which is due Friday. Don't you love kids? Right before the deadline they tell you they need something from you. Something which requires a lot of time or money or both. I guess I got off lightly this time as it only cost me five hours of time and money for gas (and McDonald's for her for dinner).I picked her up from school at 4:00 and we headed to a friend's ranch so she could get footage of his zebra... I kid you not. Footage of the zebra turned into footage of the cows who swarmed our car when we arrived (have you ever seen a swarm of cows? I'm from Montana and it was still a bit unnerving), footage of the miniature donkeys Sebastian and Benjamin, footage of the zebra Gabriel, and footage of Andrew using his flamethrower... Jessie was ecstatic--especially when he let her use it. I don't think Gabriel, Sebastian or Benjamin were too thrilled--they scarpered off as soon as he brought it out.After much fun with Andrew we headed down to South Congress to get more footage of the lights, the rain, and... cowboy boots. I wish I had lower arches as I CANNOT wear Old Gringo boots--in spite of the fact that I am definitely an old gringo. The ankles are just too tight and I can't bend my feet enough to squeeze through them. Jessie, however, had no such problems and was pretty sporty in my favorite pair: the Day of the Dead boots in red and black. We closed down Allen's boot shop and drove home in the rain.When we arrived home I booted Jessie out of the car and waited for her place to be taken by Dave. I then whisked him off to a romantic late supper at Hanabi where we had Udon and Tempura (and hot sake--don't forget the hot sake) inspired by the rainy, cool (relative terms) weather.Now we're home, I'm posting, and Dave's having Alexa play All Your Favorite Bands by Dawes on Spotify for me. He's ready to take up guitar again and this is the song he wants to start with. This is a life, a good life. May all your favorite bands stay together."},

No, the best part of Monday right now is the meal my spouse has waiting for me after I get home from my wood and steel class at the Art School at Laguna Gloria. Tonight was the most incredible Philadelphia cheese steak sandwich made with ribeye steak and, wait for it, Cheese Whiz. Accompanied by tater tots. And wine. OMG. Dave said if he hadn't trusted the serious foodies so much he would have just used provolone and been done with it (he is not a cheese whiz kind of guy--Velveeta either) but he went it, and it was the best sandwich I have ever had. We didn't even begin to make it through the tater tots so I told Dave to save them with the extra sandwich fillings on top for me for lunch tomorrow. He thought that sounded like a particularly1960's housewife stroganoff recipe and now we have another meal to try!My table top after biscuit joining,gluing and clamping.The second best thing about today was the steel and wood class. Tonight was amazing. Zaga thinks I am too hard on the instructor, but I'm pretty sure tonight went as well as it did because we came prepared with materials and a plan of what we wanted to do. I said to the instructor that we wanted to use the planer, and he showed us how. Then I asked about finishing the edges (jointer vs table saw) and he trimmed the sides of the boards for us (he didn't want us to use the table saw on salvaged wood). Finally, I said we'd like to use the biscuit joiner and glue to put together the pieces of the top. He taught us how and we glued up our table tops. Had we just gone into the class and expected to be, oh, taught something or led to do something to learn something, it never would have happened... But maybe I'm just being bitchy. Whatever. He has great knowledge and he's good at sharing it (I learned three new tools tonight, after all), but putting together a curriculum and teaching something from point A to point B... not so much.The wood for our projects was the salvaged deck wood from the little deck off the sunroom, and it was grey and rotted and gnarly. After we planed it and trimmed the sides, it was sleek, sensuous, and silky. Sure, it has holes from where the screws were taken out, and knots and splits and some areas that are rotted through. But it's redwood and it is remarkably resilient. And rich. And sumptuous. And beautiful. I am going to love this table! I can see making one for each of us and using them so we can all eat dinner on the sectional while watching tv. Oh hedon, thy name is Brenda!"},

He used pressure-treated 2X6's for the decking and now we'll let them dry and weather for a year before we sand and stain them. As he was showing me the deck he pointed out the pile of deck boards that he had taken off, and they were neither cedar nor pine--they were redwood! Almost all of the were rotted in one place or another, but there were definitely some parts of just about every board that could be salvaged and would make a nice table top if they were sanded or planed and cut down. Zaga and I are going to go through the pile tomorrow to pull out what we can use. Then we'll cut it into even pieces and get the last rusted screws out. I thought about cutting the screws flush and leaving them in as points of interest in the finished table top, but that wouldn't be a good idea if I wanted to run the boards through the planer.The piece I want to do is a couch end table that becomes a lap desk/table when turned sideways over the arm of the couch. Something like the two shown here. My current end-of-the-couch furniture is a cabinet whose door fell off. The shelves are not accessible from the couch side so it's really just a side table when I'm on the couch. What I'd like to build is something that has accessible storage for spinning and knitting tools, a dedicated place for the remote controls, a built-in charging station, and which still swings over the arm of the couch for immediate, easy access. We'll see what I come up with tomorrow as I design it.Current end tableIt might also be nice to use some of the old decking for furniture for the new deck. I'm not up to making chairs just yet, but maybe a table, a bench and some planters. One way or another I'm going to save as much of the old wood as I can. There is absolutely no point in sending it to a landfill. The framing boards from underneath were in really good shape, but they had to be replaced as we changed the profile of the deck. They are 2X8's, though I'm not sure of what wood, and I'll be using them in something too.Between the cedar trunks and limbs that the contractor cut this summer which are still lying in a pile in the yard and the old deck boards I can feel the beginning of wood hoarding coming on. However I am going to approach it just like I do with yarn and fabric now: What I have must be used in projects before I get more. Considering that I have a lot of outdoor furniture to build for the botanical garden and the various decks, I don't think that will be too hard."},

Costco had the top-ranked system (Arlo by NetGear) on sale so I got a set of three. They are completely wireless (including power) and incredibly easy to install. Now we'll see how they do longterm. The images are great--even the night vision IR ones shown here. So far I have three, but as easy as they are, I think I'll add 3-4 more.Back deckThis morning I exchanged some texts with a friend and when she asked me how I was, I said slower. That's the honest truth, and I just have to learn to accept it. I want to go and go and go (the spirit is willing), but after a few hours, I poop out (the body is not). This morning I managed to install the cameras, do a bit of work on another project, and practice piano. Then, somehow, it was time to go to Lego Ninjago. Eh.ApartmentFortunately when we got home, Repo Man was waiting for us. We had been wanting to watch it in honor of the life and work of Harry Dean Stanton who died a week ago. It's a movie that's definitely held up and was perfect for washing the taste of Ninjago out of my mind--that one was strictly for kids. I should've known we were in for it when the first preview shown before the movie was for the upcoming My Little Pony the Movie, which appears to have nary a smidge of irony in it. I was left wondering why it's coming to the big screen at all. The only movie previewed that I had ANY interest in is Jumangi, and it'll be a tough sell for the spouse."},

I was feeling pretty confident about half way through the time because I thought we were halfway through the puzzles. Turns out we were about 20% through, and with the two of us it would have taken us easily two hours to do it with no hints--and there's no guarantee we would have made it even then. It's a fascinating business model and the room was really intricate in the way it presents information. I feel like I'm being really coy, but I'm not even going to give a hint of what you do in there because anyone who is here in Austin and has the opportunity to do it really should. Now enough babbling. Going to take a picture and get to bed!"},

Dave and I both woke at 2:30 am and couldn't get back to sleep. Dave also has a cold so he's pretty miserable awake or asleep so he got up and never did go back to sleep. I read until 6:30 when I was finally able to get back to sleep. Of course falling back to sleep at 6:30 when workmen are coming at 8:30 is not very much time to sleep, and I dragged all day.Dave took the J to school and then came back home to the Nyquil and bed. I stayed up and puttered--feeling the day drag on interminably, but unable to kickstart myself into getting anything done. I did get in a kiln load and almost stopped before doing the last two pieces (which don't need to ship yet as I don't have the stands for them), but I decided to push on through the heat and humidity in the studio. (It was over 90 degrees and steamy in there today.) And I shouldn't have as I blew the layout on both pieces and have to remove the first layer and a half of glass and redo them tomorrow. Or Saturday. Or Monday.At the end of the day I dozed a little in the recliner (when did I become an old man?!) before Jessie got home. Poor J--she's coming down with the cold too and can't afford to miss any more school so she has to tough through it.Now Dave's in bed, I'm pretty sure Jessie's in bed even though she has homework, and I'm going to give in and go to bed too. Tomorrow morning I have a surprise activity planned for Zaga's birthday and then I'm taking her to lunch so I had better get some rest."},
{"title": "The Stages Of Learning a New Skill", "date": "Wednesday, September 20, 2017", "text": "Today was supposed to be a full ceramics day but I came home mid-afternoon to pay home bills and unsnarl my medical bills. *Sigh*. Paperwork just made me tired and aggravated, so back to ceramics!Whenever you attempt to learn a new skill you pass through a couple of distinct stages in the process. At first--no matter what you're learning--the teacher gives you instructions on how to do something, and you blindly follow them with no understanding of what they mean and no physical feeling of doing them correctly. Then comes the moment where your brain connects to whatever part of your body is trying to pick-up the new skill, e.g. your hands, and the brain remembers the instructions, and the hands know the feel of what they're supposed to do. Oh they probably can't do it yet, but they can feel where they're going. Or it could be your mouth as you pronounce a new language or sing a song. Whatever the body part is, the practice begins. You can feel your mistakes, and you frustratedly fumble around trying to overcome them. You get to the point where you can concentrate and will your body into a posture or series of actions to get the result you want. Eventually--if you practice enough--you get to the point where you don't think with your conscious mind anymore about doing anything, you just do it, and it flows as naturally as breathing.Today I had the moment while I was throwing the clay where I could feel both where it was and where it should be as I manipulated it. I could feel when I did something that was going to cause the piece to fail before it failed. I am still abysmal at correcting my errors and saving the piece, but I am on the path and can see what it will feel like to succeed.Now if I could just throw pieces with thick enough bottoms that they could be something other than flower pots."},
{"title": "Growing Old and Medicating", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2017", "text": "Another day has blown past me. I keep reciting my three-things-a-day mantra, but some days it's less effective than others. I don't even know what I got done today, but I know I decided against hormone replacement therapy (HRT). I am post-menopausal (TMI!!), and my new doctor was all rosy about HRT when she first mentioned it to me over a month ago. She touted it as the end all be all for obliterating hotflashes, preventing osteoporosis, decreasing the risk of some cancers, and keeping your skin and boobs taut. Who doesn't want taut skin and boobs I ask you? HRT is also linked to improving mood through increased serotonin and neurotransmittergamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production. An end to depression and anxiety? Sign me up!When I went in after my lab tests to see what my hormone levels were (and progesterone and estrogen were non-existent--I suppose that's normal for my age), I had an appointment with the PA as the doctor was on vacation for three weeks. The PA gave me a sheet of paper with the potential side effects of the medications and had me sign it. She didn't have any further information to offer me about HRT, and didn't say anything specific about my medical history that would argue for or against the treatment.But then I talked to Bill, who is also a doctor and who is someone I trust implicitly, and he wasn't wild about HRT and urged me to do more research and make my own decisions. My own research led me to the Mayo Clinic site and an article on HRT and heart disease. The clincher for me was at the end: \"If you already have heart disease or you have a history of blood clots, the risks of hormone therapy have been clearly shown to outweigh any potential benefits.\" Considering I went to see my current doctor right after an episode of extreme blood clots in my kidney, I was more than a little surprised that she thought HRT was a good idea for me. I can put up with hot flashes, saggier skin and boobs due to loss of collagen, and look for another solution to any possible osteoporosis issues. It will also be nice to not have the additional cancer risks associated with HRT. It's also time to find a new doctor. Again.I am not ready to go the route of the new trend in medical care--a boutique doctor who takes a limited number of patients, accepts only cash (no insurance), and has a membership fee that guarantees weekend and off-hour immediate access--but I am ready to make a change. Fortunately I met a very nice family physician at a clinic very near to us who is accepting new patients when I took Jessie in for dermatitis and allergies a couple of weeks ago. Now if I can just find her card..."},

I am going to miss seeing her, and I am even more resolved to get out west to see her either this fall or winter.Clearly I am not going to get through my list for the day, but I bet I can put in a kiln load and get my glass orders done, re-pot the orchids, buy my secret-pal back-to-school gifts, and take Zaga to the airport.

{"title": "What I Learn From My Child", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2017", "text": "Many (many) years ago I bought a greeting card that had a picture of a grinning (evil-looking, or was it just mischievous?) child on the face. The text read: \"Children keep you young\", with \"But first they make you very old.\" on the inside. Never were truer words written.My child is keeping me young right now with the music she introduces me too. Her latest offerings are from the album An Awesome Wave by a British group called alt-J. My J has an assignment to make an experimental film for her AV Production class (due in two weeks), and she would like to use one of the songs from the album in it. Part of the process of making the film is to obtain the rights to use any music you need for it. The film is to be shorter than the song she wants to use, nevertheless copyright will be strictly followed and permissions obtained, or the music won't be used. I really like her teacher. Now if I can just get her to get off her butt to see what she needs to do to obtain the rights.The music she has picked is very eclectic--it is not at all like anything you'd hear by Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry. In fact Jessie doesn't, in general, like female vocalists. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised at her current musical taste as she introduced her father and me to the spoken word poet and author Shane Koyczan when she was about 12. We were blown away by her mature taste back then. As with Koyczan's work, alt-J's music can be very disturbing--the videos for it even more so. (J hadn't seen any of the videos when I asked her.) At her age I liked the Beach Boys and read novels with women in ripped bodices draped over Fabio on the covers (remember the movie Romancing the Stone?). Jessie reads manga and listens to alt-J. I know who's cooler. I can't wait to see what she's like when she's my age."},
{"title": "Houston, We Have a Wood Shop!", "date": "Friday, September 15, 2017", "text": "Wood stash, horizontal wood and metal bandsaw, compound miter saw, shop vac, table saw.I'm not going to call it a studio--we have enough of those as it is and this new work area is something special. It's my manly cave. I can't have a man cave as I am missing some necessary parts requisite for membership in that club (borrowing Dave's doesn't count), but I can have a manly cave, and I do! I am not exaggerating about the caveness of the space: the room has no windows and no glass in the doors either. It's also under the house accessed from under the deck. The floor is concrete, the walls are stark white, and there is a window A/C unit sticking through a non-window in the wall to the outside. I replaced the A/C unit today for $139 and am using it to further dry the lumber. (Home Depot is having a thing where if you open a Home Depot card you can have $100 off your purchase. I already had a card, but the clerk told me you can have up to five so... Score)!Table saw (again), 14\" bandsaw, 6\" joiner, 10\" planer, wood stash (again)My carpenter, Craig, and his assistant Darren unloaded and set up all the equipment for me (I couldn't even lift half of it), and they also moved all the wood out of the trailer and stacked it to dry in the wood shop. As I looked at all the pieces as they came out of the trailer today I realized I have an extra slab and its accompanying cut-off. Each slab is eight feet long and has a four-foot cutoff. So I not only have the three slabs for the bed, one slab for the desk, and one cut-off for desk and bed shelving, but I also have an enormous slab for a new glass and wood dining room table with a cut-off for a leaf for it and three more cut-offs for tables! The one thing I don't have and expected is a 2 X 8 for the bed. I have the 2 X 10's, and the 4 x 4's, but not the one 2 X 8 I needed for the shelf behind the headboard. But never fear--I'll figure something out. Monday we learn to oxyacetylene weld and do our class designs, and I'm going to propose the desk even though it's so large I won't be able to take all the materials to class to work on it! I'll do the welding there and the shelves, but I'll do the top surface prep and the assembly back in the cave.In the above pictures I'm standing in the middle of the floor where the eventual workbench will go. Some of the equipment is on wheels or otherwise easy to move, some (like the bandsaw), not so much. I think I had a genius moment and put the bandsaw in front of one of the doors (the one I never open) so that if I have a long piece I can open the door and run it through unimpeded.Hobbies--and cool workspaces--are good."},
{"title": "Got Wood?", "date": "Thursday, September 14, 2017", "text": "Bubinga tabletop from Owl Hardwood LumberDeep breath in, deep breath out. No anxiety tonight, and that is good. It was also good to hear some innocuous news about butterflies and pottery from Ellen (comments on previous posts). Every time I think of her, I think of the slogging clean-up she's having to do after Hurricane Harvey and all I see is endless, smelly, gooey muck. Butterflies are better.Today Zaga and I did the inspections on the last two hives (all suited up of course) and it was a breeze. It was even a bit breezy and we HAD FUN! What a concept: Bees can be fun. This afternoon we searched for local hardwood emporiums where we could shop for materials for our steel and metal class (materials for her--I have a ton of blue pine to use for my desk and even a table or two). We went to two of the four I found--and one of those was a hardwood flooring supplier, not fine hardwood for furniture building so the trip was a bit of a bust. So far Woodcraft is the best we have seen, and Zaga was a bit disappointed with it. Apparently there is a place in Chicago called Owl Hardwood Lumber that has an enormous selection of all kinds and sizes of wood and it puts Woodcraft to shame. It's true there is only one small area for wood at Woodcraft as they also stock all the major tools and those take up most of their floor space.Westbrook MetalsAfter Woodcraft we went to Westbrook Metals and I looked at i-beam, angle iron and tubing as candidates for the legs for my desk. I brought home small samples of each for $.50 a lb ($11 total--I love a hobby with relatively cheap materials!) and tomorrow when we unload the pine from the trailer and move it to the wood workshop I'll be able to look at the wood and the steel together. The slabs are really big and I need to balance the size and weight of the metal with the wood. It would look silly to have little, spindly one-inch steel tubing for the legs under a massive, three-inch-thick-slab desktop.  Right now I like the idea of i-beam standing on end and coming up all the way through the top of the desk so its end is flush with the surface. Somewhat like the leg on the bench below, but without the wood missing from one side of the i-beam, and the i-beam would not be all the way to the edge of the top either.I think I'll use four-inch i-beam and put a leg in each corner... but who knows! I need to touch and move the wood around to see what I want to do. Big problem with that idea is that the long slabs of pine weigh about 176 lbs each, and the cut-offs weigh about 88 lbs each. I need a hobby that isn't so physically demanding. I guess I'd better figure out how I'm going to manipulate my materials. If I do use the i-beam for the legs the weight of the desk will jump to over 250 lbs (each leg will weigh about 20 lbs). And that's before I've added on any shelves or shelf hardware. Maybe I should cut the slab down to two inches thick--or I could make the desk six feet long instead of eight. That would be a better proportion of length to width anyway.What an exciting project! After I do the desk for my class project I'll be in better shape to do the bed. And speaking of bed, I think I'll make my way to mine. Allergies are kicking my butt this week and I am TIRED!!"},

Nor was I anxious as I was throwing them. It was a relaxed and fruitful class. In fact the title of the post should probably be Pottery Anxious as the pottery state came temporally before the anxious state. The anxious state is now. I look on my to-do list and it looks like I am on top of everything and everything is moving forward as it should. But I don't feel that way. Instead I feel like you do when you are in a plane having just taken off for a foreign destination not serviced by Amazon.com. You have the nagging sense you have forgotten something you really need. The sensation builds until the realization of the identity of the forgotten item drenches you from the inside out like cold, broken up gelatin. Only I don't think I have forgotten anything. Nevertheless I keep feeling that icy, jittery, cold-gelatin-under-your-skin-rushing-down-the-body tingle. Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!My anxiety is enough that I am going to give up any pretext of writing a coherent, thoughtful post tonight. I'm not even going to try to knit.

Today was full of photos! There were the cool honeycombs formed by the one of my hives, the beautiful butterflies in the garden--the queen of whom was the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail feeding from the salvia, and the stick bug and its reflection. It was a great life-affirming day outside--and I didn't melt!I did my first bee inspection since the great debacle of a week ago, and it went just fine. I was in full suit and knee-high boots, but I think it would have been fine even had I not been as bees were just fine except for one hive at one moment--and the smoker took care of them. Looking back on the incident last week, I think the biggest mistake was not having the smoker lit.StickbugToday was also the first day Gallifrey had his invisible fence collar back on, and when he went out this morning his first actions were to go outside of the yard, pee on the neighbor's 911 Porsche (caught on their security camera) and then come back in the yard. Clearly he got a good zap going in and out as he wouldn't cross the line later. Whew!The demand letter from the lawyer went off to the contractor today, now we wait and see. In the meantime I am working with the new carpenter/handyman to get through the open items, and I am okay.I also had my last lab work done for my doctor today. She thinks she might be able to fix my hot flashes in a plant-based, non-hormone-supplement way. It's weird that I have gotten to a place in life where it not only doesn't hurt when they take blood from my arm, but I actually can't feel it.Today's hive inspectionGallifrey had his own little medical procedure today. I took him in to a visiting doggie dentist at Tomlinson's (pet supplies) and he had his teeth cleaned while he was awake (without anesthesia). I had to hold him along with the dentist, and it was an awful sounding procedure (scraping the tartar off the teeth), but Gallifrey's teeth are pearly white again. I asked the dentist what to do to keep them that way as this has been an issue for me (Gallifrey already had his teeth cleaned under anesthetic a year and a half ago and they were dark brown with tartar then and almost that dark again now). Clearly I'm not doing what I should. The dentist said to give him raw bones. I thought bones were bad for the teeth and would crack them (according to my last vet) but I was told today that they needed the raw bones to keep their teeth clean. After the dental appointment I went to HEB to get bones and they don't didn't have any! The butcher said they have them occasionally, but they don't stock them. Not even soup bones. Tomorrow I search out a butcher shop to treat my sweet boy after today's ordeal.Now we've had a great dinner (Dave rotisseried a chicken on the grill he got last year for Father's Day), watched the first few episodes of The Tick on Amazon (we love our superheroes), and are relaxing after a long day. Tomorrow pottery starts up again (for me), and I am meeting with the carpenter about replacing the bedroom and bathroom carpet with hardwood and tile. I just can't stand it any more.For our friends in Atlanta and Florida--stay safe! I guess California, Oregon, and Montana too. A lot of the country is subject to natural disasters right now.

There have been tears of overwhelming love, tears of loss, tears of leaving, and tears pulled from beautiful writing about the best of the human spirit in Aaron Sorkin's Newsroom. Right now the tears are drying to the song \"If It's the Beaches\" by the Avett Brothers--the latest sensory input that pulls emotion from me like water from a tap.We are home from Montana, and I cried as I drove to the airport because I didn't want to go. But unlike previous times when I left Montana (for Atlanta), when I got home this time (to Austin) I was glad to be here. It's good to have two places you really love to be. I also cried at the wedding of my Uncle Ed and new Aunt Susan. I cried during Ed's speech when he mentioned all the people who knew him and Susan and who died before being able to celebrate their day with them. One of the people who missed the day was my mother. and how I wish she could have been there! I was living in Arizona for my uncle's first marriage, and my Mom came to stay with me for the wedding. I don't remember why, but I was late getting us on the road for the wedding and we missed the first of the ceremony. My mother was so mad that I made her mother miss (at least the beginning of) her brother's wedding!But I didn't only cry for loss at the wedding, I cried for love. My heart was full to bursting, as we say, as I listened to their vows. They have been together longer than Dave and I have been married, and to see them formalize their commitment was so life and love affirming. Watching my adorable little cousin Charlotte the flower girl (the daughter of Ed's son Andrew and his wife Rachel) scamper around during the service provided a pivot point for my feelings of continuity in life and family and love.But enough of tears. Tonight I started another class at the Contemporary--this time in wood and steel with Zaga my friend next door. Tonight's demo/hands on tool introduction included mig welding. Next week we learn welding, cutting, and hot-forming metal with an oxy-acetylene torch. I think I'm in love. My project for this class is a desk from one of the big blue pine slabs with tubular steel legs and maybe some other steel and glass details (floating shelving, back stop, etc.). The instructor is up for us learning and using a variety of big tools including a planer, jointer, and table saw for wood; a bender, miter chop saw, and the two varieties of welders for metal; and an angle grinder for both. It's going to be an interesting few weeks.My music has morphed into Darius Rucker's (the original--he wrote it) version of Wagon Wheel.

It was a beautiful ceremony that made me want to renew  my vows with Dave. The wedding was held on a lovely lawn cupped by spruce pine and weeping willow on the property of the Barn at Finley Point. Our part of the family (Dave, Jessie, and I) were late because we were doing last minute family stuff for the wedding party, but it worked out because the wedding wasn't ready to start on-time anyway.It was a lovely ceremony with interjections of humor by both the bride and the groom--and lots of special moments provided  by the granddaughter Charlotte who stole the show. She was the flower girl, and took it as her solemn duty to place every petal in her bucket on the ground at the beginning of the path before proceeding up the aisle. She was adorably, studiously meticulous as she spread the rose petals on the grass in that one, perfect spot in spite of the exhortations of her mother and other members of the wedding party who kept trying to get her to come on down the aisle and drop some petals towards the end.For much of the rest of the ceremony she sat next to me in the front row of the audience. People around us were taking pictures of the proceedings and she stated her intention to take pictures too. She asked for my phone, and I gave to her (how could I do anything else?), and she started snapping pictures. Then she'd pause, switch to the photo app, and go flipping through the pictures she had taken. Next she'd hold up the phone, go back to the camera app, and start taking more pictures. She never once asked me how to do anything on the phone, she just crushed it on her own. I have to mention here that she is three years old. I am officially disconnected from the world when a three year-old is more natively savvy with a smart phone than I will ever be. I am having difficulty right now even charging my phone enough to get all the pictures off of it...I could recount more now about the chaos that was the day with sprained ankles (the groom's daughter--in the wedding party), adjusting the length of two bridesmaid dresses (a combination of scissors and a cigarette lighter), ironing, prescriptions, hand foot and mouth disease, and a host of other wedding-day things, but the only thing any of us needs to remember about the day is that we were lucky enough to be there and to share in the culmination of 25 years of love that went into the wedding of Ed and Susan. The rest of the happenings make for nice stories later, but for tonight, all I want to remember is the look on my uncle's face as he said his vows and pledged himself to the love of his life.Time for me to go join the love of my life in exhausted slumber.

I acknowledge and allow myself this cheat and post as if it were still Thursday. Sue me.As our little plane was leaving Salt Lake City bound for Missoula, the pilot warbled over the PA system that there was good news; we would be able to land in Missoula and not have to divert to Helena because of the smoke. The whole possibility-of-diversion thing was news to us as it had never occurred to anyone that there was a possibility of not being able to land because of smoke from forest fires. But when we arrived, we could see what the big deal was. I grew up in Missoula and have never seen such dense smoke. You could smell it strongly in the jetway getting off the plane--and even right before landing we could barely see the ground under the plane. It was good to get our rental car and get out of town heading up to Polson.Unfortunately there is nowhere you can go in Western Montana right now that isn't smokey. It isn't as bad in Polson as it is in Missoula, but you can't see the lake from our back deck, and at night all the street lights have a diffuse glow under them that looks like fog or fine snow. I can't imagine what it's like to live here day after day right now. The sun is a faint orange glow in the sky--a daily partial eclipse. It's kind of like a grey day in Seattle, but the light's a bit more sickly yellow/green. I think it would be very depressing for more than a week, and folks here have been dealing with it for much longer than that.Getting to sleep is rough as Jessie is having difficulty breathing, and and I am worried about the air quality because I have done my normal night time routine of opening all the windows in the house. We don't have central A/C or any kind of whole-house fan system here in Montana so open windows are the only way to get any air circulation. The master bedroom (where my cousins are staying for the wedding) has a ceiling fan as does the livingroom, but otherwise we're pretty air-movement primitive up here.Tomorrow is a day of fun at the lake (not in the water--it's way too cold for that!) and an evening of square dancing in the Barn at Finley Point."},
{"title": "Back to Textiles", "date": "Wednesday, September 06, 2017", "text": "It was a short work-week. First there was Labor Day, now tomorrow we're heading off to Montana for a long-anticipated family wedding. It's 10:30 now, and all I have left to do is pack. Considering I have more stuff in Montana that I want to bring back to Austin from the summer than I want to take for the next four days I'm guessing packing will be pretty easy. I made Dave a new shirt to wear to the wedding today, and I was finished by 6:30 pm. I can't remember a trip when I was done with everything but packing by 6:30 the evening before departure. It's weird--I hardly know what to so with myself! Guess I'll enjoy the peach hookah and post!The shirt. Let's talk about spending the day in the fiber studio again. It was wonderful! I even sold my LeClerc 60\" loom yesterday. The woman who bought it can't take delivery until October so it's going to stay crowded in the studio till then, but I can squint and see a time when I will have room to weave and sew in there without having to wend my way through narrow passage ways around the various equipment. Fall is my favorite fiber time too. There is something about the weather taking a turn for the cooler (a relative term here in Texas) that makes me want to bury my hands in textiles. Spinzilla is coming up in October, then NaKniSweMo in November (national knit a sweater month)--both of which will be dedicated to the twist coat I am making myself this year. Last year's project was Dave's sweater (an enormous garment now known as the Bolt--a reference from Neal Stephenson's book Anathem). But today I made a shirt. My goal is to replace all of his current shirts (mostly made over 14 years ago) and to take the old shirts and make them into a quilt and rag rugs for the bedroom and kitchen. A little sewing, a little weaving, a lot of spinning and knitting... Oh the fall is going to be glorious!!Now off to pack."},
{"title": "I Can't Make This Stuff Up", "date": "Tuesday, September 05, 2017", "text": "Image from the Yucatan Times (linked)This morning Jessie pointed a beetle out to me that was hanging around by our front door. He was a cool white and black color, and I had never seen an insect like him before so I looked him up on the web. I found out he's called an Ironclad beetle and is in the Zopherus family (Zopherus nodulosus). In the Yucatan, Zopherus beetles are adorned with little rhinestones and a chain and worn as living brooches. Apparently there is a Mayan legend about a princess and a beetle that is the basis for the custom, but wearing the beetles as ma'kech (the Mayan name for the beetle brooch) might not date back in practice further than the 1980's. I think I remember my mother telling me about girls in the 50's wearing what they called chameleons but were probably green anoles as brooches. The Internet is further littered with stories of women wearing real chameleons throughout the ages. I even found citations for women wearing live, giant hissing cockroaches from Madagascar as jewelry. That one freaked me out so badly I stopped looking for more instances.That little excursion into the weird corners of the web epitomizes my day perfectly. It was a lovely little blend of the surreal and banal, and I made it through it without accomplishing much of anything. *Sigh*. I did start making a shirt for Dave for him to wear to the big family wedding this weekend, but I barely got it more than cut out before I ran out of time. Tomorrow my day is packed solid so I don't have time to do it then, and then we leave Thursday. Guess he'll just have to wear an old one."},
{"title": "Finally Something Good!", "date": "Monday, September 04, 2017", "text": "A few days ago I quietly surpassed the number of posts written in a year. The previous maximum post year was 2008, and admittedly I was only posting weekdays then so my theoretical maximum for it was something like 261. I wrote 243. This is post 247 for this year.Today's happy story started not so happily over a year ago. When we first moved in we had a really sleazy contractor (who knew there were sleazy contractors?). Not the sleazy contractor who recently absconded with all of our money and left us high and dry with several projects underway. No, this was the sleazy kitchen remodeling contractor. I didn't know any carpenters here, Dan had gone back to Atlanta, and I desperately needed someone to build frit storage in my studio so I could begin unpacking. Sleazy Contractor #1 (SC1 from now on) told me he had a carpenter who had just started working for him who wouldn't mind some extra hours, and I could hire him for some weekend work if I wanted to. The deal was, I would pay SC1 and he would pay the carpenter. He charged me $75 an hour, and I know damn good and well (because the carpenter told me so) that he paid the carpenter less than half that. Now you might say that the additional charge was for employment taxes, workman's comp, etc., but in hindsight I'm betting SC1 paid him cash under the table and pocketed the rest. It wasn't my business so I didn't ask, but...The carpenter did really good work. He is more of a high-quality jack-of-all trades and master-of-some than he is a straight carpenter. I would have loved to hire him weekends to do more work, but SC1 said I had to continue to go through him so he could \"manage the carpenter's weekend schedule\", and I just wasn't willing to do that. I gave the carpenter my number and said if he was ever not working for SC1 and wanted work, he should give me a call.Last Wednesday, as I sat in a slough of despair over the state of capital improvement and repairs here, the phone rang and it was the carpenter! He had finally had enough of SC1's uber-sleazy ways and quit. Today he came out and fixed the roof ridgecap  from SC2's work (I'm sure I don't need to explain the acronym), and he also worked on our front door--the one SC2 was supposed to replace and never did. SC2 just took the door off and left a construction door in its place. He put the old door on the ground out by the wellhouse where it sat in the rain and weather until today. The carpenter cleaned up the door and filled the place where the lock mechanism went with Bondo so we could redrill it for the new lock. Then he sanded the paint off the front and removed the broken leaded glass insert--managing to preserve all the molding strips that held it in place in the process. I cut a piece of clear textured glass from my studio stash and he put it in the door as an interim measure until I can do the new stained glass door insert, transom and sidelights. Then he tried to rehang the door. Unfortunately it suffered from its time outside in the rain and constant humidity, and it swelled so much it won't fit into the doorjamb. So now it's standing up inside the front hall drying out (and shrinking) so he can rehang it. It might still have to be sanded down a little on the sides, but it's definitely going to shrink so we didn't want to grind it down now and have it be too small in a couple of weeks. I can live a little longer with the construction door. Last thing he did before taking off was to repair the well-house door that blew off and rehang it.Turns out the carpenter is also a fourth generation painter, and he asked if I would like him to finish painting the house (left undone by SC2's crew--probably because he stopped paying them). He's going to give me an estimate on it tomorrow. He's also going to fix the cabinet doors which are hanging off their hinges from SC1's kitchen install. I am so happy to have found someone to pick up where SC2 left off and to also fix SC1's crap. It is so good to be back working with one individual who actually does the work instead of general contractors who come in, promise the moon, and then disappear--leaving their laborers to do the work (maybe competently, maybe not). Now for a glass of wine and a shower"},
{"title": "Glass Incarnate Today is About... Glass!", "date": "Sunday, September 03, 2017", "text": "I have clearly been out of touch with the glass fusing community for awhile. I heard today from another artist that there is some furor over fused glass boxes and who came up with what, and that someone is teaching a glass box technique remarkably similar to the one in my book. Of course there is always the possibility that this artist and I both engineered our own solutions independently and came up with the same thing--it happens all the time. Whatever the circumstance, it was gratifying to find out that things I did for the book are still out there and being tried by new people. In a fit of nostalgia I went back through my photos and found my original glass box work from 11 years ago. My how time flies! I submitted the combed box below for a Niche Award in 2007 and made it to finalist. Two years ago I submitted a 3D printed piece (done by hand with screens, not machines), and that piece won. Have I done anything really creative since? Not in glass!Since I was thinking of glass, I went surfing through the Fused Glass Fanatics Facebook page and was excited to see pictures (admittedly from a few years ago) of the mokume gane technique from my book that other people tried. Made me want to get back into mad scientist mode in the studio too. I love the mokume gane box (above) and it was both the last box and the last mokume gane project I did. I miss that feeling of having an idea and engineering a way to make it happen in glass. Some of it is bringing forth the artistic vision, and some of it is the sheer joy of problem solving to allow the vision to come out that make my heart sing.Years ago at a BECon lehr-bq I remember telling Lani McGregor that I was going to take the 3D-printing technique I had learned from Steve Royston Brown at a pre-conference workshop, and really go somewhere with it. I saw intricate sculptures in my head all laid down 2mm at a time in Bullseye glass powder. Unfortunately due to a firing schedule snafu in the workshop, my final piece didn't fully fuse and I unmolded it to find only glass powder sifting through my fingers. I'll admit my enthusiasm was a bit dampened by the failure. It took a few years (until I started writing the advanced book) before I sat down with it again and calculated a firing schedule that would work. As I still have my designs and the screens from the class, maybe it's time to try that complicated, multi-screen project again.After finishing the book, the stream of life carried me down a different current and all the techniques I had worked on were left to lie fallow. Now, however, I have more time to create in the studio again. Having creative time and energy was one of the main reasons I decided not to have a teaching and retail studio anymore. I was spending all of my time trying to do my regular line of gallery work and managing the retail and teaching--there was no time for creativity.Now I'm in Texas (for the past 15 months) and my studio still isn't unpacked and set up. But I was out there yesterday and today and I set up an auxiliary work table (for fun projects, not production), and I think it's time to get back in there to see what all the fun is about. It's almost cool enough out now to spend long days in there without dying of heat stroke. Eventually I might even get a pair of glass patio doors installed to separate the kiln room from the rest of the studio. First project is going to be a 3-D printed one. Or mokume gane tiles for our kitchen..."},
{"title": "Today Was a Better Day", "date": "Saturday, September 02, 2017", "text": "We kicked it today. It took two, but Dave and I pulled down all the plastic and tape that the painters put up on our back deck back in May (April?) when they started painting, before they absconded. Then we blew the leaves off (me), washed the decking down (Dave), and put all the furniture back (us). I also cut all the glass and inset it into the kitchen cabinet doors with silicone and glazier's points. Tomorrow we'll put all the doors back on and that project will be done.I was all excited last weekend when I did a design for all the doors and it was supposed to be in leaded glass, but it turned out wanting to be in fused glass. And the week went on. And I couldn't execute. Turns out I just couldn't get behind the design for the doors or in fusing them. Instead I cut plain panels of reed glass (think 1930's private investigator or lawyer doors) and put them in. Simple, elegant, contemporary, classic, perfect.Tonight we sat out on the newly reassembled deck and provided an all-you-can-eat for the mosquitos as we communed with the night. It was both more and less enjoyable than it sounds. Now I'm off to bed to snuggle with my spouse, the love of my life and partner in my frumiousness."},
{"title": "I Cannot TGIF Enough", "date": "Friday, September 01, 2017", "text": "The week ends as it began: with difficulty and tears. Back at the beginning of May, I went to Barton Springs Nursery and picked up some plants. When I went to leave, there was a line of cars waiting to get out of the parking lot. I joined the queue about three or four cars back. The woman in front of me rolled forward, I rolled forward, and I tapped her car. She jumped out of the car practically hysterical that I had \"hit\" her. She demanded my insurance info and I gladly gave it to her as there was no damage to either vehicle, and I figured she'd see there was nothing to fuss about when she calmed down. Just to be sure, I took pictures of her bumper. The only \"damage\" to her plastic bumper was a scratch from the hexagonal screw on my license plate holder.Today I looked on my State Farm account online and saw that there is a claim against me for that accident. Without even calling me to let me know she had put in a claim and to see if I had information, State Farm paid her $304.58 for medical expenses, $231.88 for a rental car, and $706.68 for repairs. I was behind her so I was at fault, the fact that she completely overreacted at best, or submitted a fraudulent claim at worst doesn't even matter. I have been with State Farm for over 20 years and not been at fault for an accident in all that time. I've been hit a few times, but I have never been at fault. Now because of this my rates are going up $15 a month. Oh State Farm doesn't call it a rate increase, instead they call it losing my accident-free discount. A pile of poop by any other name smells the same.Please let the weekend usher in a better week!"},

{"title": "The Train Wreck That is My Week Continues On", "date": "Wednesday, August 30, 2017", "text": "I'm baring my soul. I started to feel out of touch several months ago when I just could not make a mental connection to the definition of the word \"meme\". I would hear the word, know it meant something that everyone around me (namely Dave and Jessie) understood, but it felt like it was from a foreign language to me. It took about three months before I *finally* got it and felt comfortable using the word in a sentence. Looking back I blamed my inability to grasp the meaning on my B12 deficiency. In honor of how far I've come, I start this post with a meme. Of course, given how my week has been going, I won't be surprised if I get that wrong too and what follows isn't really a meme.\"I can only please one person a day and today is not your day... Tomorrow isn't looking good either.\" For a snapshot of my week thus far, switch it around a bit to \"The universe only lets a few people triumph per day and the past two days were not my days... and today isn't looking good either\". I started on Monday with the debacle of the bees--two more sting casualties added to the count since I posted the details. The latest victims were both neighbors. One was a man who was power-walking by the garden as part of his morning workout. He's prepping to do a trek in the Himalayas with his son (not sure if it's Everest, but it's still a BIG DEAL). He got stung five times--thank heaven he's not allergic! The second (I heard from another neighbor this morning) was the man who lives across the street from the gardens who was in his yard and got stung on his hand. He's the man who lives behind the big wall who was mentioned in the post This Whole Thing Could Have Ended Very Badly. So not a great start to the week.Then yesterday I was crushed by my lack of savvy regarding \"throwing shade\". Even my friend the professor (who is my age) threw shade at me for my ignorance. Enough said on that low spot. In my defense, and in spite of the data points of my performance this week, I have felt more on top of things and aware since I started on blood pressure, B12, and diabetes meds. I find a good gauge of mental acuity is how well I do at Sudoku on hard, spider solitaire with four suits, and Words with Friends. Lately I have been kicking it on all of them so I've been a bit smug about my focus. Fast forward to this morning. My schedule was pretty tight: Piano lesson 9-9:30, car in for service 10-11:30, Dr's appt 12-12:15, lunch with the child 12:35-1:16, break for a few hours and then off to the last jewelry class from 5-10:30. The piano lesson went great. I still can't play Bach's \"Prelude in C\" with any skill, but I did pretty well on \"Rock Around the Clock\" and had great first read-throughs on both \"You Really Got Me\" and \"Amazing Grace\". I was doing so well (having so much fun at piano) that I actually ran a bit late. I think my teacher also appreciates having such an enthusiastic student who really loves to practice and looks forward to her lessons so I don't think she minded the few extra minutes either.I grabbed my laptop and my bag with my knitting and I was out the door. The minivan, though pretty new, has been badly treated over the past few months with two drives between Austin and Montana, and hauling a trailer load of wood and woodworking tools over the Rocky Mountains on the way back. It's been a bit hesitant to start and was overdue for service so I wasn't entirely surprised when I got in it today and it wouldn't start. The lights came on an it beeped at me, but the console lights wouldn't come on and the engine wouldn't turn over. I called Greg at Friendly Car Care to tell him I wasn't going to be able to make my appointment. He said that sometimes the push-button-start cars need you to press really hard on the brake before pushing the start button, or there can be an issue if it's not all the way in Park. I pushed really, really hard on the brake, and nothing. I tried to move the gearshift around, and it was firmly in Park. Then he said to call Honda because the battery should still be under warranty. I called and sure enough it was so I said I would bring it in today.Next I needed to call AAA to get a jump. I reached across the seat for my bag and rummaged through it for my wallet to get the AAA card for the phone number and my member number. No wallet. In fact, no purse. I had left it in the house. Therefore no car \"keys\". My car wouldn't start because I didn't have the keys. Even technology is getting the best of me this week!I got the car in, and while I was waiting for it to be serviced I casually watched the Wendy Williams Show. Her guest today was Yvette Nicole who gave a frankly wonderful interview about comfort with yourself and your body and being strong in your goals--all kinds of great things. Then she mentioned meeting the new Spiderman Tom Holland and she said \"I think he gave me rhythm\", and I was back to yesterday with absolutely no clue what she meant. At least this time I got to salvage my pride because when I told Jessie about the comment at lunch she also did not know what \"giving rhythm\" meant. When I told her the definition (as provided by the Urban Dictionary: \"Verb. To engage in flirtatious actions between two people.\") she said it sounded stupid. I said it probably sounded stupid because I said it.Now I'm back home and I'm going to go work on my jewelry projects for awhile before class so I might have a chance at finishing one of them tonight. I need something to go right this week."},
{"title": "How Do Vampires Manage?", "date": "Tuesday, August 29, 2017", "text": "I have been feeling good for the past couple of weeks. I even mentioned awhile ago that I felt like I had half of my life in front of me rather than just 10-20 years. In the space of five minutes in the car today with my fifteen year-old daughter, I was relegated to the status of the bewildered 80 year-old grandparent wondering how I was going to navigate the rest of my life in the linguistic chaos of the world.I have noticed before that I felt out of step with the larvae of our species. I lost interest in youth culture about the time hip-hop came in, but never before have I had so many difficulties all at once as I did today. We were listening to the radio on the way home from school and the dj said something about Taylor Swift's latest song. Jessie commented that the video was really funny as she (Taylor) ?????? ????? ??? ????. First problem: I couldn't hear what she said--my hearing is not what it used to be. So I asked her to repeat it. She instead defined what she said for me, \"It's like mocking someone, but it's not.\" We entered the Marx Brothers portion of the dialogue with me asking , \"What was?\". She said, \"Shade.\" At this point I was completely mystified and not a little frustrated. Enunciating carefully and slowly, I asked her to use \"shade\" in a sentence for me so I could understand it by context. She replied, \"Taylor threw shade at Kimye.\" (The entity formerly known as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.) I not only had never heard this phrase, but I would have had no idea what it meant had J not told me. Tonight I Googled Taylor Swift throwing shade at Kanye and I got a whole page of results. I was instantly thrown back to my youth when I looked with pity at the old fogies who were out of step with life and the current generation. How did I wake up as the old fogey? When did this happen? I listen to current music. (Sometimes. When Jessie switches the car radio from the 80's channel or Classic Rewind to Hits.) I see the latest movies and would have said that I am au courant with the world and its people (though not its fashions--I sacrificed form for function long ago). But this afternoon I was cut adrift.Vampires go through time the same age and having to move from identity to identity to keep people from suspecting that they never grow old or die. How do they do it? With a few minor tweaks (like my hearing) I still feel inside like I did when I was 27. Unlike a vampire I have aged and I may not look 27 anymore, but I still have (almost) the same joie de vivre and spirit of adventure. But here I am getting caught by someone \"throwing shade\" at a Westashian. If I with my very limited life span can't keep up with language's fluidity, how do vampires who can live for hundreds of years manage it? It's a mystery."},
{"title": "The Story Of the Angry Bees", "date": "Monday, August 28, 2017", "text": "My feet look like sausages tonight--the left one so much so that  I don't think it could swell any more without bursting the skin. On the scale of my less stellar decision-making days, today is right up there on the top. The morning dawned cloudy--not actively raining for the first time in days, cool, and only a little windy. I know you're not supposed to open your beehives when it's windy or raining, but I didn't get a chance to feed them before Harvey hit and I was worried that between the dearth of August (it's a tough time for bees in Texas because it's so hot and dry that there aren't a lot of nectar flowers for them so we have to supplement the nectar with sugar water) and the storm they would need some extra vittles.I knew enough not to attempt a full hive inspection today. All I planned to do was open the hives and pour in a quart or two of sugar syrup in each. I suited up in a full suit and my Keene sandals as I don't have any work boots and I didn't figure sneakers would protect me either because the bees would sting me right through my socks if they felt like stinging. Choice of footgear was my first mistake.Zaga suited up too and filled the smoker for me, but as damp as everything was (even using dry paper and leaves), I could not get it to stay lit. I tried and tried and finally decided to forgo the smoker as a) I was just doing a quick feeding, and 2) I only had 45 minutes to feed everyone before I had to get to a doctor's appointment and drop Jessie at school on the way. Forgoing the smoker was my second, and arguably biggest mistake.As it was the first nice weather for them too, the dogs were out frolicking in the botanical garden as I went into the apiary to do the bees. Having the dogs out was the error that made the whole event a perfect swarm, er, storm.The first hive I fed was my golden girls and they were their usual sweet selves as I filled up their feeder. The next couple of hives the bees got a bit more agitated, but nothing worrying. Then I went to the Topbar hive. As soon as I pried the bars off the box (four--not just one as I needed to get to the feeder in the bottom of the box) the bees got really testy. They buzzed angrily around me, and when Gallifrey came to see what was up with them, for the first time they went after him. He got stung twice in quick succession and Zaga and I picked bees out of his fur as we headed him towards the house. The bees instantly burrowed into his fur to get to his skin when they landed on him and with his coat they immediately disappeared. Zaga took him in the house while I finished up the Topbar hive, and she pulled another 6-8 bees off of him.Meanwhile I got the Topbar hive fed and put back together and headed for the Lang/Topbar hybrid. As soon as I took the cover off, the buzz ratcheted up. Those bees were riled up already--probably because of the alarm pheromones in the air from the Topbar bees stinging Gallifrey. By the time I got the inner cover off (another 30 seconds tops) they were out and swarming me in my suit. Even though I was covered it was still very scary--and then they discovered my sandaled feet. As soon as the first one stung my foot and released the alarm pheromone down there I was a goner.There were bees all over my sandals, legs and exposed feet. I was shrieking like the girl I am, Zaga was trying to figure out how to help me, I said \"Water!\" and ran towards the hose but quickly realized I wasn't going to be able to wait as long as it took her to get the sprayer and to turn it on, so I turned and ran for the pond instead. When I got there I swung my legs over the edge and plunged my feet into the water. Then I sat for a few minutes with my feet in the water up to my knees gasping and shaking from shock. The bees were everywhere and in their frenzy kept falling into the pond, whereupon I reached down with my gloved hands and helped them out of the water. I like to think that most of the ones I saved were shocked back to their senses and flew off back to the hive leaving me in peace.As I sat there, I felt two bees inside my suit climbing up each of my legs. They must have been near my pant cuffs and got swept up the inside of the legs when I entered the water. I couldn't bring myself to squish them, but I was terrified they were going to sting me. They climbed higher. I got up and waded to the middle of the pond, still swarmed by bees. They were on my gloves stinging them, attacking my veil around my face, and landing all over my arms and torso. I could feel the one on the right side of my body inside my suit on my hipbone moving in towards other more tender areas. I pressed my suit flat against my body so it couldn't go that way and I started to hyperventilate. I couldn't see Zaga, I didn't know what had happened to her, I called out and she didn't answer and I started to whimper and cry in panic thinking I was all alone stuck in the pond and I didn't know what to do. Then I pulled myself together. If there's no one there to save you, you have to save yourself.I tried tipping my head back to let the carbon dioxide and fear smell out through my veil, and slowed my breathing. It didn't help. I even tried holding my breath thinking they were attracted to the CO2 so I'd just not breathe and release any, and they'd begin to go away. Zip, zilch, nada. None of it worked and I was still being swarmed. I decided my only hope was to get out of the pond and run for the house. I sat on the edge of the pond again, this time with my legs on the inside to start, and then I swung them over and out and leapt up and ran for the house. I heard Zaga call from somewhere behind me as I ran, but I couldn't stop.As I approached the house I heard a new tenor of buzzing--the sound of a bee inside the veil. A bee had managed to get inside my suit somehow and was angrily zipping around my head. I should have mentioned earlier that I made another sloppy mistake as I was suiting up and did not tie my hair back. By the time I made my mad dash to the house my hair was all over inside the veil and I could barely see a thing through it.When I got to the house I had a little bit of luck: I couldn't hear any bees buzzing around me (outside my suit) and I didn't see any obvious ones on me. So I ran inside and frantically started taking off the suit before someone inside it stung me. It was soaking wet from the knees down and hard to get off. But I managed, and as I pulled my bare legs out of the suit, I saw five bees crawling around on the inside. Two of them had obviously stung me (poor bees have their stingers ripped right out of their abdomens when they sting which is why they die--their insides trail outside...), but I didn't take time to check the others. I opened the door and shooed them out while not letting any more in.I could go on about getting Jessie to school, missing my doctor's appointment, soaking my feet in ice water as I watched them swell, and eventually suiting up again (this time with knee-high leather boots un the suit) to put the lid back on the beehive... But you get the point. It was a crazy day.At the end of it all, my feet are--as I mentioned before--like sausages, but I still love my bees."},

No hardship as we all had things we wanted to do in the house. There were a couple of times when the wind and the rain let up enough to walk around the garden a bit. Much of my yard art was blown over or blown down--including the wire man I had hung over the path into the botanical garden. But the glass didn't break--unlike the large metal bell on a plant stand that I hadn't moved off the driveway into the yard yet. It fell over and cracked right in half. I doubt I can fix.it, but maybe I can place it so only the front of the bell is visible and the back is hidden by foliage. It's not like I was actually going to ring it or anything. Jessie even gets a bonus for tomorrow as school is starting two hours late on account of the weather. I hear the rain still coming down out there and we have been very lucky that it has been moderate and steady and not an unrelenting, overwhelming deluge.Organization has come to the jewelry studioMy day was, for the second day in a row, all about the jewelry studio. Since the temps stayed in the low to mid seventies all day it was easy to stay in there working and I got everything sorted and put away. This is a never-before-done accomplishment. The best I've managed previously is to get everything co-located in the same room or area. Now I not only have a drawer or shelf designated for all tools and materials and everything unpacked and in said drawers or on said shelves, but I also have labels on all the drawers! Dave is beside himself at the sight of more empty boxes indicating more progress on being totally moved in forever.The cat on the matThe torch isn't hooked up yet, but I got the Foredom hung and powered up. I also have a studio cat mat as both Kaiju and Pavlova like to hang in there--though not on the same mat at the same time. Kaiju is more possessive of me so I have a feeling when I am in the studio, he will be too. He's the one who likes to escape out the front door when I am working in the garden just to hang out and watch me weed, or tend bees, or whatever. I think he thinks he's a smart dog (as opposed to the other dogs we have who are clearly idiots: They have collars to keep them in and out of areas, they don't get to sleep on the bed or wherever they choose, and they only get dry kibble not wet food too).My jeweler's (watchmaker's) benchAnd speaking of bees, tomorrow I have got to feed the bees and at least peek into the hives to make sure they're okay. Zaga is convinced her bees are dead. There are definitely dead bees on the front of the some of the hives--these last couple of days have got to have been hard on them. While the plants (especially the trees) have been all about the rain, the wind has taken a toll on the bees. But tomorrow morning they all get big bottles of sugar syrup as soon as there is a break in the rain. It would be the height of rudeness to open up the hive and let in the rain on top of everything else so the inspection is going to be cursory (if at all). It will also probably still be windy and inspecting when it's windy is a great way (not just good but great) to get stung. Needless to say, I'll suit up as the suit will keep me away from both bee stings and rain."},

We are heading out into the storm to meet with some friends and play geek games. Fortunately they live just around the corner from us (by car) so we don't have to go far. As we have already braved the storm this afternoon to go see Logan Lucky--the new Soderbergh film--at the Drafthouse, we are not too concerned. Yes the wind is still howling, yes the rain is still coming down. But we're up high, if not dry, so we don't have to worry about flash flooding.The wind was pretty fierce last night--fierce enough to tear the metal well-house door off its top and bottom hinges. It was left hanging from the middle hinge. When I looked at it this morning I saw that the wood of the door jamb was rotten so I'll need to remove the door, replace the rotted wood, paint it, and hang the door back up. If I still had contractors, this would all be easy. For now I have the door wedged shut so the beekeeping supplies stay dry. When it dries up a bit, I'll tackle it. Or I'll try to find a new handyman to help with some of my incomplete projects.The jewelry tools and supplies are all but deployed in the jewelry studio. Tomorrow I'll hang the Foredom, and maybe even set up the torch. A girl can dream. Though I was planning on working in the glass studio tomorrow...Some day I might clean, or do laundry, or something housewifely, but frankly I don't think I'm that kind of girl."},

Harvey is coming and we are going to get pounded with rain. When to feed the bees is my biggest issue right now--and hoping we have enough candles when the power goes out as it probably will. We aren't worried about flooding or rock slides where we are. Trees blowing over could be an issue, but mostly we're going to hunker down and wait it out. Jessie's school is a refugee center for the storm and there will be a lot of people sleeping in the gym there probably into the week next week if the rain and flooding follow through. The storm is going to be bad enough, but the massive influx of rain over the next week is what's really going to kill us.The day was spent in the jewelry studio--still without AC as the quote I got on replacing the broken unit today was waaaay out of our current budget. I started with big swooshes of organization--unpacking all the various tools into the cabinet--and by the end of the day I was separating out two colors of 11/0 seed beads--beads so tiny I can barely see them in two different shades of medium blue... Okay so maybe I went a bit overboard on the whole organization thing, but I am looking forward to hanging in their tomorrow and finishing up. As the jewelry studio is a glass greenhouse, 2/3 of the walls and all of the roof are glass. It'll be a cool place to hang in during a driving rain storm.Hope Ellen and Marc are safe down in Wharton, and if the water level rises too high, hope they bring their cat and come hang out here in our apartment."},
{"title": "More Studio Set Up", "date": "Thursday, August 24, 2017", "text": "It's a good thing I have the liver of a teetotaling teenager (according to my doctor) as I had more than two glasses of wine tonight to relax after moving three metal cabinets into the conservatory/jewelry studio/wet studio and rearranging all the furniture in there. I don't know what to call that room. It's a little glass greenhouse added onto the side of the house, and it has a tile floor with a drain in the middle of it (and a sink on one wall) so I can refer to it as the wet studio. It's also where I set up my jewelry bench and torch. Oh and my soap making and bookbinding materials. And ikebana tools and books. And all the tools I don't have a workbench or a shop for yet (they're still in boxes until I get the inside tool room and the wood shop set up).Today I unpacked three or four boxes, cleared some of the floor off, and got ready to think about making jewelry in there. I say thinking about as last night jewelry class did not go very well and I am still feeling a bit beaten up from it. I posted a picture yesterday afternoon of the bracelet I have been working on and it was at the first level of polish. I took it all the way to final polish and started to set the stones when I ran into a problem: The bezel settings were too work-hardened to bend so I had to hammer the bezels around the stones. Unfortunately, hammering caused the big bezel to break away from the cuff in two places and I had to start all over again with the soldering, stone-setting and polishing. This time I will polish the silver after the stones are set so the metal doesn't get to hard to bend.No glass was done today. I hold out hope for tomorrow--especially as the woman in China who sold me the glow-in-the-dark mineral pigment in June keeps prodding me to tell her how it fired. I need to get on that so I have a result for her--and for me too (though it doesn't look like we'll be remodeling our bathroom anytime soon).Now it's time to head off to drink a lot of water, take my diabetes med, and get some sleep. Good night moon."},
{"title": "Jewelry Day", "date": "Wednesday, August 23, 2017", "text": "Today is my most creatively-focused day in recent memory. With the exception of filling out our benefits forms for the annual open enrollment, I have been working in some form or art or other all day. I started the morning with a piano lesson. I am working on a Bach prelude and it is seriously kicking my butt, but today my head broke through the clouds and I was able to catch mistakes as I made them because of sound, not sight reading.As soon as I finished piano I hopped in the car and headed to the Creative Side Jewelry Academy for a four-hour open studio session to make up for the class I missed Monday night. Today was all about polishing and finishing. Fussy work that nonetheless has its own zen and joy. I was hoping to get the stones set in the bracelet I have been working on for a few weeks, but I still have one polish left. I am going to do the final polish first thing at tonight's class before it officially starts so I can get help from the instructor on getting the stones into the bezels. The actual setting (clamping the bezel down around the stones) I can do at home later this week as I have the tools. After I get the bracelet done, I'll do the last soldering (of the bead post and safety clasp) for the silver hollow-form ring I'm working on.If I get those two projects done I'll be caught up and ready to start on the final project for the class: A kinetic sculptural necklace. I am going to do a large hollow pendant that has a couple of hinged doors on the front which open to reveal tube-set stones on the inside. I am thinking to use citrine and maybe some of the sapphires I had cut from our mining adventure in Montana this past summer for the stones as I would like to use real stones, and citrine is the only real faceted stone we have available in class. Coincidentally, Dave and Jessie's birthstones are citrine and sapphire so I can see a family-love-theme thing going.One of the last projects I was working on at the Spruill Center For the Arts when I was taking jewelry classes there with Mom and Becky was a copper hollow-form heart with the first-name initials of my family members showing through swiss-cheese like holes in the front of the piece. I never did finish it, but I could see doing it now.Now off to class to create some more!"},
{"title": "Back To My Glass Incarnate Roots", "date": "Tuesday, August 22, 2017", "text": "It was a Tuesday. Tuesdays are days when I catch up from Monday. I watered the garden today (and managed to remember to turn the water off when I was done so I didn't flood the pond this time). And I took Dave to work and Jessie to school. And I designed the glass for the kitchen cabinet doors. That last one was my big accomplishment.I started out the project absolutely certain I was doing stained glass for the cabinets. But the design I came up with is just not really feasible for stained glass. I wanted something that was a flowing river of one-inch glass squares in many colors continuing from one door to the next. But I didn't really want squares. Instead I wanted squares with rounded corners. I love the look of the design, but the rounded corners would be extraordinarily difficult--especially given the number of squares and the number of doors--and I'm not even sure I could do them so that they would come out as good as they are in my mind. Cutting the lead would be a nightmare. As I was looking at the finished design and trying to come up with a way it would work I said to Dave, \"This would be easy in fused glass.\" And the lightbulb went off.I guess my creative force really wanted to do these doors as individual panes of fuse glass. However there's a big difference between the clarity of antique or semi-antique glass and glass that's been fired on a kiln shelf (however non-textured). What to do to make the clear portion of the doors look textured so the contents of the cabinets can't be seen through them, and yet have the transparent colored squares be as untextured as possible? I have some ideas, which I can't wait to start on Thursday--I'm already booked all day tomorrow. The first option I'm thinking of is tack-fusing and using large frit in the clear areas. Should I not like the look of that option, I have several other texturing options available from lava cloth or fiber paper to sculpted kiln wash. Whichever option I end up going with, I have plenty of glass to make them!"},

Tomorrow I have the CT scan to check out my right kidney One More Time, and tomorrow night Dave and I get to see Jason Isbell being taped live at Austin City Limits (he won the tickets at work). Life is good, right? Right! And yet I flounder. Today is my 440th day in this house. I look around and much has been done, much is in the process of being done (but currently languishing as I'm not doing anything), and much is left to do. I look around, and I have no idea what to do next. I actually came to the brink of tears today as I thought of next week and what I should do. I love the classes I am taking, and I am focused, driven, energized and productive in them. But at home, I become paralyzed and spend a lot of time not doing anything. I am honestly overwhelmed by how much I have started and how I am going to finish it all before I die (not in any time soon!).Part of my inability to move on something (anything) is because of the heat. Projects that happen outside, in the glass studio, or in the conservatory (the proto jewelry and bee products/soap studio) just can't happen right now because I have totally expended my outdoor time for the week taking care of the bees, pond, and gardens. For the rest of my time I need air conditioning.But the bigger part of my paralysis is not attributable to any obvious root cause. Today it was so bad that I went to Dave and asked to task me with three medium-sized things that he would like me to do for the house this week--something started that he would like to see finished. He looked at me like I had lost my mind, but I figured that his request would stimulate me to doing something, and at the end of the week if I accomplished what he asked, we could celebrate the win together. Mainly I am hoping that these three things will jumpstart me into finishing other projects--be they for the house or my own creative outlets.After a bit of hesitation he came up with something, and what he asked filled my heart with joy and my body with energy. A bit of background: I asked him right as I was about to head off and take a nap this afternoon, but I was so enthused by his response that I sat down to post several entries in both blogs. So what does he want? Me to do the measurements, design the layout, and choose the glass for the kitchen cupboard doors and backsplashes (behind the sink and next to the fridge). I got so excited that I expanded the project to putting the front door back on and doing the design for the door, sidelights and transom. And there are my three projects.

{"title": "Bees, Bees, Bees!", "date": "Saturday, August 19, 2017", "text": "Cissus trifoliataToday was the Tour deHives, and I met some lovely people! We had five groups (11 people in all) who came out to see the apiary, and we sat in the shade, sipped iced tea and lemonade, and talked bees and plants. I loved it, and I learned a lot. For example, I have been noticing this fleshy vine that looks a lot like a slightly succulent variety of poison ivy coming up all over the new beds and in the yard. Turns out it's not poison ivy, it's a relative of Virginia creeper call cow-itch or sorrelvine. I found two different scientific names for it: Cissus insisa from the Texas Native Plants Database from Texas A&M, and Cissus trifoliata from the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center plant database. Both of them have the same common names associated with them. It's a member of the grape family, a vigorous climber, and--like Virginia creeper--is loaded with toxic levels of oxalic acid in both the leaves and the fruit. It can also cause a skin rash, which is probably why one of the landscapers swore it was poison ivy. Curiously, oxalic acid is one of the common treatments in bee hives for varroa mites. One of the people on the Tour de Hives today speculated on potential benefits from bees pollinating the Cissus and possibly introducing a natural source of oxalic acid into the hives that might affect the mite population.I also found out today that one of the oak tree species I have growing in the garden is the Lacey oak. Someone on the tour asked me what one of the existing trees in our botanical garden was, and I didn't know. But I had all my Texas gardening and bee books out for the tour so I was able to look it right up. I only have a couple of these trees, and they are extremely slow growers so mine could be over 20 years old. As I was looking at it today, I had the thought that I might have planted the olive tree too close to it. I guess it depends how much the olive tree is going to grow.Tomorrow is the day of bee lectures and I am signed up for the 201 class with a talk at 10:00 by Les Crowder who is one of the foremost TopBar beekeeping experts in the country. Though I would like to spend one last quiet day with the family before school starts on Monday, I can't miss the opportunity to hear Les speak. Maybe he'll tell me why my TopBar bees are so cranky..."},

Then I'm going to clean up contractor debris, water plants, and wait for people to come ogle my apiary. That's a less filthy activity than it sounds and not a euphemism. As I wait I'll weed. So even if no one comes by (not that I expect that outcome), I'll have a good time and get a lot done.For the afternoon I'm supposed to head in to the rest of the TdH activities at Zilker Botanical Gardens.

I always loved getting ready for school and the excitement of the first weeks and seeing my friends and starting new classes. Jessie, not so much. She likes being alone up in her rooms and occasionally coming down to forage for food. School is a just-bearable nightmare for her.

I was focused, energetic--I felt like I could take on the world. I honestly also felt like I was at the midpoint of my life. You know how you have kind of a running gauge of how many grains of sand you have left in your hourglass? Well I do anyway. And lately I have been feeling in the 20-25 year grain range. Not a short life, but more behind the cart than in front. Yesterday and today I felt like I was at the halfway point. I thought, \"Wow! B12! Who knew?\"Then someone on Facebook asked me what I was taking and I looked it up on the Internet. No wonder I'm feeling so good--my vitamins go under the name PepPods, and they are an energy tablet--caffeine and all. They are for hardcore rock climbers, skiers, skateboarders, triathletes, and obstacle course distance runners to take them to the next level of hydration and vitamin, energy, electrolyte balance. And, oh yes, they have 71 mg of caffeine (in my formula). Whatever they are, I'm sold. According to my doctor they are a high-quality source of B12 and other vitamins, and that's what I need.Tonight after going out for great Mexican food with Dave, I went over to Zaga's to join her and Jessie and learn to play craps. It was so fun! I lost all my chips--as did Zaga--but Jessie managed to end the evening with $650. She didn't know how much she started with (none of us did), but she was definitely up. I had a monster streak where I just kept rolling and winning for all of us and we all had several hundred dollars, but then we had three crap-out-right-away shooters in a row, and all the money was gone. Good lesson in gambling: Just that quickly you an lose it all. But it was fun, and we listened to Frank Sinatra as we played.Now I need to get some sleep before heading to Zilker Botanical Gardens tomorrow for a class on making products from bee stuff--lip balm, lotion and candles. I had a lot more interesting things to say in this post throughout the day, but sadly they flitted in and out of my mind and I did not capture them for regurgitation here. Maybe tomorrow."},

I had a wonderful date night out with my spouse where we played Hive and only talked a little bit about politics. I read an article in the NY Times today about China's drive toward technological dominance and intellectual property and mentioned it to Dave, and then I headed down the Trump-Is-Evil-Scum path bringing up fracking, coal, the diminishing of solar and wind power in this country and their rise in China. That discussion was maybe 10 minutes out of the 24 hours of my day and it was the only thing I did that was not completely centered on my tiny life. No, that's not quite true. I did watch the entire anti-fascism film \"Don't Be a Sucker\" made by the War Department in 1947 that Bill linked to on his Facebook feed. I had previously seen the much shorter edited version that Al Jazeera English put out. It's worthwhile to watch the entire clip. Nevertheless, I didn't give a thought to Charlottesville, Trump's ongoing twit idiocy, or Heather Heyer.When I sat down to write this post tonight I was going to delve into the intricacies of my vitamin B12 deficiency, newly diagnosed diabetes, and the news from the doctor that I have the liver of a teetotaling teenager (I wonder when she'll want it back?). I was going to mention some of the current issues with the contractor litigation, show off the progress I made on my hollow-form jewelry project last night, and ramble on a bit about the upcoming Tour de Hives. But the ugliness of current days overwhelmed me, and I couldn't continue the banal little post I had started.There are serious things happening in our country now--more so than in a very long time. (Cynthia Morgan posted a link on Facebook to Jim Wright's post on his blog Stonekettle Station about the late '60's and George Wallace. I don't remember that time--I was too young, and I lived in Western Montana. Maybe had I lived in a city that burned or even had large populations of minorities--any minorities--I would remember more.) There is an alarming amount of hatred, bigotry, stupidity, and the rise of the lowest common denominator not only in this country but in the world. Though I can't keep up the level of moral outrage that the times deserve, every once in awhile I have to stand up and be counted as one of the outraged and to acknowledge that I am very privileged, and with great privilege comes great responsibility. I will not forsake my neighbor, I will continue to stand against injustice and prejudice, and if necessary, I will march. I don't know where I'll march to, but I'll march and I'll vote."},

This is the culmination of many months of work for me from the redesign to the remodel to the furnishing, ending with photographing and writing up the listing. It feels so good to have it DONE!Though I have by no means completed my course of action, I decided upon one and followed it through into the in-process stage on my issues with our contractor. I am tired of thinking about the state of the place and all the things he left unfinished as I go to sleep every night. I am tired of dreaming about it and waking up feeling it looming over me. Today I got a recommendation for a good lawyer, I had my first consultation with him, and he gave me my assignment of exactly what he needs me to send him tomorrow so he can draft a letter and craft a proposal. Though we are far from done, I still feel a huge sense of relief to have made my decision and started down a path. Sometimes just starting something feels like the biggest accomplishment.Jewelry class tonight was incredible. We started our hollow-form project and I decided to create a ring based on one I saw last year. I got all the walls for it cut and the side pieces textured so Wednesday I should be able to whip through soldering on the sides (knock wood) and get to sawing and filing. Hollow form is really cool, but there is a lot of cold work to it.This weekend is the 5th Annual Tour de Hives and our apiary is one of the stops. Think I'll spend some time tomorrow planning what I'll have out for people to look at (books on bees and pollinator plants) and cleaning up the garden a bit. More on that tomorrow.

My new hat: rental property manager. Here are some ready-to-rent photos.The drudge part of the day was preparing all of my documentation on our contractor's lack of completion on all the projects here (projects for which he has already been paid). I need all the documentation and photos (not the nice photos of the apartment shown here but other, bad photos of shame and neglect) as support for the succinct statement I am writing up to tell the lawyer what I paid, what the contractor did (and did not do), what he said he'd do, and what I want from him now. I also have to find the right lawyer. I thought looking on AVVO would be an good idea, but Dave looked at me in horror when I said that's where I was looking, and immediately sent me a link to Ken White's blog post on Popehat \"How To Cold-Call A Lawyer: A Potential Client's Guide\". My favorite highlights are below, but it's well-worth reading the whole post.Living room, breakfast nook, kitchen\"However, on occasion, you'll need a lawyer with an obscure specialty, or in a remote area where you don't know anyone, or you won't have time to seek a recommendation, or you'll be a reclusive misfit with no friends like me, and you'll not be able to six-degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon your way into a connection with the sort of lawyer you need. In these circumstances, you might find one online, through a Google search or a lawyer search site or in the Yellow Pages. You might even call the local Bar Association — though in my experience you might as well ask the cat.\"\"Prepare for the call: Oh, sweet Jesus, please prepare for the call.\"Kitchen\"Especially if you are calling a lawyer to talk about suing someone rather than facing criminal charges or a lawsuit against you, think about how to explain what you want. If you can't summarize what the problem is and what you want in four sentences, keep thinking until you can. This is especially a problem if you are one of those people, bless their hearts, who cannot explain a straightforward situation in less time it would take James Joyce fully to explore the tension between autonomy and religion.\"Master bedroom\"So: prepare for the call the way you would for a wedding toast at a wedding where the mother of the bride is sitting next to you and is notoriously violent and has personally informed you that if you speak for more than forty-five seconds she will be jabbing you in the crotch with an oyster fork.\"\"A lawyer is not there to tell you what you want to hear. If you insist on a lawyer who will only tell you what you want to hear, you will eventually wind up with one who is (1) meek, and therefore a shitty lawyer, (2) dishonest, and therefore a shitty lawyer, or (3) so desperate for work that they will put up with your bullshit, and therefore a shitty lawyer.\"Second bedroom\"And lawyers are human, at least in the bundle-of-flaws sense. So if you are curt and abrupt, if you are openly incredulous at what the lawyer says, if you treat the lawyer openly like someone who is out to cheat you (as opposed to doing so subtly, which is perfectly sensible), if you can't let the lawyer speak a complete sentence without interrupting, if you negotiate in a contemptuous manner as if you are buying a fake Rolex off a guy in an alley, then the lawyer is not going to be enthused about you, and his vestigial humanity is going to lead him to turn you down or charge you more or resent you and work less hard for you. He can't spit in your food the way waiters will if you act like bad consumers, but he can do stuff that's far, far worse. Pretend that the lawyer is a human being with feelings, and things will go much smoother.\"BathroomIt felt a bit like cheating to quote so much of his post instead of writing my own, but it was so damn good I just couldn't resist. And if you liked that one, you'll also like his \"So You've Been Threatened With A Defamation Suit\". This one came to mind in part because I do blog about my experiences, I am considering leaving really shitty (completely honest) reviews for the contractor as part of my process, and I just read the cautionary tale of the Dallas couple who social-mediaed their wedding photographer right out of business and she just won a million dollar defamation suit against them.

Did you have your ice scoop in the ice bin?\"No. Never. \"Well it was probably in there sometime and it caused the error.\"Really, no.\"Or you had a power surge or lost power. That happens in the Hill Country a lot. You can Google it.\"Uh huh. So how do you fix it?\"I'll call and get the reset sequence from tech support, I can't remember which buttons to push.\"A phone call, a few buttons pushed, and then:\"There all set.\"But what if it happens again?\"If it happens again, you can reset it by flipping the breaker.\"This was the same solution he gave me on his last service call when the range locked up... Really Thermador? Your solution for problems with your Pro series appliances is to have the customer flip their breaker?!? I asked why I couldn't use the same reset sequence he had.\"The reset sequence is just for service technicians, customers are supposed to flip the breaker.\"I don't want to flip the breaker. We had our breaker box replaced this year when we got solar and it isn't relabeled yet. I have no idea which breaker is for the fridge.\"That's not Thermador's problem.\"It's not rocket science to use the reset button. I do it on my laptop, my router, my cell phone, why can't I do it for the fridge?\"I can't tell you the reset sequence because if you used it and screwed up the refrigerator settings, I would have to come out again and you would have to pay for the service call because you aren't supposed to use the reset buttons. Anyway, I fixed the same problem for another woman over a year ago and it hasn't happened again. If it does happen again you might need a software update, or we'll have to replace the icemaker.\"Why can't you do the software update while you're here?He looked appalled that I had even asked and replied, \"I can't do the software update because I'd have to do it for all of your appliances.\"Okay, my bad here because I let him get away with saying that as if it were reasonable instead of saying, okay, update all the software. But when the E30 error came up again tonight--just over 24 hours since the technician \"fixed it\"--I called customer service and a very nice woman took down my issue--both with the fridge and with the tech--and said, \"I will pass it on to the appropriate people\".So the appropriate people will call me Monday\"\"Monday or Tuesday.\"Sigh. Here we go again. I thought I posted the saga of the Thermador dishwasher on Blogger with how long it took to get it replaced (also Thermador) after it arrived and was installed broken. But apparently I just fumed to myself. It was a couple of months to get a replacement and took the intervention of a VP from corporate who called me after I left a scathing review on their Facebook page. Let's hope the icemaker problem is resolved easier."},
{"title": "Thamnophis Proximus Rubrilineatus aka Phil", "date": "Friday, August 11, 2017", "text": "A Thamnophis proximus rubrilineatus has taken up residence in our pond. I am going to call him Phil--or Philomena if she starts carrying her babies around on her back which I have heard the moms do. Phil is a redstripe ribbon snake. He has been in the pond for at least a couple of days now and I don't think he can get out. Dan and Zaga are convinced he can, but every time I see him he is on the same lily pad. These garter snakes do live by permanent bodies of water, are excellent swimmers, and eat mostly frogs so I am not surprised to see one by the pond. I am just surprised to see one so consistently IN the pond. Although as Dave said, why not? It's an all you can eat buffet for him.And I added lots more food today. Dan drained his pond to clear out the algae, and there were hundreds of tiny tadpoles in the skimmer box. They would have boiled in there had I left them so I scooped the water--leaves, tadpoles, and all--into a bucket and carried it (one bucket at a time) over to my pond and dumped it in. I was raining sweat by the time I finished (and I'll admit, somewhat dizzy from the heat), but I think I got every last one of the tadpoles. Now we'll see how many of them can evade the fish, the snake, and the other frogs who would probably eat them, and grow up into fat frogs.Speaking of frogs, there were a lot fewer of them in the pond today then there have been. There were a few hiding in the leaves of the lilies, and a few more nestled into the algae on the bottom, but there was definitely not a frog on every pad as there was a week ago. I wonder if it's Phil or his cousins who a making them wary. Well, if I need more frogs, there are two basins in the back yard that are part of the non-working stream that have water in them and which are also full of tadpoles. The water is totally disgusting, but apparently the frogs like it anyway.Now it's time for me to toddle off to bed as my right hand is still terribly swollen from yesterday's beestings and it hurts to do just about everything (including type) with it."},
{"title": "Life's Wisdom", "date": "Thursday, August 10, 2017", "text": "I learned a new lesson today when I was working with the bees. Actually I learned two: 1) When examining the hives, be 100% present. Don't get distracted, and don't talk. 2) Don't exert an area after it's been stung. The first of those bits of sagacity probably doesn't need any explanation, but the second might be a bit more obscure.I got stung four times in rapid succession today. The first sting was from a random bee that flew out of nowhere and maybe didn't even mean to sting me but collided with the index finger on my left hand and ended up stinging me on the underside below the first knuckle. If she didn't mean to sting me it was a tragic accident for her as he lost her life. I quickly scratched the stinger out and then went over and rubbed my hand in the dirt of the garden thinking that would take care of any residual attack pheromones from the sting. Apparently the dirt didn't work as I got stung right away three more times, twice on my right hand and once on my stomach through my clothes. These stings all hurt significantly more than the ones I've had previously, but the pain stopped pretty soon and I snagged the stingers out of all of them right after I got them. I also stopped doing hive inspections as I wasn't up to either more pheromone-driven bee frenzy with the rest of the hives or putting on a full bee suit and gloves to continue.All was fine--minimal swelling, a bit of tingling itch--until I decided to weed a garden bed. John from Wicked Bee Apiary fortuitously came by to do hive inspections for me today as I was supposed to be in Montana and had forgotten to tell him I wasn't. So  hung out and pulled weeds with my right hand for a good 45 minutes. By the time I finished my hand was all swollen on top and very painful from the venom being moving around from the exertion. Stupid move. The left hand--which I didn't use to weed--didn't swell. Now several hours later the right is still very swollen and very painful.  We don't have Benadryl, but I did take another antihistamine earlier. Don't think it did diddly squat.While I am sharing life's wisdom learned, I have another tidbit: don't drink coconut water from Thailand--even in aseptic containers--if it is six months out of date. So a miserable evening all around. But like Annie and Scarlett O'Hara, I look to tomorrow as a better day. A day when I might be able to use my right hand again. Glad I didn't have jewelry class tonight!"},
{"title": "Accepting Limitations", "date": "Wednesday, August 09, 2017", "text": "For the chronically overextended and project-driven, it can be difficult to strike a balance between accomplishing your goals and getting things done, and pushing yourself so hard that you break. I mused as I was posting last night that the list of things I had down for today was not reasonable, and if I pushed to do them all I would not only not enjoy any of them, but I would also probably fail. Since the jewelry class is the last project of the day--and the one requiring the most focus, energy and stamina--that's the one at which I would likely fail. As I am also looking forward to it the most, I really don't want to poop out before it's done. The conundrum raised by the timing of the activities of today has pushed me to a conclusion: I can only do three things a day.Another way of looking at it is that I can (should) not schedule more than 6-7 hours a day. Three of today's projects (piano, blood work done at the lab, and jewelry class) take up 7-1/2 hours including driving, and two of them require total continuous focus. That's enough. I am not going to get the pictures of the contractor's unfinished work taken today. I am not going to work in the apartment getting it ready to rent. I am not going to spend three hours in the studio working on orders. I am not going to do my hive inspections in the apiary. I am not going to talk to a lawyer about my options with the contractor. All of those things are going to need to be parceled out over the rest of the week. Probably in groups of three.The upshot of deciding to go about life this way is that I know and acknowledge going into a day that there are projects that will not progress at all that day. Heretofore I have always started each day holding a shining ideal of progress on everything I have in the air. As the day went on I would let things drop as they would, and I'd let all the balls fall at the end of the day with a \"Whew!\" and a recap of the many things I did get done. Then I'd philosophically assign the didn't-get-to's to the next day... and the next... and the next. But now I have to squarely face, first thing in the morning, that there are projects I am not even going to try to touch. As they sit they will stay until the day arrives that is their day to be one of the three. Their day may not be tomorrow or the next day either, and I am going to have to be good with letting them languish. How odd to have reached my mid-fifties without accepting this reality. But I can't recover from overdoing like I used to. A good night's sleep used to set me to rights and I could wade into the deep end again the day after a long, hard day of work. Now I have to plan a little more carefully because my supply of energy isn't inexhaustible, and it takes sometimes a full day or more to bounce back after really pushing hard. I am no longer the hare, I have become the tortoise. Sigh.On the plus side, this kind of a schedule allows for naps, and I am proactively going to nap this afternoon to prepare for tonight's class so I can hit the ground running at 5:30 and not look up until 10:30. Tomorrow the bees, the photos, and working in the glass studio. Friday the lawyer, the apartment, more studio time, and lining up new contractors to finish the open projects. Or maybe that fourth one will wait till Monday and Friday I will act upon the information I get from the lawyer as to my options. Now off to nap."},

The day winds down. Today's primary accomplishment was having a physical and arranging to have a full panel of blood work done tomorrow. The upshot so far is that I do have higher blood pressure than I should, and I have been put on a low dose of blood pressure medication. After the labs tomorrow I'll have to wait a week for the results (cholesterol, thyroid, diabetes, anything else weird going on) and then another week to have the CT scan and x-ray of the kidney (again). Life goes on.Even Kaiju is napping with his peepsSince my contractor let me down so badly I have to do a reconciliation tomorrow of everything I paid him, and then I have to take pictures of everything that is not done so I can follow up with legal action. Sigh. I am not looking forward to it--it's just that much more to do and all of it entailing negative energy. There will be no creative joy associated with going after him financially. It will be disheartening, tiring, and drudgery. But it's my job as household manager--and also as the person who mistakenly trusted him so thoroughly and paid him in advance.But I will start the day with a piano lesson which gives me joy, then the medical lab work (considerably less joy), a couple of kiln loads (the joy meter rises), photographing the contractor negligence (all the joy sucked right out of me) a nap (add 10 joy points if I'm joined by a cat, 20 points for two), and then another marathon jewelry class (exhausting joy). I am proactively planning the nap because the instructor for the jewelry class has offered the opportunity to start 30 minutes early and end 30 minutes late, and I'm not going to turn that down, so I know I have an intense five hours to end the day tomorrow."},

The day started about 6 am with a loud thunderstorm right on top of the hotel. Dave said there was a half straight of lightning show. I mostly slept through it. Now almost four hours later it's still pouring. NOT good weather in which to harvest cochineal! But I will persevere. I just hope is stops raining before we go so I can do it. Even for a good natural dyestuff I am not going to sit out in the rain and scrape bugs off of a plant.--------------------------------My bench in jewelry classOkay I lied. I stood out in the rain and collected bugs from cacti for dye. It was the experience points that made me do it. It rained all the way home and when we arrived we found the pond so full it had clearly overflowed a bit. At least I get out of watering the garden for the next couple of days. The drive was tough so when we got home I napped. I was supposed to get a kiln load in, but I was still lethargic from the weekend.And it was a good thing I napped or I never would have made it through my first Jewelry 201 class tonight. Wow. It's billed as a four hour class, but it's really more like five and we really move through the material. The first two classes (today and Wednesday) we are to design a bezel-set piece with corners, make our own bezel wire from sheet with shears and the the rolling mill, and completely solder the bezel for the stone (in my case two stones). I made it, but I am wrung out.Now it's time to sleep. I finally have my physical and meet my primary care physician tomorrow."},
{"title": "What a Sybaritic Day", "date": "Sunday, August 06, 2017", "text": "Something else to buildI am pretty sure napping until 8 pm is not going to turn out to have been a very good idea. Dave also napped until after 7:30 and Jessie has been immersed in a 3-D rendering engine plug-in to a piece of video-editing software she likes to use so there was no one to put the sleep brakes on. Dave, good hunter gather that he is, is off to scope out the restaurants and grounds to see what dinner options exist. No, he is not checking out the population of massive black squirrels that roam the property for possible entrée options, he is looking to see if they have a BBQ going on the lawn tonight. Turns out there is no BBQ tonight, but there are both buffet and menu dining options in the cafe, and a pared-down version of the same menu in the pub.Even the squirrels lounge hereI spent the day today carrying an unopened bottle of champagne around the resort from lounging pleasure spot to eating place to lounging pleasure spot, never quite feeling like opening it. I know! How did that happen?! First there was the hanging lounger outside the spa (the hanging bed was taken). Then there was the hanging bed. Then there was lunch. Then there was the lazy river in tubes. Then there was the epic nap. Now stirrings of appetite awaken and it might be time to go find food again. I'll probably be up till after midnight since I just finished sleeping for three hours (!), but who cares? This is vacation. The pets are all being lovingly spoiled by Zaga so there is no guilt, and I have a night and half a day left before I have to care about anything again. The effortless ballet of familial enjoyment goes on.My first roost of the dayOh, and tomorrow I'm going to harvest the cochineal bugs off of the cactus outside of our room here so I can make red dye out of them when we get home. I do not think, however, that I will try to raise them myself and start propagating my own cochineal. The amount of red dyestuff I will get tomorrow will probably be enough to dye one skein of embroidery-floss-sized yarn."},
{"title": "I Soak Up Relaxation and Energy Reserves", "date": "Saturday, August 05, 2017", "text": "Life has been complicated for the past couple of years. Mom died, we moved to Texas, I sold my studio building and have restructured my business, we have been in non-stop renovation mode for over a year, Dave started a new job, Jessie started high school, and I am now having health issues exacerbated by age. Complicated. And difficult. Even Montana was, well I won't say ruined because it wasn't that bad, but it was definitely sub-optimal this summer due to life's difficulties.This weekend we are stepping out of time and obligation and chaos for a three-day family vacation at the Hill Country Hyatt Resort and Spa outside of San Antonio. We are all hanging out together, and yet we're also doing the individual things we each want to do. Today was the first day and it was amazing. In order to get us here early I made a spa appointment for a pedicure at 9:00 at the Windflower Spa. That meant we had to get up at 6:30 to be out the door by 7:15. While I had a pedicure, Dave had breakfast and Jessie hung with me in the spa. Then Jessie and I had breakfast while Dave checked into our room and got into his swimsuit for a day in the water. It was like a well-choreographed ballet with each of us swimming in and out of the others' orbits, and it happened effortlessly. There were no long discussions about who wanted to do what where when. We just did our thing(s) and the day flowed on. There was floating in inner tubes on the lazy river, there were massages, there was a nice dinner, and now there is lazy lounging in the room.I can feel my body recharging and filling with the energy I am going to need for fall. Dave had the I'm-on-vacation-so-I'm-not-coding creative burst which resulted in him coding a surprising amount of cool new functionality for his company. I didn't begrudge him at all because that's how creativity manifests: You empty your mind and all the wonderful ideas just flow in to fill it up. I dream in glass, wood, silver, clay, wool, and home design. Dave dreams in code. I'm not sure what Jessie dreams in--I didn't ask her what she was working on today. Maybe she was just relaxing. (And freezing--right now she has a knitted hat on and is huddled under a blanket on the couch because it's so cold to her. I'm hot-flashing. Guess who got to set the thermostat.)Tomorrow will be filled with more of the same as will half the day Monday. Monday afternoon we'll finally wend our way back to Austin, but until then I'm a creative energy sponge."},
{"title": "All About Photography and Line Cutters", "date": "Friday, August 04, 2017", "text": "There's hardly anything you can do as an entrepreneur that doesn't require photography. As a glass artist I need photos of my work. As the owner of a rental property, I need pictures of the property. Heck, even as a blogger I need photos because nothing but words, words, words would get really boring! So today I spent a lot of time on photography. Oh I didn't take any pictures of the apartment, nor did I take any pictures of my work. But I got out the new camera and shot a few pictures in the garden, and then I spent an hour trying to get them off of the camera... Yet a few more things that are still in Montana (card reader, charge card, camera usb cable). But that's okay, replacements for these are quick and cheap from Amazon, and will be here Monday.Photography also came up earlier in the day when I asked Zaga to do a walk through of the apartment and she said I needed art on the walls. I didn't want to go buy something generic from a chain, I don't have any extra work that we are not displaying in the house, and I can't afford to just go out and buy all new one-of-a-kind work or even prints. But what I do have are a lot of good photos, and I was lucky enough to find a Groupon for a company that prints photos onto canvas and I got three 30X20 canvas prints for $29 each and two 16X20's for $17 each. That is a SUPER deal, and I had three large landscapes from Glacier National Park printed on the 30X20's and a deer at the National Bison Range and a mountain goat from the Park printed on the 16X20's. Supposedly I will have them in 7-10 days. I'm not going to wait that long to do the initial photography of the apartment, but I'll keep updating the marketing photos as I have new, cute things to add.And that's the happy part of the post. For the rest, I would love it if I never drove out shopping again. As I was getting into line at CostCo a woman walked in front of my cart and pointed for her partner (who had their cart) to get in line. In front of me. She saw I was getting my cart to the line, she didn't have their cart (and was therefore more maneuverable) so she cut in, and looked at me flatly, daring me to say anything. I didn't make a fuss, but I fumed. As they were finishing checkout and my stuff came up the conveyor belt, a plant I had tipped over and spilled little pebbles all over their package of steak. The clerk laughed nervously and said something about sorry for any pebbles on the steak (package). I commented under my breath that that's what happens when you cut in line. My aggression was passive.Then I went to Home Depot looking for new knobs for the cabinets in the apartment. It sounds petty, but they were white plastic and are now all yellowed and gross so I decided to replace them. I found some nice black ceramic ones for 97¢ each, but they only had 20 and I needed 34. So I asked an employee if he could help me, and he said no but took me over to a man working in that department so he could assist. That man was cutting a key for a woman so I stood there patiently waiting and the other employee stood with me too. Just as the man handed the woman her cut key another man walked up, handed him a key and said, \"I need three of these.\" The man I was waiting for calmly took the key and started to duplicate it--saying nothing to me. The new customer also ignored me. I said, \"Excuse me, I've been waiting and I would like help with these knobs.\" The employee said nothing to me just went on calmly cutting the keys, and the customer went on calmly waiting for the keys as if I hadn't said anything, as if I weren't there. Then the guy took his keys and left, the employee walked me over to the knobs, fiddled around with his inventory device a bit and told me there were no more. I calmly said thank you, put all the other  knobs back in the bin, put the empty shopping bucket on the floor, and walked out. As I headed to the exit I had to pass by the man who cut in front of me for keys and I walked up to him at the self-checkout and said, \"I have to know, did you intentionally cut in front of me to get your keys or did you just not see me?\" He said he didn't see me, he had been painting all day, and whatever. I said, \"Huh. This is the third time I was cut off today and I'm beginning to feel invisible\", and I walked away. (The first time I was cut-off was driving to the store.)As I drove home there arose another moment when someone didn't want to wait through the line going straight at an intersection and so got in the lane that had to turn left and then tried to cut over. Actually there were two cars who tried to cut over, both of them tried to cut in front of me but the first one didn't push it. The second one did and started to come over into the lane while I was still there and I moved slightly out of the way and kept going, forcing him to drop back. He was very pissed and kept trying to get in a position where he could cut in front of me, but it didn't happen. That's it. I'm done driving and shopping. I can get everything I want on-line--especially since I was only able to find about 50% of what I needed in the actual stores. I was told at the stores that the other things I needed were available in their on-line stores.Tomorrow we're off to San Antonio to stay the Hill Country Resort for a long weekend. I think I'll let Dave drive. Zaga is pet and house sitting again--I really won the friend lottery with that one!!"},

The presentation was on hand planes--a tool that I knew I needed to get, but was unclear about exactly which one to start with. Tonight cleared that up nicely for me--and there's even a hand planing class coming up the end of the month! I don't know if I'll take it--I'm kind of class-heavy right now--but I am looking forward to getting my hands on one and trying it out.Today was (relatively) cool and overcast in Austin, and I didn't have to water any garden beds as we got good rain last night. I should've used the extra time this morning to set up the wood shop and unload the trailer, but I frittered. So tomorrow will be spent both in the glass studio on kiln loads--four orders to get out--and on wood shop set-up. Jessie worked in the apartment for me today getting the new beds made up and the dishes all washed and put away. We'll do pictures and make the listing live tomorrow.Dave added to his t-shirt collection today and I am afraid to admit it, but I really like the new one. It has a picture of Josef Stalin and reads: Dark humor is like food, not everyone gets it. Oh that's so wrong and so good at the same time.Now the coyotes are singing out back, and I need to chill after a long day.

In my defense, I did make it through my list today and I am feeling good about tomorrow. I also cleaned the kitchen and made progress on the laundry.The Art School at The Contemporary opened class registration today for members so to be sure I could get the classes I wanted, I registered for two sessions of pottery (running in succession) and a class in wood and metal with Zaga. The first pottery session and the wood and metal class start in September. I also signed up for an intermediate level jewelry making (silver smithing) class at the Creative Side starting next Monday and going Monday and Wednesday nights for four hours until the end of August. It's my end of summer hurrah and will, I hope, springboard me to finish setting up my own jewelry studio.In addition to art classes, I signed up for a couple of days of classes in beekeeping and beeswax products the weekend of the 18th, and my apiary is one of the stops on the Tour de Hives this year on August 19 (the classes are the 18th and the 20th)! While I am excited to be on the tour, I hope I haven't bitten off too much of an obligation. The tour hours are only 9-12, but I should probably have some info prepared about the apiary, what books I like, plant lists from the garden, etc.Lest it be thought that I am disregarding glass, I ordered stands from Bill and shipped two orders today with more firings and a shipment planned for tomorrow. Still haven't put in time on the glass website, but did finally kickstart an entirely new business endeavor today with the creation of a listing for our guest house (The Roost At Stone's Throw) on HomeAway. Tomorrow J and I will finish setting everything up in it and deploying the linens and furnishings we got today at Target. Then we (I hope Jessie) will take pictures and the listing will go live. Next stop: vacation rental manager! I am a woman of many hats. Oh, and this is a good time to mention that if you are planning to come visit you had better get me your dates soon so I can take the dates down from HomeAway."},

Later in the week I had settled in, but the days were still slow enough that I could do something in the morning, then rest, then maybe do something else and be done for the day, and rest some more. There was a lovely balance between the things I needed to get done and the amount of time in a day. Sadly that time has passed and I am right back to the speeded up version of life I experienced back in the spring before going to Montana.I get up early in the morning and go, go, go until evening. There is no time to nap or relax, and it's getting harder to get through everything on my list. Yesterday I made it through by the skin of my teeth, but today I didn't. So tomorrow I start the day finishing everything I didn't get to today--beginning with watering the garden which I only got half done today--and then I move onto tomorrow's tasks. How did this happen? Is it just because the entire family is back home? Do the pets and the spouse add that much more to my day? I don't think so. So what's going on? No idea so I just have to move on.The child is definitely helping lift my load. She has a lot of clothes that she wants to buy that aren't in the 'need' category and which are designer-ish and cost more than I would pay (a Rita Oro jacket from Adidas, for example) so she is working for money to get them. The other day she vacuumed and mopped the wood floors, today she unloaded the trailer and the mini-van, tomorrow she will dust the house and clean the apartment. Even so, I still feel inundated by all this stuff I have on my plate. Where did it all come from? Some of it is from the round of appointments I had to make for both Jessie and me to get ready for fall (doctor, dentist, etc.) and some of it is from the new round of home improvements and contractors I have started. Maybe everything will slow back down soon... but I doubt it.Part of making my life fuller comes with the fall round of classes at the Art School Laguna Gloria of the Contemporary. Registration for members (that's me!) begins tomorrow and I know pottery is in my future as is a wood and metal class with Zaga. Now I just have to decide about intro to watercolors. The drawing class I attempted last winter was less than successful as I missed the last third of the classes due to travel and other commitments. Maybe I should just stick with the two other classes for now and take up watercolors when I'm older.In the meantime there are still the shirts I planned to make for Dave this summer, the spinning project I started for the Tour de Fleece, the sweater coat I am knitting from the Tour de Fleece wool, the blue pine bed and desk project, the glass orders which have been coming in, caring for the botanical garden apiary and pond, getting the apartment finished and on the market for vacation rental, harvesting the prickly pear fruit for dye jelly and syrup, and finishing the homework for the Master Spinner level one. Oh yes, and beginning to work out regularly in an effort to improve my health.I am tired just thinking about all of it. Time to put in a load of laundry, clean up the kitchen and go to bed!"},

I did get a bee down my dress and up my leg today, but I calmly moved them along and I managed to get through inspection and feeding on all six hives without getting stung! Even as lightly as I was dressed I still had issues with the heat, but I made it.In between the errands and the administrivia that made up today, I also managed to squeeze in 20 minutes out by the pond. I added 33 new fish today--three medium/small koi and the rest were little comet goldfish, 19¢-35¢ each--and after I put them in I just sat on the upper edge in the shade by one of the waterfalls and just watched the fish and the frogs. It was so peaceful and wonderful--even though it was over 100º out there. While I was at the pet store (I went for dog food and got dog food and the fish) I saw they had turtles with a 5-6\" diameter shell, and I was really tempted. But the big fish will already eat the little fish, the frogs eat the fish and the fish eat the frogs (at least I suppose they all eat each other based on size) so the last thing I need to do is introduce something else to eat the fish AND the frogs. But turtles are so cool..."},
{"title": "Contentment--Even In Texas in July", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2017", "text": "Sunrise this morningAnd a long, good day comes to an end. Everything is in readiness for the spouse who is due to roll in in the next 20-30 minutes. All I have left on my list for the day is to post. So in hommage to the return of the spouse, I post on contentment.Contentment fills me in the morning when I water the garden and watch the frogs in the pond. It follows me into the cool, dark of the house when I am done, and accompanies me while I have breakfast and practice the piano. In the evening, it sings to me with the voice of the windchimes in the night breeze. And in the dark and quiet of the humid Texas nights, it dews my skin and relaxes me into sleep.No, Texas in July and August is nowhere I planned to or wanted to be. But now that I'm here (again--we were here last summer too), I'm getting back into the rhythm of outside in the early morning and late evening, and inside the rest of the day. As I still don't have A/C in the glass studio I also have to work early and quickly on glass. I don't see A/C in the studio ever being effective enough to really cool it down low enough to work in there in the summer even if I had it--it's hard enough keeping the house cool with the big A/C units; never mind the mini splits. But orders are picking up--two more came in over the weekend and there is another in the works. Guess a good project for the hot summer afternoons is to get off my ass and finish my website. I've been \"working on it\" for over a year (almost two years!) and I need to fish. I've cut enough bait.The orders will make Todd happy. He's been a bit worried that we were petering out--and it's my fault because I haven't been marketing or engaging our client base in any way for the past year. I had other priorities. I still do, but in order to afford those priorities, I need to make business a priority too. Art for art's sake and beauty is nice, but it doesn't pay the mortgage.I end my post tonight with a deep breath in, and a deep breath out. The spouse should be home any minute!"},

But life is too short. It'll all work out because it will, and I just need to move on.Instead, the big focus of the day is on my spouse who is currently in Colorado, wending his way back to us with pets in tow. Actually he has wood and woodworking tools (and lots of fiber stuff) in tow, and the pets are in the car with him. Jessie and I cleaned and prepared today for the Great Arrival, and we will finish up in the morning when it's still cool out. It was 105 degrees today and according to the weather service it felt like 106. That's just not civilized.Speaking of the spouse, he just called to let me know they had arrived at the motel in Colorado. He sounded... frazzled is a polite way to put it. After an experience normally only found in the sixth circle of hell or above--aka getting all the pets transferred from the car to the motel--they are all locked in the room for the night. Pavlova spent most of the day crying in her carrier--and the last few hours yowling--so I am guessing Dave's nerves are shot. The pets are lucky they weren't shot. One more day on the road, and they will all be back in the bosom of the family. That's me.Now it's also time for me to tuck in. Tomorrow night can't come soon enough for me--safe travels spouse!"},

Jessie and I had just started watching Chicken Run (for the 900 millionth time), and the network went out. A reboot of the modem didn't work so now I do the chat on-line thing using my phone as a hotspot. And now, for no explicable reason, it's on! The chickens are organizing again!Today I communed with my garden for three hours as I watered every single plant. It was soooo satisfying! On the top of the country, the day was far less peaceful. Dave--with much help from my Uncle Ed and Aunt Susan--packed up everything that needs to come from Montana back to Austin. They unloaded the trailer full of my parents' belongings that were stored in the lake property and moved down to the Polson house, and then Ed and Susan went to the lumber mill with the minivan and the trailer, and Daylen (the mill owner) cut down my slabs and the other lumber I needed for my bed project and had it all loaded into the trailer. The whipped cream on the top of my sundae came when I got a call from the freight company that they were delivering my last two pieces of woodworking equipment to the house just in time for it to be loaded into the trailer.12 ft blue pine slabs for bed before they were cut down to 8 ftNow it's all loaded and Dave and the animals are all resting (I hope) to be ready for the road tomorrow. Dave thinks it will be an easier drive than it was for him in the Mini Cooper on the way up (the Honda is nice to drive and has satellite radio). I am just hoping with all my heart that he and all the animals arrive here all safe 47 hours from now."},
{"title": "You Can Never Go Home", "date": "Thursday, July 27, 2017", "text": "My NemesisIn this case, I can't go back to Montana this summer. My medical stability is apparently in the crapper and it isn't wise to either fly (potentially more blood clots flying around my body, and untreated high blood pressure that could lead to stroke or heart attack) or be off in Polson with limited access to medical care should my infection not clear up or become worse now that I've pulled my stent out. Yup. I was a pioneer woman and I did what I had to do. Enough said. Except maybe, OUCH!!! So my flight is cancelled again--this time permanently. And now the fun begins...My husband, father of my child, love of my life, and provider extraordinaire has demanded to do something so far out of his wheelhouse that it's not even in the same dimension. And he's attacking it with gusto, bold bravado, and a confident swagger. Tomorrow--with help from my uncle and aunt--he is going to pack up all my stuff, Jessie's stuff, his stuff, our joint stuff (unloading and reloading the trailer with wood and equipment); put away the mini cooper; and shut the house up till we come back for the Great Wedding in September. Then Saturday morning at the earliest crack of dawn he is going to take to the open roads pulling a trailer with a minivan whose passengers are three dogs, two cats, 10 lbs of huckleberries, and (I hope) 20 lbs of cherries. He will brave the gas stations, rest stops, fast food joints, and La Quinta with nothing but his quick wits and his wallet to succor him.I am reminded of the words he wrote for our wedding invitation 22 years ago: \"The dangers fearsome, the odds incalculable, the rewards overwhelming, our love unbounded, we hope for your company as our adventure begins.\" The adventure this time begins Saturday, and it'll be all his. I have mapped his route, made his hotel reservation, lined up packing assistance, and made lists of things to pack. That's all I can do.Now I take a breath and mourn the last, lost half of my summer in Montana. Last year we didn't get to go at all, and this year felt short at only two months (we got spoiled with up to four months there when we were homeschooling). That two months just turned into one, and if it weren't for Ed (my uncle) and Susan's wedding in September there, it would have broken my heart not to go back now.But I am going to do my damnedest to have my health issues wrangled and under control so there is no question about me going to the wedding. First step: find a primary care physician tomorrow, get in, get a physical, and get on BP meds. Second step: lose the weight. I am at high risk for Type 2 diabetes and not doing my joints any favors by making them work so hard. Finally (oh Cynthia, isn't this fun?!?) I need to have a sleep study done to see if my snoring and occasional apnea are contributing to the rest of my issues. I may end up eating my words of this morning and having to wear one of those sleep thingies too.It's been a mad ride since we got back to Austin, and now (for me at least) it has stilled. I'll spread my mother's ashes in Montana in September. I'll clean and winterize the house there, ship back anything that might be missed in tomorrow's packing then too. Until then, it's time to dig back in at Stone's Throw and resume life and projects here."},
{"title": "Prickly Pear PINK", "date": "Wednesday, July 26, 2017", "text": "Cynthia is right: A good hobby can fix anything. I don't need to pick up a new hobby, I just need to re-pick-up an old one. Enter natural dyeing! Inspired by the prickly pear fruit I picked up this afternoon from the ground underneath our cacti, I just read \"harvesting color\" by Rebecca Burgess. Okay, I read the main text and only skimmed the recipes that interested me right now. Out of all the natural dye books I have--and trust me I have more than a few--this was the only one that used prickly pear fruit. Interestingly, the recipe calls for fermenting the fruit for a week or so and then soaking the fiber in the fermented mash for another week to ten days. Okay I can do all that, but the color she got is nothing I would spend 2-3 weeks on. She says you can get a pinkish tan. The photo at left is from the book listing on Amazon. It looks more yellow/gold to me, and is still not what I was hoping for.Of course one can't discount the wonders found on the Internet so I also looked up dyeing with prickly pear fruit there and the first hit was an incredible scientific paper \"Eco-friendly and protective natural dye from red prickly pear (Opuntia Lasiacantha Pfeiffer) plant\" from the Journal of Saudi Chemical Society.Though waaaay over my head in detail, I was able to understand the summary of the results just fine. They tested for different mordants, ph, temperature, salinity, several kinds of color-fastness, time in dye bath, pre and post mordanting. And they didn't say, \"Well, it looks a little darker if you do this.\" No, they used a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B UV/Vis Spectrophotometer and the Kubelka-Munk equation to measure color strength. I love these guys.The article--though eye-glazingly technical--was beautifully organized into short summary paragraphs that told me which mordant, pre and post, what ph, temperature, time, and amount of salt to use--with exact percentages!!!--to get the color I want. I am all touchy feely too, but being directed to sprinkle in \"a handful\" of this or a \"scant dash\" of that makes my skin itch. The only downside to the scientific approach is that they used a centrifuge to extract the Betalain pigment from the fruit. But, hey, Dave has been muttering about a centrifuge for cooking for awhile. Maybe we can share!Also out in the wonderful interweb is a lovely blog called Small Things written by Ginny Sheller. She has a post about trying the prickly pear dye recipe from \"harvesting color\", and her results are MUCH more what I was hoping for. Of course I don't know anything she might have done differently from the basic instructions in the book, but it at least gives me hope for a more attractive color. I'll wait to try out the serious-science recipe with more ripe fruit later in the fall. For now I'll just sling it all together in a bucket and watch it rot, er, ferment.Tomorrow I venture back into the yard and pick the remaining ripe fruit to take back to Polson with me on the plane. I have just enough time to do a fermented batch before we head back to Austin. Note to self: Wave the fruit over a gas flame to burn off all the micro spines before packing."},

I cannot imagine what it has been like for Cynthia over the past 10 months since the initial demise of Elmo (her replacement knee). It is only the second full day home from the hospital for me, and I am already jousting with boredom and maniacally plotting the very visceral demise of our (former) contractor. (Why the hell can't people follow through on what they commit to doing?!? It's a simple, little equation!!) And the exclamation points from my fingers fly like spittle from my lips. And I can. not. get. COMFORTABLE!!!! Argh!A big problem with the current picture is that I'm not supposed to be here. My brain is just now shifting to what-to-do-while-I'm-here mode as opposed to what-I-am-doing-in-Polson mode--and I am having to drag it kicking and screaming to here because it's just too damn hot for it to want to come! The body is not back to full form yet either so it's not like I can go out and wrestle a bear anyway. Oh, wait, that's what I would be doing in Polson. Here I guess I'm going to work on the final details in the apartment so we can rent it out at last this fall (Jessie is going to clean for me), and I'm going to pick cactus fruit! We have a ton ripening, and I am interested in it for both its natural pink dye and making preserves from it. Maybe I'll take some back to Polson with me. Or I'll just refrigerate it here...I did do the hive inspection with John this morning starting at 8:00 (and it was coolish out! Only 81!) though my role was relegated to observing over his shoulder as he knew where the hives had left off the week before and I also wasn't up to the task physically. It pangs to say that last bit. Later in the morning I fired two small kiln loads, thus checking off all the items on my list for the day. I couldn't even nap--too restless and sleep-saturated.There are a few things I can do over the next two days that won't be too taxing but will make the house more pleasant to come home to in a few weeks--for one thing I can crack the whip over the child and make her my cleaning slave... No, that's unfair. She already volunteered to clean the house for me and I am going to ask her to vacuum the wood floors on the main level and help me change the bed. I can easily sit and sort through papers to file or throw. And I can get all the garbage out of the house! Calming, deep breaths. Time to settle down for the night and rein in the dragon.

All functions seem to be back to normal, and except for some deep discomfort (the gnomes need to quit hammering on my right kidney!), we are moving past The Incident. Tomorrow I am meeting with my bee guy at 8:00 am to inspect the hives in the cool and without suits. There's no way I could bear a bee suit right now. Hey! I just looked down and my hands are no longer swollen! Between fluid retention and an IV catheter in one hand, they were looking pretty Stay Puft Marshmallow Man till just now. Another sign I am on the mend. After the bee inspection I'll probably nap--no need to go overboard on the regular life thing. I'll do a firing on three pieces I have due from last week in the afternoon.So nothing exciting to post about. Convalescence just seems to drag on in slow motion.

Of course it's not like I did anything with my newly-won freedom. I came home and slept a lot. And peed (I know, back to the TMI, but there's only so much sleep you can get when you have to get up every 1-2 hours to hobble-race to the bathroom).Unlike Cynthia, I left the hospital without interacting with and learning a fascinating story with one single person who wasn't a caregiver... except maybe Ryan. Ryan was a young, bouncy man who would breeze into my room at meal times (without knocking) calling out \"Room Service!\" I shrieked and jumped startling us both when he came in with yesterday's lunch because he woke me from a sound sleep, and then I never saw him again. So no story there.As they began processing my discharge this morning the doctor asked me what pain reliever worked for me and I said Dilaudid had and before I had a chance to follow up she asked if I would like to take Dilaudid IV home. Uh no. Hell the hell no. I might have looked so horrified that she thought I was totally against pain meds so she only gave me five Hydrocodone. I hope it's enough, but it probably will be. I've only had to take one so far.Now I sit watching the Total Recall remake and munching on treat food, enjoying a few moments totally free of discomfort. Who knows, I might even feel up to knitting tomorrow!Though I haven't been posting every day, I am going to give my self a pass as I have been catch-up posting. If a kidney stone doesn't get you a free pass for something I don't know what would. Anyway Day three in a hospital is likely to be a boring day so this will be short post!Because I wasn't having too much pain, I passed on the Dilaudid and spent most of the day dozing. Everything went fine until about 4:00 when I awoke trembling, upset, in pain, having trouble breathing, and starting to cry. What woke me was the tech coming in to check my vitals, and things got hopping when they hit my blood pressure: 177/116. They figured I was having a panic attack and gave me both Dilaudid and .5 mg of Ativan. After awhile I relaxed, and stopped crying. The rest of the night they didn't much disturb me and I slept as solidly as I could."},

Because I am absolutely fanatical on doing things linearly, I am going to post yesterday's notes about the surgery and the rest of the day now before moving onto today's notes in another post! I'm still a bit woozy from all the meds they have me on, but I think I can make it through.So I understood from last night in the ER that I was supposed to see the surgeon first thing in the morning and have surgery shortly thereafter. 8 o'clock came, 9 o'clock came, and when I hadn't seen my surgeon by 9:15 I finally asked to see the floor doctor. She came in and said, \"I don't know when you're having surgery, I didn't see it on the schedule.\" So then there was a flurry of phone calls and Dr. Maloney, the urologist and my surgeon, informed the floor doctor that he would be by to see me at four and that he was planning the surgery for around six. By this time I hadn't had anything to eat or drink since noon the previous day besides ice chips. I wasn't really hungry, but I was so dehydrated.I spent the morning dozing, and then the tempo really picked up.  Doc M rearranged some things and they came in to whisk me off to surgery at 12:10. It all went very fast and was very exciting after that. I met Dr. Maloney and the anesthesiologist, and Dr. Maloney explained that what he planned to do was put a stent in my kidney and try to remove the stone. If he couldn't remove the stone then they were going to have to go in later and blast it. Then they hooked me up to a mask--they also indicated that they were probably going to have to intubate me, joy--and then I was out!When I came back to myself I was surprised to find myself NOT crying hysterically. I just lay there with kind of a drowsy smile on my face feeling great. What a change! Then Dr. Maloney came in and had a post-op talk with me (why do they all do this right after you've had surgery and you're still all doped up? There's no way in hell you're going to remember anything they say!). Surprisingly I hung onto two things from my conversation from our conversation: 1) he did not find the stone. He founds tons of blood clots from kidney, but no stone--I apparently passed it in the ER. Wow, no wonder I was practically hysterical and foaming at the mouth in the ER if I passed a 7 mm stone. And 2) rural western women are supposed to be tough. He put the stent through the ureter into the kidney and he said it had to stay there a week. However he didn't think I'd find a urologist in Polson so he attached a fine filament to the end of the stent, ran it through the bladder and out the urethra. The he taped the end to my belly so I could remove the stent myself in a week. Pioneer women.Then they whisked me back to my room for dinner--mistake: too soon after anesthesia. Otherwise, the evening passed well and I gradually gave up the fantasy that I was going to be able to fly home the next day. There are much worse things than staying at Stone's Throw."},
{"title": "Hello From the Emergency Room!", "date": "Thursday, July 20, 2017", "text": "Note: I am finally posting this entry the day after I started so you know I'm still alive.If you had told me a half an hour ago that I would be able to blog while here, I would have laughed in your face in between moans and whimpers of agony. But let's start at the beginning.I was in the studio unloading the kiln and getting my shipment ready when I started to have an ache like a twisted muscle in my lower right back. It got gradually worse until I was in significant discomfort by the time I got my shipment out for UPS. I wondered how I had wrenched my back so badly and went to lie down for awhile.But I couldn't get comfortable. No matter how I was lying or sitting, the pain just kept getting worse. I found myself whimpering and gasping. I went to the Internet to see what I might have because, hey, the Internet! I became convinced I had appendicitis.Then I did something appallingly stupid: I drove myself to Urgent Care. By the time I got there I could barely walk in the door I was in so much pain. I was shaking, crying, sweating, and nauseated. I managed to drag myself to the check-in desk and gasped out that I thought I had ruptured my appendix. The rest was a bit of a blur. They got me into a wheelchair handed me a bag in case I had to heave, and they called EMS to take me straight to the ER.I had my first ride in an ambulance in 20 years--no sirens--and they immediately hooked me up to an IV and started pain and anti-nausea meds. By the time we got to the hospital I was feeling a lot better. Oh I still had constant pain, but I could talk through it and I wasn't shaking anymore. That lasted about 15 minutes and I was back to an incoherent gibbering, writhing mess. I could barely hold it together for the EKG.They had given me fentanyl in the ambulance and I remember it from Mom's hip procedures as being a pretty strong opiate. In the hospital they gave me iv ibuprofen (Toradol) and it was WONDERFUL. It took a little while to take effect, but when it did kick in, pain went from a 10 to a 2. I met my ER doc in my calm, mellow, state and was able to hop out of bed and onto the CT platform with no problems. They did a CT scan because the ER Doc said my symptoms were classics for kidney stones. He was concerned that I also had a UTI (we skirt TMI, but it's quite important for the rest of the story).Unfortunately my pain only stayed a 2 for a little while longer and I was back to crying, shaking, and moaning. Enter a new pain med: Dilaudid. That pretty much worked, holding me together through the doc bringing the news that I did, indeed, have a raging UTI, and I also had a 7mm kidney stone. Anything up to 5mm they will let you pass on your own (with lots of pain meds). Bigger than 5 they blast it with ultrasound waves to break it up--unless you have the perfect kidney storm and have a UTI too. In that case they are worried about you going septic really fast and dying so they keep you overnight in the hospital and they perform the symphony of surgery and insert a stent into your kidney that has to live there for a week or so. But that's tomorrow's story. For tonight, I am moving upstairs into the hospital and waiting to have surgery first thing tomorrow morning.In case you think I shared all the details, know that I did not. There is a lot more to the story, but even I have to draw the line somewhere!"},

{"title": "Notes On Apple Jelly With Rose Petals", "date": "Tuesday, July 18, 2017", "text": "The thing about reading a recipe written by a master with many years of experience and trial and error behind her is that it's written mostly for her and her level of expertise. Oh there may be a couple of notes added for the newbie, but it's hard to remember what it was like to start out and not know anything about a subject and to remember all the little details that would make replication easier. Of course replication of the result, spoonfeeding, may not have been the goal of the author of Mes Confitures at all. Maybe the reader is expected to pay her dues too and to have to figure some things out by experimentation. Whether that was the goal or just the outcome, right now (having just finished ladling the jelly into the jars over the rose petals) I am all kerfluffled!Little green apples from my vet clinicMy conundrums began last night when I sat down to prepare my little green apples. The book is organized by season with the fruits that should be ready for harvest grouped accordingly. However there are a lot of apple recipes in the \"spring\" section, and apples don't ripen until fall. The recipes do call for green apples, but only one of them (the basic green apple jelly which you make to serve as pectin stock for other jams and jellies whose fruits are too low in pectin to set on their own) calls specifically for very green, unripe apples from the beginning of July. Now you might think that order of the recipes would play a part, and if the author mentioned very green and from the start of July once, it would apply to all successive recipes calling for green apples. But the green apple pectin jelly recipe comes 82 pages later than the recipe I used for the green apple and rose petal jelly. So did she mean any variety of ripe green apple or any green--as in unripe--apple? The book is translated from French, and I begin to wish I had the original. I punted and used my little green unripe apples which I expect to be higher in pectin and lower in flavor than ripe apples would be.My green apple goopThe next question came when I was cutting up the apples. The instructions say to remove the stems and leave the peels, but they don't say anything about the seeds. Should I also remove the seeds before cooking the apples? Will the seeds add bitterness? Are they desirable? Okay? No clue. I removed most of the seeds (as many as I could by hand without cutting into the apples).From conundrum I moved to overzealous and a probable mistake. The recipe directs one to bring the apples to a boil in 6 1/3 c. of water and then let them simmer for half an hour on low heat. When I looked at them after half an hour on low I realized that low on my Mom's electric stove doesn't keep that much mass at a simmer--there were no bubbles. So I turned it up and cooked the apples another 10-15 minutes at a true simmer. Next I was supposed to pour the mixture into a chinois and to gently press against the apples with my skimmer. I was agitated by that time and I pressed the hell out of them. I was trying to get juice out of them when I bet the actual goal was just to get some apple-flavored water. After I mashed up everything in the chinois, I put the resulting juice through a cheesecloth (as instructed) but there was so much gummy, pectiny pulp that it just sat there and not much juice went through. Giving up for the night, I put it all in the fridge--the cheesecloth in a strainer with the pulpy mess in it suspended over a bowl to catch the juice--as I was supposed to let the sediment settle overnight anyway. Then I went to bed fretting.Macerating the rose petalsThis morning I arose to find a large mass of goo, and 2 1/2 c. of juice instead of the 4 1/4 called for. Oh dear. Deciding at this point that it's all a learning experience, I dumped the goop out of the cheesecloth (it came out in a pretty solid mass) and poured cold water through the cheesecloth into the juice until I had 4 1/4 c. of liquid.Next I went outside to harvest the roses. There were plenty of floribunda and old-fashioned (likely Bourbon) peach colored roses that I initially mistook for a standard Peace rose, and the old-fashioned roses have lots of little tiny petals that might not be so pretty in jelly. But they were what I had, their color was good, and there were enough of them, so I snipped off the heads and brought them inside to denude them of their petals.Bringing the jelly to a boilThe rest of the process went pretty much as it seemed to be supposed to. I brought the majority of the rose petals to a simmer and then macerated them for an hour. After the hour was up I strained them through a cheese cloth with no mishap (though I might have--again--been overzealous in my desire to extract as much liquid as possible as I couldn't refrain from squeezing the cheesecloth. I squeezed gently, but nonetheless.Rose petals saved to put inthe jars with the jellyThen I cooked the juice up (again) with sugar and lemon juice (squeezed fresh) until it boiled and (seemed to) set. How to tell when juice \"sets\" becoming proto-jelly and ready to put up in jars is a mystery still. However I started the day with an overabundance of pectin so I figured it wouldn't be a problem and just (mostly) followed the directions for time. While I was waiting for the juice to boil up I put some rose petals in the bottoms of my sterilized jelly jars and measured out the rose water to add to the jelly at the end.Upside down jars of jellywaiting to setI figured I wasn't going to get more than six small jars of jelly so I only sterilized six, so of course I got six and a half. The last half jar necessitated a quick microwave sterilization and a run to the garden for one more rose. Had I not filled the other jars so full (the book says to fill the jars all the way to the top so I tried that too, but it's messy so I stopped) I probably would have ended up with seven finished jars of jelly.Now the jars are resting upside down with the rose petals floated to the bottom. When they have cooled a bit more and started to set up, I will gently shake them to distribute the rose petals through the jelly, and I'll set them right side up. Let's hope they cool fast enough that I can flip them before I leave to catch my plane! I will NOT be making the plain green apple jelly for pectin today. One jelly a day is enough.*Note as I get ready to leave for the plane: The jelly did not set up adequately. Guess I should have fretted more about that part of the process and less about others!"},

From the schedule that I made yesterday I managed to get my cutting list to the lumber mill for the bed (I also picked out another slab for a matching desk--I am considering a dining room table, but that can wait till next year!), Dave helped me unload the trailer, and Jessie went out to the lake with me and helped me load it up again. This afternoon I stopped by our vet's office and picked green apples from their tree in back, and tonight I'm starting a batch of apple and rose petal jelly. I'll pick the rose petals from my mother's peace roses first thing tomorrow when they're still cool with dew. Besides the apple and rose petal jelly, tomorrow I'll make a batch of the green apple jelly to use as pectin in other preserve recipes this summer. These recipes are both from the book Mes Confitures by Christine Ferber.The animal shelter was closed today so I couldn't talk to them about the rabbit pens, but tomorrow morning I'll move the pens out into the rock garden in the backyard and give the shelter a call. This way I'll be able to set up the fleece station pretty quickly. I won't have time to use it before I get back, but it'll be ready and waiting for me next week. The second hand store that benefits the animal shelter was also closed today, and I don't know if I'm going to have time to take a load of stuff to them before leaving for the airport tomorrow. I think I'll be conservative and just say no.What I will do tomorrow is cut out four shirts for Dave that I will take to Austin to sew, and I'll finish my two jellies. I'll also pack, though we're only going for four days and it's not like I don't have toiletries and clothes there. The important thing to remember is the car keys for the Leaf!"},

In a flurry of energy, I bounded out of bed at 10:48 this morning and went to breakfast with the spouse. Really, I was energetic and enthusiastic even though it was so early. Okay so I didn't get much of a jump on the day, and I took a nap in the late afternoon, but I really did think about all my current projects today. Mostly I straightened and set up work areas.I got the sewing area ready for the next great round of Dave's Hawaiian shirts. I planned the layout for the garage staging area of give away and throw away items from the lake storage. I organized my spinning, knitting, and computing area...I have noticed when I save posting till after 11:00 at night, I am winding down and mentally cataloguing the day. It's good for me as it sets up the next day, but it doesn't make for an interesting post. As I am getting ready to go back to Austin the day after tomorrow and I have a ton of things I want to get done and a few things I need to get done before I go, it's hard to think anyway other than in linear, logical, orderly lists.Tomorrow I need to get up early so I can call the vet to ask if I can pick some green apples from the backyard of the clinic. My jelly and jam making supplies have all arrived, though the copper pan arrived a bit crushed--I was able to bend it back out but I'm not sure I want to pay that much for a damaged pot. I let the restaurant supply company know about the damage right away... and have heard nothing back since. I'll go ahead and make a batch of green (unripe) apple jelly in the next couple of days so I'll have it as an ingredient for the next round of confitures I'll be making when I get back.Dave is beginning to look a bit ragged in his 14 year-old Hawaiian shirts so I want to get a few new ones cut in the next couple of days so I can take them back to Austin with me and sew one or two up. I didn't bring a machine here this summer as I just planned to cut them all out and bring them back to sew this fall, but I think I'll have time to whip up one or two while I'm home. I hope. Unless everything there has gone to hell in a hand basket.Now that the design for the bed is done I am ready to order the wood from Dupuis. I'd like to get that cut list in to them tomorrow--along with the list for the Doug fir for the workbench. I bit the bullet and bought three pieces of woodworking equipment and will be setting up the last studio area in Austin when we get home this fall. There is one last room underneath the master bedroom that is only accessible from outside and which seems to have been the workshop space for the first owner. There is a cement floor, lighting, and even an AC unit in the wall. I currently have it filled with all of the things I would have stored in the garage or a tool shed, but the garage is a glass studio, and we don't have a tool shed. We do, however, have a closet under the stairs to the apartment which will make an excellent place to store all the art fair display supplies, tables, tents, etc. I can hang yard tools and hoses and such by the potting bench area under the back deck--unless the new rain barrels take up all the space there. I'll have to co-ordinate the layout with Jay when I am back next week.The yarn I spun, plied, and washed was dry today so I balled it up and knit a few swatches to make gauge for the sweater coat I am going to knit from my Tour de Fleece yarn. It's much prettier than I expected it to be. I don't like barber-pole striping in yarn, like you get when you twist two different colors of yarn together. However it looks better when it's knit as it looks more heathery and not stripy. Now I just need to figure out if I'm going to have enough. The pattern calls for a certain weight of mohair yarn instead of a yardage. Mohair weighs like dandelion fluff so I have no idea what a commensurate weight in wool would be. Surprisingly, I ended up making my gauge with the same size needles the pattern called for. I can only assume that had I used cobweb-like mohair (even the three strands knitted together that it calls for), I would've had to go down several needle sizes.When I come back from Austin I'm going to bring some sheet glass in my suitcase (in tile-sized pieces) so I can use them as the base for the glow-in-the-dark tiles I want to test. I have a lot of frit--and even a few jars of morceaux--here, but I don't have any clear sheet at all.I'm going to see if the local animal shelter would like the rabbit play yard and super hutch. If they don't, I'll try to sell them. When they're moved out from under the deck I'll have room to set up my fleece skirting and prep station so I can do the big fleece for my master spinning class that I brought from Austin.And that's enough to fill my brain for tonight. Good night!"},

We took Kyla to the airport in Missoula to head back to Atlanta today and I had my usual joyful experience with TSA accompanying her to the gate. Two discussions with the TSA supervisor, a VERY thorough groin pat down front and back followed by a comprehensive residue test both on my hands (front and back) and on the the gloves of the agent who patted me down (also both front and back). But my cavities weren't searched, and I did not lose my calm so I guess I can count it as a win.I did spin today--I plied 582 yds and then wound it on a swift. After I took it off the swift I checked the twist (to make sure it was balanced) and it was; it hung in a perfect loop, not twisting back on itself at all. So I soaked it in hot water for a couple of minutes and then took it out and thwacked it a bit to set the twist. Tomorrow, when it's dry, I'll weigh it (to see how many yds/oz I get so I can make sure I have enough for the coat I'm going to knit), and then I'll knit a swatch for gauge for the coat. I am very eager to start knitting again. I am still bummed that I can't find the lavender cotton sweater I was knitting earlier this spring.Spinning (and Dave's excellent pesto chicken for dinner along with Steve Adler's company) were the only good parts of the day. I already gird my loins for the contractor issues in Austin next week, and the DSL here (which was just upgraded to 25 Mgbs) tested out at 1.7 Mgbs download speed tonight. I checked because we kept timing out on Deadwood again. We finally gave up on watching.It's too early to go to bed so I'll either read, work on the bed cutting list, or practice piano when I'm done posting. Or maybe I'll go clean the kitchen.

Of course I have about another three lbs of fleece to spin first. I had hoped to have it all spun and done during the Tour de Fleece, but life has intervened and I am behind. However I cannot lament my tardiness as I spent the time I was not spinning being a good mother, a good neighbor, a good wife, and a good hostess. I didn't manage good housekeeper, but nobody's perfect!Tomorrow Jessie's friend Kyla goes home to Atlanta, and next Tuesday Jessie and I head back to Austin. She gets her braces off, and I gird my loins to deal with contractors. Maybe I'll give myself a treat and have my legs waxed--nothing like ripping all the hair on your legs out by the roots to take your mind off of contractors! I am a little irked with my main contractors right now since they didn't finish the pond and get it filled and the water cleared in time for me to put all the koi from the holding tank on my back deck into it. I ended up leaving them in the holding tank, charging Devon with keeping the water filled and clean, and asking Zaga to feed them. I planned to release them into the pond next week when I am home. Unfortunately, earlier this week some animal discovered the all-you-can-fish buffet and removed most of the water and all but four of the fish from the tank. Whatever it was very nicely left heads from some and headless bodies from others for Zaga to clean up. I was very sad to hear that the three fish I brought from Atlanta--my big white one and the two big orange ones--were among the casualties. Had the contractors finished the pond when they were supposed to, I would've been able to put the fish in it and they would have been safe.

Now I am thinking I might be regretting having one of my stones heat treated. It was already pretty dark--though more aqua than royal blue--and it might have been nice to just have it natural. The heat process typically clarifies the stone and saturates the color, but there is something to be said for natural...Anyway it was amazing how many good sized unfractured sapphires we found today. Jessie, Kyla and I all had rough stones in the 2-2/12 carat size with no fractures. Kyla's biggest stone had a beautiful iron spot in it that will go yellow with heat. I think it's going to be gorgeous cut and will be about 1/2 to 3/4 carat. My big pink one has a large fracture that doesn't go all the way through so the appraisers thought it was worth doing. I said it was okay to cut it with a bit of an inclusion. The stones below are all mine from one small bag of gravel and include my large dark one and my big pink one. I left one more round one a little smaller than the one on the upper left to be done too. Now we just have to wait seven weeks until they're done!"},

This time the dentist did not manage to numb me all the way--even after three hefty shots of novocaine--and it hurst much more tonight than it did after the first one was fitted.Icing on the cake is that I still do the zombie shuffle when I walk as my ankles and knees are still in major pain from yesterday--everyone else is recovered. Sure, I'm hte oldest, but I need to get back into shape! For the rest of the night--which admittedly isn't very much--I'm going to chill and read my book.

I hopped handily enough out of bed at 5:15 this morning and hustled everyone into the mini van for our trip to Glacier. Then I drove with spry alacrity up to the park, arriving at West Glacier just before 8:00 am. At that point Dave took over driving and I took over photographing EVERYTHING with the new camera.Looking back down the road we drove upMy sexy spouse With all the stops (and we didn't make one at Logan Pass this year) it took us until 10:40 to get to Swiftcurrent Motor Inn. It's right next to Many Glacier on the northeast side of the park. It was drizzling lightly when we arrived, and we were all hungry so instead of hitting the trail right away, we waited 20 minutes until the cafe opened for lunch and then we ate. With one thing and another, it was about noon before we hit the trail. Hindsight is 20/20, but if we had started hiking right away we probably would've seen the moose by Fishercap Lake or the enormous sow grizzly and her two cubs further up the trail. But you never know when the wildlife will be out and about. I'd like to do that hike again--next time earlier in the morning (maybe after staying the night at Swiftcurrent).Bullhead Lake--the end of our hikeField of beargrassThe last time we hiked the Swiftcurrent area Jessie was only 8 or 9 and we hiked a more strenuous trail up to Iceberg Lake. I could no more have done that hike today than I could've flown. The hike we took was very easy and mostly level, but at the end of 3/1/2 miles Dave and I reached Bullhead Lake and decided to call it good enough. We were on the Swiftcurrent Pass hike, and we knew we weren't going to do the steep part at the end leading up to the pass, but I thought we'd make it to the end of the Bullhead lake at the bottom of the mountain. However the girls turned back before we even got there and said they'd wait for us at Redrock Falls. Dave and I went on, but then it started raining again and the descending hikers reported no animal sightings further on so we turned around and headed back out.Ground squirrelThe cows of GlacierIn spite of the lack of wildlife bigger than squirrels (except for the multiple small herds of cows at the entrance to and even inside the park at the Many Glacier entrance) it was an incredible hike. I have never seen so many different wildflowers blooming all at once--and the beargrass blooms were just dense everywhere and taller than Jessie. Last winter was a big snow year, and the spring was very rainy so the growth is explosively lush. And it's not like we didn't see large animals all day. We were fortunate enough to take in the casual browsing show put on by a young male mountain goat up by Logan Pass. I even saw another goat settled in on the side of a cliff above the road as we were on our way back down the road at the end of the day.Jessie's pic of the fire from '15The burned area nowIt was our first visit to the Park since the devastating fire on the east side two years ago. Jessie was on a boat right off shore of where the fire started and ended up being out on the lake for two hours watching it grow from a plume of smoke to an explosive conflagration. The boat she was on was held there in case they needed to use it to evacuate hikers trapped by the blaze.Where Siyeh Studio was bornToday the burned trees still stood stark and bare--many peculiarly burned leaving blackened bark with shocking white trunks showing through. And beneath all of them bloomed a riot of wildflowers and lush meadow grasses. As sad as it was that there was a fire, it was really overdue. That area was full of beetle-killed pine trees just waiting for a careless match. Nature reboots just like everything else, and fire is one of her major ways to do it.Even when the sky is sullen, there's nomore beautiful place to beThe requisite mountain goat shotWe're home at last, and I managed--barely--to hobble into the house and down the stairs groaning all the way. My ankles hurt. My shins hurt. My calves hurt. My hips and my gluteus maximus hurt. The skin on my inner thighs hurts the most as I wore one of my currently-usual dresses on the hike and chafed that tender skin most egregiously.Logan PeakHeaven's PeakNext time I'll wear some spandex workout shorts under my dress for hiking. Or I guess I could just dress like everyone else in their frufty Gore-Tex with their rain gear and their fancy hiking boots and their walking poles. I definitely got some funny looks in my Keens and a blue dress with a camera slung around my neck--especially in the rain by Bullhead Lake after most of the casual hikers had turned back. Whatever. My mother used to do all her serious hiking in thongs--excuse me: flip flops. I keep forgetting that Jessie told me \"thongs\" means something else now other than footgear. Again, whatever.Bird on a dead treeBirdwoman FallsNow I sit with a pre-shower Negroni, posting and curating the day's photos to pick the best one for the 365 project and the runners up for here.

I took the trailer to the lake and filled it with the first big load of my parents'--mostly my Dad's--things. I did pick up a some of Mom's fabric and the kitchen utensils from the lake cabin that Ed and Susan don't want, but it felt like most of the load was everything from Dad's life. There were two boxes of ski maintenance equipment including old irons for waxing the bottom of the skis and files for sharpening the edges. There were boxes of maps, notes, entomology books, and tax returns going back to 1983 (okay, I picked those up in my last load, but they fill out the feeling of the rest of the things I loaded so I added them in). Everything I loaded today was stuff they had stored, not things from their daily lives. And almost all of it will go to the second hand store benefitting the animal shelter or to the dump. There are a few things worth selling, and fewer still that I will keep.

However when I pulled the carton of milk out of the fridge, it didn't slosh, it sludged. Uh oh. I knew we'd been having a problem with the freezer--the ice cream bars weren't (bars) and the ice cream wasn't (iced). But apparently the whole unit is giving up the ghost. I could have called a repairman, but I think--though I am not sure--that this fridge might have been the fridge we had when I was a teenager. Maybe not, but it is an OLD unit. So instead of repairing it, we decided to replace it. I went online, and then the ruralness of our situation became apparent and Dave and I drove to the Home Depot in Kalispell and picked one out.I had to face the hard reality that we are truly in the boonies here when I tried to order one online and have it delivered and I got the message, \"We're sorry. Appliance delivery isn't offered to your area. Your nearest store may be able to offer other arrangements.\" So I couldn't get free delivery--or any delivery at all for an on-line purchase--but we were able to go into the store, pick from 3-4 models in the basic style we wanted that they had in stock, and schedule delivery for Thursday. We could have picked from a wider selection had we been willing to wait, but what they had was more than good enough. And for $48 they will deliver, unpack, set-up and install (water line) the new one and haul away the old one. I call that a steal of a deal.On the way home we stopped at the Tamarack Brewing Company in Lakeside for lunch. They have some of the best food and best beer on the lake. It's too bad that Lakeside is right outside of Kalispell and so clear on the other end of the lake from us (about a 45 minute drive). Wish they were in Polson. They also had a gorgeous firepit outside made by Big Sky Backyards. I looked them up and fell in love with the the one below. Someday it might adorn the garden at Stone's Throw.As we are mostly sans fridge, we will be eating out for a few days. Or Dave could shop daily for fresh food and we could pretend we're Europeans who grocery shop everyday and who neither store much nor have big refrigerators. I will, however, see if the neighbors can keep our ice cream for us till Thursday. And I can't wait to have ice and water in the door again!!!!! The old Kenmore certainly didn't have it (its ice maker hasn't even worked for the past few years) nor does the Thermidor fridge at Stone's Throw have ice or water in the door. Come to think of it, we didn't even have ice in the door in Atlanta--just water. We haven't had a fridge with ice and water in the door since Jessie was one and we lived in Austin the first time!

Even so there were three other vehicles spaced out a bit on the road in front of us.Tiny mountain chipmunkAntelope on the ridgeWildlife sightings were decent, not great, but the 300 mm lenses on the new camera let me get some great close-in shots. Jessie, however, got the best shot of the day (again) (with my camera as hers is in Austin) of a young bull bison swiping his nostril with his tongue. We saw antelope, deer, bison, and chipmunks. We didn't see bighorn sheep or bears, which we have in the past.Herd of cow and calf bisonJessie's tongue-in-nose-bisonI want to make one more drive through this summer but at the end of the day. The latest you can start through is 7:00, and as late as it stays light, that would leave plenty of opportunity for great photos as the animals move around at the end of the day. I also would like to make that drive in the Mini Cooper with the top down. Dave is a bit nervous about that idea as he thinks the bison might mistake the Mini for another bison and either try to mate with it or fight it. I want to take the Mini as I can get good 360 degree photos without having to get out of the car (which makes Dave very nervous).Another picturesque doeSaw lots of buck deer with large racksThe reason the day felt like vacation was that--even though I did much the same as I have been doing--I didn't feel like I should be doing something else instead of napping or watching woodworking videos.

Instead of my goal of four ounces a day for each day, I produced zero ounces. I do have 16 ounces done for the first four days, but I may need to reset my goal. After all, it's an endurance race as much as anything and I need to be in it for the long haul (till the Tour de France ends on 7/23).My one accomplishment of the day was acquiring a very nice used enclosed trailer.

So off Dave went to WalMart (the only place in town still open on the 4th of July) and bought a small propane blowtorch. Then, so to speak, we got cooking with gas!

I think it will be a challenge to spin my four ounces of fiber for the Tour de Fleece today.Quel bordel!Jessie as Carol BurnettJessie as Charlie Chaplin"},
{"title": "Happy July 4th!", "date": "Tuesday, July 04, 2017", "text": "Selective color effect focusing on red hues (whichapparently include reddish brown too)It's the Fourth of July--Dave's favorite holiday--and tonight is the big family fireworks. Dave and I are going to sit for this one--I plan on taking lots of photos with the new Nikon DSLR camera I got last week. After six months of taking pictures everyday with my iPhone I decided it was time to upgrade my tech. I read the reviews, was honest with myself about my aspirations and limitations as a photographer, and  found a nice mid-range camera with a good bundle on Amazon. The bundle included the standard 18-55 mm lens as well as a 70-300 mm lens, a wide angle lens, a telephoto lens, and a filter kit--as well as host of little accessories and a bag. The camera is also red. Woot.I have played around with it a bit--mostly in automatic mode--but I haven't spent a day on my own with it yet. We've driven into Missoula twice since I got it and both times I minimized the number of stops I made to take pictures. I need just me and the camera off in the Mini Cooper for a day--maybe with Gallifrey as my co-pilot--to really go in-depth. When Jessie bought her Canon DSLR (several years ago now) I bought her a book that walked her through the different features and functions and encouraged her to go through it with her camera so she could really learn it inside and out. That wasn't her learning style so it didn't happen, but she mostly figured it out in her own way.Selective focus on yellow flowers also catches the highlights on the pine needlesMe, I like a structured, organized approach. I took a formal film photography class back in the dark ages of high school (even learning how to develop my own black and white film) so I have a basic working knowledge of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, etc. I've also done a quick read through the manual. Now I'm looking forward to making a blended list of all the features of the camera along with basic manual photography techniques that I'll use to plan photography days. One day might be repeated pictures of the same subject but shot with different apertures. I know the theory of what will happen, but it will be good to get the hand practice in of actually taking the shots. Other skills I want to brush up on include shutter-speed-focused pictures, macro photography, night shots, portraits, fast action, landscapes, nature, etc.). This camera also has some cool special features and there is one I particularly want to experiment with: selective color. I already had a bit of fun with that one and would like to go to a very color-saturated local (like the farmers market) and practice there.Friday this week will be my first day of play and I'm going to start with a very forgiving subject: nature. Specifically I am going to take an early morning trip to the National Bison Range where in the past we have seen bison (duh), antelope, big horn sheep, and even bears--all of them close enough to get really good shots. Tonight, however (and here we get back to Fourth of July celebrations) will be my first night shooting. And, hey, what could be more forgiving than fireworks?"},

I have spun about 14 oz so far leaving only about 42 left to go. Okay, even if I weren't already exhausted I'd be really tired just thinking about it.Besides fiber, today was about my mother's roses. I deadheaded and took out large canes that had died during the winter or were killed last summer by cane borers. I cleaned house a bit. I napped. It must be summer when I can condense an entire day's activities down to a couple of sentences! Had I not been on a mission to post every day this year, I probably wouldn't have bothered today. Tomorrow, however, will have all the excitement and action anyone could want as it is July 4th and we have enough fireworks to take down a small country. Pictures will be taken. Stories will be written. We will go down in history."},
{"title": "Baby Driver", "date": "Sunday, July 02, 2017", "text": "We saw the new Edgar Wright film \"Baby Driver\" tonight and loved it! It was set and filmed in Atlanta, and I only have one criticism of the film: There were too many white people in it. Atlanta is a city with a 38% white and 54% black population. It was weird to have the postal workers, the construction workers,  police officers, security guards, and the average people on the street overwhelmingly white. It really struck me as wrong. We lived there for 13 years and moved there from a city with an 8% black population (Austin). When we first moved I was struck by the large black population. Then we moved back to Austin and I couldn't help but think, where are all the black people? But there is a much larger latino population in Austin so it doesn't seem so white-bread as, say Missoula Montana where I grew up. It is 94% white. I loved the diversity when I moved to Chicago from Montana. Chicago is a very balanced city--at least as far as black, white and latino at 33%,  32% and 29% respectively.Now we're home and getting ready to retire for the evening. I'm ready. I still feel a bit meh from yesterday--though I did find out from my uncle today that my great aunt Annabelle (Gramma Jessie's sister) sold John Dillinger his last driver's license."},
{"title": "Family", "date": "Saturday, July 01, 2017", "text": "It's so quiet right now that when I am not typing, I hear the slight echo in my ears of the sounds of \"John Wick 2\" which Dave and I just watched. There is just the faintest ringing from an excess of sound left in them. It was a good day--there was a nap in it. There were also lots and lots of fireworks of the mega variety purchased. The one thing I forgot to buy was earplugs--I think we're going to need them. We have some serious artillery shells and cakes that have 500 grams of pyrotechnic composition in them--the most allowed by federal law without a license.The neighbors on both sides of us will be off camping somewhere for the 4th as neither they nor their dogs appreciate all the fireworks that go off in our neighborhood. Speaking of dogs, I need to go to the vet on Monday to get Jig some doggy valium. He is terrified of the fireworks and will be holed up in the basement with the doors closed and a white noise fan on too. Valium would be just the little extra boost I think he would appreciate.After picking up fireworks, I cleared out half of the boxes of my dad's papers and ski clothing that I brought home yesterday from storage at the lake. I threw most of the papers away, but I kept his entomology and biology books. I also kept the book they made for him when he retired from the forest service. The clothes and gear will mostly go to the resale store that benefits the local animal shelter. Dad got Jig there, and I think he would have liked to see his things benefit them.Before picking up fireworks, we went downtown to Pop's Grill for breakfast this morning. The cafe shares an interior wall with an art gallery and there are windows between the two businesses allowing one to look over some of the work while eating. So we went in after we finished breakfast, and as I was wandering through I to looked up and on the wall right in front of me was a copy of one of my great grandfather RH McKay's photos signed and dated \"Flathead Belle\" 1920. I bought it and it now hangs on the wall by our front door along with all of my father's photos of mountains he climbed or skied or both.Oh I'm in a melancholy mood tonight. I've always loved Montana, but this year it's been hard to be here. I keep thinking of all the family who have passed from my life. I won't get to ask my grandmother if her sister was there the day Bonny and Clyde robbed the bank where she worked. I can't ask my mother who the camel cigarette belonged to that has the words \"Do you want to take years off your life?\" and the date 11-3-52 written on it that Jessie found today in one of Mom's drawers is a sealed tube. Mom would have been 12 then and my uncle wasn't even born. I can't ask Grampa the story behind his Dad's middle name, Lafitte. These are only some of the questions that have popped into my mind in the past two weeks.Okay, time to go to bed to snuggle with my spouse. I need some reassurance about life, and he is very good about grounding me in the here and now. If I hurry, I might even get there before he starts snoring. But even if I don't, he'll wrap his arms around me in his sleep and everything will be okay."},
{"title": "I Have Project ADD", "date": "Friday, June 30, 2017", "text": "I said to Dave this morning as I was sitting at the kitchen table debating what to do today that I have craft ADD. He snorted and said, \"It has been widely commented upon\". I asked, \"What, you mean everyone else has noticed this before me?\". Answer: \"Yup\". Nonetheless, I am paralyzed by the decision between woodworking (designing and lumber list for the bed, the desk, and a worktable I would like to build), glass (making sample tiles with the glow-in-the-dark powder I got), or spinning (I have the fleece for the Master Spinner course to sort and wash and the fiber for the combo mash-up to spin). For some of those nifty crafting activities there are prerequisite home activities that need to be performed. For glass I need to set up the studio. For preparing the fleece I need to clean off the back porch area and set-up the fiber sorting and washing area. And there are other house activities I would like to/need to do like gardening (weeding the perennials, or pruning and deadheading the roses) and cleaning (vacuuming, dusting, changing the beds, cleaning the bathroom and kitchen, washing the windows). Yet I sit unable to focus on one of the aforementioned options as the right choice for today!Okay, breathe. Here's what we can do. I'll make my lumber list for the bed and the workbench. I'll see about renting a trailer from U-Haul to bring to the wood back to Austin. I'll make a list of cleaning supplies I need for the house. Then I'll pick up the cleaning supplies and stop at the lumber yard on the way out to the lake. I'll take the girls there for the afternoon, and while we're there I'll spend an hour or two cleaning out the metal building and then I'll spin for a bit.Normally this is the place in the post where I would list what I'll do tomorrow to continue this line of activity, but I know better than that! No, tomorrow morning I'll get up, have coffee, and sit paralyzed for awhile again until the day comes clear.Whew! I can move again!"},
{"title": "What Do People Do Here?", "date": "Thursday, June 29, 2017", "text": "The girls are gearing up to race on the indoor track at the Hub in Missoula and I am stuck on a conversation we had in the car on the way in from Polson this morning. As we drove down to Missoula, Jessie looked out the window at the little towns, rolling fields, and mountains and asked, \"What do people who live here do?\". Her question made me remember back to when I was her age and growing up in Missoula. I would have rather died than live in or outside one of the little towns between Missoula and Kalispell. Even Kalispell would have been too small for me. My feelings were based on what I had to do at the time and what I liked to do at the time. I had to go to school, and high school with its greater density of people was much more enjoyable to me than was grade school. I liked to do social things--like dance and party with large groups of people. I dreamed of traveling, going anywhere. I loved meeting new people. Living in one house my whole life (till I was 17) gave me itchy feet.That's a nice reminiscence, but I don't think it was really what she was asking. She was honestly curious about what people would do for a living and for enjoyment in the apparent middle of nowhere. The short answer to her question is that people here, as everywhere, do what they have to do (work, school), and in their free time they do what they like to do. For many people in Montana, what they like to do takes place outdoors. They hike, bike, kayak, ski, boat, snowboard, run around on ATV's or snowmobiles, raft, hunt, fish, etc. They live here for the proximity to those activities, and for the slower lifestyle you get in a more rural area. Even cities in Montana aren't very big. Billings, the largest (and in my opinion least pleasant) had only 104K people in the 2010 census. Missoula was second largest with 67K, and Bozeman and Helena (the capital) had 37K and 28K respectively. Polson, where we live in the summer, only has 4K people. All together the entire state--the fourth largest state in the union just behind California) holds 990K people. There are half again as many people in Hawaii, and California has 39 million...So what do people in Polson do? What do people do anywhere? They live. They laugh, cry, fall in love, pay taxes, die. Some of them go to church (yet another social opportunity) or belong to fraternal organizations (Elk, Moose, Kiwanas). They own or work in retail businesses. They work in infrastructure support (for the utility providers). They work for the government or the banks or the grocery stores. They are electricians, plumbers, carpenters. They work at the hospital or in one of the private medical or dental offices. Some of them are teachers, some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives. For entertainment they go to the movies, go out for meals, do the outdoor things aforementioned. They (like me) craft, make, build and garden. Like Dave they code, cook, play video or computer games. They read, write, paint, compose poetry, swim. In short, they live.Living here is not for everybody. Life is best spent where you find your passion and your muse. If you wake up, look around you and are uplifted by the world around you, you're in the right place. If the things you like to do are regularly available to you--you don't have to wait for vacation to do them--you're in the right place. Of course you have to be able to make a living there too. If you hate where you live, it's hard to like life.When I was younger, meeting and interacting with people was everything to me. Now, I couldn't care less. I can go most days without talking to another being. If I am inspired by my surroundings I'll create. If I create, I'll lose myself in it. I also lose myself in books--and I can do that whether I am inspired by my surroundings or not. Beauty, cool weather, and lack of traffic (people) are now the markers of a good place for me."},

Dave has already retired for the evening and I need to do the same, but I was lost in the bed project all evening and didn't get to my post till now. I am happy to say that after many days of practicing Sketch-up, studying woodworking techniques, watching innumerable YouTube videos on woodworking, and pouring over pictures of beds on Pinterest and Houzz, I have finally put together a solid rough out for the new bed. It's big, heavy, and will be unique in both its quirky design and asymmetrical flow. I made a list on Trello of all the elements we want in it: lights, built-in charging stations on both sides, electrical outlets on both sides, beverage nooks for his diet coke and my water, a small jewelry catch-all, places for Kleenex and lotion, support for sitting up, small night tables, a big shelf, and a drawer or two.The construction will include mortise and tenon joints with drawbore pegs in ebony or another dark hardwood, and a drawer with dovetail through joints and ebony sides. Further design elements that I am considering are ebony inlay and glass cutouts.But for the rest of tonight, my designing will be done behind my eyelids. G'Night from Montana!"},

It's still beautiful, and it's still relaxing, but the day was less than optimal as I spent the morning getting fitted for a crown on the tooth I broke before coming up here, and I spent the afternoon increasingly aching as the anesthetic wore off. I did no gardening, nor spinning, nor cleaning. I didn't even start working on the bed again until about an hour ago. Instead I read all day, finishing the second book in a steampunk magic series by Devon Monk (Age of Steam). I started book three tonight, and even though the plot line is set out for eight books, the series is stalled after #3 while the author writes in her other series. It's a pity as I love these books.  I like all of her books, and I especially appreciate the distinct voice these have from her other work. The first one reminds me a lot of Deadwood, and the second one has a very Firefly vibe. Steampunk in the old west that never was kind of thing with magic and the Strange.It's the second week of our time here and so far I think I have a good balance of things occupying my time. I feel a bit unsettled by not going full out on have to's every day, but I am doing my best to relax and enjoy it. Now that the girls are here I have put myself at their disposal to take them out to the lake or wherever else they want to go. I'm spinning, planning woodworking projects, and soon will be fusing the very cool glow-in-the-dark pigment I got into glass for tiles and path pebbles. I'll also get the big garden completely weeded. Next year I'll have to have the house either painted or sided (it's cedar and not in the best of shape), and I'll finally put in the rock garden in the front where the old porch used to be. But for this year, I am not doing any major projects here. The most I think I'll do is re-stain the deck floor because I can do that with a roller in a couple of hours.While I'm thinking of things to do, I found the box of shirt fabric for Dave's Hawaiian shirts that I left here two years ago and I have a pattern, a rotary cutter and a cutting mat. Think I'll get some shirts cut out and ready to sew up when we get home. I haven't made shirts for Dave since we last lived in Austin. I made him 38 shirts for his 38th birthday. I won't be making 51 this year, but I bet I can whip up a dozen or so. For each one I make, I can retire one from his closet and turn it into material for a quilt (yet another project I'd like to get to). All this talk of projects has made me sleepy. Off to bed!"},
{"title": "First Day At the Lake", "date": "Monday, June 26, 2017", "text": "Dave gently woke me this morning, pulling me from the wildest and most vivid dream. He was interested in breakfast at Mrs. Wonderful's Marmalade Cafe. I, of course, had to detail my dream for him before I would consider the idea. But of course the the prospect of Mrs. Wonderful's got me right up and ready to head out the door. There have been a lot of days like this recently (where I pop up and out the door without so much as a by your leave), and I really must start making time to shower. Everyone would appreciate it.So a blueberry scone and an iced coffee for me and a breakfast sandwich for Dave at Mrs. Wonderful's, and then it was back home to spin! After yesterday's marathon design day for the bed on the computer, I determined to stay off the computer as much as possible today, and not to work on the bed at all. The creative part of my brain needed a break. Spinning is great when you want to turn your brain off.This afternoon I took the girls out to the family property on Finley Point. This is the first time we've been there since I sold my half of it to my uncle, and it felt very odd. As we were going down the drive to the cabin I spotted the pine tree where the ashes of everyone in the family who has died have been spread. Even our beloved pet's ashes have been laid to rest there. This summer I will place my mother's ashes there, and I will have no more claim to the place. It is unsettling to have severed my connection to my Mom's final home.My grandparents bought the lake property in 1965. Originally they had a mobil home there, and later Grandpa built a cabin next to it that they planned to use for guests and laundry. The laundry part never got hooked up (there was a washer but either never a dryer or never a dryer that was hooked up). Some time after they both died and my parents took over stewardship of and a half interest in the property. The mobil home was eventually hauled off leaving just the cabin. After Mom died, I held onto my share of it for just over a year, and then I decided to let go. My uncle fiercely loves that property, and his memories of it growing up are much more vivid than mine. He is eight years older than I am, and he was already a teenager when his parents bought it. He went there every weekend while I spent a lot of my formative weekends camping on the side of the Loch Sa river just over the border in Idaho.Even so, it was hard for me there today realizing I had no more connection to it. It is not my place anymore--as it was when my mother owned half of it or after she died and I owned half of it. It is not mine, nor will it ever be my child's. It is Ed's and will be his children's. It was a bittersweet day for all of that. I hope subsequent visits will be less emotional for me--especially since I need to clear out the metal storage building on the property where my parents stored a lot of their things.* I realized as I went to add the photos I took today to this post that I had a bunch of Gallifrey, and none of the girls! I'll work on that for later in the week. For now, It's time to head exhausted to bed, ready to rise in the morning and get my tooth fixed!"},

Oh I woke at 7:30, but then the eyelids took pity on the eyeballs and closed again till 8:30. After seeing to the pets, showering, and a bit of desultory cleaning, we hit the road.Another vista on the road less takenAs usual we took the back trail (literally), and as we were in no hurry and it was such a beautiful day, we stopped for me to take many pictures. I was chasing down my favorite vista of the Mission Mountains and saw a dusty rise on the dirt road off to our right through the Pablo National Wildlife Refuge. It looked to offer the perfect capture point for a picture. Dave was amenable so off off-road we went. Oh we were still on a road as we were in the mini van, not an ATV, but it was a narrow dirt road, and a couple of old (old) pickups were the only vehicles we saw the entire time we were on it. We saw cows. Lots and lots of cows. We saw some deer--including a doe with a little fawn almost lost in the high grass--and ducks and geese. And I got my vista shot.Cows!We got to Missoula in plenty of time to park and take a stroll through downtown to the farmer's market. Unlike the Polson market yesterday, the Missoula farmer's market is all produce, meat, honey, plants and foodstuffs. There is another market, the People's Market, a block away where you can find handcrafts, crystals with special powers, hand-tied flies for fly fishing, healing oils and unguents, and anything else you might expect in the city that is the last bastion of the time of peace and love in Montana.At the first booth in the farmer's market, run by one of the many Hmong families that sell there, we found beautiful fresh morel mushrooms and grabbed a couple of bags. It was too early for huckleberries--the Hmong will have those come later in the summer. The Amish and Mennonites were also well-represented as market vendors as were the occasional Russian or Eastern European babushkas selling pickling cucs. While we didn't get any cucs today, I have a hankering to make pickles this summer so I will be picking up some nice little ones for baby dills later on.More farmer's market bountyWe skipped the People's Market today in favor of the street musicians, and I was absolutely blown away by Jesse Davis and William Cook of TopHouse. They were gracious enough to let me video them playing a song so I could post it here, and I was gracious enough to give them (literally again) a fistful of money. Okay, it was mostly ones, but it was all Dave would let me have. I can get a bit... carried away in my enthusiasms. I also liked the woman playing banjo and the guy in a kilt and a baseball cap singing Livin' On a Prayer. Music on every corner. Literally.Whenever we come to Missoula I make it a point to go the 4 Ravens Gallery. My first artistic mentor, Katie Patten of Mercurial Art and Glass Concepts is one of the owner/partners, and I always find gorgeous work there to keep and to gift. Today I fell in love with a couple of watercolors, one of shallots and one of onions. I may have to purchase one of them before the summer is over. For today we acquired pottery--an olive oil cruet and a coffee mug to add to my handmade mugs collection.Livin' On a Prayer(in a kilt)Butterfly Herbs, seductively beguiling the passers-by with scents of patchouli, ambergris, frankincense, myrrh and musk--eau de 1960's in a gem of an old building on Higgins Avenue--was our next stop. Dave shopped for spices, and I just had a coffee and drank in the atmosphere. Flower children of every age and degree of personal hygiene abounded with dreads, tats, and piercings the norm rather than the exception. I could have sat there all day. But Dave had a hankering for empanadas at the little storefront empanaderia in front of where we parked. Sadly, upon closer inspection there wasn't an onionless empanada to be had so we had to do without.She could play that banjo...The afternoon was spent reliving Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I have to admit that Kurt Russell as a younger Ego was much less creeptastic this time through. Maybe because I was prepared for him. Now we relax at Liquid Planet back downtown until it's time to go to the airport. A coffeeshop is not a popular hangout on a summer evening in Missoula so we are enjoying having the comfy leather couches all to ourselves. I think I'll get a kombucha (I'm sure they have it here) now and go back to designing our bed. I leave you with... TopHouse!"},

Oh I can't lie, there was less bounce and more stumble. But I thought about bouncing because today was our first day of the summer going to the Polson Farmer's Market! This early in the season there is less farmer and more crafter/baker, but it is always fun to peruse the all the wares from bullet keychains to cheese curds to fresh apple pie, scones and jam. There was even a guy selling Lichtenberg burned wood objects. He made his Lichtenberg machine from a microwave transformer. It's clearly more powerful than the Calistoga one I purchased (deeper longer burns), but I'm betting less safe.moving slabs of blue pineAfter we got home (Dave, Gallifrey, and I all went in the Mini Cooper--Gallifrey was the hit of the market), I started spinning the fiber for my combination/mash-up sweater coat. That is going to be one fun project--though I'm still unsure about using merino in a coat. A little spinning, a little reading, and it was time to head out to the Dupuis lumber mill for my first foray buying raw wood for furniture building. I have my heart set on a blue pine desk and bed frame/headboard for Austin. Blue pine is so named because it is pine that was killed by mountain pine beetles and then infected with a fungus that caused dark staining in the sapwood. I have been wanting to make this bed for three years, and this summer I finally hit the tipping point for seeing what wood is available and what the cost is.The first slabs I picked out for a desk andmaybe a dining table...Out at Dupuis, the owner, Daylen, took me to the back metal shed and we went through the dried cut slabs they already have. They have logs too, but those take a long time to dry after they're cut into slabs--even with a kiln. Picking out this wood is not like picking through a bin of fiber or a case of glass. The slabs were stacked with little spacers in between, and they were 3-4 inches thick, 20-27 inches wide and 10-12 feet long. Of course the ones that initially caught my eye were on the bottom of the pile so Daylen went out and got the biggest forklift I have ever seen and moved everything around so I could get all the way to the bottom ones. I fell in love with four 3-inch thick 12-foot long pieces of varying widths and headed home after purchasing them. Dupuis is going to plane them for me and there's no way I could have carried them in the Mini Cooper anyway. As it is, I'm going to have to figure out how to get them back to Texas... But, as Dave likes to say, that's a problem for future Brenda.Rough sketch of bed--headboard detail not startedmortise and tenon jointsBack at the homestead I watched a bunch of YouTube videos by the Wood Whisperer, downloaded a copy of Google Sketch-up and started designing. Here is what I have come up with so far. It took quite a bit of time to get proficient enough with Sketch-up to be able to get the detail I wanted in the mortise and tenon joints for the frame pieces and the footboard so I haven't even started on the headboard part. I also didn't even try to show the natural edges that the footboard will have (I'm using a 20 inch wide, 3 inch thick slab for it).Tomorrow we go to Missoula to pick up Jessie and Kyla at the airport (after a day roaming the Missoula Farmer's Market, taking in an afternoon movie and an early dinner) so I won't get to work on my designs again till then. Oh it's hard to wait!"},
{"title": "Life Slows Its Pace Again", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2017", "text": "Starting the morning in the gardenI would highly recommend that everyone split their time between two households. I hadn't realized what an incredible break moving from one place to another--even for just a couple of months--gives one's brain. I cannot stress what a great life-resetter it is! I remember feeling vastly relieved and unencumbered when I moved to Austin last June. Yes, I had a ton of unpacking and organizing to do, but any bad cycle or habits of time that I had in Atlanta were broken. Every day dawned fresh with things to do, but no chains already set. I had choices, and I didn't feel overwhelmed.Gallifrey helps separate the rovingMontana this summer feels like that too. I get up in the morning and I garden--or not, I work on my spinning project--or not, I have an appointment or lesson--or not. There is no drive, only flow. Life stretches out in front of me with endless possibilities and refreshingly few obligations. Sure there is some maintenance (it wouldn't be a home of it didn't require time for upkeep), but it doesn't swamp me.Before we left Austin I cleaned out the refrigerator and threw away old bottles, jars, and packages of things that would be out of date before we got back from the summer. It felt liberating, and I reveled in the knowledge that I will return home to a clean (and mostly empty) fridge. I wish I had done the same thing here. I really looked at the contents of the door of the refrigerator here today and I was horrified. There was mayonnaise from our last stay here... two years ago. The door was crammed with things I know house science projects or alien lifeforms waiting to eat our brains while we sleep. Looks like I do have one upcoming obligation here...Kaiju guards the roving I decided not to useIt's so quiet in this house that, when I am not typing on the keyboard, I can hear my heart beating in my ears, and the occasional squeak of Dave's chair upstairs. The pets aren't even snoring right now. It's putting me to sleep, but before I head off for a nap, I'm going to write about a project I have begun. It's a SAL/KAL (spin along, knit along) that I am starting now and will continue in conjunction with the Tour de Fleece. (More on that another day.)The project is designed to help use up beautiful but random (not matched to a color or project) 4 oz skeins of hand dyed roving. Every spinner buys them, luscious little braids of scrumptious color that we have no idea what we're going to do with but which we absolutely, positively must have. Then they languish in our stashes because there's not all that much you can do with 4 oz of yarn--no matter what the One Skein Wonder books tell you. But for this project, it doesn't matter if you only have one skein of any given colorway as long as you have eight skeins that you can see going together in a glorious technicolor project. Eight skeins (11 for me--I don't want to run short) are enough to knit a sweater. I'm going to knit a sweater coat!Look at the lovely crossover cable in the back!I really hope a little over 3-1/2 lbs of yarn will be enough to make this pattern. Maybe I should do more than guess and actually take some measurements because once I have started spinning, it will be hard to add more roving into the mix and I have my heart set on this pattern.When I was in high school I found a thick red mohair and wool sweater coat knit in a thick cable pattern by my mother. It was enormous--I don't think she ever wore it. She said I could have it and I wore it everywhere, whenever it was cold enough (and in Montana that meant I had plenty of opportunity). I wore it through college and brought it to graduate school in Chicago. Somewhere there I lost it, as often happens with things one loves and drags around the world. I have thought of it many times in the 30 years since it disappeared, and wished I still had it. Now I am taking roving of every color in Merino, Polworth, and other blends of wool and I'm going to spin a light yarn for a lightweight sweater coat that I can wear in Austin. Merino is not the most durable of wools. It is the softest, but I have some reservations about its appropriateness for this coat. I guess I'll have to wait for the final evaluation and choice when I finish the yarn.Pavlova sleeps on the discarded alpaca rovingThe pets all helped in the preparation of the fiber--mostly by napping on or near it. Pavlova took a brief, but more intense roll by chasing and pouncing on bits as I pulled them apart. She was eventually dissuaded.And then it was time for a late lunch, some reading in the Sky chair, followed by a two-hour nap. Dave napped too as it was after 5:00 in Austin and the work day was done. He is convinced that we are sleeping so much because of the lack of oxygen in the air (we are at about 3,000 ft being at the top of the hill in Polson). I think it's just been a hard couple of years.Now the evening stretches lazily ahead. Maybe some spinning, maybe some reading. There'll be enough time tomorrow or next week for more serious endeavors."},

This is the first time I have attempted a post with a cat and a dog. But I am not going to dislodge anyone. We all just watched A Dog's Purpose. Gallifrey was fascinated at the beginning, and then went to sleep. Jig stayed agitated for the entire movie and kept pressing up against my seat staring at me. Finally I let him up next to me, and he curled into a ball huddled against my leg with his nose tucked to his tail and to my thigh. Then Kaiju wanted some lap time for the first time since we got here. And so there were two.The movie is over, the tears are dried, and the animals remain nestled. All I need now is Pavlova deciding to join us. I was disappointed that the critics panned the movie (it only got 30% Rotten Tomatoes on Netflix), but I was encouraged by the audience reviews (4.5 stars from 511 reviews). Even Dave liked it--while saying it was the most manipulative movie since ET (and, yes, he cried too). All that remains for me is this post and the inside of my eyelids--oh yes, and some soppy snuggling with my spouse.We started the evening by going to the East Shore Smokehouse for dinner, then home for wine, chocolate chip cookies (Dave is the cookie god), and a wonderfully sappy movie (made a change from our usual fare of Deadwood Season 2). Now it's 10:00 pm and it's still light out. I love summer in Montana!The time zone is a bit problematic as my piano lesson is at 8:00 am Wednesday morning for the rest of the summer (9:00 in Austin and 10:00 in Atlanta where my teacher is), but I got up at 7:00 (it gets light about 5:30 am) to practice, had my lesson, and then went out to the garden for a couple of hours. I don't remember all I did this afternoon. I know I worked on my upcoming spinning project (a fascinating piece I will describe on Friday) and read, and I didn't nap. Well, I didn't really nap. I did lie down for half an hour before going to dinner but the J called from Atlanta halfway through and we talked for a good long while. I have missed her and am really looking forward to seeing both her and Kyla on Saturday!"},

Yesterday I didn't really follow through on that plan, but I'm all behind it today. So far I've read email, signed up for the Tour de Fleece (similar to Spinzilla only linked to the Tour de France and our teams spin as theirs do), planned my project (based on the random stash basket of hand dyed rovings I brought with me to Montana), and had breakfast. I've also lazed in the Sky Chair and done a bit of reading. Now I'm contemplating a nap.-------Nap over, dinner over, a ride with Gallifrey in the Mini Cooper with the top down over. It's only 9:15, but bed is calling me again. Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll wake up and get back into the groove. As soon as I get all the pets (including the kitten) back in, I'll wrap up for the night."},
{"title": "Let the Summer Begin", "date": "Monday, June 19, 2017", "text": "That ribbon of highwaySomehow the night before last when I got online to post, I didn't notice that my post from Friday on Glass Incarnate was missing. However tonight I noticed that both of the posts from the past three days that I did on my phone ended up on the misbeehiving blog! Apparently when I post from my phone it goes there by default. Who knew. So I moved the posts over tomnight, and sadly lost the comments (sorry Bill!) Ididn't want to lose my streak of posting every day since December 27, 2016. Now I'm ready for today's.I am very relaxed right now--a super-sized Negroni will do that for you, even if you had it over four hours ago--and I still don't feel up to a long post. I think the idea of posting earlier in the day is a good one. Today I managed to get up by 9:00 am (I heard Dave on his conference call on the deck above me and that was enough to get my bones moving out of bed). Dave took a short break from work--sadly no day off--and we went to Pop's Grill for an enormous breakfast, and when we got home, I decided to give myself a treat and I weeded in the garden for an hour. There were many other things I could have done--maybe even should have done--but I chose to clear my mind and zen out in the dirt.They don't call it Big Sky Country for nothingThe garden at my mom's house used to seem so big and overwhelming to me! I used to look at it and I couldn't imagine getting it all weeded. Today I parceled it out into a week's work, and I determined a good treat for weeding would be to go buy some perennials to take the place of the weeds I pulled. Expanding your projects makes you grow, and the experience of putting in the botanical garden in Austin makes this entire yard look small. Most of the weeds in the bed are grasses--though there is a dandelion or two in the bunch--so weeding goes fast and I feel no angst about pulling up wild flowers. Tomorrow I'll plant the perennials I got at the nursery this afternoon, and then I'll weed the next strip in the garden. I should have taken pictures today, but I'll do it tomorrow.Plants here are very expensive. Next year it might be a good idea to grow seedlings in Texas and then bring them up here to plant in the garden. I still have a big bed in front that I covered in plastic three years ago in preparation for turning it into a a large raised bed and it's going to need a lot of plants. Pete from two doors down offered me some irises and poppies when he splits his this week, but they'll just make a dent. Or I could just continue to support the small local nursery which has to provide a living for its owners in an inhospitable climate in a very small town.The view of the lake from dinner last nightBut enough of plans. This summer is all about relaxing and recharging my batteries. Sure I'll source some blue pine to make our bed and my desk, and maybe I'll design the mosaic for the front hall and fuse some experimental glow in the dark tile for our master bath remodel (the powder came Friday!).l But, really, relaxation and recharge are the watchwords. Pictures of the lovely lake and garden tomorrow."},

Well, everyone who was in the minivan anyway. Dave, who drove the Mini Cooper alone without even any music to keep him company, is the most sanguine of all of us. Kaiju doesn't deal with stress well--he lashes out at everyone with wicked teeth and wickedly fast claws. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to towel him to get him into the carrier tomorrow. Today, after a brief foray around the car, he went back into his carrier (each cat has to have their own because Kaiju is vicious when he gets put into it) and slept there all day. Pavlova slept in my lap and the days were good in the back (Gallifrey gets the back bench seat and Jig and Baxter took turns on the other backseat).All went well until Baxter managed to slip off the seat on the door side and get himself wedged. He cried and carried on and just got himself more and more stuck. There we were doing 75 mph going through somewhere near Denver and I had to pull off onto the shoulder and get out to help Baxter. But it got worse. When I opened the side (powered) door, Baxter slid and his head went through the bottom of the door mechanism. The doors are meant to open if you close them on something, but apparently there is no safety mechanism if something falls through to the back. I was hauling on the door trying to stop it from closing on his neck as it was opening and the cars on the highway (thankfully on the other side of the car) were zipping by at a bezillion mph. I ended up grabbing his collar and pulling him out by his neck. We were both shaking by then, but he was okay.Now we're settled into a La Quinta, Dave went out for a bottle of wine while I ordered pizza to be delivered. Everyone has eaten, and we're ready to sleep. Tomorrow, Montana."},

Today... was a pretty great day! The contractors stayed last last night and tonight and they will finish the cosmetic parts of the pond by tomorrow--that is to say all the rock work and the waterfalls. There is still a lot of plumbing and filtering infrastructure to get in--and heaven knows when they're going to work on that as they are moving on to their next job on Saturday. I just hope they get to most of it before I come back in July.Tomorrow night I'll do the final reveal with pictures, but for tonight I'm just going to watch another episode of Deadwood with the spouse and go to bed early. I was out in the sun all day again today watching the pond construction and putting in the bog plants. I am sunburned, and my eyes are burning from the sunscreen running into them. Maybe a gin and tonic will help..."},
{"title": "Brenda of the 600 Days", "date": "Wednesday, June 14, 2017", "text": "Unlike Anne of the 1000 days, I do not expect to be beheaded any time soon. The law and my aversion to prison being what they are, I'm not expecting to behead any contractors any time soon either. *sigh*. Nevertheless, when we leave for Montana, Stone's Throw will have been under renovation and/or construction for 600 days, and the projects that are all in progress in one stage of completion or another won't be finished. The exterior painting won't be done. The paths in the Botanical Garden own't be done. The front door won't be replaced. The pond won't be done. The stream in the back won't be done. The rainwater collection system won't be done. The painting was only half finished when the painters vanished so now there is plastic sheeting masking off huge swathes of decking and stairs, just flapping in the breeze. At least they took the plastic off the windows before they left so we could see out.Today my glass is definitely half empty, and I have no one to blame but myself. I believed all the assurances that things would be done by a certain date on *every* project because I wanted to, and because the contractors were earnest, and sincere, and seemed to just be having a run of bad luck with weather and staff and vendors and life. I should never have let my current contractor start so many simultaneous projects as he has going. I should have insisted that he have all the materials and workers for the project underway rather than starting the next one because he was missing something for the first one. But I didn't want to waste time and I figured keeping them moving forward was better than having them not work and wait. Maybe if I had said, \"You don't have the materials here for the job we had scheduled? Fine. Everybody go home until you have them.\" instead of paying them to do something else. Today for me was the last straw.Last night he told me they would be done with the capstone around the pond today, the pea gravel would be delivered and the guys would get it in first thing, and he would set the stone for the three waterfalls himself. Then his main worker called in sick today, (he went home sick yesterday afternoon), the third guy he was going to get to haul pea gravel couldn't come, the pea gravel delivery was delayed until 2:00 (it still isn't here yet), and he didn't show up himself to start laying the capstone till 11:30.  At one point when they started working on the capstone, he was talking to me and letting one of his workers--a really good guy, but no experience in laying stone--do the capstone. When I questioned the contractor on it, he said he was teaching him how to do it and it was the only way he was going to learn. I politely lost my shit. I said I didn't think it was appropriate for him to be learning on my time when we are this far behind the schedule, and I would really like to see them both working. I said that I understood that I wasn't going to be able to see the skimmer set-up, or the float set-up, or the plumbing finished before I left for Montana, but I absolutely had to see the capstone all around the pond and the waterfalls done. I was pissy, he was annoyed, he stomped off, and I went back to the house leaving them to do whatever they were going to do.I feel really bad when I crack the whip. Whoever I crack it over invariably looks at me like I'm nuts and as if all I'm doing by pestering them about when they are going to get done is slowing them down. But from my perspective, I don't pester until they are already seriously late, or they look like they're going to be late and I need to know in advance to change things down the line that are contingent upon their progress.Lack of realistic time table seems to be endemic with many contractors. The kitchen remodel was a mess both for lack of adherence to schedule and crappy work. The roof took three months instead of three weeks. The walk through on the botanical gardens and the rest of the landscaping was February 13, it was supposed to be done by the end of March. It's still a ways from being completely done. Admittedly, there has been more than a little mission creep on my part, but dammit part of managing a schedule is managing customers' expectations. \"Yes, we can add that in but it will add one week to the schedule\" instead of \"Sure we can do that\" with never a mention of schedule or cost and nothing but assurances that it would be finished on time when pressed.At least the solar guys hopped right on it and threw more people at the project--without asking for more money--when they dropped the ball. They even went threw all the last minute hoops the city threw at them with nary a hint of we can't do that today because we're busy with something else. They were very much a how-high-would-you-like-us-to-jump organization when they screwed up--which made me feel like it was less common for them.Do I sound bitter? I feel burned out. I need the break I will get this summer from contractors. Now it's time for one last progress check for the day. I will stay away from sharp implements while I am out there.NOTE: They're about where I expected they'd be. They'll finish the capstone on the lower pond by 5:00 and the pea gravel is about 20% in (if that). That leaves tomorrow to finish the pea gravel so I can plant the bog plants on Friday, and tomorrow and Friday for the entire upper capstone and the waterfalls. As Miracle Max would say, \"It would take a miracle\"."},
{"title": "The Pond Goes On", "date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2017", "text": "Today saw another delivery of 2,000 gallons of water for the pond, and the acquisition (and release into it) of two dozen minnows and 11-1/2 dozen goldfish. I ended the day by putting the water lilies in the lower pond. Tomorrow we'll get the pea gravel so Thursday I'll be able to plant all the bog plants in the top.I was hoping the pond would be completely done before we left for Montana, but it is not to be. It should look pretty close to finished, but the skimmer won't be in, the float ball for maintaining the water level won't be in, and the backflow preventer won't be in. My big fish fountain won't be repaired and installed either. But I'll be back in July (mainly so Jessie can get her braces off) and by then it really should be done. I think I want to make a platform in the middle of the pond for frogs to sit on. I fished a frog out yesterday and put him in the tank with the water lilies because he couldn't get out on his own. Maybe if I have a sunning platform for frogs in there (maybe even as a stand for the fish fountain), frogs will be able to get out. Our pond in Atlanta had a sloping entrance so things that fell in could get out. I need to do something similar in this pond in a way that won't encourage herons...Tomorrow I'll have better pics. For today, here are a couple of shots of the guys trying out one of the rocks for a waterfall slab."},
{"title": "Stupidity Runs Rampant", "date": "Monday, June 12, 2017", "text": "Yesterday was Sunday. Kind of an obvious statement, but it serves to anchor the coming post. On Sunday we do laundry. Laundry uses a relatively large amount of water. We also, more likely than not, run the dishwasher. The dishwasher doesn't use a huge amount of water, but it adds to the consumption nonetheless. Sunday is also a great day to start the morning sharing a bath, lounging and reading our books in the sun amongst the orchids (and right now tomatoes). The bathtub--seating two, as it does--does use a lot of water, especially when one of the participants (the stupid one to be named later) chooses to top it off with hot water and stay a bit longer after the other one leaves. All in all, given that our system only produces 1.5 gallons of filtered water a minute, it was not a good day to decide to run a test of the entire soaker irrigation system in the botanical garden.I had good intentions (obviously). We are getting ready to leave for Montana and I didn't want the house sitter to have to muck around with watering a solid half acre of new plants. But I failed when I bought the timers for the hoses and didn't get the kind where you can specify the day(s) of the week you want the system to run. Mine just have intervals so logic (which I applied only sparingly) dictates that if you program them all on the same day, they will all start on the same day and run on the same day thereafter. I also set each hose to run for an hour. Finally, to make sure each hose had sufficient pressure, I set them to run in sequence rather than in parallel. Let's do the math. We have six raised beds. All but two of them have two hoses each for a total of ten hoses. That means running our water for ten hours straight. On Sunday. On top of everything else.The tip of the iceberg of my stupidity was discovered by the spouse on Monday morning when he went to brush his teeth and found there was no water. I blithely reassured him that it was just because I had watered the night before and all I had to do was go flip the reserve switch on the tank and we'd have water. The true magnitude of my stupidity was subsequently discovered when I arrived at the well house to find we were already in reserve mode. I had run our tank dry--and it started the day almost full. The coup de grâce was delivered by the new meter I had installed which told me we (and I use that pronoun very loosely) had managed to use 1,750 gallons of water on Sunday. Average consumption for a family of two is 160-200 gallons for a day.Back to the drawing board for an automated system for watering the botanical gardens (thank god I put in native plants which only need water to get established and then sparingly thereafter)."},
{"title": "Superheroes and the Summer Blockbusters", "date": "Sunday, June 11, 2017", "text": "The summer blockbuster season has begun, and I was lucky enough this week to see both The Mummy and Wonder Woman. I saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Pirates of the Caribbean the days they came out.As I am guessing is the same with most other people who have seen the first two movies, Wonder Woman is by far and away my favorite. I would go so far as to say that it is easily as good as the first Star Trek (thanks to Chris Pine) and it holds its own with  Guardians 2. I am really looking forward to the upcoming League of Justice film in November.So the studios that own what superheroes: Disney owns Marvel Studios. Warner Brothers owns DC. Universal is hoping to get into the game with the Dark Universe, of which the Mummy is the flagship film. 20th Century Fox has all the X-Men movies--including Logan, and they also have Deadpool. Paramount has the Star Trek franchise, which I shouldn't mention because it isn't any kind of super hero series, but, hey, Chris Pine. It's very interesting to see what different studios are doing to get into the game since the take-off of The Avengers.Marvel continues to be consistently strong in Guardians as in their individual character movies and the Avengers films. Warner Brothers has mostly bombed trying to do as well with the DC characters, but I really think they hit it out of the park with Wonder Woman. What's so great about this triumph is that it is a movie with a female protagonist played by an unknown, non-American actress. She is supported by a well put together cast of quirky sidekicks (the staple of any successful action movie), and I think the future looks bright for WB. They are pulling together a powerhouse cast for the League of Justice (I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for Jason Momoa--Kal Drogo--to play Aquaman). Now if they can keep the humor balance and not let Ben Affleck bring it down (Tom Cruise 2)...Universal should really have picked someone other than Tom Cruise for The Mummy. I am not wild about him, but I respect his rendition of Jack Reacher and his run as Ethan Hunt. But in the Mummy he never found his stride and his attempts at humor and showing a warm side were (not) laughable. Russell Crowe portrayed a credible Dr. Jekyll and even gave us a glimpse of a well-realized Mr. Hyde. But Tom Cruise's character (I can't even remember his name) fell flat in the comedy arena, and lacked good side kicks. Annabelle Wallis set a strong foundation for a continuation of the Jenny Halsey character, but, again, there was no comic relief (sidekicks, minions, whatever) in the movie leading one to believe it took itself (as did its leading man) too seriously.Now since I don't take myself too seriously, I am off to bed! I'll finish the posts about the bees tomorrow."},

Like the day that the post will chronicle, it begins with infinite possibility. I can hear Tony singing \"Something's Coming\" from West Side Story as I write this post. Of course by the time I write the post the day is over, but what spills from my fingers to the screen is anybody's guess--I don't even know what I'm going to write about until the first sentence forms. Spontaneity, that's what makes bouncing out of bed in the morning worth it. Oh sure, life is worth getting out of bed for, but spontaneity makes you bounce.Today was a good spontaneous day. We could have (arguably should have) spent it checking things off lists and getting ready for the great summer migration, but it wasn't really necessary. It was much more fun to go for a walk this morning, and then go for a late lunch/early dinner at Roaring Fork this afternoon. There we sat out on their deck playing Tsuro, munching on appetizers, and sipping frufty cocktails. What made it even better is that we followed it up by going home and taking a nap, only getting up to water Zaga's tomatoes (for me) and to craft some code (for Dave) before heading to Bryon and Vanessa's for a late evening playing Takenoko. I feel so wonderfully, exuberantly carefree. (I almost wrote irresponsible, but responsibility didn't raise its ugly head today.)Tomorrow, Sunday, will be a good day for responsibility, planning, organizing, and packing. After breakfast--or maybe brunch. Food has taken on a whole new aspect with Jessie gone. eating out has been easier than eating in, and Dave and I both like the same things so deciding where to go isn't the struggle it is when the three of us have to come to a consensus. Soon, however, all choices will be removed as the watering holes we frequent in Polson are The Smokehouse and McKenzie River Pizza for dinner, and Pop's Grill and Mrs. Wonderful's Marmalade Cafe for breakfast or lunch. I guess there are a couple more places we'd do lunch--even very generic Mexican and Thai places. But we mainly stick to the first four. We'll be back in a town with one, tiny, two-screen movie theatre and two restaurants we'd dine at.That's what's coming--and I can't wait."},

The contractors are still behind, but I still love them. I didn't get to everything on my list, but I got half way through. Mostly I'm just content.

I did get Zaga's bees and set them up this morning, but I'll write about that tomorrow in Misbeehiving. Today's post on yesterday's affair of the varroa mites (gack!) was long enough. I hope Dave isn't too annoyed about his kitchen strainer...For now I'm going to put away the Chinese takeout (we had Vietnamese for lunch) and settle in to read my book a bit. I might also stew a bit more about where the cardigan I'm knitting has disappeared to, but maybe I'll drown those sorrows in another glass of wine and my book. I love well-crafted stories where people do heroic feats of daring do (magical, in the case of the book I am reading now) to help other people and triumph over evil. Okay, enough writing.

{"title": "Another Year Opens", "date": "Thursday, June 08, 2017", "text": "I took my first step  onto the road called 56 today and it is a fine road! There are many horrible things happening in our country and in the world right now, but today, in my little slice of Austin, the day was perfect. I missed my daughter who is in Atlanta visiting friends, but I was snuggled awake by my spouse who then plied me with fresh, hot coffee, pastries and flowers. It was sunny and hot all day--and there's a full moon tonight.I even zipped through my bee maintenance in record time. The only blot on my day was a spot, well it was more like a lot of spots with six little legs waving madly in the air as I poked them to see if they were smutz or varroa mites (smutz doesn't wave its legs around). But even the mites turned into an opportunity to learn more about bees and to get more in tune with my hives. There'll be a Misbeehiving post tomorrow that will go into varroa mites in depth for those who are not like my husband (whose eyes tend to glaze over when I start in talking about mites and mite treatments).To celebrate the day, I was pampered. I was scrubbed, exfoliated, pummeled and oiled from head to toe. I drank champagne (and lots of water) throughout and just reveled in the bliss of a guilt-free day being glad to be alive. In the evening, Dave took me to the Alamo Drafthouse to see the new Mummy movie. I liked it, I didn't love it. I might have loved it had they chosen someone other than Tom Cruise for the lead and had significantly fewer screen writers. Sadly... But I'm looking forward to Wonder Woman on Sunday.Back to the concept of birthdays. In the US we start our new year on January 1. The change from the old to the new gives us a chance to reflect on our lives and adjust our course if we think we're heading into undesirable waters. Birthdays are somewhat the same, especially for me as mine falls almost in the middle of the regular year. I almost get to start over on my birthday with a new evaluation of life and what tweaks need to be made to improve it. Today I am happy to say I don't feel the need for any tweaks. Oh some of the things I planned to do at the beginning of the year have fallen by the wayside (spinning 15 minutes a day, making bread and pasta on a regular basis, keeping up with ikebana). But some things are going strong. I have posted every day since the end of December. This might not be such a an accomplishment to everyone else, but for me, at the end of the year I will have a journal of every day of my life for one year. I have also kept up with the 365 Project and taken and posted a picture a day every day this year. From this project I'll have a visual journal of the year.

{"title": "Too Late to Call It the Antepenultimate Day", "date": "Wednesday, June 07, 2017", "text": "Today is the last day I'm only 55 years old. Tomorrow I'll still be 55, I'll just be 55 + 1. If I had thought of this a few days ago I could have posted that it was the antepenultimate day before I turned 56, but I snoozed, I lost. I love the word \"antepenultimate\". It means the next to the next to the last. Last = ultimate, next to the last = penultimate. I learned the word my freshman year of high school when I got the chicken pox and spent a lot of time laid up in bed reading the Penrod books by Booth Tarkington. I've never read the Magnificent Ambersons--also written by Tarkington--and he won a Pulitzer for it. That might be a good read for this summer.I celebrated the last of my 50 hump year by doing not much. Oh I planned to do a bunch of stuff with the bees, and I planned to put the last plants (vines and a couple of shrubs) where I would like them planted so Devon can get them in. I also planned to make appointments to have both the cars serviced before Montana. Well I didn't get those appointments made, but I did get an appointment for a mani/pedi today and a mini spa day tomorrow. A girl's got to have her priorities and I plan to ride into the last half of my fifties with style and well-sanded, well-oiled skin from head to toe. I think they're even going to use some hot stones on me tomorrow!Of course before I get the whole pampering thing done I do have to see to the bees. I have my plan of attack all set out: First I'll slip the paper into the bottom of the hives and then I'll dust all the little critters with powdered sugar. I'll collect the powdered sugar on the paper and then pour it into an empty plastic frit jar--I have one jar for each hive. Then I'll put the new brood boxes on two of the hives with the feeders (filled today) in them. For the nasty hive that already has the second brood box on, I'll just take out two of the frames in the top box and put in the feeder. The hybrid hive will get a closed-top ladder deep division feeder, and the TopBar won't get anything at all. As soon as I'm done feeding and putting on new brood boxes, I'll slip off my very hot bee suit and take the jars of powdered sugar into the house to do my mite count in cool air-conditioned comfort. There is no way in hell I'm going to swelter out in the sun in my full bee suit trying to count little black specs with wavy legs. That's how you tell a varroa mite from a regular black spec: When you poke a mite it waves its legs around. When you poke a spec it just sits there because, hey, no legs! I have to get this all done by 9:20 am so I can take a shower and hit the road by 9:30 to be at the Spa by 10:00.For my spa treat (I am using the gift card Dave and Jessie got me last year for Mother's Day), I'm taking a bottle of champagne. I won't finish it, but I have a time where I need to sit and wait between services as they couldn't get them all in one after the other. But I don't care. I'll sit in their comfy lounging area in a fluffly white spa robe reading my book and drinking champagne. Then tomorrow night, The Mummy! I just wish Jessie were home to share the day."},

I get sick to my stomach if I work for long in the heat, and Austin right now is nothing if not hot. The studio is hot, the garden is hot. It's hard to find a place that's not hot except for the couch. Needless to say I'm not getting much done. As usual there are dozens of things on my list that I need to get done before going to Montana--some of them I need to get done to take to Montana. But the heat is just sapping my will to live.Some posts area litany of things accomplished in the day. If I were to do a post like that today it would be things not done. Tomorrow I need to get up and make sugar syrup for the bees, and swap out the bottom board on one of the hives so I can at least test three of them for varroa mites. I need to do this while it is as cool as it's going to get for the day as I have to fully suit up for Hive #4. I'm tempted not to feed them when they're so cranky, but that wouldn't bee nice!"},

I stood on a rubber mat, I wore rubber soled shoes, I worked on a wooden table with no metal or other conductive material around, and I kept my phone and electronics on another table. I even took off the silver pendant I always wear and I didn't have any other jewelry on except my wedding ring. The LM has two probes that conduct the electricity, and it doesn't have an on/off switch. Instead it has a foot pedal that you must depress in order to have current. The second you take your foot off the pedal, the power is cut. This post shows three quick tiles I did before dinner.As has been the case for me lately (I swear I am having more and more senior moments!), the first baking soda and water solution I mixed up (it's the electrolyte solution that facilitates the arcing of the electricity) had the wrong proportions of baking soda to water. It still worked, but not as well as it did with more baking soda in it. I worked primarily in pine today though I also tried a hardwood piece (birch, I think), and I experimented using both one probe or both at a time. I can definitely see the potential of this tool for making some very cool art, though it doesn't seem to create as dramatic pieces (deeper wider burns) as the homemade, microwave transformer-based LB's. But my spouse is already dubious about me using this one, there's no way on earth he'd go for one of those.Today was also a bee day so I'd better mosey on over to the bee blog--which, by the way, is getting a new name: Misbeehiving.

I am too old for this--I need more sleep. After putting her on the plane for Atlanta, Dave and I stopped for breakfast at Kerbey Lane. When we got home (7:30 am) we fell back into bed, and I didn't get up till after 11:00. Dave had to shake me awake even then. I think I could seriously have slept all day. I'm ready for bed now and it's only 9:30! In spite of my sloth, I did a lot of creative thinking today. While visions of glass and other media did dart in and out, I must admit that today's main focus was again wood.Our ceilings are all woodAs I was dozing this morning I was thinking about the frame (mostly the headboard) I'm going to build for our bed. I was running through the qualities of different kinds of wood in my mind, and I was also considering the enormous pile of stripped juniper cedar logs and limbs that is building up in the front yard to see if there was a way to use them.Driftwood bedBut the bed won't exist in a vacuum, it will have to fit in with the existing base elements of the room. Right now our bedroom has a 30 year-old teal wool plush carpet. We are going to replace it with wood when we redo the bathroom.Initially we thought we might do a bamboo floor since the flooring we have in the rest of the main floor isn't available anymore (you can see it under the dog), but then we decided that something that radically different, combined with the layout of our house, would make the bedroom and bathroom look like an add-on instead of an integrated part of the house.Upcycled palletsSo we'll probably go with a similar style of varying widths in an oak for the floor--maybe one that's even a bit darker than the one shown. We also have to consider the pine ceilings in every room on the first floor including the bedroom (the dining room ceiling is shown above). The windows also have wide pine trim and decoration around them, and I don't see replacing it or changing the color on it.Blue pineMuch as I like the stripped cedar, that rustic look just doesn't feel right. Maybe for Montana, but not this house. Likewise the cool beds people are making out of upcycled pallets really don't fit in with the armoire and the style of desk I would like to add in there. Another thought I had was blue pine which is wood from beetle-killed pine that we have a lot of in Montana. But though I love it, its predominantly grey cast would not go with ANYTHING we already have.Luckily there is a reclaimed wood place in Missoula that I will visit to see what I can scrounge and possibly have cut. Maybe I should see what's available first and design around that."},

She leaves for Atlanta tomorrow morning at, gulp, 7:05 am (what was I thinking when I chose that departure time?!?!?). We need to leave for the airport about 5:30 am. I swear I'm coming right home and sleeping after we drop her off.Work at Stone's Throw has been challenging this week. Materials haven't shown up or the wrong materials have shown up. The workers are blocked because they don't have the tools, the materials, or both to do their jobs. I am seriously losing my calm! The latest snafu was the second round of rock delivered for the top edge of the pond. First the stone was 4X4X10\" block. I rejected that before they even got it off the truck. Then they brought the flagstone shown above. I thought that was going to be okay, but as soon as they got it laid out, it's obvious it doesn't fit in at all with the tidiness and regularity of the rest of the stone. Today I went out to the stone yard and picked the stone I wanted (that was three hours out of my day I didn't really have to spare), and Monday it will be delivered.The liner and washed river rock for the bog pond should also come Monday. I forgot to ask about the scaffolding for the painters, but I will send the contractor a text and remind him about it for Monday too. Maybe the electrician will even show up Monday and we'll have a fully productive team! Considering I had planned to have all of the gardens including the pond done by the end of March--at the latest--I am way past needing it to be done. I am so glad we don't have any kind of renovation project in Montana this summer... Though I do need to clear my parents' stuff out of the metal building on the lake property. I sold my share in it to my uncle last year and now I need to get all the stuff out so he can set up a workshop. Maybe he'll even let me use some of his tools!Okay, it's still 82 degrees here in Austin. The last time I looked this afternoon it was 92.

{"title": "Mid-Year Crisis", "date": "Thursday, June 01, 2017", "text": "What is it about the end of December/beginning of January and the end of May/beginning of June that makes me go non-linear in project space? My brain has been in overdrive with ideas for glow-in-the-dark in glass and resin, glass in metal and wood, glass as tile and cast sculpture, welding metal for sculpture for the garden (and with glass). So far I have purchased 2 kgs of strontium aluminate in blue-green and green, and as a birthday present to myself I got a Lichtenberg figure wood burner. It's a lot safer than the microwave transformer and produces the same effects on wood. Of course I look at the fractal-like design and I think of filling it--maybe with glow-in-the-dark resin, or maybe casting glass to fill the void.I have a lot of cedar (juniper) from cutting down all of the cedars to make room for the garden and other trees. Most of it isn't of any significant diameter. It will make good, rough garden furniture, but it's too small to mill into boards. But there are a couple of pieces that I can see making a split live edge table and casting glass for the middle cavity between the two live edges. Something like the piece below left, but with straight edges on the outside.Then there are the welding ideas. We got a couple of the tomato cages shown below right for vines in the new garden, and I couldn't help thinking I could make some really cool pieces like this if only I could bend, cut, and weld steel--I could use my own glass in them.I just have this intense creative drive to do one of a kind pieces right now. And I am trying to get away from the mentality that what I make I sell, and I have to be able to make it in a way that is cost efficient for production and making a living. Honestly, art to me anymore isn't about making a living. If I find myself needing to \"make a living\" again (i.e., pay the mortgage), I'll go back to software.I'm not sorry I decided to have a career as a glass artist, but I am under no illusions that the business of producing, marketing, and selling a production line of glass work exists in the same creative universe as making something for its own sake. Making something because the drive to do it is there from the moment you wake up till you drop asleep exhausted, and then goes on in your dreams is about passion, obsession. Sadly, production art is like production anything else after awhile: A job. And not one that pays very well.But had I not made the change from software to glass, I never would have become an artist. I started as someone with a passion for glass, but lacked the technical expertise and a personal artistic vision. Like many hobbyists, the first thing I picked up were the technical skills. Developing my own style took much longer, and it took longer still to be comfortable in the skin of an artist and to extend my confidence into other media than glass. Being an artist is about the way that you see and portray. If you are a technician, all the better as you have the skill to produce your inner vision, which makes you a good artist.I'm also really glad that Dave loves what he does for a living as much as I love creating for the sake of creating and learning for the sake of learning, because it means we won't starve. It doesn't hurt that he is an artist too, and a Mæstro at that. Passion and production, he is one lucky man."},

I found the workers in the midst of unloading and just said, \"Oh no, that's not the material I agreed too. No, we are not going to just cut it down. By the time I have paid for the labor to cut it and the rental of the saw, I will have paid more than I would have for the right material, and it will take three times as long.\" I hope the correct material gets delivered tomorrow and the capstone can go around the rim of both the bog area and the main pond.It was also a day of new beeeez, and there is a non-eyeglazing post on them here.In the meantime I dream of mosaic shower stalls and entry floors, glow-in-the-dark applications, a wood table inlaid with a cast glass river (anybody can do it with resin!), the bed headboard and desk I want to make for our room.

I have become obsessed with strontium aluminate and the potential of adding it to fused glass--specifically tile for the bathroom, and glass pebbles for the garden paths. In case you're unfamiliar with strontium aluminate, (and really, unless you're a chemist, why would you be familiar with it?) strontium aluminate is an inert, non-toxic chemical use as glow-in-the-dark pigment powder. I have a suspicion that it's what was in the glow-in-the-dark glass frit I bought many years ago. I made Jessie a cast starfish out of the frit and it still glows almost all night.Oh sure, you're thinking why don't I just buy glow-in-the-dark tile and pebbles for the garden? Because I am itching to play with the powder myself! I want to see what I can do with it as an added element in mosaics and castings, in fused pieces and combined with dichro! And with the global market what it is today, I can order it from a vast array of sources at very good prices. Heck, I can even buy it on Amazon. I also see the possibilities for glow in the dark and thermoreactive (or thermochromic) glass and resin pieces for inlay in wood or setting in metal--or in ceramic glaze.

Better stability.Today there was also a bee post so the bulk of my brain and energy went there, but I have a small bit left for here. Tomorrow we go into the final week of school for the J with two finals tomorrow and one on Wednesday. She will be done by 11:00 on Wednesday and will officially be a sophomore. Her friends are all learning to drive this summer, but she is remaining adamant that she has no interest in driving now. Polson this summer would be the perfect place to teach her as the speed limit is a strictly observed 25 mph, Ah well, maybe she'll change her mind.Now I'm shopping for clothes with her. It's always an experience as her modus operandi for shopping is so much different than mine. She likes TopShop, Rita Ora Dragon Adidas (shoes and clothes), and Air Jordans in burgundy velvet. She also has no problem shopping for them in Asian and UK stores--some of which don't even ship to the US. Ebay and Etsy are also good sources, but the sizing is so limited there. She hates the mall so Macy's and Nordstrom's are out. Target has nothing. We're doomed. Oh yes, and she won't wear white after Labor Day. I think she got that one from my mother. But it's Memorial Day now so white is in again! Maybe she'll wear the white shorts with the blue whales again that she insisted on getting last summer. Teenagers make me tired.My shopping trip on the Internet ended on a fraudulent site created to mimic Solestruck shoes which I learned is out of business (the fake is at www.solestruckes.com). Before I figured out it was a fraudulent site, I entered all of my personal and credit card information and also Jessie's debit card number. I cancelled both cards and requested replacements within 10 minutes, but the fraudulent site had already posted a $75 charge to my credit card! Luckily I am a suspicious person (though not suspicious enough as they caught me) and figured it out before more damage was done.

But then it devolved for me. Maybe it was the oppressive heat and humidity that have been building for the past few days (and which finally broke into a major storm tonight). Maybe it was the walk around the yard and garden noticing all of the things almost done, mostly done, or not done at all. Maybe I just got overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of poop I have to cleanup tomorrow since I didn't get to it today. Whatever it was, I had no bounce in my bungee and was not capable of doing anything new and productive. So I didn't! I took a day off. Tomorrow, bees.

It's easy to learn (though hard to master--it's very much like chess in my mind), quick to play, takes no set-up, and uses very little table space. Dave won one real game and I won one real game. We also each won a flawed game. And then we let the game at the restaurant and Dave had to go back for it after we got home. Wacky times.Now the workday is done, dinner is over, and I accomplished my one task of the day. It took six straight hours of work, but I got it done. I have completely unpacked the sunroom/textile studio and put almost everything away. I ran out of storage boxes and baskets so I'll have to run to IKEA and the Container Store tomorrow, but I deserve the reward as I used a bunch of the cool boxes I bought on sale at JoAnne's earlier this spring that have been waiting in the pantry for a purpose.The big difference today in my modus operandi was that I kept working and unpacking boxes even after I ran out of optimal storage containers for the stuff in them--and long past when I wanted to quit. Now I am left with four piles of yarn and three piles of fabric, and I know exactly what I need to buy for them so finishing will be quick tomorrow.

The greenhouse (jewelry/soap/paper studio) is a mess. The glass studio is (still) a mess.

Then tomorrow I'll disappear down a rabbit hole and end the day with nothing more accomplished than was done when I began it. Alternatively, I can see myself getting up with enthusiasm tomorrow, surveying the spaces, and deciding the best way to handle everything is to go to Target or The Container Store to acquire more vessels in which to organize and store everything. The acquiring will take most of the day and I will end with even more stuff (in the form of totes or boxes or bins) languishing in stacks waiting to be purposed.Groan. How about I nip all the angst and self-whipping in the bud and set myself one task for tomorrow. Just one. Maybe that would break my paralysis in the aforementioned areas and set the stage for more accomplishments. So tomorrow I will... Unpack and put away all the yarn! Oh this is harder than I thought it would be. I feel myself straining to add more to the \"tomorrow I wills\". Just one more thing, I think. I could... But no. But yes. Okay, compromise: Most of the boxes left in the textile studio are yarn. There are also one or two with other textile craft stuff in them.

I can't use the water from the well as it would likely kill the fish, and if I wanted to use water from the RO system it would take.... a very long time at 1.5 gallons per minute to produce 6,100 gallons. Today's load was just to verify the watertightness of all the drains and to situate the liner before putting the capstone around the pond and the next rows of blocks up the face of the bog pond (where the waterfall will spill naturally filtered water from the bog pond into the main pond).The painters continue pressure washing, scraping and caulking to prepare the exterior of the house for painting. This morning was almost a repeat of the roofers on the ladder outside the bathroom window while I was in flagrante, but I was ready for them and quickly put on clothes at the first sight of guys wandering around the yard.I finished the evening by working on the studio books.

{"title": "Only In Austin", "date": "Tuesday, May 23, 2017", "text": "The double rainbow tonight from Jessie's room.It was another exciting day here at Stone's Throw which began with running out of water. Again. This time for real (if temporary). Our water system is complicated. We have a well, and it has a pump way down in the ground that pumps into a 1,250 gallon tank. Then there is another pump that pumps the water from that tank through our reverse osmosis system and then into another 1,250 gallon tank. When we turn on the water in the house, there is yet another pump that sends water from the RO tank out to the house or the garden or wherever we need it. Right now all of our hose bibs use the RO water. The only way to get straight well water is from a faucet on the pipe that feeds the RO system. Bear with me. I know this is boring stuff, but it is the basis for my tale of woe, hair pulling and teeth gnashing.Back when we bought the house I had the whole system inspected and overhauled where necessary (same with the septic system). One of the things that made me nervous was the possibility of running completely out of processed water and not knowing about it until it was too late. While the well has good head pressure (I think it's like 9 gallons per minute, but I can't remember for sure), the RO system only processes about 1.5 gallons per minute which means that if you run out of water it could be hours before you have enough to use again. So one of the modifications I had made to the system was the installation of a float switch that would turn off the pump to the house--effectively turning off the water--when the RO tank went below 700 gallons. This configuration gives us enough warning that we can moderate our water usage so we don't run out.However the reserve system can be overridden by flipping a switch in the pump house--that's how you get to keep on using water after you've found out you're running low. I managed to forget that I had switched the system from normal to reserve last week when the contractors were going through a lot of water, and I had never switched it back. Then to compound my error, the lightning knocked out the RO system on Saturday requiring a system reboot that I didn't know about until we ran out of water today. So I rebooted the RO filter and it started working again (and that was about 10:00 this morning). We finally had water again this evening at 9:00. I'm not sure what took so long to get us any at all, but it was grim times today. Now the system is back in Normal mode, and everything seems to be working fine. Dave got to experience all of this excitement himself as he took the day off today and so was also without water all day. Tonight was better, and was the source for the title of this post.Ever since we got married, Dave and I have taken a game when we go out to dinner for date night. Over the years we have played many different games in restaurants and even convinced Jessie to play with us once or twice. Tonight we experienced Vigilante, a local gaming bar and restaurant. It was So Cool! I don't know if it started as a kickstarter project or just went there for more funds, but the founders really put together a cool place. I could go on and on about the features they put into it--custom gaming tables, awesome selection of games, a button at each seat to call your server, electrical and usb outlets at each seat, and a button at each table announcing that you are interested in other patrons joining in on your game. Top it all off with infused-sake boilermakers (called drops) and good food and you have an amazing place for an evening. But don't take my word for it--look at the website or Facebook page for pity's sake!"},

Only natural I suppose as we prepare for the great migration to Montana and Jessie finishes up her first year in high school. Some projects here at Stone's Throw are winding down while others wait in the wings ready to be spun up--weather, time and my energy level permitting.My big accomplishment today was getting the cactus and succulent garden half planted. I'll finish it tomorrow and post pics. I'm planting the cacti in pockets of a big, flat, limestone rock that makes up one corner of our drive. I have to be careful not to put the plants too close to the edge of the drive as everyone misses that corner and drives a bit into the bed. The propane delivery truck misses it more than a little so I out some extra big spiky rocks closer to the curve to encourage the driver to turn a bit more carefully.Now off to join the spouse who is already long asleep and (not-so-)gently snoring. I'll have to wrest my pillow from him as he curls around it until I get to bed and can take its place. It's not a bad life at all."},
{"title": "Fish, Bees, and News", "date": "Sunday, May 21, 2017", "text": "I went out on the deck to feed the fish in my two holding ponds this morning and it looks like lightning didn't just fry my router... Ten of the twelve fish were floating belly up and they had been all fine with fresh food and water on Friday. One fish was barely moving a flipper, and one fish looked fine. I moved the two live ones to the other pond--which also had a water change and a feeding Friday and there were no dead fish in it. I suppose something else could have killed them, but since both ponds were treated exactly the same and I lost that many fish in one day, I'm thinking lighting. Now it's time to check on the bees.Okay, hives look fine, details coming tomorrow in the Day 29 post. I got all hi-tech for my inspection today and recorded the whole thing in a voice memo so I could make sure to capture all the data, and put the salient points into the post (how many frames in each hive are being built out, what are they being used for--brood, nectar or pollen, etc.). Unfortunately I was out there for an hour and ten minutes, and even though I didn't talk the whole time--or necessarily say only important things while I was talking--I still have to listen to the whole thing again to record the important bits. I don't have the energy for it tonight--especially since I have to wait for my phone to finish updating before I can even begin.Tonight I will post a great pic for the 365 project that I took in one of the hives. In order to take photos while in bee garb, I cut a slit in my right glove on the inside of the index finger just in front of the second knuckle (and covered it with duct tape so the bees couldn't get in). This way I can get my finger out through the slit to control my phone. Stupid iPhone needs to read the conductivity from your finger to make the touch screen work. I thought it needed a thermal reading, but Dave just reminded me that styluses work and it's because of the conductivity thing...  Oh damn. I could just have purchased a stylus and left my leather beekeeping gloves intact--and also never had to risk getting stung while getting a finger in or out of the glove. Ah well, live and learn. I can still get a stylus and just leave the tape on the glove.Besides messing with fish and bees, I pretty much sat around and read the news. Bill asked me why I chose to get a subscription to Esquire and it turns out to have been a mistake--I meant to get one for the Atlantic. I wanted to pick two publications known for being slightly left and slightly right and very in-depth. I also added on Aljazeera for a final perspective. After a couple of hours I remembered why I stopped reading the news: Bleak, dark, grim, horrifying. Still, I can't have my child knowing more about what's going on in the world than I do. That would be Bad Parenting."},
{"title": "Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...", "date": "Saturday, May 20, 2017", "text": "Today was all about art. We started and ended with the Cinematic Arts Program at McCallum, and squeezed in the Dirt Dauber Festival in the middle. In the morning we went to a fundraising garage sale put on by the students in the CA program at which they raised $1,000. The funds are desperately needed because the school district has decided to stop paying for the film editing software used in the program because only one school uses it. So now the kids and parents in the program need to come up with another $1,500 a year. That's on top of the new equipment they need. Tonight was a pizza banquet and film screening of the best films from each class, then in different categories (music video, documentary, etc.), then the senior films. They were all good, but the senior films were amazing.In between film things, Dave and I went down to San Marcos to the Dirt Dauber Festival at Eye of the Dog Art Center. They were really lucky at the festival because it rained all last night in Austin, let up for a little bit this morning (just enough time for us to get into the car) and then it poured again most of the way to San Marcos. Not too long after we left the house Jessie called to say lightning had either struck the house or very close by. So far the only casualty has been our router, and I got a new one this afternoon from Amazon Now (free delivery in a few hours for those of you not familiar with it--it's part of the Amazon Prime service). I kept the same network name and password, but the thermostats and all the Alexa's--probably anything that connects with wireless including the tv and the printer--all need to be set-up again. *Sigh*. I have to turn the lights on and off manually tonight. I can't even remember where some of the switches are.They'd clearly had some rain down at the festival too, but it had stopped awhile before we got there, and turned into a beautiful day. As we were walking around, Dave was a little worried they were going to sell us for parts (or use our bones--or maybe our teeth--for grog). I think it's because the art center is out in the country, and the band that was playing for the festival had a banjo player. I think that's just a holdover from our Deliverance days in Georgia.We both picked out some really nice pottery from six of the different artists selling there--including my instructor at the Art School at Laguna Gloria. I picked up my favorite teapot ever--it looks like something that would have won a Niche Award back in the day--and three matching cups, among other things. Dave went Big with a serving platter, huge bowl and a tortilla/covered side dish container."},

But I went about my morning routine--got dressed, fed the cats, cleaned the cat box, washed-up, brushed teeth, took pills, brushed hair, topped off fish ponds, fed the fish, cleaned up where Baxter peed by the front door... and then it all went pear-shaped. Then I picked myself up out of my puddle with serious help from my spouse who took me out for a taco breakfast--which is different than breakfast tacos. I did not have a breakfast taco, I had a trashy trailer park taco on corn. I realized that, for whatever reason, it was a big-girl panty day and I just need to pull them up.The afternoon went much better with a run to Armadillo Clay to get some mold making materials for casting glass (#1 pottery plaster and 325 mesh silica sand). While I was there I looked at wheels, and I must confess I succumbed to one. Before you think I've lost my mind...Right before class at Laguna Gloria ended, I threw my first perfect bowl. It was a perfect shape, perfect thickness, perfect texture, and had a perfect foot... Like I said, it was perfect. Now I don't want to wait two months to do more--I want to continue to practice while the muscles have memory. Thus answers the question of what craft I will do in Montana this summer. Lucky for me I already have a duel-media kiln there big enough to do a few pieces at a time. At Armadillo I also got some cone 5 clay and some glazes. Finally I looked through their book shelf again to see if they carried either of my books. Last time I was in I did not see them. This time I saw multiple copies of them both! I was so excited I asked to sign them. They couldn't stop me.Now the day is done and I chill at home after seeing Alien Covenant with Dave. I really liked it. I want to see Prometheus--Dave saw it without me. Dave wasn't so enraptured. Actually, he wasn't enraptured at all. But I think he grudgingly admitted that it was okay. (Prometheus is the Alien movie that came before this one)Tomorrow sees us doing cinematic arts program stuff--fundraising garage sale and then end-of-the year pizza banquet and film showings. I am hoping to get together with a friend on Sunday to do some suminagashi. Somewhere in all of that I want to fit in the clay sculptural part of a glass casting project I want to do. I don't think I'll throw any clay this weekend, but I have a feeling it will be a very creative time nonetheless."},

It was truly the best meal I have had in the past couple of years.It wasn't just exquisite food that made the experience memorable, it was also great service, good drinks, and the beautiful environs.

After the episode he posted on Facebook and compared me to Calamity Jane. I take that as a high compliment. As I was reading through the Wikipedia entry on her tonight, my attention was caught by this paragraph:\"Calamity Jane was a frequent visitor to and sometimes resident of Livingston, Montana and towns in the Paradise Valley, Montana.She came up from a very hardscrabble life, unacquainted with bourgeois notions of decorum; she probably never knew financial security, but even in poverty she was known for her helpfulness, generosity, and willingness to undertake demanding and even dangerous tasks to help others. She was afflicted with alcoholism and wanderlust (and, perhaps, promiscuity) but, as someone remembered her, \"Her vices were the wide-open sins of a wide-open country – the sort that never carried a hurt\". \"How could I not be flattered by the comparison?My wanderings into the history of Calamity Jane that I was able to find on the Internet brought me to looking up my own illustrious ancestor, my great grandfather RH McKay who was the preeminent photographer in Missoula and western Montana in the first half of the 20th century. His photos--most of which are in the archives at the University of Montana are showing up in many more places on the net than they did when last I looked. I was thrilled to find a couple of good ones of him (I never met him--he died the year before I was born) and someone who has access to some of the photos and uses his name as a twitter handle! There are pictures on that page of my dad--and maybe even one or two of my mom in McKay Studio employee photos.It was a lovely, sad, nostalgic, wishes-were-horses perambulation, but now I need to do my post, upload my photo and get to bed so I can be well-rested when the solar inspector shows up. I will be in Montana again soon enough, and this year I'm going to see if I can see the photos myself in the archive.Today was a wonderful day of being feted for me (notice I said feted, not fetid). Zaga took me to lunch and then for super facials, and she gave me early birthday presents--a cookbook, a bee journal, and a Kate Spade beehive purse!!!! She'll be gone for the actual day (not for a a couple of weeks yet) and she wanted to get a jump on celebrating. After all of our pamperings I toddled (there has been a lot of toddling lately... really) home and was finally able to eat again about 8:30 when Dave and I shared the caked she got me from the local Korean bakery. I am still beached.John Swann of Wicked Bee Apiary also delivered my TopBar hive today so I can paint it in prep for getting the bees (fingers crossed) Friday. I'll be off to Home Depot or Sherwin Williams for some of their mistake or partial or whatever they call their super cheap paints tomorrow."},

We're supposed to get a big storm tonight, I hope it brings rain for the garden.It's been four and a half months since I started posting and taking a picture every day for a photographic journal (the 365 project). There are days it's tough, and it feels more like a chore than an experience. But in spite of those days I have to say that I feel so much more creative in both word and picture now than I did when the year started. I have so much creative juice I almost feel like writing a book... (fiction, of course).But before I go off and start another project/career, I need to finish up a bunch of things I have going right now--foremost among them, the solar installation and the new garden. They are so close to done I can almost taste them! The final solar inspection is scheduled for 8:30 am tomorrow. The solar company was out again today checking and rechecking--for the fifth time--the wire sizes, breakers, anything and everything the inspector might question. I actually had to write a letter to the inspector today putting in writing that I understand that I can't use all my appliances at the same time (including kilns) because they pull more amperage than my system is rated for. If I do try to run that much at once, I will blow the house breaker. Really? I have had to do many asinine things in my life in the name of bureaucracy, but this may have been the most spectacularly stupid. Whatever. It's done.The pond liner is going in tomorrow and I am going to need to schedule a water truck to deliver the water for the pond on Thursday or Friday. But, wait, you say. Don't you have a well? Why yes we do! And though it pumps lots of gallons a minute from the aquifer, the reverse osmosis system only purifies around a gallon and a half a minute. The pond is about 6,500 gallons which would take... six days of non-stop running of the RO system to process, and we would just about blow through an RO filter doing it. The filters cost $600 each so it's better to just do a one-time water buy.New beehive tomorrow too (if I'm lucky). I need to paint it before the bees come and they're tentatively scheduled for Friday. Have I mentioned how much I love my bees? I LOVE MY BEES!!! I'd love them if I didn't get a lick of honey or a smidgen of wax. I love that they are.Zaga is beginning my birthday celebrations early and taking me for a deluxe facial tomorrow afternoon. I feel so pampered! Pedicure yesterday, facial tomorrow, legwax Thursday... is that TMI? I never know. I look at it like I'm taking the car in for a tune-up and detailing. Dave did have my car detailed last week and it's so clean it feels brand new again. That's quite an accomplishment after I've been hauling muddy dogs, bees, uncounted plants, a McNugget begrimed child, and assorted other stickiness--not to mention schlepping all kinds of stuff from Atlanta--over the past several months. I am hyper-aware of how clean it is and I'm being very careful not to let so much as as French fry fall between the seats.This is one of those stream-of-consciousness posts. Sometimes they can be good, but sometimes they can go horribly wrong so I'm just going to wrap it up now and hope for the best. It was a Good Day. I'd like more of these please."},

It's been a really long slog and on days like today I feel like it will never end.I only had two workers show up today, and they did the best they could to move a few tons of sand to the bottom of the pond, but there were only two of them, and it was 90 degrees. So the garden languished. The solar didn't get inspected either. I am ready to go postal on the city inspectors if they don't stop focusing on how many appliances I have and pay attention to whether all the wiring and breakers are in code (they are).Now I'm tired. I did a long post on the bees, and that's going to have to do for tonight. I'm going to take a page from the cat in my lap and go catch some ZZZ's."},

It was a lovely Mother's Day at Stone's Throw where I did some some needed to's, some had to's, but quite a few wanted to's. First and foremost I took a nap. Two straight hours of solid sleep and no guilt. Ahhhhh. I also played a couple of hours of Witcher. It was fun, I don't regret it, and I won't play anymore tonight. Dave plied me with food from the moment I got up (scratch pancakes and sous vide bacon for breakfast, burgers and \"mango chunks poached in cardamom syrup with chai whip cream on cinnamon shortcakes\"--from Dave's Facebook entry) for dinner. I am well sated.Though I watered 1/3 of the new garden today (I have got to get the soaker system and the rest of the irrigation in!), I did not do anything with the bees. John Swann of Wicked Bees recommended doing the maintenance in the morning so most of the foragers will be out doing their thing and I have a better chance of seeing the queen and not being harassed by cranky bees. Regardless of the time of day I do it tomorrow, I will be wearing my full suit. That one cranky hive is seriously damaging my calm!So back to Mother's Day. My child is a freshman in high school. In just over three years she will be off to college or film school or somewhere. Three years! The last fifteen don't seem like any time at all, the last one was a blink of an eye. (Didn't school just start a month or so ago?)Another blink of an eye was the time I have been sitting here with this post open and unfinished. I started it at 9:30 pm, and it is now 1:11 am. What have I been doing, you might ask. Well, I fell down the rabbit hole that is iPhoto. I went looking for a few photos of Jessie through the years to commemorate the day, and next thing I know I have 216 photos and a slideshow. Good thing the spouse said he wouldn't be grumbly no matter what time I came to bed! Now we'll see if YouTube will actually upload the slideshow so I can embed it here. It's over 200 mgs in size (I remember my computer in 1991 had a 200 mg hard drive which was extremely large--and expensive--at the time) and it's going to take over 15 minutes to upload. Plenty of time to finish my solitaire game. Good thing almost all of the early photos of Jessie (the whole first year) are on film and I haven't scanned them yet, or this slideshow could have been an hour long. It's worth watching with the sound on..."},

But that was before today. Today I worked in the studio most of the day, and all I got through was unpacking the stringer and rod. It was a bit discouraging to see so little accomplished, but it was a difficult organizational task to complete in a small space, and I'm not ashamed of my performance. The problem I had was not even with the quantity of what I did or even the quality. It was the temperature at which I had to do it. I like to have died out there! I am not meant to work in the heat. It upsets my tummy something fierce and just drains my will to live.I meant to work on the computer stuff for the studio--website and newsletter--when I came inside, but it was all I could do to sit and play \"Witcher\" for a couple of hours till dinner. I blame Glenn Marsh who just visited from Chicago. He introduced me to the gog.com online computer game site for computer games old and new that will work on your current computer system. Sadly, though all the Might and Magic games are available, they're only for Windows.Do I really have time to play computer games for a couple of hours? Sure. I'm not dead yet, and my inbox will be full when I am so I'm not going to sweat taking a little time out to do something engrossingly, mindlessly fun now.

Blogging is an extension of creativity for me so clearly Austin is very good for me creatively. Today was also a creative day in the studio. Though I only got my orders fired, I did straighten a rug. I know, you're scratching your head and thinking, \"What the heck is she nattering on about a rug for?\" The rug is both physical and metaphorical. It has physically been cockeyed, folded, and hanging over the edge of the step for months. I have walked over it every day--along with all the wadded up papers, boxes and crap on the floor--ignoring its state. But today, I picked up papers, threw out boxes, and straightened the rug. Had it not been so hot and late this afternoon when I finished getting the kiln load in, I would have put away stringer, rod, the last of the 5 oz jars of frit, and half sheets of glass. If I'd started really early and felt really spunky, I have unpacked the finished work and arranged it on shelves. Tomorrow morning I am going to try for that level of spunk. (Motto of the weekend: Spunk, not Funk!)Debbie went back to Dallas this morning after a very exciting Summer Tanager sighting--both male and female!. Bird geeks and their books and binoculars are so cute. It was a good visit and I feel more energized towards glass than I have in awhile (and, hey, website almost done!). I'm so energized I pulled out the old steel butterfly wings that I have from a metal artist I used to work with and started planning to cast the glass insets for the wings. I might even get that project done this weekend so Jay can mount them in the garden.Lots of work happened in the garden today too. Some trees and the rest of the perennials were planted. I hope the cement reinforcement in the pond walls was poured today so the liner can go in Monday, but I haven't been out to look. By Monday the arbors will all be up, the vines and roses will be placed, the rest of the trees and shrubs will be placed (I place, I do not plant--I have people for that), and the soaker hose will be placed. Next week the brass bed will be delivered and I want to get it in too. We did get one big delivery today--the new additional rainwater collection tanks for under the deck. I'm not sure how they're going to get them under there as they are 1500 gallon capacity each (thereby tripling our rainwater storage), but I have faith in Jay.While I was in the studio today the dogs hung out with me--as did Kaiju who wanted to show his dog spirit. But when the dogs came in he decided to stay outside and be a cat for awhile. Dave looked out the window and saw him playing with a little brown mouse, and when he commented on it to Jessie and me, Jessie was out the door like a shot to save the mouse. She was successful--Kaiju apparently wasn't hungry--and the mouse (with no apparent injuries) sat for awhile in her hands and then scampered off to freedom. Now Kaiju sleeps in my lap, probably dreaming of the one that got away. I think I'll go sleep too."},

All afternoon it just kept getting hotter and more muggy, and we all kept getting crankier and moister--and not in a good way. Finally it broke loose, and the first thing that happened was I got a call from Dave that he was not stopping at the grocery store for scallops on his way home because he didn't want to have hail damage on his new car. In the meantime, it was pouring rain up at the house, and then  the rain turned to hail. I haven't seen much hail in my life and this was a spectacular storm!Debbie and I are both exhausted tonight--what I wouldn't give to sleep in tomorrow morning! But I bet I can get some good chillin' time  tomorrow as long as I give Debbie ap  ...? (note from the next morning: Debbie just pointed this sentence out to me and though I puzzled and puzzled, I couldn't figure out what I meant to say before I fell asleep mid-post. I fell asleep mid-post at least four times. Like I said, exhausted.)Kaiju, our tabby cat, had decided he absolutely positively HAD to go outside about an hour earlier so he was MIA in the storm, and Jessie walked in the door after getting off the school bus minutes before the sky opened up. Debbie, Jessie, and I watched in amazement as hail and rain and god knows what else came out of the sky and slid down our roof to the deck and the ground below. At least I didn't need to worry about watering the plants today!Today was my last ceramics class at the Art School at Laguna Gloria at The Contemporary for the quarter. Now I have to wait till next fall to throw more pieces. I did trim a bowl, and I did glaze two pieces which I then brought home as I was worried about timing for picking them up and the next class starting. I should be able to finish all the glazing next fall before my next class starts.After ceramics, Debbie and I went back to Barton Springs Nursery where we picked up the last arbor I bought--I swear it reminds me of nothing so much as the elephant in Moulin Rouge. I have my very own Elephant Love Medley going into my backyard... Hope Dave likes it.In the afternoon Debbie took me up to her cousin's in-laws house where they have a super cool sun-dial built into in the backyard. This evening I told Dave all about the sundial, but I didn't mention their equally cool swimming pool to him... I was truly tempted. But since Dave is getting through the whole \"botanical garden\" project with the mantra, \"At least it's not a pool\", I haven't the heart to introduce the prospect of a pool in our current design. But the coolest thing about this pool--since they were also on solid limestone like us--was that it was cleverly cut into the slope in the backyard in a way that maximized the use of the slope and minimized the need for cutting out a lot more rock and dirt.So the question of the day is, how do I get Dave to buy into the idea of a pool?"},

Top it all off with a stop at Barton Springs Nursery for yet more yard art (two arbors and an obelisk) and my day is complete.

Kaiju thinks he is a dog and should therefore go out for a walk when Gallifrey and Jig do so he joined us in perusing the hives tonight. I don't think he even likes honey.Some of today's thrifty finds include a big metal-framed mirror for $12.99--I gave away the mirror part in the parking lot to a woman in the car next to me (she just out-of-the blue knocked on my car door as we were getting ready to pull out and offered me a padded bag because she saw the stuff I had packed into the car and she thought I could use it so I asked her if she'd like the beveled mirror out of teh frame). We both left happy. I also got a vintage (aka \"old\") mint green screen door frame with no hardware that I'll put wire on for plants to grow up. The big find of the day, however, was a beautiful old brass bed headboard and footboard. They, too, are going into the garden (not the new garden, but an area off the sunroom/textile studio) for a garden bed like the one below (though I like my bed better). Debbie also spotted an old plow that will be perfect in the front yard where the native grasses and wildflowers are growing. I wouldn't have bought it if she hadn't suggested such a perfect spot.I'd like to say I did more today--wrangled contractors, eviscerated city solar inspectors, finished the website, cured cancer of some form. But all I excelled at today was shopping.Tomorrow I'll try to excel at glass. And maybe pottery as I glaze my penultimate pot and trim the ultimate one. Oh and Debbie is going to take me to see a friend of hers' garden where they have a sundial made from plants..."},

So I just want to experiment a bit to see if there is a big response to this title. (Although at this point I'm asking myself: 1) What am I doing thinking I have time to be looking at stats, and 2) What do I care anyway?)So here it is the end of the evening, I'm sitting down to blog, and--miracle of miracles--I'm not exhausted! Maybe it's because I had Prosecco with lunch, and then wine and cheese for a late dinner. It's certainly not that I got a lot of sleep last night because, hey, pets. But my friend Debbie is here from Dallas, we have talked gardening, business and glass all afternoon (after the prosecco lunch at Chez Zee) , and I even got another page and a half done on my website. Check out the colorways page! Isn't it cool that it looks like the comb in a beehive?Not too much happened on the contracting front today. The pond moved forward a bit, but that was about it. It rained. The solar guys didn't show, nor did the inspector, nor did anyone call to give me an update. Jessie came home sick from school. The cleaning women came after saying they weren't going to come so I hadn't cleaned in advance for them. (Yes, I finally succumbed--I can't clean AND garden.) Debbie came for a three-day visit.But I'm not exhausted, and I think it's because I finally checked something off my list that has been hanging on there for weeks. Or maybe it's because it wasn't blazingly hot today... Nope. I'm going with the euphoria of getting something DONE. FINITO. Archived from Trello. And even though I'm not exhausted, I am going to quit here (after babbling on about nothing much in particular) so I can show Debbie the apartment and then spend some time with my spouse when we are both awake. That will be a nice change. Unless he's already asleep..."},

Really.The week began with a text from our solar company at 7:30 am to let me know that the inspector is dicking us around again and cancelled today's scheduled inspection because he didn't have time to review the documents he asked for. He got them Thursday at 4:00 pm. Even if he doesn't work at all on weekends, he had all day Friday and at this point (four months after the solar system was installed and it's still not operational) he should have made time. I had enough and called him, the chief inspector for the city and the inspector scheduler. Now the inspector wants something in conduit instead of in a gutter... Frankly, I think he's just being an ass. Rant over.Shipped a big glass order today, but didn't get thing one done on the website or the newsletter. Shame on me, must get to that tomorrow. Because I was dealing with bees today, I let the contractors be (hah! a pun!), and I think I'm going to have to light a fire under tails tomorrow again. I was really expecting a lot more accomplished today than happened.Jessie got 100 on her Japanese test today and I wish I could include a picture of it here. Her writing is so beautiful! It is as delicate and precise as the instructor's (or the instructor's computer's--it's hard to tell whether he wrote the test out or typed it).Now it's time for bed. I'm all restless, frustrated, pissy, and exhausted--and I don't have a picture for the 365 project for today. However the chicken carcass from dinner will make a good subject and fit my mood just fine...Oh, speaking of birds, I saw a road runner in the front yard again today!

Thank you Glenn for teaching us to play!We also took Glenn to free comic book day at Dragon's Lair, and it was my first one ever. The line was amazingly long and no one even blinked. For comic books. Free comic books, but still! They even had a bouncy castle outside the store, a snow cone stand with free snow cones, and waiters from HopDoddy walking up and down the line with free samples of different kinds of fries. Harley Quinn was handing out water up and down the line. What a wild experience. It was so fun I had to go home and nap. Actually I sat down to read the new Patricia Briggs novel and fell asleep.

I ended up getting very few plants for the garden, but I got another arbor, a couple of bright spinny things, and a whole bunch of orchids and a few cacti.

Zaga has a pick-up so she came and brought it home for me.Today marked another bit of monumentousnous: I decided not to do a major remodel of the bathroom. Yes, there are things that need changed--the carpet must go and we need a taller toilet as my knees can't take the current one. But the layout really isn't that bad! Sure, we need new fixtures through out.

I arrived early--as I like to do--and got started right away throwing a piece. My goal for the day was a mug and a handleless Japanese-style tea cup. I threw the cup first and it came out beautifully. I had set out two 1.5 lb balls of clay so after I put the cup up on my board to start drying, I threw the second ball. It did not cooperate with a mug shape, but I got a nice bowl out of it (not as nice as the mug, but still) so I put it on the board too. I was on a roll! At that point I had delusions of multiple finished pieces on my last day of throwing. I needed more clay! I started rummaging in my bag of clay for two more pieces... and I accidentally squashed my mug. I was so thrown (hah, I just got that) by the destruction that the next four pieces I threw all failed spectacularly. So I ended the day with a bowl that I will trim next week. I have one piece left from last week to glaze, and that will be it. Much as I am tempted, I am not buying a wheel and taking it to Montana. This summer I am going to cast glass.It was also a glass day here today with another kiln load going in. Tomorrow I'll ship it, and then I'll finish the website and the newsletter.The solar company did not manage to get my system inspected by the city inspector today, I hear now it's going to be Monday. I'll believe it when I see it.Lastly, it was another big day in the garden. I have been concerned with getting my plants in the ground as it is getting super hot during the day and it is getting harder to keep the plants watered and alive in their plastic pots./In addition, the pond walls climb higher, the path gets thicker, the stone on the beds gets higher, and the plants just keep getting planted. Jay and I also talked about putting a concrete floored pergola in by the pond with some lounging furniture. I'll think more on that tomorrow. Today I even started planting the roses and am having Devon put in an old Texas climbing blush rose over an arbor in the new area. This is going to be the coolest garden!! Maybe one last nursery stop tomorrow, and the plants will be done this year. I would like a few more lantana and Turk's Cap--and you can never have too many salvia."},

Up: Some of the waterlilies bloomed and they are gorgeous. Down: One of the workers the contractor brought in yesterday or today pulled two of my rare native shrubs as weeds. It was extremely difficult to find them and everywhere I called today didn't have them. The electricity was off all morning and there were solar guys in the kiln room in the studio so I didn't get in there till afternoon, and by then it was 92 degrees and too hot to do anything but flee. I'd say tomorrow morning, but I have pottery class and then it'll be too hot again. Friday morning for sure.The solar was tweaked today so it should pass inspection tomorrow morning and be up and running early next week (next we have to wait for the city to install a meter). Then the well-water tank ran dry again so I had to call the well company. The float switch on the top of the tank was busted, and the one on the bottom was cracked so we had to have them both replaced. Fortunately we have great well and water service people and they came out today, replaced both, and we have water again.It was an apiarily active day (yes, I just made that word up) so the bees got their own post. Thanks to the garden and the bees and other life things, I didn't get back to the website today either. I'm feeling behind and stressed and like I have too many balls in the air. Big, heavy, steel balls that are going to crush me alike a bug when they come tumbling down. Sigh. I think I need a Negroni."},

I started the day with two contractors and went down to one by the end of the day. Devon is wonderful, but there's only so much he can do. Beyond the contractor issues, I had a very unfortunate encounter at Barton Springs Nursery today. As I was leaving, I got in line (in my minivan) behind a woman in a little sport utility vehicle (turns out it was a BMW). We were cars three and four in line to pull out of the parking lot, and we inched slowly towards the street. At one point in the inching, I glanced down as she she stopped and I tapped her rear bumper. We were going 1-2 mph when it happened--I didn't even have my foot on the gas. Because I am a responsible person I immediately put my vehicle in park and hopped out to inspect the non-existent damage. She got out too, looked at the bumper and said I cracked it. I said, here's my insurance card.Close-up of where the screw head from my license plate indented her bumper. It's 1/4\" in diameter.Then we moved our cars so the people behind us could get out of the parking lot. Then she asked for my driver's license--I gave it to her. I asked her for her phone number and called her (mobile) so we both have each other's contact info and I showed her how to enter me as a contact into her iPhone. Then I took a couple of pictures of the bumper and said, the bumper isn't cracked, there is a scratch from where the screw head on my license plate pressed into it. Mind you, this isn't one of the hard plastic bumpers that show every little nick. This is a sport utility vehicle with a rugged bumper. Plastic, but rugged. She says she has to take it in anyway. I say fine, and off we go. Later this afternoon I get a notice from State Farm that she has filed a claim! I call and am told it depends on how much they have to pay her out that will determine how much my rates go up. I say it was a scratch! But it doesn't matter because I am the one who was at fault.Had the situation been reversed, I wouldn't have even taken her info--much less made a claim. There is no damage at all to my car. The whole incident tainted what was already an only okay day. Here's hoping tomorrow looks better, and the car inspector laughs her out of the garage (or she comes to her senses). I don't think that'll be my luck, however."},

I left a few windows and a screened patio door open last night and woke up to a house that was 60 degrees this morning! Needless to say 'twas a bit chilly for just one cotton quilt.

{"title": "And Now the Pond!", "date": "Saturday, April 29, 2017", "text": "The incredible spouse got up early with me this morning and we arrived at Hill Country Water Gardens 20 minutes before they opened. I brought my plant cart as I heard they often run out, and we were third through the gate. Just as I came through I spotted Jared from yesterday, he spotted me, he took one list, I took the other, and we started pulling plants. I was briefly distracted by their fine cedar furniture--it gave me some great ideas for what we'll do here--but I quickly came back to point.HCWG had very kindly set up an empty pond for my use so instead of filling three carts, we just dropped the plants into a pond marked Not For Sale! with big red tape as we pulled them. We blew through the list and I got everything I wanted, then I snagged a couple of succulents on the way to the fish area while Dave trudged next door to WalMart to get a rigid plastic swimming pool to serve as a temporary holding pond. I picked out 10 small American koi and 10 small (American) butterfly koi. While I was there I overheard the girl at the tank explain to a customer the difference between American koi. She said when you pick a small American koi based on its color you may be disappointed because it can change color (even drastically) as it matures. But Japanese koi, she said, remain the same colors their whole lives. That would indicate to me that Japanese koi are not koi that come from Japan, but a whole different variety. Not sure if it's true, haven't had a chance to check yet.When we got home I filled the little pink plastic wading pool and loaded it up with bog plants. We didn't have nearly enough space for everything! Fortunately, Dan and Zaga next door had a couple of big pond tanks that they weren't using, and with a little help from the spouse (who ran to Home Depot and got a missing plug for one of them) I got them both filled with water and lilies. The fish were a bit more problematic. First off, one of the butterfly koi was floating in the bag when we took them out of the car. Jessie unloaded the bags and asked, \"Hey Mom, why'd you buy a dead fish?\". Teenagers. I put the remaining 19 fish in with the three big ones I brought from Atlanta and added an extra bubbler to their tank. Jay thinks the pond will be done by the end of the week so they won't have to live there long.The only negative thing that happened today was that as I was filling the second lily tank, my body betrayed me. If it's doing this now when I'm only in my fifties, what does it have in store for when I'm in my eighties? I guess it was mostly my fault as I had just slipped my shoes on and not secured them so they were flopping around at the heels, and somehow my feet, my shoes, the rocks, and the brush around the pond all got tangled up together and I took a tumble. I landed half on one of the holding ponds--and got soaked in the process--and banged up an arm and a shin. Glad it wasn't worse. Second tumble in the new garden--hit my head last time.Tonight I had a girls' night over at Zaga's. We had burgers and champagne, talked and talked, and hot tubbed. Yes, up here on the hill where the wind howls is a perfect place for a hot tub! It was 91 degrees this afternoon, but tonight it was 68 and windy--perfect tubbing weather. And did I mention we had such a good time?Tomorrow: French toast, sous vide bacon, and the new MST3K. Could life get better? Oh yeah, it could: I have a snuggly spouse waiting for me in bed.

I was handed the remote and am now watching/listening to \"No More Words\" by Berlin... nope, nope, now it's \"Smoke On the Water\" by Deep Purple. That one's less of a music video and more of a live concert recording. And now the music is off and Dave and I are out on the deck having a slice of strawberry peach pie from the Grand Traverse Pie Company thanks to Ed and Susan. They gave me a pie subscription for my birthday last year, and periodically I get a delicious fresh pie in the mail. That's how the day went too--every time I turned around something else was going on.So why was today different? Well I still don't have any of my administration tasks done, but the guys made tremendous headway in the garden. The topsoil, river rock and decomposed granite were all wheelbarrowed into place. The stream in the backyard has been patched and it is almost completed. Everything to do with well water is working again (yay! Showers for everyone!). I can actually squint and see it all done. I have to squint pretty hard, but it's nonetheless visible.Tomorrow is the big annual sale at Hill Country Water Gardens, and I went out there today with Zaga to make a list of all the plants I want--both lilies and marginals--and I also made myself a little map to go along with my list telling me where they all are. I even  got the name of one of the guys who works there and he walked through with me today looking at everything on my list. Tomorrow I'm going to get there about 8:30 (if it's a nice day) so I'm ready when they open at 9:00. I'm going to find Jared, give him my list and map, and I hope to be out of there by 10:00-10:30. The spouse is even going to Igor for me.I'm also picking up another brood box from Laura and Danny Weaver of Bee Weaver Apiaries tomorrow, and on Sunday when I get to look at the hives again, I'll move the frames from the box I borrowed from Zaga to the new one.

The inspector from Austin Energy did not come out today to inspect our solar, even though he was scheduled. He seems to be in a pissing contest with the solar company and right now he wants a load assessment for our electrical system before he will approve the solar. So let me get this straight, I says, you want to know what appliances I have and what they draw in order to approve our solar? You don't have the right to tell me what devices I can or cannot have. You can tell me what kind of wire I have to have for what devices, you can tell me the total amperage I can draw at a time, but you absolutely, positively, cannot tell me what toys I may or may not have. This is NOT something you should even be considering during an inspection! He tries to tell me he's asking the solar company for all of this information for my own good... That didn't go very far with me. Then he says they wouldn't be so strict if I wasn't in the rebate program, i.e., asking for a rebate on our solar install... REALLY?!?!? I let that one go. He was pedantic enough in his defense of his requests to the solar company that I didn't have the heart to eviscerate him for the rebate statement.Tomorrow, if I don't hear good things from the solar company regarding my inspection schedule, I am calling the chief inspector for Austin Energy and asking him to explain to me why they think they need to know all about my kilns, sous vide units, vibrator rechargers, etc. My loins are girded.The pump on our RO system went out yesterday morning so we are not making any fresh water. What we have is what we have. Unfortunately the water from our well is so bad we can't drink it without RO processing (salt, sulphur, fluoride, among other nasties--not bacterial contaminants). Last night through this morning we weren't even able to pump the treated water that we had in the tank to the house. We had a trickle because the booster pump was not working. I looked at everything this morning, and it turned out the electrician yesterday knocked loose the breaker for the pump. Of course I didn't find the breaker--that was done by our sweet neighbor Dan who reseated the breaker and baths were saved for everyone. At that point we had 900 gallons of water to get us through till tomorrow night when the new pump is (hopefully) installed. Little did I know that Jessie had left her sink faucet wide open this morning so when the water came back on it gushed out. Two hours later I went in the house and heard what sounded like water running somewhere. By that time we were down to 450 gallons. Drink wine, save water. Ah.I continue the countdown till the annual migration and I have serious concerns about the contractors finishing the landscaping projects--forget about the bathroom remodel, it's going to have to wait till fall. But I supposedly have truckloads of three different materials ordered for tomorrow morning, I have extra workers scheduled, and the plan will go forth. I have ceramics till 12:30, we'll see what it looks like when I get home.So like I said: Drink wine. It saves water and, coincidentally, blood pressure and sanity!"},

Glass Incarnate needs to get back to a more rounded blog that, if it's skewed at all, is skewed towards glass.Speaking of glass I did another full kiln load today, and in spite of the warm temps outside, with the people door and one of the big roll-up doors open it was not too hot in the studio thanks to the breeze.

I ended up getting another hive as they had a cool one that is a hybrid between a Langstroth and a Top Bar, and Zaga got a Langstroth because it was pretty--green components and yellow components. I picked up the two nucs I had already paid for and then ended up getting another nuc and a package! We drove home with the hives, suits, tools and bees all int eh car, and only the bees flew around... The nucs were all supposed to be sealed, but there was a leak somewhere as between 50-100 bees escaped and were flying around the car during the 2+ hour drive home. I pretty much let them be till them came to the front of the car, but if they did, then I had to open a window on them and free them to the bee afterlife.Examining a frame with NO GLOVES!During our class Zaga and I were in full bee suits, socks, shoes, hats, veils, gloves... and our instructor was in a hat and veil. About 30 minutes into the class I got tired of feeling hampered and fat-fingered because of the gloves and I took them off. It was WONDERFUL, and I never felt threatened by the bees. Our instructor got stung a couple of times, but that was because she accidentally got them between her hands and the hive frames. Squeeze a bee and it will sting--motto of the day. She was very casual about it and just brushed the stinger out. It's important to remove the stinger right away as it is usually still attached to the venom sac which keeps pumping the toxin into you after the bee is already gone. When I do get stung for the first time, I hope to remain calm enough to remember that fact and act accordingly.Zaga happy with the bee frameWhen we got home, I emptied the package into one of my Langstroth hives and went to install the older nuc (the one that was prepared for me a few days ago) in the other one--only to discover I didn't have a deep brood box, I had two shallow boxes so the feeder and the frames of bees in the nuc wouldn't fit into either of them. Luckily, we had Zaga's new hive handy (I haven't unloaded the hybrid from the minivan yet) and it had a deep brood box on it so I went ahead and set it up. Tomorrow morning I'll set up the remaining two nucs in the Flow and hybrid hives. I have one more Top Bar nuc  and hive I ordered from someone locally (John Swann of Wicked Bee Apiary) coming mid-May, and Zaga has a nuc coming soon, so we'll be sitting on (obviously not literally!) six hives by the start of summer. Wheee! Honey and wax galore."},
{"title": "Today Butterflies Tomorrow Bees", "date": "Saturday, April 22, 2017", "text": "Monarch caterpillar on the purple milkweed vineIf you build it they will come! Walking through the new garden with the spouse tonight (it's our path to the mailbox) and saw two (two!) monarch caterpillars decimating my milkweed! It's too bad I just planted it because I think a lot of the plants won't make it through the monarch larval stage as they haven't built up enough leaf reserves. In other garden news, the bee hives are all set up on stands which are on new concrete pads, the concrete footing around the pond was poured and the frames cleaned up today, and it rained all last night so I didn't have to water today (yay!).I've still got it! Kite for On The MainWhile I worked in the studio this afternoon, Dave worked in the apartment. The bookcases have now all been set up and filled with books. I made a list of the last few things we need so that Tuesday evening--barring all the photos, and registering, and setting up on-line with Home Away and/or Air B&B--the apartment will be ready to rent out. Friends and family, you always have first dibs (to stay, not to rent) except for during SXSW. :-)In the studio I fired three full kiln loads and did a little unpacking/organizing, but I swear it's going to take more effort than I have in me to get it all unpacked and set up. At one box/container a day it would take well over a month. Then there's the textile studio and the wet studio (which also serves as the work area for jewelry, soap, torch-worked glass, and paper. I need fewer hobbies.I have a studio cat--Kaiju rules supremeTomorrow morning Zaga and I are heading down to Navasota to take a two-hour beekeeping lesson and to pick up three hives worth of bees--two nucs and a package. Nucs, short for nuclear hives, have a queen, workers, and frames already started with brood, nectar (proto-honey) and bee bread (pollen for protein). All you do with them is take the wooden frames out of the cardboard box you bring them home in and install the frames in your existing hive. A package is just three pounds of bees scooped into a box with a new (to them) queen in a little matchbox looking contraption hanging it it with them. Eventually the workers will chew through the candy end on the so named queen cage, releasing her into the hive. She is initially put in the queen cage to keep the other bees from killing her. She needs a couple of days with her pheromones pervading the hive before the workers will accept her. To install the package of bees in your hive you take out the queen cage, open your hive, and shake the 10,000 bees  in the box into your hive. Doesn't that just sound fun? I think everyone should pick up a box with 10,000 bees in it and shake them out! Maybe I'll ask Zaga to video the procedure for tomorrow's post."},
{"title": "Living Off the Land", "date": "Friday, April 21, 2017", "text": "Let's actually do a post before 10:30 at night to see if I can stay awake for it...Update on the garden: The concrete footing for the pond and for the first three beehives was poured today. Stripping of the bark off all the juniper cedar limbs that will be used for the garden furniture and structures continues apace with the stripped bark being used as a large-format ground cover in the cacti and on the back sides of the beds, and the outlining branches for the paths were all laid today. In general the week felt slow, like very little was accomplished, but in reality what got done was seed work for the next stages that is going to make the next parts go quickly. That's the hope anyway.Sunday the bees come home to roost (like chickens, but smaller), and beginning Monday--except for the stream in the backyard, work is going to go from top to bottom of the property from now forward. We got a little off course by having live projects all over the yard. In some ways it made sense--work by task rather than by area so that, e.g., all of the weeding that needed to be done was done at once--front and back. But now we are moving into quantities of materials that make having all of them delivered at once for the entire yard impractical so we are going to go from man-to-man defense to playing the zone, as Dave used to say to describe alternative parenting strategies. In the new garden--the top of the world--the pond walls will be set Monday, poly-vinyl will go down on the path areas, the irrigation pipe will be put down on top of it running to each of the new beds, and then the decomposed granite will be laid on all the paths. Those steps right there are going to make everything feel so much more done! Then it's just getting the rest of the pond and bog pond put together and beginning on the furniture. The furniture for that area is going to take some time as it's going to be made from the reclaimed limbs of juniper cedar and so will be a little more free-form and artistic and a little less quick. There are a couple of benches, a swing stand, trellis arches, obelisks for vines, and other cool wooden art pieces that will be designed as we go.As they're finishing in the top of the world, the dirt for the front beds will be delivered and all the existing front beds needing it will be topped off, then covered with weed cloth, and mulched. Then we're getting several loads of river rock delivered. The existing river rock areas will be raked clear, weed cloth laid, the rock raked back over the top, and the new rock added to freshen and fill it up. The rain garden in the front is being held for later, and we're not even going around to the garage side of the front yard (where the deck in front of the sunroom is going to be replaced) for now.A planter inspiration for the herb gardenAfter the front is done, we'll run decomposed granite down the north side of the house, and another boatload of topsoil will be delivered  for the backyard beds. Wash, rinse, repeat on filling the beds with new dirt, weed cloth, and mulch. Put mulch in the area under the live oaks, add some new yellow jasmine to the white jasmine growing up the deck, and the basic gardening is done back there. I will add a few more shrubs, plants and trees, but most of the hernage is done. Fun, creative touches to the back include tumbling recycled glass in a cement mixer to make into mulch for a couple of bed/walkways,  and building vertical, staggered-height boxes on the stone patio for herb garden.The electrician is coming Monday to rewire the stream with 220, and to put switches for the pumps in the rain barrels up by where I turn on the hose, and revamping the existing hard-wired lighting. With the new wiring for the rain barrel pumps, I can easily switch from purified well water going through the hoses to water from the rain barrels when I'm watering in the backyard. Replacing the irrigation system is up in the air, and I haven't given up on finding a way to distill and use the waste water from our reverse osmosis system on the well. Jay has been working on designing a distiller cannibalized from a solar hot water heater that looks like it will process about 4-6 gallons of usable water an hour from any water source without breaking the bank......And with one thing and another (dinner and Serenity for two) it's now 10:00. If I really want to finish before 10:30, I should stop now. More garden news (and an update on the solar system approval) as it happens."},
{"title": "Clay Is Also Dirt...", "date": "Thursday, April 20, 2017", "text": "So the secret to minimizing the itch and the hard white bump from fire ant bites is a buff puff and isopropyl alcohol. After I got nailed yesterday I dosed the bites in alcohol and scrubbed at them with an abrasive pad (for skin). Using the pad worked better than just dabbing at the stings with the alcohol--which makes sense. Fire ants aren't causing all the damage to your skin and reaction to the venom by biting you. They only bite you to get a good grip on you so they can swing their abdomens up under themselves to start stinging you. You can tell this is what's happening by looking at them--it looks like they're curled up on your body when they are attacking you. Anyway, other people swear by vinegar, but I am sold on alcohol, salt and a buff puff (or a Scotch Brite green scrubby pad from the kitchen in a pinch).Thursday is my favorite day of the week because it begins with pottery class. Actually today began with me yelling at the solar company (again) about getting an inspector out here from Austin Energy to give us the rubber stamp of approval so we can Go Live. Pottery was definitely better than solar. I glazed my first wonky piece for the kiln, I under glazed a textured vase, and then glazed it, I trimmed a bowl, and I threw another little bowl. I was a ceramics machine! Today was the glaze demo in class, and my first day glazing in a couple of years. I had forgotten all the chemistry and science that goes into it. The glazes I put on my pieces today don't look anything like they will after firing. Part of that's because one piece not only has two glazes which will chemically react with each other, but it will also be fired in a soda firing. Explanation of that technique here. I dipped the other piece in a mint celadon glaze after underglazing it, and sadly forgot to take a picture of it. But the celadon glaze is iron rust brown before firing.Now I'm off to sleep to ready myself for a piano lesson first thing tomorrow morning, followed by craft morning with Becky. Then the decomposed granite paths are going into the new garden tomorrow, and the concrete footer is being poured for the pond (they placed the forms today). Though that project really feels like it's been hanging forever, all I have to do ton console myself about its duration is to think of the solar project. We haven't sued yet..."},
{"title": "Worst Day Ever?", "date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2017", "text": "Today had the potential of being the worst day ever on the new house. Somehow I lucked out, and the badness was limited to about 15 minutes. So we have been working all over the yard, and this is Texas. Texas is famous for, among other things, a high number of nasty, stinging, biting, poisonous things that would as soon kill you as look at you. Today I ran afoul of one of them: The dreaded Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta. There are currently lots of bare areas in the yard including the native grass/wildflower meadow which has a few things coming up (mostly weeds I think), but has mostly big, empty, dirt patches.As we were reviewing one of the grasses coming up in great force in the yard (yellow nutsedge), I noticed four flat areas of hive activity. Jay thought they were termites getting ready to swarm. A few minutes later I stepped in one while trying to save our cow skull, Scully, from being overrun with them. I didn't notice right away--not till they were swarming up my ankles! Then I started swatting at them and trying to brush them off (while jumping up and down and squealing and telling Bobby to squirt them with the hose) and they were on my hands and arms. I finally got my shoes off and my feet rinsed clean of them, brushed most of them off my legs (they got up past my knees under my skirt) and brushed/squished the rest from my hands and feet. It still wasn't enough so I went in to the house and immediately pulled all of my clothes off in the hall... and then saw the worker out the side window studiously Not Looking At Me. We were both pretending No one  saw nothing...After I was naked and the bites were starting to come alive, I went into the bathroom and tried to think what I read to do the last time I got a lot of bites. I remembered vinegar and alcohol, and I found the alcohol first. What luck! I scrubbed at my legs, feet, and arms with a defoliating pad soaked in alcohol, and when some extra alcohol splashed out, I mixed it with salt from a bath bar made of solid salt and rubbed it all over my legs, feet and arms. Now tonight I don't have any itches, and though I bites on top of bites, my skin feels fine. We'll see wait it looks like tomorrow. As of now (several hours later) none of the bites bother me in the slightest.Now it's time to turn into a pumpkin (as the spouse snoring gently beside me on the couch would say) and give in to the tremendous predisposition of my eyelids to close and stay closed. Like my gently snoring spouse on the couch next to me. It was a long day for everyone."},
{"title": "A Sick Day", "date": "Tuesday, April 18, 2017", "text": "This afternoon I gave myself permission to take a sick day. Of course by that time it wasn't a whole day, but I spent much of the afternoon just lying on the bed. With cats. Cats apparently have to pretend you have a lap even when you don't. And they are very persnickety over who gets this prime real estate. Pavlova was first to pounce on the opportunity to snuggle with mom this afternoon, and when Kaiju showed up he was quite disgruntled to find her already in what he considers his spot. But (for once) they settled in amicably and we all sort of dozed. I blame the ham. Or the caffeine in the coffee and tea I drank. Whatever it was, I had a headache, upset stomach, vertigo, and a racing heart. It was good just to chill for a bit. Unfortunately it meant that I didn't get my glass work done, but I just wasn't up to it. Tomorrow.This week in the garden has been slow. The general contractor who runs the crew didn't come yesterday as he had a family thing, and he didn't come today as he was sick. The concrete guys were in a car accident yesterday and spent today trying to get their truck out of impound so they didn't show up (either day) either. One of the part-time workers quit last week because he was told (not by me) that he couldn't wear shorts--against the GC's policy--on the job. Any kind of long-term contracting is very much a game of hurry up and wait. But I rescheduled my bee pick-up from tomorrow to Sunday (yes sir, yes sir, three hives full!) so I have a bit of breathing room, and I confabbed with the three main workers today and gave them a list of things they can start on in the morning while we wait to see if the GC and the concrete guys show up.Now it's after 9:00, which is a perfectly reasonable time to go to sleep. Hope I actually CAN sleep tonight--last night was rough as I think my upset stomach started about 1:00 am. At least I got some good Words With Friends time in."},

The result? I don't have enough plants to fill the beds. In part this is because I haven't worked the seeds into the planting, and at this point I don't know if I'm going to. Maybe I'll plant them all in back or on the side. If I don't plant them this year, I'll need more potted plants.Right here is where I would normally natter on about all the plants that were put in, or some other aspect of the day. But I am just too pooped. We are newly home from the Dr. Who season premiere which we saw on the big screen (I love Fathom Events!) and I had a VERY long day with the solar install company, the City of Austin electricity workers, my regular landscape installers, and life. So I'm going to save a longer, better post for another night. Now I am going to close my twitching eyelids, and dive deep into them. Goodnight all."},
{"title": "Stinky Easter", "date": "Sunday, April 16, 2017", "text": "It's Easter Sunday, and I managed not to gorge myself on chocolate or jelly beans! It's a new record. Unless it rains tomorrow, the rest of the plants will go in. Really. The landscape cloth went down (note to self: decide to put down weed barrier BEFORE putting down the mulch) at the end of last week, and now there's nothing holding me back from putting the plants in place for the last four raised beds. As my final check for which plants go in which beds (after soil moisture, light requirements and height), I turn to my bloom chart. This is only a snapshot of the spreadsheet, the rest of the info already mentioned is also in it, but the visual aspect of this part as I move the rows around representing where plants are placed in each bed is incredibly helpful in ensuring I don't have the dreaded flower gaps.On a subject that is not gardening, I learned some very interesting things today about tonic water! I knew that you aren't supposed to drink lots of it because of the concerns about the quinine in it. But what I didn't know is that doctors used to prescribe quinine for leg cramps--which frequently wake me in in the middle of the night--and it can also deter mosquitos. I don't know if it also makes you smell funny to people, I guess I'll find out. Anyway, three eight-ounce glasses a day is okay (without the gin ;-), and I find I really like the flavor with lime.And on the subject of smelling... Not-so-funny moment of the day: Jessie was hunting for Easter eggs this morning and there were three hidden in our bathroom. While she was looking there, she had her sweatshirt pulled up, covering her nose. I asked her why and she said because of the cat box. She went on to say it even smelled into our bedroom. OMG! I have become the old cat woman!! I couldn't smell a thing! I have noticed a strong odor in other people's houses if they had a lot of cats or around their cat boxes, and though it was unpleasant, I always figured they knew about it. Maybe not. Now I'm really bugged: How do I find out if my house (or parts of it) smell unpleasant if Jessie is not here? And what the heck happened to my sense of smell?!?"},

Good thing the Easter bunny no longer has to hide the eggs before the crack of dawn anymore. There's no way our teenager will get up before 10:00 so the bunny can sleep in a bit. Tonight we had Dan and Zaga over for dinner--lobster ceviche with mango and avocado, rotisserie duck with the Charlie Trotter Moroccan BBQ sauce, and orzo with mint and mango. Zaga brought a fantastic lemon tart to finish up and we all waddled away from the table. Zaga is my partner in bees, and tonight she proposed getting some chickens together so it looks like we're going to have girls again! As with the bees, she will take care of them in the summer while we are in Montana, and the coop and run will cross over a bit of both of our backyards. Who knows, goats next?Today Jay also came over and got the stream going, and after watching it for awhile we determined that the original owners of the house probably had a system that ran at least 100 gallons of water a minute down the stream. We were pushing 30-35 today, and the stream never really filled up and flowed. It trickled. So next week, a new catch basin to hold the extra water that will be in the system when it's fully powered so we can turn it off and it won't overflow at the bottom, a bigger pump, bigger pipe through which to push the water up the hill, and a bigger gravity drain from the bottom pool into the pump housing basin. We've also got some mortar leaks to seal--might even pressure wash and seal the entire thing and then it will run as good as new. Jig walked out and inspected the next to the bottom pool, and I got this picture of him just as he turned around which makes it look like he's only half a dog. But the stream looks nice!Final big news for the day is that I not only got another couple of glass orders, but I also had a really cool idea for some cast sculpture that will require several different techniques to get all the pieces the way I want them. I don't think I will ever do this work commercially because I can't see being able to get the price I would need for the pieces, but it will be fun work, and I have a garden where I can put it. Pics when it's all done--don't want to tip my hand till I've worked out all the details."},

He stopped by today and we must have talked for almost four hours. It is so rare to meet someone you can talk to and listen to for hours and still have so much you want to share. Chris is a chef and an actor and is both very successful and very fulfilled by each career. I love interacting with people who are able to follow their passions! We hope to have him teach a dinner here at our house next Saturday. It's very short notice, but I think we can pull a few people together. And I hope this will be the first of many dinner party classes he teaches here.While Chris and I were talking, the guys were working outside and by tomorrow morning (yes, Jay is coming back on Saturday just to finish this) we are going to have a working stream! It turns out that the pipe carrying the water from the pump at the bottom to the waterfall at the top was broken in two places and filled with acorns and other debris--it's a wonder Don was able to get any water out of it at all to show it to us running when we were originally looking at the house. Jay's crew dug up the entire pipe and replaced it, then Jay replaced the pump and rewired it, and tomorrow he will put the last touches on the electrical and we'll have a stream!! The stream, as completely unnecessary to the running of the house as it is, is one of the most important features of this place for me. When I updated Dave on the status of the work out there I was very surprised at how happy he was that the stream will be functional for the first time since we've owned the house (over a year and a half now!). I knew it was important to me, but I thought he didn't really care about it.Now I sit and listen to the frogs--I think that's what's making that weird noise--and the water in the little ponds on the back deck, and I am ready to dip into my eyelids again. At  least tonight I didn't fall asleep three times in the midst of writing this post like I did last night. And tomorrow is Saturday! No alarm going off!!!"},

No peacocks today. I was deprived. Then I was a mother caring for a sick child (for me today that meant a trip to McDonald's--I know there are those of you who scorn me for this, don't be such haters). And then we got back to the garden. I cannot write that phrase without hearing Crosby, Stills Nash in my head belting out the line from the song Woodstock. The new garden will be forever linked in my mind with that song. And finally I met a few friends for dinner, and I ate way too much, but it was great fun and I got to talk about bees and gardening so I'm happy.The weather has been so wet this month that every day the contractors either hesitate to come for fear of getting rained out, or they can come, but they can't do the project we had scheduled because the ground is too wet. It's a good thing I'm a patient person. Tomorrow, thank the catholics, is Good Friday and a school holiday for Jessie. I will not be setting my alarm so I can wake her up. I will not be setting an alarm at all. I'm so excited.Have you ever noticed how when you get really tired and you're sitting on the computer, your body tenses up--especially through the neck and shoulders (or maybe that's just a function of working on the laptop), and you have to pause frequently to intentionally let everything relax? No? Well, you're lucky. I am, as has been my wont for how many days now, totally exhausted. I would like to wax poetic about the copper and steel plant marking stakes I started putting into the garden today, or the milkweed garden I laid out, or the vast number of different plants that went into the front (white) garden, but I'm just too tired.

Tonight the beverage was a Negroni made for me by my child whom we are training to be a bartender so she can get a good job while she's in college (good tips and you're separated from the clientele by the bar). Music is While My Guitar Gently Weeps, covered by Regina Spektor, from Kubo and the Two Strings.Today was an amazing day wherein I consummately wore a great many of my hats. There was gardening. There was apartment furnishing in preparation for renting it out. There were secret Pal Easter baskets prepared and delivered to McCallum teachers (eight of them). And biggest deal, a friend of a friend who is an award winning chef (James beard and all) contacted me today about getting together as he will be in town teaching Friday. At the end of the conversation I decided it would be a good idea to host a culinary class at our house with him later this spring. I am very excited to be unveiling Stone's Throw  at last. It's not done--it won't be done for a while as I have lots of artistic projects to complete from kitchen backsplash and leaded glass cabinet doors to a tiled entryway to inlaid wood projects (dining room table, bed headboard, and desk--just to name a few). And then there's the master bathroom... All I can say is carpet, and that should be enough.Tomorrow begins with pottery--and I miss Becky yet again (and I should reply to her texts!). I'm going to go in early again and see how many pieces I can throw before class starts. the other week I did four and mashed all of them but the last one into balls of clay to reuse later. Pottery is all about the journey. The last thing I need is a bunch of substandard pieces. Wonky is okay--great even. But the piece has to have character to keep. I'm over keeping everything I make. the teacher had an interesting take on it. She asked us if we would record every piano practice and keep it if we were learning piano. Hell the hell no! I am learning piano and some of the things I play are downright hard on the ears. In spite of my conservatism, I have kept four pieces so far--two from last week. I'm into bowls right now and I'm looking forward to making one or more tomorrow.Lastly on the creative front, I bought flowers today for some ikebana practice. My sensei will be very pleased that I am getting back to weekly lessons. And now I'm ready to crash. Just like clockwork every night, I hit a wall and am incapable of doing anything other than sleep.

This post is all about two fine gentlemen from my alma mater (the University of Montana) who discovered something that upsets what we learned in high school biology. Remember learning about lichens? No? Well lichens, we have been told, are an organism made up of an algae and a fungus living symbiotically. But now two researchers from the UofM have discovered that some, if not all, lichens are a threesome! They are composed of TWO funghi and an algae. Can you believe it? The University of Montana is doing cutting edge biology right there in Missoula Montana.Another thing they are doing is offering Master Beekeeping certification both for and not for credit. And it's all online too. This is truly the age of miracles and wonder. Now there is a Master Beekeeper program offered through the Ag Extension at Texas A & M. And it looks like a fine program. But I just can't see having to have had bees for a full year before being able to get the apprentice level in the program and then having to wait another full year before doing the journeyman level work, and then spending two more years on the master's. The U of M course can be completed by doing the work--not waiting for time to pass. And I'm too old to sit around waiting for time to pass. While Texas' course looks really great in terms of knowledge learned, it also looks like overkill. Really, PhD programs are four years, Master's programs are one to two.And now back to the garden! There isn't much to say--we had a rain day today so no workers. But I did get the first two bed drawings done with a layout of all the plants planted so far. Tomorrow, barring rain, will see the completion of the current planting. Whee! The fourth beehive arrived today and I will put it together tomorrow as well as pulling out the first two (one Langstroth, one Flow) and assembling the Flow. My remaining hive is a TopBar and it's coming from Wicked Apiary along with a Nuc of bees. Zaga is getting her hive and Nuc the same day, and then there will be five.Now there are eyelids and I want to fall into mine."},
{"title": "Am I Too Old?", "date": "Monday, April 10, 2017", "text": "Spreading seed in the rainThe forecast called for rain today, but that didn't stop the guys from coming to work the landscaping. They finished spreading all the dirt in the front wildflower and grass meadow, and then we all started spreading the grass and wildflower seeds by hand. Of course it began to pour before we started so we were all out there getting soaked. The worst part of it was that our footware grabbed the mud (with the seed on top if we had spread in that spot already) and glommed it onto the bottom. I finally gave up and went barefoot. We got all the seed down and then the guys left. And then it stopped raining for the day, and by this afternoon we even had steamy sun.So how dos this all have to do with old? Well for most of the rest of the afternoon I caught up on computer and phone tasks and didn't get back out to the garden till about 4:30. Then I spent another hour and a half moving plants around--sometimes by hand and sometimes in my little wagon--getting ready for possible planting tomorrow (if it's not pouring again). Now I'm back inside, and I'm pooped! Am I too old to be starting the garden of my dreams? I have to admit I'm a bit nervous. It's strange because this really feels like my golden years. I am a very late bloomer, and it took until my fifties for me to achieve the maturity and wisdom that most people start to evince in their, I don't know, 30's? 40's? But now I'm here, I'm happy, and better than happy, I'm content and challenged and motivated and enthused... and tired. This is the first post I've done in recent memory where I'm not falling asleep over the keyboard and that's because I got an early start--it's not even 7:00 yet. I want to be Helen Mirren or Judi Dench or Ann Stunden. Annie is the only one of the three who's not a famous actress, and she's also the only American, but I had to include her because she's got the same glowing beauty and vibrant goddess-of-a-certain-age thing going that the other two do. And they all three seem to have much more energy--in addition to their extra years--than I do! What's up with that? I guess it's a good thing that the women I most wish to emulate are all over 70 (Judy Dench is 82). I could be chasing after wanting to be Angelina Jolie, but this where that maturity thing comes in: I know better. But this tired thing has got to stop.Moving away from the subject of gardening. And age. And fatigue. To bees! I get my first two nuclear bee hives next Wednesday! I am driving down to Navasota before the crack of dawn to pick them up and take a hands on class in hive management. I've attended lots of lectures on the theory of beekeeping, but next Wednesday is where the rubber meets the road, where the stinger meets the skin. I hope I'm going to like it as much as I think I will. Of course news of the arrival of the bees has put the fire under the guys to finish the planting, paths, irrigation, and all the other tasks in the new garden short of the pond by then. None of them are excited about being around the bees. And, you know, bees can smell fear.Glass orders are starting to come in again and I have dropped the reins and turned Todd loose on calling our galleries to see about getting orders since we didn't see them at any winter shows. Normally I handle all the gallery contacts, but right now he wants the work more than I do so this is a good solution. And it's good for me to be able to let go of something. Clearly I can't keep up with everything so the change should benefit us both.Feels good to have the post done before dinner. Now if I only had my 365 Project photo done for the day."},
{"title": "One Project Completed, Nine More To Go", "date": "Sunday, April 09, 2017", "text": "And the gardening data project is complete. My spouse laughed at me a bit as I took these pictures of the binders, but he cannot deny the satisfaction I ooze at having seen this project through. There are 550 plants going into the garden representing 185 different varieties (I was slightly off in my count the other day), and I have data sheets on every single one of them printed out and organized. The main categories are Perennials--split into dry soil and moist soil because there are too many to fit into one binder--Annuals, Cacti, Grasses, Shrubs, Trees, Vines, Milkweed, plants for a White Garden, and plants for a Rain Garden. These categories are then sorted by soil moisture, then by light requirements, then by height range. Oh damn. I forgot a category for Water Garden plants so I am going to have to redo one of the binder covers to include them once I get started on the pond.I have already benefited from the data sheets in the planning of the beds by the front door and driveway. It is a cool shadowy area as it faces north and west, and the western side is full of trees. I thought it would be a perfect place for a garden of white-blooming plants. I love the way a white garden looks in the evening, and I have always wanted one in the front of a house. Now I get to check that item off my bucket list. Using the data sheets to construct a garden is kind of like using binders of Magic cards to construct a deck, and it's ultimately satisfying. Of course the binder with the white garden and rain garden plants is just a planning binder. I'll be adding plants for a dyer's and spinner's/weaver's garden to it next. And in my OCDness I'll also be redoing the cover. Again. I haven't done data sheets on the seeds yet, and since all the vegetables are in there I'll need to add that category--as well as fruit--to one of the binders. Or I could just make a new Edibles binder for vegetables, fruits, and herbs. Guess I'm not as done as I thought. But I am done FOR NOW.Next week, after all the plants have gone in, it'll be time to start on the sheep fleeces for the Master Spinner class. It will be even more intense, and there will be more binders..."},
{"title": "Ghosts", "date": "Saturday, April 08, 2017", "text": "Celestial Ghost IrisGhost In the Shell is an amazingly beautiful, really well-done movie. I don't care about the the furor over Scarlett Johanssen playing the lead role. Frankly she is perfect in it, and it was very believable that the evil corporation would make its robots into more generic feature types. Given that most anime characters have decidedly alien features that are neither Asian nor Caucasian, Scarlett Johanssen fits right in, big eyes, tipped up nose and all. Okay, that's enough about the outside world, now back to the garden.Last night as I was walking around checking out all of the wildflowers that are coming up in the natural area around the new beds I came across the beautiful, delicate little white flower at right. I only found a couple of them with complete petals, the others seemed to be fading and curling up. When I got back to the house, I pulled out my Texas wildflower books and tried to figure out what they were. I had absolutely no luck. I even looked on-line and couldn't find anything with the right leaf, petal, and stamen configuration in white.This morning I went back to the books determined to find a match, and the first thing I decided to disregard was color. Bingo! Everything but color is a perfect match for Celestials. Most references I could find list them as only blue and ours are pure white. (Though the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center database of plant images has several verified photos of white ones too...) They are also supposed to bloom early in the morning and close up by afternoon. When I went out a bit before noon today looking for them, there were none open. I saw some buds that looked like they might be opening today, but they certainly weren't open by noon. So ours are later afternoon/evening bloomers and white. (Indeed, they were just closed when we got home from the movies about 9:00). I did find finally find one reference to them that said they are night blooming and referred to them as Celestial Ghost Iris. They were still listed as blue, but at least I got closer. Maybe I should start growing them and sell them! They are clearly native as they are all along the roadside and in an area of our yard that has never been planted."},

Between the Native Plant Society (who also had tents set up at the Wildflower Center and were selling their own plants there) and the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center, I added 127 plants to the collection which brings my total number so far to 566 plants covering about 185 different varieties. They will all be planted (except maybe the cacti) Monday. No, not by me. I will place, and I will water, but I am not planting. I have minions. :-) Even though I am (mostly) done adding species and varieties for this year, I do not have all the plants on my list. Nope. There are still 157 plants on the want list... Next year. Sadly, I think I'll run out of room.Today my spouse was my plant Igor and carried the three boxes of plants I bought from the Native Plant Society to the car. That left 85 plants for me in the cart--and they all fit. Can I pack or can I? I forgot to get a picture of the Great Packing while I was standing in line to check out, but I wager a guess that I had more plants in a cart than anyone else there. Wusses.The only sour spot to the day happened when I first got to the Wildflower Center, Dave and I went in separate vehicles as he took J to school and I took the cart to LBJWC. When I got there there were already cars parked along the street for a couple of blocks. I parked at the end and then pulled my cart all the way to the main parking lot--where I found four open spots in a row right at the end. I knew we'd (Dave would) be carrying plants to the car throughout the morning and I didn't want him to have to do a block at a time so I put my cart in one of the spots with a big note on it that read: \"Spot Taken, Please Do Not Move Cart!\" and I raced off to get my car. By the time I got back, someone had moved my cart off to the side and all the spots were taken. I didn't think plant people would do that. Dave said I shouldn't have expected anything else and I was in the wrong for trying to take the spot when I didn't have my car there. I'm just glad I couldn't be 100% sure which space it was or I might have done something mean to the car.The rest of the day was spent lazing (and napping, literally) with the spouse, eating pizza and drinking champagne.

Or Fifty", "date": "Wednesday, April 05, 2017", "text": "After consuming way too much good food and spirits last night on my date out with Dave, I didn't sleep well and woke filled with dread at the prospect of an early morning (8:00 am) piano lesson and then a day on the road doing the last great nursery tour. I should've known better than to plan a tour anyway. Even though the last info I got from Medina Nursery was that they didn't really have any of the plants on my current wish list, I should've known I'd find more than enough plants there to fill the car completely (and they were my second stop--the first was Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center to get more turfgrass seed. No, it's not Bermuda, Zoysia or St. Augustine... Then I headed to Medina to pick up the plants I bought last time but couldn't fit into the minvan. I thought that would leave me with plenty of time and space to hit a couple more nurseries recommended by Medina. The guys from there sent me a list of other good native nurseries, and the route I planned out is below. I should've known it was both WAY too ambitious, and overkill for right now. But I have it for future road trips--maybe when Debbie comes down from Dallas.I got home just before 6:00 tonight and was too tired to unload the van before dinner. It's too dark now so I'll do it first thing in the morning before heading off to pottery class. It's hard to tell from the pic above, but the plants are packed solid from the very back to the back of the front seats (all the other seats are out) and even in the front passenger seat.Tomorrow afternoon I have to take Baxter in to the vet again. He's doing well, but I feel badly that he has to spend all day in a rate. But when he's out, he paces, and the vet wants him completely immobile for the next two weeks minimum to really give the hip time to settle into the socket."},

I got the first round of plants set out in the first and half of the second garden beds this morning before taking Baxter to the vet for his check-up. Turns out my Appointment wasn't until Thursday, but the vet saw me anyway and we were both glad I brought the B. in as he had an open wound on the elbow joint of the front leg on the dislocated hip side. It was a cankle (hygroma) gone bad. So the vet cleaned it out, checked the hip--it was still in the socket--and sent us home with a good prognosis. When we got home, Baxter went in the house and I went back to the garden for another hour. When I was done I put Jig and Gallifrey back in the house with Baxter and headed off to a two-hour meeting. And that's when the pear-shapedness occurred.When I got home from my meeting I opened the front door to find all three dogs waiting for me in a very agitated state. Gallifrey was clearly all worked up and anxious, and Baxter had been the object of his anxiety. While I was gone, Gallifrey chewed through Baxter sling and opened the small sore on his dislocated leg into a gaping open wound with an exposed tendon, he had taken the bandage off the front leg and licked that wound into a raw state again, and he had finished by licking a hole in the the right front hygroma which had just been a bit swollen but not all an open wound. He had also licked his ears, a swollen area in his groin area (part of the initial accident trauma that had mostly subsided until Gallifrey started licking at it) and all over his back so that Baxter was soaking wet with slobber. When I opened the door, Baxter looked dazed and wet, and he was completely out of his sling. So off to the vet we went again.An hour and a half later and Baxter has three serious bandages on three of his legs, he's out of the sling--they couldn't put it back on because it would put pressure on the back leg wound--and I have to keep him kenneled and pretty much immobile for the next two weeks, and I have to keep Gallifrey away from him. So there is a big kennel set up in our bedroom now, and it has one of the transmitters from the invisible fence on the top so when Gallifrey goes up to it--in case he could chew the bandages through the bars--he gets a correcting zap.Now Baxter has had his nightly meds (we're up to four different ones), and I am ready to crash into my eyelids. He also got a new stuffed squirrel today s all seems to be okay with his world.Tomorow: more plant shopping and acquisition."},

It took all damn day just to get them sorted and inventoried and to print the rest of the info cards for the grasses and shrubs I have. But tomorrow, tomorrow in between taking Baxter to the vet and meeting with the bank, planting will happen. And Jay assures me the stream will flow tomorrow too. All renovation/construction projects take more time than you think they will/should, but I think landscaping takes the longest. Even with three guys showing up at my door at 9:00 am this morning and asking what they should do and then working all day, we are still no closer on the planting. I admit it: I am the bottleneck there. I keep making lists and charts and cards and such when I should just throw it all into the ground and figure I'll move things if they don't do well or look right where I initially put them. Commencement anxiety. That's what I have.But tomorrow they will all get planted, and I'll probably get the seeds in too. I might even get the grass seed thrown and have the guys use the roller to flatten it in. Tonight, lacking anything more exciting to say, I am just going to head off to bed so I can get up at the crack of daylight to make the next round of plant lists."},

Thanks to the seriously inclement weather, we were able to take the parents to brunch at Jack Allen's Kitchen and not have to wait. Score. I had a big day planned (i.e., I wasn't planning to nap when we got home) so I forewent the mimosas. By the time we got home the rain had cleared and it was a beautiful, sunny, if chilly, afternoon. I spent all of it indoors. Except for the part where I moved a tarantula off the corner of the front porch before Jessie saw it. Poor thing. I think it might have been dead. But I put it carefully out under a bush in a relatively dry spot.The rest of the day we all sat around waiting to go to bed. It felt like an old folks home for all the ambition and energy we had. Jessie cleaned her room so she could (finally) show it to Gramma, and that was our combined effort for the day. We didn't even really stir ourselves for dinner. Brunch was so huge and filling we just put out some cheese, meat, fruit, dolmades, and crackers, and everyone helped themselves as they felt peckish.The rest of the plants waiting to go into the ground.In spite of my lack of physical activity, I did have a major accomplishment today: I made the first native plant information cards to use in planting the garden. They are 5-1/2 X 8-1/2 and are based on the data from the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center plant database, which is itself built from the US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service plant database. In order to make the information more visually available (without having to read the card) I made a template with light requirements and size range on the top, blooming season on the right, and soil requirements on the bottom. After I printed them out, I used highlighter markers to color the appropriate selections on the template. Tomorrow I will be able to sort them first by soil (wet or dry) and by light to determine which bed they'll go in, then I can sort the plants selected for each bed by height and bloom season so the heights will be staggered and there will always be something blooming in every part of every bed.Many packets of seeds.I still have lots of packets of seeds and I'm not quite sure what to do about them. I guess it's still early enough to sow many of them directly into the ground, but I haven't done the info cards for them yet. I got them done for half of the 113 different plants I bought in containers--including all of the perennials. The shrubs and trees are usually only in ones or twos so I don't need to worry so much about where they are going to go--and they aren't going into beds. Maybe I'll have time to do the cards for the seeds tomorrow before the contractors come so I can plan on planting them tomorrow too."},
{"title": "It Was a Quiet Day", "date": "Saturday, April 01, 2017", "text": "Today was a quiet day in the grey hill country of Austin. We were expecting thunderstorms so we didn't bother to make plans, and then it never rained at all. Now the forecast calls for thunderstorms all day tomorrow. We'll see. Dave's parents are in for the weekend and all we have done so far is eat. Dave made sous vide bacon and scratch pancakes for breakfast. He made banana bread this afternoon. And he made beef tenderloin stroganoff for dinner. My accomplishments were more garden (no surprise there) oriented. The biggest one was finding a new breaker box today (we've owned the house for a year and a half now) under the deck by one if the rainwater collection tanks. It had two flipped breakers so I solved the mystery of where the stream pump breaker is, but now I have no idea what the other three breakers in the box (including the flipped one) go to. My in-laws walked the new garden this morning, and later my MIL said to me, when I asked her what she thought, that it's a lot of work. And that was the first moment that I really contemplated what it was going to mean to have an acre and a half of meticulously planned and landscaped gardens and neither a yard service nor a gardener... It wasn't a pretty image. Right now I am all gardening all the time, but not too long from now I will have the pond and the bog pond in, all the plants planted, furniture designed and built, paths, lighting, and irrigation all installed--and then I'll move on to the next thing. Time spent on the garden may go the way of making bread once a week, pasta every couple of weeks, spinning fifteen minutes a day, and drawing. Knitting I have managed to keep up because dishcloths are a quick and easy project--but I have not done *any* of my homework for my spinning class, nor have I done any ikebana since Christmas.I have planned the new landscaping to be low maintenance, but low maintenance isn't no maintenance. There will be weeds. Sure, I can use a pear burner on the paths and rock area, but there is still going to be mowing, weed-eating, and just plain weeding to do. And I don't have a teenager who can be hired to do yardwork of any kind. She's too afraid she'll run into a tarantula. This is going to require some thought and planning. And maybe a regular yard service to keep up with the leaves and the mowing and the weed whacking.Baxter and his pacifierOther news of the day: Baxter is getting around well in his sling, and he's making me crazy. He has been doing a periodic aimless-wander-in-circles thing for several months now. Before his accident, he liked to go 'round and 'round the couch while we were sitting watching tv. This would have been okay if either we had carpet or he didn't have horribly long toenails. Unfortunately... Since the sling he spends all of his time in our bedroom--right off the main room--and has taken to pacing down the hall and back again. Tonight it's been every 15 minutes. At 3:00 am this morning it was continuos until I finally got up and shut the doors so he couldn't get out of the bedroom and into the hall on the wood floor. I have taken him outside. He doesn't need to relieve himself. I have given him his meds--two opiates and a muscle relaxant. He is feeling no pain. I fed him cooked chicken breast and beef jerky and brought him fresh water. He is neither hungry nor thirsty. And yet he will not just lie down and *stay* down. So I ordered him a squirrel. He used to do this zen thing with his stuffed squirrel (actually he started with a stuffed pacifier and then moved to a squirrel) where he would hold it between his paws, put his mouth on it, and just sit. He didn't lick. He didn't chew. He just sat there with his mouth on it.Maybe he's got an oral fixation thing going. So now two squirrels, a duck, a fox, and a host of other small dismemberable creatures are on their way from Amazon.Baxter and his squirrelAnd speaking of dismemberable... Tonight when we sat down to dinner Jessie saw Pavlova with a small (live) wren in her mouth on the other side of the kitchen. She took the bird away from her and gently put it down outside where it flew away. There were quite a few downy feathers on the stair landing indicating Pavlova had been playing for awhile, but we still have no idea how the wren got into the house. There were no open windows, we didn't leave any doors open (because we don't want the cats to go out), and yet, there was a little wren in the jaws of death. Literally.Now I have crashed hard. Again. This is becoming a nightly pattern. I'll spell and grammar check this post tomorrow."},

I am tired and sunburned. My knees hurt, my back hurts, and I didn't even plant anything today! I moved plants around. I walked back and forth and carried plants to the wagon and then pulled them to their final locations. I moved lots of pots around as I was sorting. But digging the holes, placing the plants, and shoveling the dirt, that was all someone else. AND I'M STILL TIRED! But what went in today is beautiful. I decided to do a predominantly native white garden in the front by the entry to the house. I planted Anacacho orchid trees, a white redbud, white beautyberry, white turk's cap, Texas mock orange, a Mexican plum, Alabama croton, and fragrant tea olive. Oh, and a wafer ash hop tree. Those are the vegetative bones of the area around the front porch and leading down the north side of the house to the backyard. I only got three trees put in the backyard today: A beautiful, large Mexican redbud, a weeping Traveler redbud, and a Mr. Wonderful pomegranate. Now I have the weekend to plan the layout of the next great round of planting to commence on Monday.I wanted to have the stream in the backyard running by the end of the day today when my in-laws arrived for a visit, but I was denied. An electrician is coming Monday to chase down a wiring problem, and Jay will finish cleaning out the pipes and turn on the new pump he installed today. I am really excited to have the stream working again. It was my favorite feature of the house when we bought it, and it hasn't worked since then. Fold it into the existing and planned water collection system and the solar energy for the power, and I am feeling pretty confident about running it full time. Heck, we *could* have a pool....So now it's time to give Baxter his last meds for the evening and to fall into my sunburned eyelids. Goodnight all."},

It's so exciting! I have also found a new nursery specializing in native plants and I hope to check them out tomorrow morning. Maybe if I leave early enough I can get up there and back before Jay arrives to fix the stream and do the walkthrough of the yard with me. I would just leave it till next week, but our spring here has been so aggressively early that nurseries having been selling out of the rarer natives and I don't want to let another's weekend's worth of shoppers take away my prime plants. Mine! Mine! Mine!I just had a second's flashback to when I started this blog and it was all about glass. All glass all the time. A few personal posts might sneak in, but I had the now defunct Stranded In the South blog for those. Now it's all about the garden. I have already written a paragraph and a half without mentioning my excellent pottery class from this morning where I managed to throw a pretty tall--if totally wonky--cylinder, and I trimmed the wonky bowl from last week and put it into the kiln room at the studio for the first firing. I love my Thursday morning pottery class! The only thing that would make it better is if Becky were here taking it too. Becky, I miss you!!! We have got to get back to our craft mornings soon. Of course that predicates getting back to any sort of crafting activity at home. The extent of my knitting lately has been making cotton dishcloths for Dave.But back to the garden. Some may find it slightly (or more than slightly) disturbing that I just hunted down and read the obituaries of the couple who built this house. But the last owner told me stories when we bought the house of Mary Lea and how she designed the gardens and oversaw every detail of the construction here. Now that the beds have been taken back to a zero state, I can't help but think of her and the joy and anticipation she must have felt planning all the plants, lighting, irrigation, and the stream. Don, from whom we bought the house, passed on her folders to me with their samples of wallpaper and cutouts from magazines of ideas that she liked for the house. One of the cutouts was a picture of a deck very similar to the one that was at the bottom of the yard. When we bought the house there was no view from down there because the cedars from the bird preserve down the hill from us have grown very tall. But 30 years ago I bet they could see downtown from that deck. That's what the picture in the magazine looked like--a beautiful curved deck with a spectacular view from up on a mountain. Like me, Mar Lea was originally a mountain girl (she was from Colorado) who never lost her love of that area.Though we have made changes to the original design and put our own (okay, my own) stamp on it, the original bones mostly remain the same. We lowered the lowest deck and dropped the middle deck to the ground and replaced it with stone. We took out several of the native cedars that she chose to leave in place, and we removed almost all of the nandina (not a plant choice that I would have expected from a woman who loved and taught herself all about native wildflowers--but who am I to talk, I put in bamboo) but I can still feel her presence in the garden. I am contemplating contacting Mary Lea's daughter who still lives here in Austin or her daughter who lives in Scottsdale but used to live next door in Dan and Zaga's house to see if they might have photos of the yard that they would be willing to share so I could see what it looked like when Mary Lea and Max lived here. I am compiling a book on the grounds and the renovation, and I would love to be able to compare my vision with her original one.I have never been to a house with such beautiful grounds as this house has. They were let given minimal care for many year before we bought the house (and to be honest, they require someone to be on top of them all the time--I kind of wish we had a fulltime gardener) so it was hard to see their potential, but now that they are completely bare they are breathtaking. With a little more dirt, mulch, new plants throughout, and lighting... Dave is right to say this place is like a botanical gardens. He made a joke this morning about where am I going to put the gift shop. Little does he know...Thank you Mary Lea."},

Many thing came to a finish today: I got all the tax papers together and mailed them off to our accountant, The house is clean (except for folding the laundry), the front beds are almost all weeded and ready for new dirt and planting, and I sent off soil and water samples to be tested. These were all tasks hanging over my head for a looong time--the taxes were my own personal sword of Damocles. Now they're all done, and tomorrow I get to garden all day GUILT FREE! Wheeee!Tomorrow the first trees go in--Anacacho orchid trees right by the front door (white), and the white turk's cap, the white beautyberry, and maybe some of the fragrant tea olives. tropical sage (in white), pigeonberry, frogfruit, maybe some shrubby boneset (if I can find some well-drained areas) and some confederate jasmine. One thing I learned from the front yard in Atlanta is how wonderful it is to have fragrant plants along the walk to the front door and ringing the porch. There we had confederate jasmine, gardenia, and fragrant tea olive and they all bloomed at different times so the fragrances were not overwhelming. I'd love to put the jasmine by the front door too, but there are no structures there for it to climb... Might have to design something for the guys to build.Oh it feels good to contemplate gardening instead of taxes!!! And doing so with a clean house is the cherry on top of my sundae.

Today was supposed to be just a couple of hours more on the taxes. I'm still not done. I finally forced myself to put down the tangle that is our moving expenses, and I'll pick it up again tomorrow when I'm fresh. Unless I slit my wrists tonight to avoid it. Every move to a new state brings a change in taxes. Texas has no state income tax so there is not deduction on the federal taxes for what you paid into the state. However they have a hefty sales tax, and the federal rule is that you can deduct either what you paid into your state for income tax OR what you paid them in sales tax. I wish I'd known that when the year started--I'd have kept better track of what we paid out in sales tax!However with a couple of hours of effort this afternoon, I was able to cobble together enough receipts to get a decent deduction. We also bought the solar system and an electric car last year--both of which qualify for federal tax credits--and it took me awhile to figure out those forms. Then I started on the move. Wow. I knew it was complicated when we were driving out the monthly (almost) U-Hauls, but it really got convoluted when Dave was flying back from Austin to drive out teh U-Haul so I could drive out the minvan. Between my calendar and the credit card bills I just about have it hammered out, but, good god, I am so glad we are NEVER MOVING AGAIN!!!I need to be done with it tomorrow so I can get back to the garden again (and now that song is stuck in my head for another night). The guys have been doing great without me, but it's time to get the first plants in the ground and do a census of what I still need.Sometime soon I'll get back to glass, back to spinning, and back to ikebana, but for today I'm just glad my house is clean (I broke down and hired it cleaned today--it was so worth it!)."},

With a little bit of time tomorrow pulling together the numbers from the data I assembled today and finishing up the moving expenses and the paperwork for the tax credits on the solar installation and the Leaf, I will be done (and the crowd goes wild!).I also gave up on building the database for plants that I was working on. FileMaker Pro just defeated me in terms of how it stores and retrieves data. I *could* get everything in in all the tables and related tables, but I would have to make all the entries one at a time as I couldn't figure out how to automate storing the values for multiple entries in one field. For example, if a plant can be planted in Sun, Pt Shade, or Shade, I would like to capture that information without putting it all in one field. It's better to have a unique record for each unique bit of data. I have done this many times before in a previous life when I worked with the Remedy engine (ostensibly for help desk management, but I built all kinds of different applications using it). FileMaker Pro is either not as flexible as Remedy, or I am just not getting it. So I scrapped the project for the time being in the interests of just getting all the data in a place that I can at least use it--like Excel. It's not pretty, but it will work. Best of all, I can probably have it done and be using it by wednesday to design the beds with the 147 different kinds of plants I have collected so far.Planting a garden isn't just about throwing plants into beds and watering them. You have to plan for eventual size--shorter ones in the front, taller ones in the back. You have to arrange for color and texture of foliage and leaves. You have to stagger the plants in a given bed by blooming season--you don't want all the plants in one bed to bloom at the same time. You also want to make sure you have sufficient plants to bloom from the very beginning to the very end of the garden season. This is especially important if you are gardening for bees and butterflies as the blooming plants are their food source: No flowers, no food.Even though it was Contractor Light, it wasn't Contractor Void, and they did get the rest of the dirt in the new beds and I think the backyard is just about completely weeded too. I am excited for tomorrow as there will be six people here working and I should really be able to see a difference by the end of the day."},

I am truly a multi-tasker tonight. Today we gave ourselves a treat and went to the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center for a family outing. It felt good to be able to identify most of the plants we saw there--and to be able to say, \"Oh yes, we have that one\". When we got home, I felt like a nap again, but worked on my plant database some more. I begin to get discouraged as I can't figure out how to make FileMaker Pro do what I want it to, and Excel won't do what I want it to. And working on it to such exclusion has put me behind in everything else. So tonight I have to shake it all off and prepare to start anew tomorrow. New week, new goals, new deliverables."},
{"title": "In Sickness and In Health", "date": "Saturday, March 25, 2017", "text": "So Baxter went back to the vet today to have his hip examined, x-rayed, poked and prodded. He also had some fluid drawn from a swelling in his groin area by the injury site. Good news first: The hip is still in the socket so I didn't have to make a surgery/no surgery decision. There's no guarantee that I won't, but I didn't have to today. And even if the hip does come out again, I STILL don't need to make an immediate decision about the surgery. The vet said it was a non-damaging option to see how he did just on pain meds with it out. They wanted to send the fluid out for lab tests--after already having looked at it in-house and found nothing--for an additional $500. I told them I wasn't that curious to find out what it is since it doesn't appear to be anything we'll do anything about anyway (it wasn't an infection and they didn't think it was cancer either--probably lymphatic fluid from the trauma). The only bad news from the day was that I was at the vet for three hours this morning, and I did have to push back on the vet when he pressed for accepting the surgical solution--which caused me to end up (unsurprisingly) in tears. The morning was stressful enough--and the past week was sleep-deprived enough that I took a 3-1/2 hour nap this afternoon. Dave finally came in and woke me at 6:00, otherwise I think I would have just kept sleeping. And I don't foresee any problems sleeping tonight.I did feel guilty when I woke about having, oh what would be a good word... Wasted and lost clearly won't do given the sentiment I want to follow... Spent! Spent is good. I spent the afternoon napping and felt guilty until I reminded myself that life isn't a race and that there are very few real deadlines in it. Time is a currency, and you should spend it wisely. Wisely today for me meant sleeping. And even with the sleep I still feel a bit fragile. Longterm care-taking of the elderly or the infirm isn't easy, and in many ways taking care of Baxter is making me flashback to taking care of my mother. Those memories--even two years on--are still too raw. There are times I can't help feeling resentful or annoyed by the demands placed on me in my caretaker's role, and then I immediately feel guilty for being the least uncharitable when the being I am care-taking clearly has a much worse situation than I do, and I am supposed to be taking care of them because I love them. But sometimes feelings of love slip into feelings of responsibility, and recognition that I'm feeling more responsibility than love brings on more guilt.So tonight I breathe deeply, and I try to be kind to myself, to Baxter, and to the rest of my family. I am so, so lucky to have them all, and pets are like marriage partners: in sickness and in health, for better and for worse, as long as you both shall live."},

Boys were the first one--the desire for a life partner and mate preoccupying my late teens and earliest twenties. It took many years to complete that goal and many more to grow into deserving him. But this post is not about that that kind of lust.While I was waiting to meet my heart's desire, I became involved with glass--first stained then fused--and hot on its heels of glass was linguistics. One thing led to another, personality and politics decreed my path would not be smooth, and when I transitioned from professional lingistics/university faculty into academic computing support, I stumbled upon the Remedy software application. Learning it led to my most successful--by the standards of our society--professional activity, and still to this day (over 20 years later) it remains one of the most satisfying and challenging pursuits I have undertaken.Now I am in the middle of another infatuation (the garden and all things botanical) and I find myself needing to return to my Remedy roots (in a way) as I pick up and learn the current version of FileMaker Pro in order to compile a flexible database of the native plants I am using in the new garden that will hold all the data I want to gather about them in a way that is accessible. In other words, I have reached the limit of what I can efficiently manage with Microsoft Excel. When it is finished, I hope to transition this database to data.world--thereby marrying both my and my husband's passions--and make it available to others. As I go, I marvel at how life winds around and flows, twining and crossing the paths of the past and the present, forming us into the solid, complex, three-dimensional organisms that we are. Who knew that software/workflow development would lend itself to gardening?Do not think this means I have forgotten glass, spinning, weaving, ceramics, metal-smithing, woodworking, and ikebana--all past and present preoccupations. But today, tonight, I create cathedrals in software. And I help Baxter walk to and from the front door. We are off to the vet tomorrow morning--I have a feeling the next post will be about him."},

Steve is also providing professional architectural services on our bathroom remodel--that will be *much* better than just winging it! I would like to say I got more done today, but honestly I have spent the last half hour trying to get the Irene Adler moan ringtone from Sherlock onto my phone--as has Steve. He has a Samsung Galaxy and I have an iPhone so we're both struggling with different tech. But by this time tomorrow... Ahhhhh.Pottery today was a new lesson in humility and patience, balance and breathing. Oh, and bad posture. Apparently my posture is too good and it affects the strength and focus I have access to in my throwing. My instructor assured me, however, that whatever my posture, throwing clay is hard on the body and I'm going to hurt. I should take up yoga. For now I think sleep will do. Tomorrow, a stream!"},

Jay had it cleaned today as the last part of the renovation so I didn't have to. Now I just need to round up some towels. Oh and vacuum out the car after yesterday's plant adventures. Cleaning in our house today consisted of vacuuming the front half of the house. I'm afraid my brain got stuck in the plant zone again (see the seed box at right?).I didn't leave the property today. The Invisible Fence guy came and extended our covered area to include the new garden, and Jay and his guys worked on the front and the back. The front garden is not as far as I would have liked as the skidsteer broke down today so dirt didn't really get moved, but the back is looking great and I have high hopes the stream will be working by the weekend. The stumps did not get pulled today either, and then I went and came up with another yard area to do. Between our house and Dan and Zaga's, we're going to clear several more cedars and some shrubs and construct a lattice pergola structure with a bench on one side (for Zaga and Dan) and maybe a fountain or some other garden art on the other. for us The main purpose of the structure is so that they can use their hot tub naked with no fear of scandalizing us, and we can stroll around our bathroom in the buff without fear of causing heart failure on their part. We could spend a lot of money on tinted windows (I definitely don't want blinds), but this way we can have nature AND privacy all at the same time, and it will be a pretty, shared space too.Taxes did not get done again today--Helen, our accountant, is going to scalp me if I don't get my butt in gear pronto. But tomorrow my pottery class starts, and I have company to entertain (they're easy) and a bathroom to design with one of the company as he's an architect and the visit is ostensibly to plan out the new bathroom. I cannot WAIT to get rid of the carpet in it and our bedroom, and to have a taller toilet that doesn't run constantly if you don't fiddle with the inside lever thingie.Okay, off to vacuum the car, take towels to the apartment, and head to the airport!"},
{"title": "There Is *Almost* No Limit To What a Determined Gardener Can Fit Into a Minivan", "date": "Tuesday, March 21, 2017", "text": "Except for the big pot at the top left, this all fit in the minivan todayThe big plan today was to drop the dogs at the groomers at 8:00 when they opened and head to the Medina Nursery Garden 2-3 hours down the winding back country highways west and south. They pulled an order of plants for me on Sunday, I was going to pick them up, ask if there was anything else I shouldn't miss, pay and head home to arrive by 3:00, give Baxter his meds, unload the plants, go get the dogs, and pick Jessie up from school. Best laid plans of mice and gardeners...I dropped off the dogs at 8:30 which put me down in Medina about 11:15. I got home at 7:00 tonight. Zaga saved my butt *again* by both giving Baxter his meds at 3:00 and then picking up the other dogs at 4:30 when it became apparent there was no way I was going to get back before the groomer closed at 6:00. Heck, at 4:30 the wonderful guys from the nursery were still trying to figure out how to fit all the plants I got in the minivan (we failed at that, but it's okay). Total plants acquired today: 249. Total plants before today: 108--and that was two pick-up truck loads. Today was the minivan, and I hadn't even taken one of the main back seats and the little middle back seat out.That nursery is incredible! They specialize in rare natives that they propagate themselves and trade with other small native nurseries. Their main clients are the native plant societies, but they also work with mainstream gardeners showing them how they can integrate natives into a conventional garden without sacrificing looks and gaining ease of maintenance and tolerance of Texas weather and soils.Unless you are a serious native plant specialist (way more than I am), you can't effectively shop there without one of the guys holding your hand and showing you plants. Ishmael held my hand for five hours. Without him, I would have come home with my list, made all my appointments, and been much the sadder for it. If you look in a lot of the pots there, they have drab, spindly, weedy-looking little plants. That's because many of them are just coming up, and they don't have robust foliage or any flowers at all yet--often they aren't even labeled. But all you have to do is say, \"I'm looking for a white flowering plant that does well in poorly drained, heavy clay and full shade,\" and they'll lead you right to one (White American Beautyberry, Callicarpa americana var. lactea). I got three.Just to get me home they had to take one of their long, short-legged, black plastic plant tables and put it in the minivan over the fully-covered floor. Then they had another layer of plants on it. All the seats were filled, the passenger foot area, the running boards inside the back doors (I had to force both doors to close on the pots and squish them a bit to get the doors to close). I'll take their table back to them when I go next week. I don't mind the trip at all as they managed to find one of the really rare (in this area) plants for me at another little place and they'll have it for me next week along with all the ones I bought today and couldn't fit in the van (probably about 20). I'm tempted to get Bobby and Devon to make me a two-tier table set-up for the back of the minivan so I could stack plants three-high. But then again, how many more trips like this am I going to make down there? Hey, maybe I should get a trailer and have plant racks built into it...I got home to a large mulch pile in place of the last brush pile, but no dirt. They couldn't get the skidsteer today so the dirt--and the skidsteer--will be here first thing tomorrow morning. There had been, however, someone working in the backyard as there was serious damage done to the weeds around the stream. I can't wait to see it running! Now off to bed to dream botanical dreams  and recover from my very exciting day."},
{"title": "And We've Got To Get Ourselves Back To the Garden", "date": "Monday, March 20, 2017", "text": "We're home, and I have many things on my plate. But none of them are so compelling as the garden. As I am a creature of whim (and an avatar of chaos), I went with the flow and picked up where we left off with the landscaping plans and let the laundry and housecleaning sit. Maybe I should just hire a service to come in Wednesday and clean the whole house and the apartment... You see we have two sets of company twining through our lives this week, and I want everything to be ship-shape for them, though they do not require it. It's a hostess thing. I also hope to convince another friend from Dallas to come down the following weekend to help me put in plants (Debbie, you know who you are).But back to the landscaping plans! I had a set of objectives and a rough timeline set out before I left, but the warm weather and abundant rain have caused every species of burr grass known to Texas to flourish and I simply cannot leave the existing garden beds to languish while I focus on the new beds. I simply must amend my plans. So I tugged hard on them, and twisted them into a new and interesting shape. Current additions to the old plan: All existing garden beds (front and back) will be mostly--if not all--cleared, with new dirt added, and mulched by Friday ready for planting next week. (Cleared, by the way means burned off with a massive propane torch called a \"pear burner\" in Texas. Why pull the weeds over hours when you can whack them with a weed whacker and then burn them over minutes? And who doesn't like a good fire...) The stream bed will be cleaned out, the new pump will be installed, and the stream will be running by the end of the week. (wheee!)On the old plan, The new beds have all been constructed--only the pond is left to do in terms of rock work. The concrete footings for the bog pond will go down this week, but the rock work, liner, skimmer, bog pond, waterfall, pump, etc., will not begin for at least a week. Current schedule reads: Mulch and make firewood from the final trees removed (mostly dead from a neighbor's property) starting tomorrow. Dirt delivery is supposed to start tomorrow with three truckloads and then an additional two loads on Wednesday (over 50 cu yds total). There is a big chipper/shredder being delivered tomorrow to mulch everything, we have a coupe of chainsaws for the firewood, and there is also a skidsteer being delivered to move the dirt and pull the last tree stump (don't you love all the toys used in this project? I love toys). By the end of the week all the holes for the new trees will be dug (by machine and man, not solely by man). Finally, the tops of all the rock walls around all the beds will be set in place so we'll have a nice wall to sit on. Because the dirt will be in, and I both already have plants and I'm going to Medina Garden Nursery tomorrow to pick up another batch of plants they've pulled for me (and probably more they'll recommend), I'm sure I'll end the week with a LOT of planting! Soaker hoses, here I come.Next week will be the pond and bog pond, and the piping for the pond and the irrigation to all of the beds. The week after that will be the building of all the structures--benches, arbors, swing, fire pit, trellises, and the laying of the decomposed granite for the walkways. At some point the bark will be peeled off all the cedar poles and they will be laid as path boundaries. Oh yes, and there will be a small ornamental bridge built over the dry culvert where we get water runoff in high rains. Trip, trop, trip, trop.No wildflowers have come up in the front lawn (designated as the new wildflower meadow), but I am going to leave it shaggy for the many species which have yet to bloom to see if I have any luck there, and I'm going to seed it heavily again this fall. Speaking of seeds, the annual seeds I ordered from American Native Seed arrived while I was in Honduras, and I went through all of them (and all of the other seeds I have purchased) today to start making a master plan for planting. Most of them will be sown directly into the garden, though a couple of species need to be scarified and then chilled before planting them. In all, it's a full garden week! Throw in taking the dogs to the groomer (except Baxter who is doing very well in his sling but not ready to be manhandled by a groomer), and getting the tax papers to the accountant, and I really think I'd better hire a cleaning service for Wednesday!"},
{"title": "Monkeys, Sloths, and Iguana, Oh My!", "date": "Sunday, March 19, 2017", "text": "At the airport, through security, fingerprints taken... again. The boarding passes taunted us with TSA-Pre-Check at the top, but of course there is no TSA here in Honduras. There is a DSA, and they laugh at our Pre-Check. Tonight we get home just in time to sleep in our own beds. I had a wonderful, relaxing time here, but I'm glad to go home. It used to be that I'd do anything to be on vacation longer, but these days I find I like my life so much that it's hard to leave. Even with all the chaos there during remodeling and renovation, it's also hard to leave Stone's Throw.But this post is about Roatán from the perspective of a more experienced eco traveler. The owners of the condo where we stayed left an informational packet for visitors and took great pains to educate us on the biggest problems for the ecology of the island and the little things we could do to make the situation better. First off, it's an island. The trash stays on the island. It's an island. It's not that big and all the plastic bags, styrofoam takeout containers, drinking straws, and water bottles (though the last are recyclable) end up best case in an ever-growing landfill in a limited space, or worst case in the ocean and then in a sea turtle's nose or stomach. It's an island.Then there's the problem of locals (or people come from the mainland to make a better living from the tourism on the island) depleting the native game (or fish) populations to supply the restaurants to please the palates of the visiting tourists. The tourists don't know that lobster season ends on March 1 and doesn't resume again until July 1 so any fresh lobster they eat during that time period has been poached. They don't know that conch is endangered and the only legal source is the research entities who couldn't nearly supply enough for all the soups and fritters on the local menus. The locals are so eager to please the tourists and gain revenue from them that they don't think ahead to what happens when the attraction that draws the tourists is gone. Yes, tourists like to eat fresh lobster, conch, grouper and other marine life. However, if those species are overfished or over-harvested then the reef dies. The reef dies and the divers and snorkelers don't come. It's bad for business all around to kill off your attractions.In the midst of being inundated with plastic at restaurants and stores, it was wonderful to visit three different places on the island that are owned and run by locals, and whose mission is to protect, educate and conserve. These three places alone make Roatán a great place to visit. Add them to the diving and the friendliness of the locals and you have an incredible vacation destination.For the past two days I have posted many pictures of us with sloths, monkeys, iguana and various other wildlife. While it was cool to be able to interact with the animals, the most important part of our visits to the various sanctuaries was seeing the genuine care the staff took of the animals and hearing about the educational and rescue missions on their behalf.Our first stop was at Daniel Johnson's Monkey and Sloth Hangout. The sloths there are not caged, and you can only hold one if they haven't already been held too much that day. There are seven sloths and they get to be held for a few minutes 15 times per day. The rest of the time, they hang out in the mangroves on the property. The sloths serve to educate both the natives and tourists on the importance of the mainland forests (their natural habitat) and their peaceable nature. The monkeys are all rescued pets as is the raccoon, the macaws and parrots. You are allowed to go in the enclosure with the young capuchin monkeys, and if they want to come hang out on you they can. They're not forced--they're not even forced to be in the same enclosure--there is a tube high up that connects it to another enclosure. In the afternoon after all the tourists are gone, the monkeys are all let out to play in the trees and roam the property for a few hours. The enclosures were large, clean, and had trees growing in them for the animals to climb or other interactive structures. I was really, really impressed with this place and the obvious care they take of their charges.Next we went to Arch's Iguana and Marine Sanctuary. Iguana are one of the native island species, and they are relentlessly hunted as food. We actually saw three iguana hunters today on the way to the airport (they were pointed out by our driver as they scanned the trees in search of their prey). I have nothing against hunting for food, but the iguana population on the island has been so depleted that it's rare to see one anymore. We did not take the snorkel tour at the Marine Park, but after seeing the video at the bottom of this post I wish we had.This is an incredible success story of locals seeing the value in preserving marine life and other animals and stepping up to make a difference. They not only actively patrol to stop poaching, but they have gotten their neighbors to see the value and join in their conservation efforts. I have seen criticism online about the horrible conditions of animals in small cages, and all I can say is on our visit I saw only two monkeys in cages--no other animals. They weren't as large or as nice as the enclosures at Daniel Johnson's, but when I asked about them--and about why the monkeys (two different species) were both solitary, I was told that the spider monkey is a rescued pet and she prefers living alone (there's actually an iguana in with her), and the capuchin had a companion but they were having to work through permitting issues in order to house her. However the monkeys are also allowed out after the tourists leave at 3:00 so they can roam the grounds and play too.Finally we ended up at Mayan Eden Eco Park. There the birds and the monkeys roam freely--though there are some rescued animals in enclosures including white-tailed deer. The big draw for me there though was the butterfly house. They propagate and raise larval plants for the butterflies, and tin their butterfly house they have living examples of the different stages of each type of butterfly. The tour guides are both knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and it's clear the mission there is also education and conservation of the butterflies and the animals that now make their home there. There is also a zipline through the jungle canopy in the park, but we never even saw the area for that. As with the other two places, the interactions with the animals were carefully controlled for the animals benefit. The monkeys were coaxed over with food--they weren't coerced to interact with the tourists--and they scampered off when they wanted.I end the post with a video interview of members of the Arch family talking about the reasons behind their Sanctuary and what they do daily to keep it alive."},

So tonight I leave you with the slideshow I made to accompany the post, and I'll put together the words tomorrow.What an incredible day! I have lots to write about it--especially about the true animal-friendliness of the places we visited today, but I'm just too tired tonight. Tomorrow will be a great day to put it all down. We visited sanctuaries and a butterfly garden, and had a lovely driving tour of the island with Arnold. There were sloths, macaws, monkeys, parrots, a kinkajou, tiny white-tailed deer, and iguanas.On the home front, Baxter got his hip put back in and the doctor thinks he'll do much better this time than last time: the hip went in easier, and they are using a better sling.

{"title": "Baxter Blues", "date": "Thursday, March 16, 2017", "text": "Tough day today, Baxter's hip came out of its socket again. According to the vet, there are two options: put it back in and there's about a 30-40% chance of success with that option, or do surgery with weeks of physical therapy and potentially months before he is back to 100%--if ever. The vet stressed that the surgery is very successful--and I have no doubt it is. But there comes a point in life when fixing it doesn't make it better. Baxter is 16 years old. He sleeps most of the time, he has forgotten where he's supposed to relieve himself, he is hard of hearing, losing his eyesight, and losing his mental facilities. I don't know how much time he has left, but I really don't want him to spend it mostly immobile, being forced to do physical therapy in the water (he hates the water), and recovering from an invasive experience. With his hip still out of the socket he has been running around the house quite happily (on three legs), eating, drinking, and going outside normally. Yes, he's on pain meds, and I see no reason to stop them. But I am really, really struggling with putting him through surgery. Between my mom and our deerhound Jester, I am not a fan of surgery on the old.Even so, I am swamped with guilt over not doing everything I can do and can afford for him. My kneejerk reaction is \"Of course, let's do surgery!\", but regardless what this vet--who has never seen him before and doesn't know him--says, I keep thinking it's better for him *not* to do it, and doing it so I can console myself by saying I did everything I could for him is a lousy reason.If we put the hip back in, it has to be tomorrow morning, but then he'll just be back in the sling, peeing on it and himself, struggling to walk, and it probably won't work. This is a lot harder of a decision because I'm not there with him judging for myself how he's doing and how he might do with various treatments.Going to go to bed to sleep on it. Have to make at least one decision (put it back in or not) by 8:30 am tomorrow."},

Or because the people are in the water with the dead whale it's eating. Even though I am not sure why none of the surfers saw the dead whale, I am managing to be terrified.We had two nice dives this morning, but the weather is changing (and we're old) so we're not diving tomorrow. Besides, we need to spend some time with the child and she has absolutely no interest in going diving.

{"title": "Gardening and Diving", "date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2017", "text": "Cruise ship days on an island are interesting times—and full of amusing sights. I love to cruise, but when we do, we rarely get off the ship unless it’s for a specific tour activity—never just to shop. Today I had a visual reminder of just why that is. So we were having breakfast on a little balcony across from the water when a catamaran full of cruise ship tourists pulled up to the beach. The last ones off were an American family of size (casting no stones here—the woman was my size, which is to say, Of Size) consisting of mother, father and an older teenage son. They got halfway up the beach before the first hawker nabbed them, trying to sell them a hammock. They deliberated a bit and then took a step backwards towards the boat and the water. Then a woman drifted over to them proffering an armload of jewelry. They took another step back. Then two large, determined-looking Caribbean women strode towards them from the road carrying bags of stuff, and the family fled back to the safety of the water next to the catamaran. There they huddled, waist-deep in the surf, holding the hawkers at bay. We left before the catamaran did so I don’t know if they ever got out of the water.On the way back to our condo I checked out the plants blooming and going to seed along the road. There was a mandevilla-looking thing that was just gorgeous, and also some kind of sweet pea that was the most beautiful blue I have seen in a flower. I also saw what looked like some variety of bleeding heart, and some big peachy hydrangea-like flowers with a big yellow star in the center. It's spring so no matter where I go, I can't stop thinking about gardening. I'd put the pictures here, but as exciting as they were, flowers don't stand up to sea life for interest.This afternoon we went to Sun Divers for a little diving refresher course (this is your regulator, this is your BCD, this is the signal for \"I'm out of air!\", this is the signal for \"Can I share your air?\", this is the signal for \"Screw you, I have good life insurance on you...\"). It really is just like riding a bicycle and it all came right back. After about 15 minutes of review underwater, we hopped on the boat, cruised out about two minutes from shore and had a great wall dive. We went down 65 feet and then worked our way slowly back up during the course of the 45 minute dive. I was kicking myself for not bringing my GoPro camera as we were really lucky and saw tons of fish from a large school of blue tang, to a barracuda, smooth trunkfish, queen parrotfish, damselfish galore, and more! I didn't actually see the barracuda, but Dave and our dive master did. The highlights for me were the hawkbill turtle, the peacock flounder, the sea horse, and the enormous green moray out swimming around. The pictures here are not mine, but they were taken by Sun Divers and are pretty much exactly what we saw--without the other divers in the scene. You can check it all out on their Facebook page. We didn't see the large hammerhead shark, a manta ray, the reef squid or the whale shark--all of which they have photographed on their dives in the last year and show up on Facebook--but maybe tomorrow!Tomorrow we're going out for a two-tank dive in the morning, and I hope we get a couple more dives in before we go. We both forgot how very much we enjoy diving and we'd like to make it an annual event. Jessie did not accompany us--getting her snorkeling is going to be challenging enough. She is not at all ready for scuba. Sadness.p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica}p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px}"},

I liked them even better on cool, cloudy days when there were fewer people. I dreamed of living on the beach when I grew up, and my biggest fantasy was living on my own island. I think if I were still young, footloose and fancy-free, I'd become a dive master/cocktail waitress and live here on Roatan. Something like I did in Steamboat Springs for a season. Ah the glorious twenties....Nope. I can't even write that last sentence with a straight face. My fifties are so much better than my twenties that it boggles my mind. I started to list all the ways that that assertion is true, but why dwell? I'm in paradise, I'm having an incredible time doing exactly what I want to do--there's no need to spend any time thinking about anything else.Today held a bit of sunning, a lot of sleeping, enjoying the environment around us, feeling the breeze, and eating and drinking whatever I wanted whenever I wanted (except lobster as it's apparently illegal now until July 1 when breeding season is over).I did almost fall into hyper-obsessive must-plan-everything-so-we'll-enjoy-the-vacation mode this morning. But when it became apparent that all of us would be completely happy doing nothing much for the next five days, I pencilled in a couple of activities and then let it go. Thanks to Dave, we did schedule a scuba refresher tomorrow afternoon followed by a quick boat dive, and then we'll probably go out again Wednesday morning for a two-tanker. Thursday we're going to Daniel Johnson's Sloth and Monkey Hangout and then Arch's Iguana and Marine Park. Did you see Zootopia? Do you remember the sloth in the DMV? We get to hold one! I'm so excited!! I am one!!!Okay, enough computer time. Back to vacaciones!"},

Does life get better than this? I'm not sure. There aren't even any mosquitos--even when we were in still air this evening on the walk back from the restaurant... Yup, that's it: Tempt fate. I just got two bites, zap zap.Dinner tonight was at a lovely Thai restaurant that has a blend of local ingredients and traditional Thai cuisine. The sunset photo at left was taken from our table on their deck. We had fresh papaya salad with fresh lime and hot peppers, and lobster pad thai and lobster panang--I even had Thai beer. The best though was the chili paste they served with the meal--traditional Thai recipe but they add a local hot pepper to the mix that kicks you on your butt. I'm going to see about getting some for seeds...Full moon over RoatanNow we're back in the condo, Jessie is studying Japanese (doesn't she get that it's vacation?) and Dave and I are on the deck. I hear leaves rustling, crickets, the occasional feral cat, the hum of someone's air conditioning unit, and some distant music too far away to be a nuisance. If I can't relax here, I can't relax anywhere. I have neither thought about the garden nor read email since this morning (and that was only email--it's been 24 hours since I've thought of the garden!) For the next six days I am going to sleep, dive, snorkel, visit the jungle canopy to commune with the monkeys, and trust that Stone's Throw, the dogs, and the cats are in Zaga's capable hands, and the garden is in Jay's.Our humble abode for the next six daysSpouse on a beach--better thansnakes on a plane!"},
{"title": "Spring Break Can Be Difficult For Our Family", "date": "Saturday, March 11, 2017", "text": "We are finally all tucked up in our hotel in Dallas resting before flying to Roatan Honduras tomorrow morning. We have left Stone's Throw in good hands--Zaga and Dan from next door are taking care of it and all the pets because she really, really didn't want them staying in boarding. We cancelled our reservation at the boarding place earlier in the week, and it's a good thing we did as catastrophe struck today.Baxter the spaniel is, at best guess, 14-16 years old. We have had him for 11 years, and he was rescued off the street a few months after Hurricane Katrina blew through New Orleans causing many there to flee their homes and relocate to Atlanta. It seems likely that Baxter's family was--for either Katrina or another reason--newly relocated to Atlanta and Baxter got out and got lost. We figure Katrina because the timing was right for the large influx of people and pets sent north by that tragedy. Also, when we first had him he would get out, go on walk-about, and have no idea how to get back home. We lost him for three days once when he slipped his collar and had no tags. We put up flyers al over the neighborhood and they were seen by neighbors of the people who took him in so we were able to reunite with him.So Baxter is old. He forgets where he should go to the bathroom, he wanders around aimlessly with a puzzled look on his face looking for something that he never finds until he finally goes to lie down. When he goes outside, about a quarter of the time when I go to let him in he just stares quizzically at the open door not quite sure what to do. He doesn't want to stay out, but he's forgotten how to come in. Today all the dogs were out in the front and I was going over the work the contractor is going to be doing on the garden and the pond while I'm gone next week. Dave had to run to the store to get some things so he hopped in the Leaf and started down the drive. The Leaf is perfectly silent, Baxter is mostly deaf, and that's not a good combination. Somehow Dave clipped Baxter with a tire. He didn't feel it so he didn't stop. Then Baxter started yipping and carrying on and I came running over to him. He sort of dragged himself/hopped from Dave's parking spot to the front porch just as I got there. I immediately called our vet, and though they have Saturday hours, they're only 15 minutes away, and it was an hour and a half before closing, they said they didn't have time to see him, and I should take him to the emergency vet. I guess I should say former vet...Fortunately there is a big, beautiful new emergency and specialty vet practice practically across the 2222 from us. They got him in quickly and determined he had a dislocated hip. I was offered three possibilities: 1) they could sedate him and put the hip back in and it would stay in, 2) they would put the hip back in and it would pop back out again--maybe not immediately, but eventually and then they'd have to do surgery, and 3) we could put him to sleep now. As frustrated as I get cleaning up the never-ending puddles and little piles, that's not what having a dog is about so #3 was off the table. At his age though, surgery is off the table too. I went through that with Jester, our deerhound, not too long after we got Baxter and I will not do it again. Sometimes it's best to just let go. We went with option one and crossed our fingers.They sedated him, put the hip back in, tied it up with a sling that he'll wear for the next month, and a couple of hours later we were able to bring him home. We got two sets of pain pills for him, and I got him settled in before beginning to pack for our trip. Thank heaven for Zaga--had it not been for her, we would either have had to cancel the vacation or put him to sleep. There's no way we could have boarded him. But it all came together, and we are going to rest and restore ourselves next week knowing everything at home is in great hands."},
{"title": "This Whole Story Could Have Ended Very Badly", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2017", "text": "Like every day for at least the past week, my life has been consumed with the new garden. Today was no different. It also included another run to Barton Springs Nursery to pick up the trees I had already bought, and to add to their number. Zaga took me in her truck again, and we had a wonderful, sunburned time at the nursery. The highlight of the day, however, came after we got home. Bobby, one of the main crew working at Stone's Throw for the past eight months or so, brought his drone and camera today to take pictures of the garden project from the air. He took some first thing in the morning, but they vanished. So when I got back from the nursery, he tried again. There ensued an unfortunate sequence of events involving wind, software updates, dying batteries, tripping over a wall, sending the controller flying into the underbrush, and watching in dismay as the drone flew over the tall cement wall surrounding the property across the street from us and vanished. This is property with a wall 8-18 feet tall all around it, a massive solid steel door/gate, security cameras on the wall, and an intercom out front.Bobby and I went over and used the call button on the intercom, but no one answered. We waited quite a while and tried several times to rouse someone with no success. So I left a note in the mailbox asking the people behind the wall to please contact me so I could retrieve and return the drone, and we trudged despondently back to the garden. As we entered, Devon (who has also been working for us through our contractor Jay for eight+ months) offered to scale the wall for Bobby to retrieve the drone. Bobby was so happy at the prospect of not leaving his drone there for the weekend and possibly forever that I said I would go too (to the property, not over the wall) in case the neighbor was home. That way I could meet him and explain why one of my workmen had climbed over his fence à la Beverly Hills Cop.Devon popped over the wall easily enough, and he found the drone, but the camera had fallen off. While he was standing in a tree on the other side of the wall looking over and explaining to us about the missing camera, the neighbor came rushing up asking him what he was doing in his yard. It is Texas, and I should have thought of guns and danger with a property so well fortified, but I didn't until I couldn't see Devon, I could just hear him and the property owner. So I went up to the door (eight feet tall, wider than a car, solid steel, on rollers with no handle on the outside) and I started banging on it asking the property owner to open the gate. He was reluctant--and I can see his point: a stranger in his yard after climbing the fence, a woman he doesn't know loudly banging on the door asking him to open up--but he finally let me in, Devon scampered off to find the camera, I introduced myself to David who doesn't seem to be a drug smuggler, a human trafficker, a coyote bringing people across the border to his compound in the middle of the night, or any of the other things another neighbor told me he was.Bobby and Devon went back to work, and David and I talked about remodeling, crazy neighbors, miniature dachshunds, city permits, rezoning, McCallum High School (his two daughters who are 16 and 17 just started there in January after attending private school up until now), and squirrels. I ended by getting David's phone number (the intercom doesn't work so if you want in, you have to call him). It was a good chat.  When I came out of the yard I realized that the gate had been closed behind us and I had been out of sight for a good long time in what had been portrayed as a dangerous compound (by another another neighbor). Bobby was clearly relieved to see me and told me that he and Devon had been just about to storm the castle looking for me.So while the garden project is fun, I have to say the best thing coming out of it is the people I get to work with every day. I just love them. To top it all off, Bobby's wife Haley got the early drone pictures off the camera and sent them to me tonight. What a great day!"},

I think I'll go firm up availability tomorrow so I can plan quantities and placement next week. I moved stone, cut 1/2 of a stone on the tile saw (before they guys wouldn't let me play anymore) and put down lots of spray paint marking the beds, ponds, and paths. Tomorrow will see us closer to completion--we'll at least have the first course of all the beds and the pond down so that they have a full week of work without me next week. The cedar will also be all chopped up and ready to mulch Monday. As I head to bed tonight, I leave you with a little slideshow of today's work."},

Today Zaga took me to two nurseries and I rhapsodized over the wonder native tree selection at one and the existence of beautiful mimosa borealis bushes at the other. And I came home with 15 more trees and shrubs... All were on my list, just maybe not so many of all.And speaking of the list, it is becoming a monster. I have now started saving pdfs of the pages of the plant database on my hard drive and linking to those pdfs in my plant list spreadsheet so I can continue to work on garden planning while we're in Honduras--with or without an Internet connection. I have about 167 plants on my list, and it doesn't even include the majority of the non-native but adapted fruit trees. It's also growing daily. The shot below shows the cultivation data for some of the plants in my cryptic code, and there are several more columns off to the right for nurseries where I have purchased them, what size I bought, and for how much. I hope it's going to be worth it to be able to use it as a design tool for the beds (which will be built tomorrow!!).Now I need to clean up the kitchen a bit and then spend some time with my husband.

It's 9:40 pm and I am still entering data into my spreadsheet about the plants I wish to put in the garden. Of course now \"the garden\" has expanded from the new garden to the entire garden. The previous owner of our home (unlike the first owner who designed and planted everything) was not much into gardening. He pretty much let it all go to hell so all that I have left of the original plants is a few crepe myrtles, red yuccas, some nandina, and a bit of phlox, jasmine, and English ivy. It might sound like a lot, but there are many virtually empty beds that I might as well fill now along with everything else!I had the landscape guys cut five more cedars today--all around 15 feet tall. These cedars were on the front (northeast corner) of the house and I am replacing them all with a variety of other native Texas trees and shrubs. Maybe if there is a gorgeous Anacacho orchid tree in front of the bathroom window instead of a straggly cedar, the contractors will be too busy looking at it to look in at me. A girl can dream.Goldenball Lead TreeThe stone didn't get delivered today, I am told first thing tomorrow morning along with four additional laborers--two stone masons and two general lifting and clearing help. I am going to spend the day out with them laying out the first course of all the beds and making changes to it as necessary. I'll also finalize the design of the pond. I was really happy with my pond in Atlanta except for the leaking liner in the bog pond part. I had originally thought to avoid that failure point by putting the bog pond inside the regular pond here, but the way the layout worked put it separate and behind. I think we'll be okay though as there is an old driveway in the spot where the bog pond will go that will provide a stable slab for it. I'm also not making it as deep so if I ever did have a leak and had to empty out all the rocks, it wouldn't be that big of a deal (menaing I can hire people to do it without breaking the bank or their backs). The other change in the design is that we're going to use a spray-on liner instead of sheet liner. Jay used it in a pond several years ago and it has been totally maintenance-free. There is a clear version available that I got all excited about thinking we could use it to fix the leaks in the stream in the backyard, but it only works if it stays full of water--we drain the stream in the winter. Of course I guess we don't have to drain it...I ended my work day with a trip to the Barton Springs Nursery where I bought all my native Texas plants 14 years ago. Their selection is even better now, and even though I was only planning an exploratory foray today, I ended up buying 10 trees. They were all on my list so I'm only jumping the gun a little bit. I didn't buy everything they had that was on my list even though they have just about everything I want. I was not only restrained (for me) because we're not ready to plant till the week after next, but because I need to decide on quantities for each type of plant now that I know they're available. In order to decide quantities, I need to get the final beds laid out and measure their area...Lyre Leaf SageOkay, math sideline here. When we were taking measurements of the bed layout to decide how much stone we needed to buy, we measured the perimeter of the beds because, well, the stone goes around the outside. It made sense to me thinking about it that the area for all the shapes with the same perimeter would be the same: If you take a roundish shape and pull it out into an oval it will be longer and narrower, but it seems like it should be the same area because the length of the outline didn't change. However I good I felt about my deduction, I had to run it past the spouse because I always check my math with him. Good thing I did because apparently the area changes. He started in about using calculus to prove it to me, but I thanked him and told him I needed to get back to bed planning and I would just take his word for it.Before I can figure out quantities of plants I need to be able to decide which ones are going where, which means I also need to finish my spreadsheet. It includes light requirements, size, bloom period and such. I have a feeling I am going to be spending a lot of time in Honduras next week working on this project. But back to today. In addition to the 10 trees I selected in person, I also ordered one very hard-to-find tree online from Vincent Gardens, and 23 packets of wildflower seeds, one bunch of wildflower roots, and one packet of grass seed from Native American Seeds.The 11 trees are:Guajillo Senegalia berlandieri, Berlandier acaciaAnacacho Orchid Tree Bauhinia lunaroidesDesert Willow Chilopsis linearisKidneywood Eysenhardtia texanaGoldenball Lead Tree Leucaena retusaMexican Plum Prunus mexicanaToothache Tree Zanthoxylum hirsutumArbequina Olive Tree Olea europaea var.

At any given time I had two books open (heavily papered with flags indicating desirables for the garden), and tabs for 16 websites up on my laptop so I could cross-reference availability, native status, and characteristics, and put it all into a spreadsheet. If only there was a place where all of this data could be put for easy querying and customized results! There actually is a place where it all lives, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service seems to have all the data one could ever want on North American plants, but I wasn't able to get any data out of it using their advanced query tool.  It is also limited on the number of rows it will return. If only data.world had this data! Maybe I can talk to someone there about getting it from the USDA...In the meantime, bed building begins tomorrow. I will take pictures. this is going to be a rough garden. It's Hill Country Native, not polished suburban flowerbeds. I'm very much looking forward to it! Tonight was the Travis County Beekeepers Association monthly meeting and we had a presentation on, you guessed it, native wildflowers for bee gardens. A very nice woman from the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center presented and made it very clear that I MUST attend the plant sale in April if I want my heart's desire.Glass, sheep, spinning, knitting, cooking, cleaning, laundry, bathing, have all been forgotten in my mad lust for garden planning--not the gardening mind you, just the planning.

{"title": "Half Measures? What Are Those?", "date": "Sunday, March 05, 2017", "text": "blackbrush acaciaTwo minutes ago I finished the list of all the native plants I plan to add to our garden--mostly this year. There are 121 ornamental trees, shrubs, grasses, perennials, groundcovers, annuals, and biennials--and that's before I add in the fruit trees, dye plants, bog plants, and favorite non-native species for bees and butterflies. Tomorrow I am going to start searching to see which of these plants are available commercially. The last time I looked for many of them was in 1998, right after we built our first house here in Austin. At that time, many of them weren't available. I am more optimistic about my chances of finding them this time because I am not just looking for plants, I am looking for seeds, and Native Seed Search and other companies like it are a great resource for native plant seeds. The Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center Annual Native Plant Sale is also coming up in April and I hope to find many desirable plants there.Today wasn't about plants, however. I finally oiled my great wheel and assembled it, and I unpacked all of my fleece from Wisconsin in preparation for my Master Spinner homework. Little by little I am working through projects I have going--some of which I started many years ago. Back to plants for a moment, today I went through my Master Gardener handouts and notes, and I sorted and organized them into my main Master gardener binder for easy reference. I did the Master Gardener program in 2002. It took me 15 years to sort the notes. But that's not as bad as it seems as we moved to Atlanta not long after I finished the program and was too busy building a life there to finish it up. But now I'm back gardening in Austin and it was the most natural thing in the world to organize those old materials.As is usual these days, I am now exhausted and must head to bed.

Sometimes it's good just to sleep. When I woke this morning I thought about the programming I saw on the science channel yesterday about the transgenetic goats whose DNA has had a gene from a spider inserted into it. The milk from the goats can be used to make dragline silk. You might ask, why not just farm the spiders? Apparently spiders are both territorial and cannibalistic, which cut way down on the silk production. Besides, goats are cuter than spiders. I wonder if Jessie would be afraid of a goat that's part spider as she is completely terrified of spiders. She said she wouldn't take care of goats if we got them here because it would mean going out at night when the tarantulas are out. Somehow I think going out to care for spider goats would be worse.When I woke and remembered the goat segment I was so excited to tell Dave about it, but he was all, \"Oh yeah, I saw that on the Internet.\" I was bummed because it's apparently old news, and I just now heard about it. Clearly I need to spend more time in different parts of the Internet. Parts where there is less Donald Trump and more transgenetic goats and dark matter (another segment on the show).Alternatively I could just get cable tv and watch the science channel, HGTV, the Travel channel, the Discovery channel, the History channel, or BBC America! But no. I think there's even more Trump on tv than there is on the Internet, and I don't need to pay to be bombarded with it (though Trevor Noah would be a treat). Oh, hey! Trevor Noah is also available on YouTube! Well, that solves that question. Now off to see Logan at the Alamo Drafthouse and hope to have water (new hotwater heaters being installed now and all water is off) when we get home."},

I didn't draw this plan--I have Haley to thank for that, but it is mine nonetheless. To make it, we walked the land together, I marked where the beds, paths, bench, swing, pond, bog pond and bridge (yes, bridge) were to go, Bobby measured the circumference of all the beds so the stone can be ordered for delivery next week, and Haley followed us and captured all the measurements and did the drawings. This may not look like the most professional landscaping plan you've ever seen, but it gets the job done, and the space is going to be incredible. As I look at it, I'm going to increase the size of the topmost right bed to three times its current size, and I'll probably up the size of the pond a bit too.The paper only shows the areas we are currently developing. And another 25% of the width to each side and that's the actual area. The bee hive area isn't shown but it runs along behind bed #4 on the left. Oh this is going to be a magnificent space! Dave doesn't think I can get it built before June... I'm planning on the beds and paths, and maybe even the pond and bog pond being in by the end of the month--mid-April tops. Using split-faced block to build the beds and a Bobcat to move the dirt will make all the difference in the world.Plant selection has also been going apace--though I'm not as concerned about getting the beds filled with plants as I am getting them filled with cardboard, manure, dirt and weedcloth. Plants will come in good time--they are much easier to add than beds. Now back to the books (see all the little red flags for plants to consider?)..."},
{"title": "Rabbit Holes and the Garden", "date": "Thursday, March 02, 2017", "text": "In the process of working on garden plans today, I fell down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out ways of reducing our water usage. I got started on it when I went to wash my hands and we had no water. Our well system is set up so that we can't run out of treated water without first finding out there's a problem because there is a reserve shut-off that activates when we get down to 800 gallons. We tripped the shut-off today and I panicked about our well having gone dry (or Timmy having fallen down it). Turned out that it was one of the hot water heaters failing and gushing water out into the garage that caused the water level to drop so precipitously. Two new hot water heaters are being installed Saturday even though only one failed today. Both of them were installed on the same day 16 years ago and I don't want to wait till the second one fails to replace it. Now the well is slowly filling the storage tanks back up and the RO system is cleaning .5 gallons of water and hour...Messing around with the system and talking with our system maintenance guy made me think about the reverse osmosis system again today, as often happens when I feel the need to fret about something, and I again felt the burning need to repurpose all the waste water from the system. Reverse osmosis is one of the most wasteful desalination methods possible in terms of both energy cost to process the water, and amount of water that comes out as waste in the process. For every gallon of drinkable water, 1 to 3 gallons flows out as waste, and my frugal Montana soul just shrivels. So I set to work to see if I could find something I could do.The first thing I stumbled upon was a passive solar distilling system that you could build yourself. It's relatively inexpensive, but it's also slow and not as efficient. I found a really cool solar-powered one in use in California called Aqua4 from WaterFX, but it's a slightly larger scale than I need, producing 1.6 billion gallons of freshwater each year.Then I stumbled upon a solar-powered home unit that was crowdfunded a couple of years ago and I missed out. Now I have to wait for one till they get them to market, and then I'll be able to go to zero waste for our water with all water processed by the second stage desalinator going to the gardens and the pond.

There are still some oak trees that need to have branches trimmed, but I am not going to do that until after June when oak wilt season is over. All the other trees and shrubs have either been selected to stay or removed. I didn't remove any oaks, but almost all the juniper cedars went as well as many mountain laurels and Texas persimmons. They are all nice plants, but over the past 20 years they have been let to grow wild and reseed wherever. I needed more room for bees, gardens, a pond, paths and other plants so they had to go.the garden from the center looking northTonight I luxuriated in scanning through my entire Native Texas Plants book by Wasowski and Wasowski. It was my favorite gardening book the last time we lived here and still holds many flags in the plant lists. As I went through it I reveled in having the space to put in pretty much anything I want from trees to groundcover.Tomorrow I plan to walk the garden with a bunch of rope (seagulls are in a flock, owls are in a parliament, crows are in a murder, but I have no idea what rope is gathered into and it is bugging me) that I will lay out where the beds will go so I can get an idea how much area I'm actually looking to plant. Since I decided to go with stone, I'm able to follow a more organic path with the shapes of the beds and contour to the existing topography and plants.the garden from the center looking southNot all of the garden will be planted this year--all evidence to the contrary I'm not INSANE--but the beds will all be constructed and filled while I have access to the labor, and trucks to haul soil, manure, and stone.Timing has been bad with all the travel I have been doing and I'm taking off for a week again in a week so I haven't been able to start plants from seeds. This year I plan to sow seed that can go directly into the garden and doesn't need to be started indoors. I will also buy some plants--especially the trees and ones that are too slow to grow from seed--but that's a more expensive route and I'm not in that much of a hurry for once.the garden from the north again,but this time just on the inside of the tree-lineI'm even redesigning the pond and bog pond layout so that the bog pond takes up a bigger area and can be used for extensive natural filtration for the pond. The bog pond I put in in Atlanta was not a good design because when it developed a leak in the liner, it would have been an enormous effort to take all the rock out of it to fix the liner. This one won't be deep. Instead it will be bigger horizontally so the water flows through a lot more plant roots and bacterially-rich river rock before flowing back to the pond. As a special treat, tomorrow afternoon I am going to run by the water garden store as I will be out in that area anyway."},

It's only Tuesday, it feels like it's been days since the week started, and I keep doing the same things over and over again. If I go back to my post on Sunday, I was gleefully defiant about not getting to the taxes or packing up glass orders to go out the door. But then I washed, rinsed, and repeated the not-getting-to's yesterday, and again today. For glass, it's not that I'm not firing, I just can't complete. I still haven't been able to get the orders I planned to ship the middle of last week shipped. Between pieces needing to be redone, kilns erroring out and not firing, and new orders coming in which need to be added to the glass I'm sending to Todd, it feels like I'm never going to get it all in the mail and out of the studio. I'm not even going to get to ship the glass to Todd tomorrow because I still have one more firing to do in the sequence before it's ready. At least I should be able to get an order out that's going straight to a gallery instead of via Todd.Tonight after dinner I finally got all my business accounts reconciled from last year. I still haven't done the personal accounts so I don't know if there are transactions I put on the personal credit card or paid for out of the personal checking that I should be deducting for the business, but at this point it's hard to care. Personal taxes next. God help me.While I am having completion anxiety, the guys working in the garden are kicking butt. They brought in the chipper/shredder today, and with one more day at it, they'll have three piles of mulch and a pile of cedar logs for me. Then it'll be time to build the beds. In an interesting turn of events, it turns out to be cheaper, more durable, faster, and less maintenance--as well as better looking--to do the bed walls in stone (decorative concrete block) rather than wood.Some day soon I hope to be able to get to choosing plants, checking on bee delivery dates, putting together the flow hive, and building/buying a Top Bar hive. Then maybe washing fleece and starting my homework for the Master Spinner level 1 class, putting up the new studio website, contacting all my galleries about this spring's orders, and a dozen other projects that I have in mid-flow.I really am trying to be okay with not getting everything done Now!

Man, am I getting old!Today was supposed (again) to be all about the taxes... and again, I failed. I did get another glass order and loaded about half of it in the kiln. I even worked out the price increase for work this year to cover Bullseye's glass price increase and my new shipping costs because I have to ship all the glass for the work I do with Todd to Atlanta so Todd can do his thing with it and ship it on to the customer. I also got the new website to the brink of being done (enough) and up, and I have every confidence I will scale that summit tomorrow.Today was also all about the new garden and finishing the last clearing of the undergrowth. Tomorrow the chipper shredder arrives and then we're really going to have some fun! Well, I'm not as I'm not going to be anywhere near the chipper shredder. But I am very much looking forward to turning an enormous brush pile into an enormous mulch pile. Then we spec out the place for the pond with it's built-in bog pond, and bee hives, and begin building beds! I decided against doing a plan. I'm not really a plan kind of gal. I'm going to let the land tell me what it wants and what's appropriate, rather than imposing a layout determined by a drawing on paper. It'll be much easier to take a list of everything I want to fit into that space out there and start staking it off based on the trees, shrubs, cactus, and rocky outcroppings that are left, rather than try to put it all down on paper. If I had a flat field in Iowa, paper would be find. But the Texas Hill Country resists paper plans.Now I'm going to take my droopy little self off to bed and, like the phoenix, rise anew tomorrow to take on my day."},

The mechanics of the post reflect my scattered processes all day. I managed (with Dave's help) to get the Christmas lights down today. I managed to get the cotton carpet warp I ordered some months ago unpacked, inventoried and arranged. I spent far too much time making a Word doc with all the colors of cotton carpet warp available through Great Northern weaving. It ended up being a fruitless endeavor as the printouts--which I was trying to use to reconcile the inventory--didn't have nearly the color quality necessary to distinguish red from cranberry, pear from tan, or a host of other color distinctions. It's better to just load their webpage on the laptop and work from it. Anyway, it's pretty, it's functional, and it's not in direct sunlight ever so it won't fade. It's also carpet warp so it doesn't really matter is it does fade.The rest of the day? Not so productive. At this point I could continue on with all the things I meant to do today and didn't get to, but who cares? I am certainly not going to be bothered by it. I made progress, and that's enough. Tonight I get to drink white wine, eat chicken tenders, and watch the Oscars on the same screen where I saw some of the nominated movies.

Today reinforced this reality with another glass order coming in, and the arrival of the box of raw sheep fleece and other miscellany from my spinning class in Wisconsin the week before last. I haven't opened it yet as I'm not quite sure where to put all the stinky fleece! Guess I'll have to wash it all next week and then I can store it with the rest of my clean fiber (all 200+ lbs of it--the rest of the clean fiber, not the new...). In addition to the wool I got from my class and the additional raw samples I bought, I also have some raw Gotland (real Lord of the Rings fleece from the same farm that raised the sheep whose wool was used in the middle earth cloaks) coming from a friend in Atlanta, and a whole, fresh, raw BFL (Blue-Faced Leicester)/ Cormo cross coming from a friend outside Atlanta. She just sheared the sheep, and I am using just about the whole thing for my homework.Today, in preparation for doing things, I organized! Most of my time was spent in the textile studio (I found my sewing machine foot pedal and power cord so I can make Dave shirts again), but I also worked on my desk and a bit in the wood shop under the master bedroom. I even took time to go down to San Marcos to pick up the child from an art competition (she got a gold medal) and then we went to see the Lego Batman movie. Tomorrow will be more of the same with some time in the glass studio to make the new order and play around with the whorls for the spindles I am going to be doing with Scott. I do need to do a bit of housework--floors and bathrooms--and I promised myself time planning the plants for the garden... Sounds like I am already out of time so I might as well not think of anything more. It's a good life."},
{"title": "The Garden Gets Cleared", "date": "Friday, February 24, 2017", "text": "Right front of new garden areaWe are now three days into clearing the thicket from the area that will be the garden. It's about half and acre and is composed of a big gravel area in the middle where a greenhouse used to be, a poured aggregate driveway, a well house, and a bunch of scrub land. It's bounded by the main street, our neighbor's driveway, our driveway, and the shared driveway for us and our other neighbors. I thought it would be a lot more open after clearing everything out, but I'm not going to take healthy oaks, and there were more of them than I thought there were. But that's okay: the oaks provide shady areas in which to put benches, bits of art, sculpture, fountains, etc.Left front of new garden areaThe only bad thing is that I was planning on putting 4 ft by 8 ft vertical panels made of 4-gauge wire staggered across the front of the property on the main road to serve as privacy screens and supports for the espaliered fruit trees and passionfruit vines. But there are so many oaks left out there that the trees won't grow on the south side of the panels--too shady. I could put them on the street side, but that would be facing north which is bad for light in summer and winds and cold in winter. I'll figure it out. Maybe I'll put up a fence along the front similar to the one that fronts our main yard along the private drive. It's the same wire either way, just put horizontally instead of vertically. Then I could save the vertical panels for screening in the middle of the garden--make it so you have to walk all the way in to see everything. Yeah, I like that.Fence by the front lawnI ordered several books earlier this week on growing plants for natural dyes. Many of them can be sown directly into the garden and will yield a good dye crop the first year. I didn't get much more than a quick glance through one of them during lunch today, but it was enough to make me drool. Tomorrow, a longer perusal leading into a shopping list and actually ordering seeds so I'll be ready to plant when the beds go in week after next."},
{"title": "Keeping My Sanity ", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2017", "text": "Breakfast--cheddar cheese pasty, sausage roll, and chai latte--at the Brentwood Social House, my Austin favorite morning hangout for the days I take J to school. Today I need to work on financial administration and taxes, and this is a great distraction-free place to do it... though I guess posting counts as a distraction. But I'm waiting for transactions to download so I have a couple of minutes.It's the end of February, close enough to March that I can say I made my prediction for the year just about perfectly. Back in December, during the sleeping months, I made grand plans for all the things I was going to do this year--restart the Master's program in ikebana; start the master's program in handspinning; revamp my business model and website; spin for 15 minutes a day; set-up my new glass studio; continue remodeling the new house; put in major gardens, a pond and bees; do a knit-along; take a drawing class; pick-up a pottery class again; renovate the apartment above the garage and set it up for renting through Homeaway or AirBnB; blog every day; and do the 365 project and submit a picture every day. Now I sit in the BSH listening to Wagonwheel performed by the Old Crow Medicine Show, and I laugh at myself. As expected, the train rattled out of the station in January, and now it's hurtling toward certain destruction if it keeps going as it is. Normally this would be the point where I would throw my hands up in the air and just give up on a bunch of stuff (and that was my prediction for the year: hurtling into fiery oblivion). Or I would try to make unrealistic life changes to keep everything.In past years about this time, instead of giving up on activities, I have vowed to give up on sleep--if I started earlier in the day and finished later at night I could get everything done. But there are two flaws with that idea. First, it doesn't take into account the need for family downtime, and second, it's stupid. This year I'm going to try something else. I'm going to keep all the activities, but I'm not going to keep the amount of them I have to do--in fact the concept of _have_ to do for any of them . Drawing and pottery (which starts in a month) have set times each week and I know from past experience I can manage two classes a week. The knit-along ends just as pottery begins so that will take care of that one. I might not finish the homework for the Master Spinner's class in time to take the second class in April as a distance learning class and the third class at Old's College in Alberta in June (there is anywhere from 150-250 hours of homework for each). It might actually take me six years to complete, and that's okay. I can continue ikebana if I set a day for it, like Sunday, when J and I can do it together, and we each do one arrangement. For the rest, they won't get done in one pass. It'll take as long as it takes to get them done.Yesterday I spent enough time in the studio to clean up and organize three working areas and get a kiln load in. I left those areas still clean when I finished so next time I can work on another area. I don't need to get the studio or the apartment set up in one balls-out day. I don't need to get anything done in one pass. Pick it up, work on it for awhile, put it down without guilt, and move on. The hardest thing, as I was reminded anew yesterday, is just starting. Take away the balk at the beginning, the inertia, and the tasks themselves are easy. Take away the need for a deadline and the stress and guilt are gone with just the joy remaining.Now my accounts have updated and it's time to reconcile shit. Rock me mama. (PS--Just found out the great music this morning is from the Jason Isbell station on Spotify: Townes Van Zandt \"Dollar Bill Blues\", Jason Isbell \"24 Frames\", Old Cow Medicine Show \"Wagonwheel\". It just made my favorite stations list!)"},

When I touched base with the contractors this morning and found out they wouldn't be coming today, I'll admit I was giddily relieved. I was less sanguine at 8:30 when I remembered that I had a drawing class at 9:30 and I was barely out of bed. But I made it to class and had my first lesson in shading. It was a beautiful day today, and when I arrived on campus for class I looked up to see all of the peafowl roosting in the live oak outside of my classroom. No one had noticed them before I spotted them and stopped to take pictures. Just goes to show, people don't look up.After class I headed to Jerry's Artarama to pick up a new sketchbook (mine went missing in the the last studio move from Atlanta) and some other supplies. On the way I stopped and picked up Jessie from school and took her for a quick McDonald's lunch. Amazingly enough I was able to meet her in the office at school, go through the McD drive-through, shop at Jerry's, and have her back at school in time for her next class 30 minutes later. It was some quality mother-daughter time, McNuggets and all.When I got home I tackled organizing the gardening books. I have loosely grouped them before, but I never separated them and shelved them by categories. It was a good exercise for finding duplicates, of which there were a handful, and it helps me gear up for the upcoming garden creation marathon. Although I am having doubts about starting it. This may very well be the last really big garden project I undertake. So do I just continue with my current plan of raised beds, trellis, pond, benches and beehives, and scattered benches and places for sculpture, or do I hold off for another year? I could put just the beehives in now--they can always be moved. Then I could spend the rest of the year going through all the garden design books I have been collected and creating a design based on all the things I've always wanted to do. I know that gardens change over time, but the fundamental architecture, the bones that you initially lay out provide the framework for the growth of the garden. If you don't get the bones right, you can stunt it with a bad design. Of course that's not the end of the world as nothing living and growing is permanent, but I feel a bout of cold feet coming on. And I need to consider the needs of the peacocks in the design too (I am hoping that was some quality husband-scaring). Whether I go forward with the full thing now or wait, tomorrow the guys will be here to clear out overgrown brush and thin out scruffy juniper cedar and low thicket. Then I'll be able to see what I have in order to better make a decision."},
{"title": "Leaving Wisconsin", "date": "Monday, February 20, 2017", "text": "What a tightly packed slice of life a five-day event like the Master Spinner class is! You laugh, you cry, you get frustrated when you don't get it, you get exhilarated when the lightbulb goes off. If you're lucky, you make new best friends. At worst, there are people you are glad to be well shot of, and because it's only five days you get to do that fairly quickly. We had three strong alpha personalities in our class, and at time there was friction. But I think we all got out with goodwill intact. Out of the rest of the class, nine are definitely taking the level two class together again next spring, one is definitely not, and two are on the fence. I am one of the on-the-fence ones as I wasn't planning to wait that long to take it, and, besides, Wisconsin in February isn't always 70 degree days...But that's the next level. For this level I have a full fleece to process. After it's processed (skirted, soaked, scoured and dried), I have to spin woolen and worsted skeins from the legs, shoulders, sides, back, britch and belly, make a finished (woven, crocheted or knitted) sample from each skein (12 in all), and write a detailed description of the look and feel of each part of the fleece indicating what it would be good for.The other big portion of the homework is the breed study. We are to collect raw fleece samples from ten different breeds of sheep (and the instructor and some local members of the class mostly supplied those), scour them, prepare them for spinning (card, flick, or tease), spin both woolen and worsted skeins from them, and prepare a finished sample (crocheted, knit, or woven). The physical spinning and prep is one thing, but because this is a college-level course, there is also a lot of writing. We need to write descriptions of the sheep, the fleece, and an evaluation of the yarn this particular fiber would be appropriate for.There are also natural dyeing exercises, blending wool with tussah and bombyx silk, the usage of different spinning equipment, alternative fiber prep methods, and more on alternative spinning techniques. And of course write-ups on all of it. At the end of the level is the final project. It begins with pairing an appropriate type of fleece with a pattern or design, and then executing every step of the project all the way through the finish. The fleece is scoured, prepared for spinning, and spun. At some point, either the fiber, the yarn or the finished piece is dyed in natural dyes (which we are to source--maybe collect--ourselves), and the yarn is crocheted, knitted or woven into a finished piece. Of course there is a written report that needs to accompany the project with a justification for all of the choices made and --pluses and minuses. I'm thinking I'll use my sock knitter to make a pair of hand-dyed, handspun wool socks.All of these projects required a bunch of material, and I am very grateful to Ingrid of Spry Whimsy for shipping my great, big, bow of stuff to me tomorrow. I love you Ingrid!!For tonight, I sit at O'Hare airport waiting to board my flight to Austin. Taxes and glass await me there. And sleep. In my own bed. With my spouse. Heaven."},

All I could think of was the Kliban cartoon, Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head. They were all kinds of ooey, gooey delicious, and I'm both astonished and not at all surprised that  there were still a couple left at the end of the day. I wish I'd put something into the box to show scale. but that dollop of Bavarian cream in the one on the top is a about the size of a quarter. Besides the great pastry, we have also been enjoying unseasonably warm weather here in lovely Northern Wisconsin. I'm so glad I missed cold and snow on this trip! I'm also glad, at the end of the day, that I am not doing the Philadelphia show this year. It has not been a wasted trip for business either--Scott Snyder of Snyder Spindles is in my class, and we are going to make some spindles together out of glass and wood. I have a new collaboration partner! Scott works in both wood and 3-D printed material, and we are going to do some fused glass whorls from my cut circles, and I am also going to cast some of his 3-D-printed whorls in glass. The cast glass will have a better weight and feel than the plastic will, and by doing both styles we each get to do some design work. Now for all of you anxiously waiting to hear: I aced my test- with 100%. I think most of us got 100%--it really wasn't a difficult test. Even the people who missed answers did it more out of misunderstanding the question rather than not knowing the correct answer.But the test wasn't the big part of the day. Nope, the highlight of the day was collecting our wool samples from the natural dye day yesterday. As I sat down to write this tonight I realized that I don't even know all the dyes we used! There are twelve of us in the class, and we paired up to do a total of six dyes. Char and I did madder root (shown on the bottom row of the rack), Scott and Suzanne did cochineal, but I have no idea what everyone else did. I'll find out tomorrow. What I do know is that we didn't just use the dye plant, we also played around with mordants which changed the resulting colors of our dyes. We did one batch of the straight color, one set of yarn that had been soaked in alum (and water), a batch that was not soaked in alum but which had iron added to the dye bath at the end, and a batch that had been soaked in alum and also had iron added to it at the end. Can you see how complicated it was and why it got so crazy yesterday? Each of the 12 of us had 24 skeins to be dyed--four skeins from each person to dye four different ways. We are all sharing our recipes (what we used, how we used it, at what temperature, and for how long) with Ingrid (the owner of the shop and our host who is also finishing up the sixth level project project for her master's), and she will type it all up and distribute it to us. For now l am enjoying just fondling the different colors. I can see how dyeing is bad for a craft-addictive personality (know anyone like that?). One more day and tomorrow night I sleep in my own bed."},

Had this day been at the end, we probably would have all gone home hating each other and swearing we would NEVER do another class together. Had it been at the beginning, we never would have come back after the first day. I won't go into detail on what made it difficult, but it boiled down to a need for extreme detail and organization in process from a herd of cats (not the most data-driven animals).Tomorrow we start the day with a test on all the material we have covered so far. I think I'll take donuts to class. There is an incredible bakery just down the street from Spry Whimsy (the shop where our class is being held). Fortunately the test is only 4.2% of our grade for Level One (20 points out of a possible 473), and we only need to get a 70% (331 points) on everything to pass the class. I say fortunately, because I just read the book for the first time tonight, and I am still so tired I'm not sure how much I absorbed. Tonight, the same as every night, we went out for dinner. Tonight's location was the Viking Brew Pub (which comes complete with a viking longship in the middle of the room). When we got back to the hotel, I sat on the side of the hot tub with a glass of wine and quizzed one of my classmates (who was in the hot tub--I didn't bring a suit) on the material in the book. I wish we'd had a hot tub when I was in grad school--phonetics might have made more sense then. Now for a decent night's sleep and no test anxiety..."},

Today we didn't spin at all, but we reviewed the terminology we learned yesterday, we finished preparing our skeins for dyeing tomorrow, and we divided up the raw fleece for our breed study... It was like sale day at Filene's Basement. The fleece would hit the table, we would pretend to care about laying it out again, but really we were just waiting for the \"go\" signal to grab our chunks for the breed study. Most of the fleeces were cleaned off the table faster than a cheetah goes through a gazelle carcass.For the breed study we are to prepare (wash and card) enough fleece to spin two ten-yard samples--one spun woolen and one spun worsted--for ten different breeds of sheep. Mary, our instructor, brought enough different breed fleeces (supplemented by some of the class participants) that we don't have to go looking for other fleeces to complete this part of the homework. We also had some lovely fleece we could purchase and I ended up with 1/2 of a lovely dark Coopworth fleece, some Rambouillet and either some Icelandic or some Finn.Tonight after class we took a field trip to Susan's Fiber Shop run by Sue McFarland. It was so funny because when we walked in I knew it was Susan's shop, but I didn't know it was Susan McFarland. For the past few years, whenever I open YouTube it loads on the video below. I was very excited to meet her in person and to see her incredible Teeswater sheep. I didn't buy a fleece from her (yet), but it was a close-run thing. I probably got 1/2 a fleece worth as I bought two lbs of raw for my breed study and fun, and another 12 oz of washed locks. This sheep has lustrous curly locks from 6-9\" long. I have wanted to do a jacket or a vest with a collar and border of longwool locks for awhile, and Sue's Teeswater is just gorgeous. I still would like a Wensleydale fleece, but I have enough room in my favorites for Teeswater too. The scarf shown at left is from a Wensleydale, the Teeswater sheep are white (shown on the hoof above). They remind me of Suri alpaca---which I haven't worked with at all."},

I even have tests with the first one on Sunday! It's very exciting. It's also somewhat exhausting--and a good part of that is because the women in my class, the host and the teacher are all party animals and I'm having trouble keeping up. There are men in the class too, but they haven't partied with us yet.Today was the first day of the five-day classroom portion of the course, and we spent a good bit of time looking at sheep fleeces and learning about the characteristics of wool from different kinds of sheep. We looked at fleeces from both purebreds and crosses, light, dark, fine, medium, long locks, tight crimp, primitive, and everything in between. We also spun and plied yarn, learning about balance and the directions of the twist in yarn and how to correct the twist in our spun yarn. We even analyzed our wheels to figure out the ratios we get using them--one treadle with the band on this drive wheel is 11 revolutions (11 times the yarn twists) of the flyer. We will use this knowledge to put specific amounts of twist in the yarn we make... that's the theory at least. I'll write more later (probably more than anyone else wants to read), but tonight I'm pooped and heading off to sleep. G'Night!"},

Not", "date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2017", "text": "Following a pattern established over the past 12 years, it's mid-winter and I'm at the airport waiting to travel. Oh some years I've driven and one year I took the train, but lucky years I flew. Dee is also at the airport--Atlanta, not Austin--as she is also flying today. But this year is the first time she is flying to Phillie for The Show, and I am not. Do I miss it? Not now. Not yet. Maybe by Friday night or Saturday I would if I were home in Austin reading about everyone's adventures, great sales, fabulous meals, fun reunions, and scrumptious food from the Reading Market. But come Saturday, I will be in mid Master Spinning Level One class spinning and dyeing and making new friends.I'm also looking forward to trying something new to replace shows--repping. If I pay 15% commission to have a rep who will make sales on my behalf, my break even point for cost of shows versus cost of rep is about $45,000. That's more than I've ever made from a show. Additionally I don't have to travel, I have no exhausting set-up and breakdown, and I don't lose 2-3 weeks of studio time getting ready for the show, doing the show, and recovering from the show. I don't see my show friends, but at almost 56 years old, I am willing to give up some shared time if it means not having my body beat to sugar physically and being mentally and emotionally burned out from the show.Of course success with the rep model requires a good rep, and I have found one--if she follows through with her idea to do it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. In the meantime I am still working on my website (it and taxes feel like never-ending tasks) and planning to email my current customers today to let them know I won't be at the show, but that Todd and I do have new work so to save a spot in their orders.Now it's time to board. Off to a new adventure in life, and a new chapter in glass."},

I am sorely tempted to adopt peafowl, but I haven't run it past the spouse yet...Tomorrow I head up to Wisconsin for the first of the Master Spinning classes I am taking through Olds College in Alberta Canada. The first few sessions are taught both on Olds campus in June during Fiber Week and also as distance learning at various times of the year and parts of the country. I was hoping for Palm Beach in February, but luck of the draw got me Wisconsin. If all goes as planned I will not wait till next year for the second class, but will take it in Alberta in June. There are six classes in all with 30 hours of in-class work and another 125-175 hours of homework (sent in for grading upon completion) for each one.I have not yet packed, but it's Valentines Day and I have better things to do. One of those better things was the dinner the spouse made as my Valentines present: caviar on sour cream and Ritz crackers with Perrier Jouet champagne for an appetizer, followed by sous vided double lobster tails served in shell, and sous vided and seared beef filet with Bernaise sauce accompanied by cheese grits. We ended with chocolate cake and I am stuffed!!Now it's late, and tomorrow will come too soon so I'm signing off. Besides, there is still more Valentines Day to celebrate."},
{"title": "'Twas the Night Before Valentine's Day...", "date": "Monday, February 13, 2017", "text": "I think I mentioned earlier in the school year that parents were asked to adopt a teacher and be his or her secret pal for the year. I started with one, then two, then five... and ended up with eight secret pals. Tomorrow being Valentine's Day, I made up little goodie bags for my teachers which I will drop off at school tomorrow morning when I take J in. I have drawing class tomorrow so I'll give her a ride to school, and then after class I am going in to get TSA approved flight status so I can always go through the TSA Pre-check line. The last three times I have had to go through security in Austin I have practically been cavity searched--even when I wasn't flying and was just walking J to her gate. I have been _thoroughly_ patted down several times while the entire line behind me was held up, and that's more excitement than I need at this point in my life.Also tomorrow, the crew comes to start clearing the brush and weeds out of the the area where the beehives, raised beds, espaliered fruit trees, benches, pond, passionfruit pergola, and new water storage tank are going. It'll probably take till June to get it all done, but we'll have a good bit done by the end of March. The water storage tank is part of the revamped rainwater collection system with grey water addition. I'm very excited to add grey water processing to to the systems of the house. Right now we have two 30 year-old 1,000 gallon rainwater tanks that collect from all the rain gutters. However a rough calculation today tells me that we get about 2,400 gallons of water off the roof every time we get an inch of water. Austin gets an average of 35 inches of rain per year. It would sure be nice to be able to use all that collected rainwater to water the new gardens and top off the pond... Enter the new storage tank. I am looking at a 10,000 gallon tank that will go up by our well house. The location means we will need to pump the water uphill from the current collection tanks, but then it will be accessible for gravity feed to anywhere in the yard and the new garden. I need to figure out the costs associated with the pumping, filtering, and storage in the large tank, but I think it only makes sense to keep as much water as we can for irrigation and other non-potable needs.The grey water system will only come off of the master bathroom as the rest of the plumbing is already in the concrete foundation and would be too much of a hassle to change. But we are already remodeling the master bath this year, and part of the project will be to jackhammer up parts of the floor to move some of the plumbing. It will be an excellent time to divert all the water from the sinks, tub and shower from the septic field to a grey water system. The first stage will be for the water coming out of the bathroom (through a pipe straight through the wall) to flow through a basket of mulch. Then it will flow through a series of contained wetlands where the water will be filtered--much like in the bog pond at our Atlanta house. When the water comes out after filtration, it will be stored in a tank before being used for more garden irrigation.I can feel myself rambling tonight so I'm going to cut this post short and come back to the garden plan at a later date."},
{"title": "Once More Into the Organizational Breach!", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2017", "text": "Another day spent bringing the house to heel. I started with the utility room again because I just couldn't let it beat me another day. Three separate times I thought of something that tried to pull me away, but I stayed strong. Well, I stayed strong for the first two. By the third I decided I had better act upon them or I would forget them because I couldn't keep three things in the front of my mind. Distractions notwithstanding, I did get the gift wrap area done today (shown at right), if not the rest of the counters (shown below).We also tried a housecleaning system today that brought to mind one of my grandmother Jessie's stories about her early married life. She and Grampa Pete (Cecil, but everyone called him Pete but me--I called him Grampa or Grumpy, which he wasn't) lived in Alexandria Virginia, and they both worked for the government in Washington DC. It was the late 1930's, and on Friday night when they got off work they would go home and quickly clean their house together before having friends over or going out for the evening. I have a wonderful series of pictures of them with another couple on one such evening in their house. The pictures are simple: two happy couples talking, posing, drinking, laughing, enjoying their evening. It's hard to believe they were taken 80 years ago.But back to the system. Today we tried working through the house together in series: First I went through picking things up off all the surfaces and putting them away, Jessie followed behind me with the Swiffer hand duster and dusted all the surfaces. Then Dave followed her with the vacuum--cleverly getting up everything she dusted onto the floor--and moving all the furniture out of the way to vacuum underneath it. I fell into the back of the line and finished with mopping the floor--including under the furniture Dave moved out--and putting the furniture back in place. It was a great and highly efficient system--even with a slightly balky teenager at the head of the line.Now my spouse and I sip well-deserved glasses of sauvignon blanc in reward (a toast!) and listen to \"All That We Let In\" by the Indigo Girls. He is making chicken biryani, raita and nan for dinner, and we have two slices of lilikoi (if you're in Hawaii it's lilikoi, if you're mainland it's passionfruit) cheesecake for dessert. Two slices is okay because it's not Jessie's thing and it was a gift--thank you Lenny the Fish! Haven't decided what we'll watch tonight. I'm in the mood for Kill Bill, and Jessie doesn't like Tarantino's films. Come to think of it, Pulp Fiction would be a good choice too...______________Dinner and he movie are long over. Cheesecake was YUMMY! The Sprout's tender sensibilities were not up for anything dark and grim so we rewatched Grosse Pointe Blank. It's been 21 years since it came out and it has held up incredibly well from the direction to the acting to the music. I spent the movie knitting a cotton dishcloth for Dave with a cat in my lap. Got it half done (the dishcloth, not the cat), and will finish it tomorrow. My mother and MIL both made these dishcloths for us in the past, and they're so great that they're the only ones we use. But time has passed, we have lost a few to the garbage disposal, and the rest are pretty uniformly grey and ratty. Fortunately I have my mom's stash of spooled cotton for knitting them, and everything (including the pattern for them) is available on the Internet so I decided it was time to learn to make them myself.Now it's time to go to bed to join my dulcetly snoring spouse. I leave you with the Violent Femmes (from the aforementioned movie)."},

Jessie is holed up in her room eating McDonald's, Dave is plugged into his laptop, and I am in between cleaning tasks. I made good progress today on the laundry and straightening the utility room but there is always more to be done.Earlier, while in über organization mode, I came upon this little gem of an idea on the web--a wall shelf with cutouts to hold dog dishes! Gallifrey has an elevated feeding station, but I have never set anything up for the other dogs because they're short. They can eat on the floor. But they scatter food and water that turns into muck all over the floor, and it's more difficult to clean up because the dishes are sitting in it. With this ingenious shelf, the dishes can be at any custom height, and off the floor at the same time. The page I found the idea on had lots of other ideas for hanging pet stations including the one below on an Elfa shelf--perfect for the growing dog (would be excellent for a wolfhound puppy!). Jessie doesn't like the dishes all the way down flush with the top of the shelf as it's harder for her to get them out so I might put in a little platform on the underside of the shelf to hold the rims of the dishes up about a half an inch from the top of the shelf. Alternatively I could use some of the boatload of Elfa I moved from Atlanta.Besides cleaning today, the spouse and I took in a matinee of \"XXX: The Return of Xander Cage\". I undestand it was not popular and I can see why many people wouldn't like it, but I loved it! I really, really liked the supporting cast of characters they assembled for this one. Yeah, the dialog wasn't so great. Yeah, the direction and the acting in many of the spoken scenes was not good. But, hey, great action scenes! Lots of gratuitous stupid stunts, and a little bit of Samuel L. What more can you ask for?Then we hit up the Container Store for some wire baskets to hold dirty laundry on the utility cart shelves in the utility/laundry room. Saturday afternoon in the Container Store at the end of the annual Elfa sale... Yeah, nowhere you want to be. Dave fled to the car to wait while I finished having a hanging rod for a closet cut down (they gave me a pager to shop while I waited...) and then I joined one of two excruciatingly long lines at checkout. Seriously, two lines!Now I end the post with another YouTube classic from _1973_ (and just think, I might get to see them live on June 18!)."},

I am so glad I (almost) no longer have to deal with them that I could dance for joy. My interactions with their business licensing division, their water and sewer department, and their department of labor have been frankly horrific. The latest--and I hope last--in a long string of brain-dead workers slogging through painfully inefficient, out-dated, and blatantly corrupt processes told me today that in order to get the credit I have on our house water bill refunded to me, I not only have to request it, but I also have to show proof of payment. Um, it's my account, in my name, it's closed, and there is a credit. Why would you need proof of the specific payment that caused the credit? Isn't the fact that the credit exists proof enough that a payment was made? No, no it's not. The gentleman on the phone couldn't tell me why I needed to provide a copy of the front and back of the cancelled check other than they needed \"proof of payment\", \"it's the city's policy\". Since the overpayment was caused by the title company overwithholding funds to pay the water bill at closing, I don't have a cancelled check and have to get the title company to provide me with a copy of their check. I hope they have one, though in these days of electronic payments I am not overly confident.Not that Austin is perfect. I am still waiting on the inspection of my solar installation that was supposed to happen a week ago so we can go live (which rhymes with hive) on the system and soak up the sun (literally). But the city has a backlog of inspections to do and they're short-staffed. I swear the older I get, the more time I need to spend on home management. In June of last year Bank of America had a data breach, and Dave's name and social security number in conjunction with the studio address were compromised. Someone took out a merchant account with Bank of America card services for the business of Griffith Plumbing owned by Dave Griffith at the studio address and racked up $1,443 of fraudulent charges against two people's credit cards. By the time I found out about it, Bank of America security had already marked the account as fraudulent and closed it, and they let me know we were not responsible for the chargebacks that resulted from the fraudulent charges. That's great, but then last week I got a form 1099-k from them showing the $1,443 as income for us that they reported to the IRS... WTF. We're not now paying TAXES on the money someone else got from stealing Dave's identity!But at least I did a couple of fun things today: I had lunch with the spouse, played on the Oculus Rift system in data.world's office for 45 minutes, and mermaided my hair again. And now it's time to down tools for the day!"},

Whatever the case, I enjoy a chai latte and a cheddar cheese pasty at the Brentwood Social House and gather myself for the next great adventure(s). As I sat collapsed on the sectional last night, Dave brought up the subject of the bathroom remodel--the Last Great (indoor) Endeavor on the house. He thought it might be a good idea to have it done while we're in Montana this summer. Hah. Even with contractors I love (and I adore Jay and his crew), I am never leaving a remodeling project to be done without me present again. The kitchen taught me my lesson, and even though Dave is happy with it and everything is (mostly) okay, it would have been a lot easier if I had been here riding herd on it. There would have been less damage, the schedule would have been followed better, and I would have seen problems as they were installed, not later as I stumbled upon them.Fortunately for Dave's sanity and my OCD, we have an apartment to sleep in while the master bedroom and bathroom are being torn up and recreated from scratch. Nothing major is actually happening in the bedroom--just replacing the carpet with a hardwood floor, but you have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom and the construction debris and chaos tromped through would wear on both of us. By sleeping up in the apartment we can just pretend the area of the house under remodel doesn't exist. Of course that means I have to get on Jay's schedule...--------------------------------------And now, many hours later, the day is over! I'm on Jay's schedule for Monday, I cancelled all of the utilities and insurance for the studio and closed some loose ends on the house. Then I took my daughter to lunch at her favorite restaurant (McDonald's), and after I dropped her back at school, I headed to my knit along up in Jonestown. The evening was rounded out by date night--John Wick 2 at the Alamo Drafthouse in Lakeline. Ah, a day of sitting. Pure bliss!"},
{"title": "Everything That Goes In the Studio is In the Studio", "date": "Wednesday, February 08, 2017", "text": "I am now 39 days into the 365 Project and have discovered a truth: When all else fails, take a picture towards Austin from the back deck. My goal with the project is to take pictures that capture the essence of the day--a pictorial journal of the year. Though the focus of today was getting the studio set up more (not totally, not for a good while), and while I could have taken another picture of the progress there, I ended the day with sunset over Austin from the back deck. That view was the essence of my day. I am so happy with our location now that it's hard to find words--and the completion of the parade of boxes into the studio and the return of the U-Haul on the studio was the catalyst for my giddy (exhausted) joy this evening.After seven months I finally have a studio again--not all set-up, not even any clear workspaces on which to, well, work, but I can *see* the studio. It's no longer a repository for everything we haven't gotten around to organizing for the house, or a stand-in for the garden shed, or a maze in which to lose the cats. No, Now when I survey it from the door to the house I see a studio from one side to the other. Using the garage as a garden shed is actually funny because one thing we don't have at this house is any kind of garden or tool shed. We have a weird room under the master bedroom only accessible from outside under the deck, and for now that's a wood shop/garden shed. It doesn't have any windows, but it does have a hole cut out of the wall with a window ac unit in it. It has three sets of fluorescent light tubes, finished drywall walls, a cement floor, and big double steel doors. Oh, and it has a little wine closet in it with racks for bottles built in.That last paragraph rambled a bit, but I can be excused as I am beyond rode hard and put away wet. The point I'm trying to make is that I finally feel moved in. The greenhouse (where I set up for ikebana, soap-making, jewelry making and, oh yes, growing flats of plants for the garden) is a total disaster with the new stuff that got moved into it from the garage/studio. The wood shop/shed (little room under the bedroom--I think I'll start calling it the bunker) is packed higgledy-piggledy with stuff from the garage. The utility room I was organizing and setting up before heading off to Florida a lifetime (two weeks) ago is still not finished. The textile studio hasn't been touched in months. And the studio will take weeks to finish setting up--but I don't care. In spite of all that's left to do, I feel more settled in than unsettled.Tomorrow I will need to clear off a couple of work areas as I have a couple of orders to do, but that's going to be the extent of my physical efforts. The day for me will consist of the ubiquitous, iniquitous taxes and other administrivia which I must conquer before heading off to Wisconsin next week for my Master Spinner's class. It will feel good to sit in the comfy chair sipping tea and working on the laptop--perhaps even without a cat in my lap!"},

At least her ears will be clean.The U-Haul is empty. I haven't returned it yet--I'll do that tomorrow. There is still a good amount of stuff in the driveway that needs to be moved into the studio proper, but I have faith that by the end of the day tomorrow, all will be sorted. I have three guys helping me again tomorrow, and they are going to start unloading the cases, standing them up and refilling them. Moving cases of glass is a bitch--especially with three tons of it. I put away 2/3 of the 5 oz frit jars today, and tomorrow morning I will do the 1/2 sheets and the 10X10's. The studio is coming together.  I am still not quite sure _how_ everything is going to fit, and yet I am sure it will. And gracefully.I'm going to be graceful too. I am gracefully going to lower myself into a tub full of warm water and Epson sats. I am going to soak and relax, and then take an Aleve (wait, maybe I'll do that before the bath), and go to bed.

Admittedly I am now drinking champagne, listening to \"Kryptonite\" by Three Doors Down, and eating Girl Scout cookies (formerly samoas, now called caramel deLites... Who do they think they're kidding? There's nothing \"lite\" about these babies!) so how bad could it be? But the sale of the studio finally funded at 5:00 pm today, and the last U-Haul from our long move from Atlanta is unloaded down to the (11) cases of sheet glass. Tomorrow I have three guys hired to unload the rest and then help me unpack and set-up. With their help I can get that three tons (really--6,600 lbs) of sheet glass unpacked and re-stored in the crates after they have been stood on end. Today we got the cases of half sheets, the 10X10's, and the scrap glass unloaded, I'll put it away tomorrow too. Then I sent everyone home so I could just sit in the space and plan the layout. Again. More.And as I sat in the studio tonight, I felt joy about it for the first time since moving here. I knew this studio could be a Good Place (and if you haven't watched that show with Ted Danson and Kristen Bell you are missing something great), but with all the stuff that got shoved in there with every U-Haul load, and the lack of the bones (glass crates, classroom table, wire shelving up the wazoo) to delineate the space, it just never sang to me. But today the first thing we did was pull everything out onto the driveway so that we could set up the newly-arrived bones, and now when I sit in there I can see the possibilities, revel in the light from the new glass doors, and admire the lines of the built-out kiln room. They make me happy. All the crap that doesn't belong there has been moved to another temporary holding area (most of it to the wood shop/garden tools room under the master bedroom--doesn't everyone have a secret cement room only accessible from outside under the deck where they can store their tools and toys?), and what goes back in tomorrow will be pertinent to Siyeh Studio.The garage is divided into three bays, a kiln room  and a wet area. My challenge tomorrow is fitting areas for finished work, packing and shipping, the last of my retail materials, stained glass materials and tools, molds and other kiln accoutrements, in around the cutting table, work composition table, and massive frit storage I already have set up. Let's face it, I am moving from a 1500 sq ft studio with two hotshops and two storage sheds to an 1100 sq ft garage. Even with everything I sold, gave away, threw away, there is still an enormous number of boxes out in the driveway. And, hey, cardboard boxes--when they're empty, I am going to use them to fill the bottoms of all of the raised beds we're putting in next month. Waste not, want not.Tomorrow is going to come far earlier than I would like so I finish my wine (red now, finished the champagne) and head off to bed. 'Night all!"},

Thank everything holy that it's The Last Time (knock on wood, salt over shoulder) that I'll have to move the studio. Dave had the worst of it last night coming into Austin in the fog and wet on I-35 with concrete construction barricades tightly bounding both lanes. It was harrowing watching him drive it, I can only imagine how tense he was doing it. Tomorrow we will find out if the buyers for the studio funded and wired their money or if I have to start the sale process all over again. I do have one buyer still waiting in the wings, but I am not even going to think about it--much less worry--for now.Though it is only 10:00 and I napped this afternoon, I am exhausted and going to bed.

I think when all the counting is done, I only drove one of the U-Hauls, but I drove every trip except the one in June after school got out. Now we are home... well, we were home, but Dave and Jessie are off getting pizza, wine, and McDonald's right now. It's been a hard couple of days for all of the Griffiths and we each need our own comfort food. It was also difficult for the pets--keeping Gallifrey from knocking me over in his on-going excitement at seeing me was almost impossible, and even Baxter seemed glad I was home. Tonight, pizza and a glass of red (or two) followed by a hot shower and bed sounds like heaven. I am not in the least bit tempted to read Facebook, or email, or the news. I can just wait till tomorrow to find out whatever idiocy has been perpetrated by our government in the past couple of days.My last view of the studio came last night when Dave and I picked up the U-Haul from where it had been parked next door. I didn't go in, but I don't guess there was much to see. It was being picked pretty clean when I left on Wednesday. I did salvage a few sentimental things on Thursday like the old wine crates that I used to store smaller pieces of glass when I started working with it. I gave all the glass in them away--no way to carry them full in the mini-van--but I am glad to have the 1985 Lynch-Bages Pauillac crate, as well as some of my other favorites from the late '80's. The things that mattered to me which were important to keep make me chuckle. I had no problem giving away two 6-ft X 2-ft sheets of white Tekta and several molds, but when I thought someone had taken the old wine crates I was really upset. I left Elfa shelving, 6-ft white folding tables, sample pieces from the second book (if I teach any classes on those techniques I'll need to make new samples), and a slew of other things. I felt bad about sloughing them like old skin, but at the same time it was very freeing. I still have no idea how I'm going to get everything I did bring into my new, smaller, studio space, but I'm finally looking forward to trying. Just not tomorrow. Monday is soon enough!"},

By this time tomorrow night we will be home. It has been a very good visit for me, though I didn't get to see even half of the people I wanted to.

The mini-van is (mostly) packed. You could not fit a box of kleenex in the back of the U-Haul. I have *never* seen such a great loading job! Of course it weighs like sin. I don't even want to estimate how many thousands of pounds of glass we have in there--not to mention the last of the furniture and a big-assed ceramics kiln (because, hey, everyone needs an art school-sized ceramic kiln...). I'll do a bit more loading of the mini-van tomorrow--there is a smidge of space left in my van and the front seat of the U-Haul. Maybe. Becky, Dan, Linda, Brian, Fawn, Lori, Licha were happy to take things I couldn't, and I am happy that everything I left that I cared about has gone to people I love.The chickens have a new home with Mel, Kay, and Kyla--they want to keep them to remember us--and the Honda sold to Dan. All of the molds and the two big sheets of white Tekta that I left have been claimed by Brian and Linda. Lori took the portable sandblaster. There are still some white Elfa shelves and a couple of 6-ft white folding tables that need homes, but all in all the studio's pretty empty.Tomorrow I'm going to take an easy day and maybe have breakfast with Keith, have a pedicure and lunch with Becky, meet Mel to get the chickens sorted in the afternoon, and then head out to Anya's for dinner and to spend the night. We close Friday and someone else gets to dream big dreams about the possibilities of that wonderful, quirky little 1920's Craftsman bungalow. I'm glad it's not being torn down. Dave comes in early afternoon now, and Saturday we drive. Sunday we rest. Monday we re-jigger the studio, and Tuesday we unload the U-Haul and return it. Once that is done, our last physical tie with Atlanta will be severed. Oh we'll still have emotional ties galore, but there will be no more property, no more pets, no more house and no more studio there. Much as I love Austin and our wonderful house, I definitely have to console myself leaving here with the knowledge that we have an apartment in Austin, and friends WILL visit. Glass friends will come and take glass classes at Helios with some of Paul Tarlow's incredible guest teachers. We'll have our own little spinning retreat in the hill country. Friends will come for food, and music, and weekends with us. We have been so fortunate to build the relationships we have here. I used to wish everyone I cared about would move with us--and I advocated strenuously with them for it. But now I'm glad that I have visits to look forward to, and I'm not afraid this will be the end. If I were up for a cheesy song ending this post tonight, it would be the Carpenters \"We've Only Just Begun\"... Heck, who am I kidding. I AM up for it!"},

And sore. Yes, Dee, I took more Aleve! :-) But thanks to Becky, who moves faster than anyone I know and is uber organized, just about everything in the studio is packed. At least everything I am taking. There is only so much you can fit in a 20-ft. U-Haul, and a 26-ft. one won't fit down the drive in Austin. I have driven one in, but last time I took out a good bit of a mountain laurel and one entire corner of the fence. I don't really wish to repeat that experience. Besides, if I have a bigger truck I'll just be encouraged to take more STUFF, and I really have enough STUFF. What's that saying? If you haven't used it in six months you don't need it? With that direction I wouldn't be taking anything! I have yet to work out what I'm going to do with this load once we get there as, as I mentioned yesterday, it's not going to fit into the garage as is. But, also like yesterday, I'm going to continue to play ostrich and not worry about what I'm going to do on the Austin end of this voyage until we're at least packed and loaded here.I was wrong the other day about the woman who walked the property when Becky was there wanting to buy it to rehab and inhabit. She is just buying it to rehab and flip. Nonetheless, I got all the doors back for her. I am not leaving the sidelights though. I don't know where they're going to go in the new house, but I am not abandoning them. Many other things are being abandoned, however, and I encourage anyone in Atlanta who wants to come pick through glass--fusible, scrap, stained, architectural clear--crates, lamp frames, molds, clamp lights, and I-Don't-Know-What-Else to drop by tomorrow. If you can't come tomorrow, you are welcome to drop by Thursday, but I won't be there. There are IKEA tables, office chairs, shelving units, refractory material, mixed frit, something for everyone!Tonight I have curry at the Hinton's, relax and drink champagne. Tomorrow, the load out. When I was little, 2-3 years old and up till I was a teen, my mother would sometimes put on a record when I was going to sleep and I would listen until I dropped off. My favorites were Frankie Laine's \"Hell Bent For Leather\" and Percy Faith a\"Music Of Brazil\". Tonight this keeps running through my head:\"Keep rollin', rollin', rollin',Though the streams are swollen,Keep them dogies rollin', rawhide.Through rain and wind and weather,Hell bent for leather,Wishin' my gal was by my side.All the things I'm missin',Good vittles, love, and kissin',Are waiting at the end of my ride.Move 'em out, head 'em up,Head 'em up, move 'em on.Move 'em out, head 'em up:Rawhide.Cut 'em out, ride 'em in,Ride 'em in, cut 'em out,Cut 'em out, ride 'em in:Rawhide!Hah!

{"title": "The Studio is Almost Packed!", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "What a great day! I have been dreading the packing of the cases of sheet glass ever since we decided to move. They are the reason I was in no hurry to put the studio on the market and finish getting everything out to Austin. The sheets of Bullseye aren't scary: They're all the same size--or at least they fit into clearly defined buckets--case, half-case, one foot square. And even the full sheets are only 20 inches X 37 inches and have rolled edges on the sides where you carry them. I would pack and unpack Bullseye glass all day long (and have). By contrast the sheets of architectural clear glass I have (and have had since the early 1990's) are very large, very heavy, very sharp-edged, and sometimes very irregular. Then there's the Fremont, the Desag, the St Gobain, the Fischer, the Oceana, Youghigheny, and Spectrum--all for stained glass work which I haven't done any of since the late '90's.Every move with the non-Bullseye glass (and this is the sixth since Dave and I have been together) has been a nightmare--one of them I even ended up in the emergency room getting stitches in my leg (or was it my hand?). But today went silky smoothly, and except for two six-foot pieces of white Tekta that we forgot to pack (I needed to cut them first), we're golden!Yesterday I packed the 10x10 inche sheets, tomorrow we pack the half sheets--Dan the carpenter built me seven or eight half-sheet-size boxes--and then we finish with the odds and ends left in the two sheds, the two hotshops and the studio proper. It sounds like a lot, but it should be very doable for one day. I'm lucky that the studio is selling as-is so I don't have to clean everything out. I can take what I want and leave the rest. Brian is busily packing up his torch set-up in the front room too. Bitter and sweet.Finishing up tomorrow will allow us to load Wednesday and free me up for a day of socializing (and a pedicure) on Thursday before heading up to Marietta to spend the night with friends there. There are a lot of people I want to see while I'm here, and it's just not going to work out. As usual there are too many cherished friends (a very good problem to have), too little time, and too much work jockeying for my attention. I have been so focused on the events of the day every day that I haven't even figured out the truck unload schedule yet or hired helpers! Breathe.So dear Atlanta friends, if I don't see you this time, YOU'LL JUST NEED TO COME TO AUSTIN TO VISIT!"},
{"title": "All Over But the Packing", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2017", "text": "Jessie and Gallifrey survey our lush, verdant yard.The studio is now closed, all sales from it over. It was a bittersweet day. The bitter started when I drove past our old house this morning to find that the new owners took down the arbor in front that had been covered with jasmine, dug up the jasmine, cut down the fragrant tea olives, the camellias, the Harry Lauder Walking Stick (contorted hazelwood tree), the dogwood, the witch hazel, the service berry, and the yellow dogwood, as well as razed any plant taller than grass to the ground including ferns, quince, and azaleas. It's not like the yard was a mess. I had it radically pruned and neatened before we moved. But there is nothing left there from us now. The crepe myrtles and the maple were planted by the builder, and they're all that remain. I'm glad I couldn't see the backyard and the pond.It was also sad to to look around the studio with its careless piles of leavings and stuff bound for the truck, and to remember all the hopes and dreams I had for it when we bought it. I never realized many of them, and of the ones I did, most turned to ash for one reason or another.Clockwise left to right: Half-Moon, Cookies & Cream,Willow, Sadie, Tuxedo, Night Shadows, Sun Dust,Creamy, and PearlThe sweet news for the day was that I sold my mom's Honda without even trying--I even had three people contact me about it--and it looks like the person who is buying the studio might be interested in rehabbing it and living there! I didn't meet her, but my friend Becky did when she was there in my place for the inspection, and apparently the woman buying wanted to keep the woodwork and also expressed interest in keeping the chickens. We have three of our original girls left--Creamy, Cookies & Cream, and Sun Dust--and one adoptee who was nonetheless from the same hatching as our girls--Muffin. They're all getting on in years and I'm not sure how much longer they'll be laying, but they are sweet and friendly and eat bugs.Tomorrow is the day I have been dreading ever since we decided to move: The day to pack the cases of glass. Oh I got rid of about half of my glass in the studio sales, but the hard stuff to pack--the large sheets of architectural clears and the stained glass--barely even got touched. This is glass I have moved around for over 20 years and haven't really touched in all that time, but still haven't let go. I did try. I managed to sell a good part of a case to a lovely couple at the last sale, but today we only had a few people and no really large glass purchases.But this move I won't pack alone. I hired two men for three full days to help me pack sheet glass, and Becky has offered to come on Tuesday for a bit. I had hired a woman from Task Rabbit that packed for me a day last spring to come tomorrow too, but she had to cancel at the last minute. Maybe I'll try to find someone else. One way or another, we'll be out by Friday, and it will be all over but for the closing."},
{"title": "'Twas The Night Before the Glass Sale...", "date": "Saturday, January 28, 2017", "text": "Much though the current actions of those currently in charge of this country scare and appall me, I am going to remain true to the nature of this blog and post about GLASS tonight. Part of the reason for that is that every time I try to post quotes and data and outrage over some recent political idiocy, Blogger deletes my post before I can get it up. Tonight, as before, I'm taking it as a sign. So I take another--they seem to be endless these days--deep breath and I focus on tomorrow in the studio. There are plenty of other places on the Internet where you can get your political news, and frankly I need a bit of a break from it too. Note to self: No more reading the news or social media before blogging.So tomorrow I sell the last of the glass, supplies, and furniture from my studio that is not moving to Austin. Friday of next week we are set--knock on wood--to close on the sale of the studio and pass ownership of our quirky little 1920's Craftsman bungalow and its resident chickens off to a new owner. Observations indicate that the house may be saved and rehabbed instead of torn down and McMansioned. I would be very happy if that were so as it has great charm, it just needs some TLC (and a serious influx of cash).Tonight I rest up alone at a friend's empty house and quaff my sauvignon blanc readying myself  for tomorrow. I will get up early to stop by Kavarna for an iced mocha and a pastry, and then I'll meet our carpenter Dan at the studio where he will spend the day building me some additional glass crates for my really big and really small glass. I have plenty of Bullseye crates for my regular Bullseye glass, it's the white Tekta, architectural clear, and stained glass glasses that I'm envisioning difficulty packing. And then the half sheets and the 10 X 10's... Just come over tomorrow and buy the darn stuff! Save me! Dee, BLESS HER, is coming to help out with the sale after all which is going to be an ENORMOUS help for me. Nevermind the fact that she is the only one who knows what's going on with the imaged dichro and dichro scrap, just having two people to answer questions is going to help a lot.Now I'm going to listen to my audiobook a bit and then drop off to sleep. I think I have figured out how to save democracy with Data.world, but that's a post for another day."},
{"title": "The Winter Show", "date": "Friday, January 27, 2017", "text": "God Bless German Roommates With German Liqueur-Filled Chocolates To Share! Now that I have that out of the way, on with the post. It was another lovely day in spinning land filled with chatting, and laughing, and sharing, and shopping. Oh yes, and spinning.Tonight, as I reflect on the past three days and prepare to leave in the afternoon tomorrow (early as it turns out), I remember why I did the winter wholesale craft shows for so long. It wasn't for the sales--though that's what we artist/business folk would like to tell ourselves--it was for the friendships and the art. I don't remember the big orders from the shows (not that there were all that many of them). I remember the Reading Market for lunches, the cherried chicken livers from I-Can't-Remember-Where (but Dee will know), and the annual dinners at Maggiano's. The days may have been exhausting, the sales crappy, the expenses excruciating, but seeing old friends from around the country over dinner was always wonderful.As we artists are solitary cats in our studios, it was the only time in a year for us to get together with both other artists and with the store owners who carry our work and who have become our friends. At the show, we'd hug and laugh and be all giddy to see each other again. But nothing stands still. Some of my friends have retired. Some have died. Some have had to go on to other things because they just couldn't make a living at art--got to have a regular job with a big company for the insurance, doncha know. Some (like me) are still in the business, but looking for a way other than shows to make the annual sales numbers--shows are just too expensive for the return.But without the shows, there are no trades or wholesale sales between artists. There are no Hulet Chocolates (glass chocolates--can you think of anything better?) or exquisite Loy Allen glass insects for me to bring home. And then there are all the new artists I would meet and whose work I would acquire, and with whom I would march out into the cold in search of dinner and lots of wine. I can't help but miss all of that.These past few days of happy, artistic camaraderie here at the Spin-In, actually have made me a bit sad that I'm not doing the Philly show this year. Don't get me wrong--I won't miss the exhaustion of show set-up, the fear of crappy sales, or the eternally excruciating expenses. But I will miss my friends, the art, and another giddy get-together."},

The pool shot I took last night was pointing down, and this one is shot looking out.I'd like to say I sat in my chair and spun alpaca and silk roving all day, but it would be a lie. I spent a lot of time shopping today too. And talking to friends. And walking out for sandwiches. And taking pictures. And talking some more. And shopping some more. At the end of the day a few of us had wine and cheese in our condo before heading out to dinner at The Back Porch. I love Florida for Gulf seafood!!! A little sauvignon blanc and some blackened grouper followed by key lime pie... I don't have words. I also don't have any more room in my tummy.What spinning I did was all alpaca/silk \"thread\". I finished the first half of the roving (it's only 4 oz.) and am now making good progress on another 1/8 of it. The shopping was much more exciting! I bought natural green cotton. The green is a very subtle sage that gets darker when you boil it. I'm going to knit another cardigan out of it--though don't be fooled by the phrasing \"another cardigan\". What I mean is I'm going to start another cardigan--the third one this month--that I hope to finish soon. Two of them are cotton or cotton blend, and the other one is merino wool/yak/silk. I foresee a lot of knitting in my future--and I'm even making up the pattern for the cardigan kind of as I go. I based it on an existing cardigan pattern, and the hard parts--top, arms, upper body shaping--are all provided by the pattern, and then I am just adding some swig and flourish at the bottom. Anyway, all I can say about the shopping is, it's a good thing I drove! I have no idea what I'm going to do for my Master Spinner class in Wisconsin next month as I'm flying. Maybe I'll pack my suitcase inside an empty suitcase for the trip out so I'll have tow to fill for the way home. Fiber ahoy!A Roomful of Spinners"},
{"title": "Fences are For Sheep, Not People", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2017", "text": "I am nestled in bed at the end of the first (half) day of the January Spin-In in Destin. This is apparently the 29th or so year of the Spin-In--a four day hand-spinning retreat that is by invitation only, and attended by women from all over the southeast. The Peachtree Handspinners Guild group is one of the larger ones there and is represented by about 23 people this year. I attended last year and had a less-than-stellar time, but a couple of friends from Atlanta pressured me to come again this year, and I'm so glad I did. It was non-stop catching up this afternoon with all of us acting like a bunch of sugared-up four year-olds at a birthday party. I feel sorry for anyone else staying at the hosting facility as this many giddy women (and a few men) are LOUD. I'd like to say it's all about the focused spinning, but one of the women near me summed it up perfectly today when someone asked her if she brought her cashmere fiber to spin and she replied, \"Oh no! I only brought fiber for mindless spinning!\" If you can't talk a mile a minute while spinning it, you should just turn away from your wheel and face your conversation partner. I, of course AM STILL SPINNING THREAD. I didn't mean to spin thread, but this alpaca-silk blend I am working is just perfect for a nice, fine, lace weight yarn--and I've always wanted to try to spin something this fine.In the evenings after spinning, we go out to eat, talk some more--everything from politics to reproductive history--drink, and we knit. I forgot my knitting on the couch in Austin so I did what any red-blooded American knitter would do and bought more yarn and needles today from the vendors at the SI. I am doing the same cardigan pattern I have at home, just a different yarn.Tomorrow will start early, another merry-go-round of color and chatter and fiber and enthusiasm. I will immerse myself in it with the knowledge that right now there is nothing I can do about the horrific things that are happening in my country, in my government. It is okay to put aside fear, anxiety, and anger until after this event is done. There are many women around me, sisters in the wool, who are on the other side of fence about all/most/many/some of the issues that bother me, but while I am here, I am focusing on the fact that they are my sisters--not the enemy--and for the next four days, there is no fence."},

I wrote the beginnings a post after catching up a bit on the Internet, and the environmental news was so grim that it spilled over and fouled my post. So now I breathe, I delete, and I start over.I am reaching right now, trying very hard to come up with good and happy things like unicorns farting rainbows. It was a tougher than usual drive east today, and I am now ensconced in my room at the La Quinta in Walker Louisiana. Someone from the hotel called me this morning to tell me they are starting construction on the hotel now and there are no rooms on the first floor, the elevator isn't working, and they can't serve breakfast. The news came on top of several other difficulties in my morning, and I'm afraid I was less than patient and understanding with the clerk from the hotel. I felt very bad when I got in tonight and saw that they are doing construction because of flooding, and I realized they must have been damaged during the horrible floods last year. Just a little reminder to always give the benefit of the doubt and assume that there's a good reason for someone's actions or some hardship in their lives that you don't have and so to cut them slack.For a unicorn farting a rainbow, the studio went under contract today and is set to close next Friday. That is both a terrifying and an exhilarating development. I think I have everything set-up to pull it off--even though I will not have the help of any studio elves as Dee is getting ready for her show in Philly in three weeks, and Becky works for an accountant and this is the busy (tax) season. My current plan is to have a last sale day on Sunday--email to go out when I finish this post--and then three days of packing and one day of loading The Last UHaul. Close on the property Friday, Dave coming in Friday night, and then he will drive the U-Haul back to Austin Saturday while I drive the minivan. That's all the easy part. The had part, the part that is twisting my brain is, where am I going to put all the stuff I'm bringing back?!? The studio in Austin is FULL. But if the weather is nice, I guess I can pull everything out of it and pile it on the driveway, and then put it all back in the way it should go instead of higgledy piggledy (which it is now) and find some room that way. And I can set-up the woodworking equipment in a woodshop in the room under the master bedroom.It's hard to believe that the last ties that bind us to Atlanta (which aren't people) are set to be severed in just over a week. I still have to sell my Mom's car. Anyone know anyone who would like a 4-door 1999 Honda Accord with 57,000 miles--yes, only 57,000, no typo--for $2500? I also need to rehome the sporadically-laying chickens--they're sweet girls, but they are getting old and we are not moving them to the sun and coyote-drenched landscape that is Austin. Anyone know anyone who would like four sweet chickens?Now I'd better get a sale flyer out and then get to sleep, Destin and spinning tomorrow!"},

I did pick up another Bona mop for stone and tile floors--I would have just used my existing one with a new cleaner cartridge, but I couldn't find any cartridges locally. So I have a second Bona mop. Bottom line: tomorrow I mop the utility room and greenhouse floors.IKEA has stepped up their furniture game and I found the perfect table for the utility room there. It's meant to be a kitchen cart/island, but it will make a great folding table for laundry, and laundry baskets will fit up underneath it--off the floor where the dogs won't pee on them. Welcome to my life. It's taller than it looks in the photo, and it has a really pretty bamboo butcher block edge. Well, not really bamboo butcher block, bamboo butcher block formica. In any case, it's the perfect height and width for the space, and it's stylish too.Today, the wind blew so hard today it blew the front door open several times. It blew hard enough for us to enjoy the wind chimes in our neighbors' backyard made from oxygen tanks with the bottoms cut off (that used to be in our front yard--life is weird). It blew so hard that it blew all the haze from the air so our view of downtown from the house was crisp and clear. The wind blew signaling change, signaling clearing out and cleaning out. I am feeling pretty good about the cleansing wind, no bluster allowed.I still have two developers pestering me about the studio property, but I ended the day by just telling them that if they're serious, send a REAL contract, (thank you Stacy Reno for telling me which contract to specify). I told them the points I wanted in the contract, and who I wanted to use for a closing attorney (thank you agin, Stacy, for the recommendation on the closing attorney). We'll see if they respond with new offers or not. If they don't, fine, I am done looking at real estate contracts with spelling and grammatical errors. If they have those kinds of errors in them, how confident can I be that they are legally correct? If those boys want to be in the big leagues, they better get real contract forms."},
{"title": "BeeZ!", "date": "Saturday, January 21, 2017", "text": "Today was the 2017 Austin Area Beekeeper's Association 6th Annual Seminar, and my brain is FULL!! I went with my friend and next-door neighbor Zaga who is also api-curious, and by noon, she was hooked. As you may know, I walked into the seminar already the proud owner of two complete hives, plans and parts for a third, and three nucs (nuclear colonies--one of the ways of getting new bees and a queen) on order. When we got back from lunch Zaga bit the bullet and ordered a nuc--many places around us are already sold out so she needed to move quickly if she wanted to keep bees this year. I also said, \"What the heck, they're selling varroa resistant queens and nucs for a really good price.\"And I ordered another nuc. Now I am short a hive so I am going to need to either buy or build one more. I think I'll buy, and I think I'll go for another Langstroth hive. Zaga also chose Langstroth so we will have three Langstroth hives, one Kenyan Top-Bar, and one Honey Flow. Some of you might remember that this current bee thing originally started a couple of years ago now when I contributed to the Honey Flow Kickstarter campaign. Now look, *five hives* coming on-line this spring!In today's seminars we learned about bee biology, essential equipment, how to set-up your apiary, month by month management, the basics of integrated pest management and queen-finding, and at the end of the day, we learned to extract honey with a live demonstration. We also learned the mating habits of bees including the fact that the drone bees explode after mating! I thought male black widows had it bad...Along the way we also learned about Africanized bees in Texas and how to manage the genetics of your hive, nutrition management from feeding sugar syrup to making pollen patties for protein supplement, and how to sample for varroa mites. We were in the beginner track all day so we missed mead making, queen rearing, and customizing and printing your own honey labels, (among other topics) but I figure we can come back next year for those.A honey super with 10 medium frames, shown on its side, ready for extractionI end the day on a bee high, and with the memory in my mind of visiting friends Bill and Bridget in California many years ago, buying a book on beekeeping, and stating my intent then to raise bees.

I haven't finished moving the contents of the studio to Austin yet--I still have all the sheet glass, half sheets and 10X10's of fusible that haven't sold, all the sheets of glass for stained glass left, and other odds and sods left. I also haven't put it on the market because I still have stuff in it, and Brian is using it for his torch-work studio. In spite of the fact that it is not on the market, I accepted an offer on it today with a closing date of asap and definitely within 30 days.While it makes sense to sell it, my feelings are bittersweet about the final end of 2480 Memorial Drive as my studio. When I think of it, I think of our carpenter Dan building everything from the kiln room to the hotshop to the shed to the chicken coop to the second hot shop/ceramic studio--which we never even got to use! I remember the good times in the hotshop, the sleigh rides, the date nights, the classes and the studio elves. Sure there was a lot of tension and stress with running a retail business, a hotshop, my own production glass business, and managing date nights--and I have to say I won't miss the retail, the hotshop or the date nights--but in tonight's memory (rose-tinged as it is) I feel nostalgia with a twinge of sadness. I also dread the speed up in tempo that selling the studio will require of me.It looks like a trip to Atlanta is in my near future. It would make sense to do one more sale day for glass and fixtures, and then pack the rest up and haul it back to Texas, but time is already tight and it's going to take me a lot of work to pack everything--the architectural glass alone is going to be a ginormous pain in the patooty. So for those in Atlanta either interested in glass or in seeing me, how does the week of February 7-13 look? The studio in Austin has big news from today too: the solar was turned on and is functional! The solar company had to turn it back off again and remove their test meter as we are now waiting for Austin Energy's inspection and new meter installation, but I am hopeful that in just over a week, Siyeh Studio will be a solar glass studio."},

I look up and day, which spread so bountifully in front of me this morning, is almost over. I find myself cramming the things I promised myself I would do every day into the last two hours of the day. That's not exactly the spirit of the intent, and it's not working out for me. Yes, I get the post, and the photo, and the spinning done., but they aren't treasured little moments in the day that I get to enjoy. Instead, they're becoming obligations. Time to reset a bit. Yes, I am going to keep taking pictures, I'm just going to take more of them throughout the day (like I did on Tuesday when I went to my first drawing class). No, I am not going to try to add 15 minutes of drawing in every day. When it happens, it happens, no pressure, no stress. I do like the post at the end of the evening because there are lots of interesting things that happened during the day around which to build a story. If I do it first thing in the morning, it often seems to turn into a list of all the things I contemplate accomplishing in the day, and the list is a totally unrealistic nightmare that I get to report the next morning I failed to complete. No, spinning should start the day. Spinning and piano.I will not spin tonight. I am tired to the bone after running around all day doing the program for an event put on by the Cinematic Arts Program at McCallum tonight, picking up supplies for it (a wig and make-up for Jessie's teacher to wear as part of his drag costume), attending my first KAL session (way to hell and gone north of the city in Jonestown, and then getting back to McCallum to pick up Jessie, feed her, and chauffeur her back for the event. I have had six hours of sleep a night for the last three nights, and I am normally a 9-10 hour gal. As it's almost 11:00, I'm not getting an early start on the sleep thing, but I'll take what I can get.Oh yes, and the day ended with a bidding war on the studio by two developers. We haven't determined how we're going to proceed yet, but it looks likely that Atlanta is in my near future, to pack up the last of the studio an finally say good-bye. Good-bye later, good night now."},

So instead of a rant, you get flowers. Today Jessie and I started up our ikebana practice again after the holidays, and though it was difficult to get back into the rhythm, we made it. I also practiced drawing today, and in both drawing and ikebana, my head got in the way of my creativity. I think it was the same for Jessie. The last couple of days have found me still more energized than I have been for several months--which is great, but also sliding into the nervy, agitated side of energized, which is very counterproductive to creative work (and a tranquil home). Need to find my happy medium. The kitten, who keeps walking on my keyboard and putting her nose up to mine is clearly trying to help.I didn't plan to stay up so late tonight as I have slept poorly for the past two nights, but I was unwilling to miss another Spin15 day or a post. So now I post, and when I am done, I will spin. I posted the ikebana pic at right to my 365 Project tonight. It's kind of lame, but unlike yesterday, I didn't take many pictures today--just ikebana. But the 365 Project is not meant to be 365 days of stunning, professionally composed and shot photos--it's 365 days of life. Some days my life is messy and haphazard, and some days it's breathtakingly beautiful so it's perfectly okay that my photos are the same.I wish I'd had this little chat with myself earlier in the day instead of wasting it fretting that I wasn't going to get to everything I had scheduled, or I was going to be late for something. I spent the whole day anticipating failure and disaster. But life is quite pleasant if I let myself relax and enjoy it instead of worrying about what I won't get done. There is something peaceful about the house when everyone (except for the kitten and me) is asleep and the only sounds are the ticking of the clock, the purring of the kitten in my arms (I type one-handed and pause for frequent pets at her insistence), and the gentle snorelets of the husband. Sadly the kitten's going to be disappointed (and indignant) in a minute as there is no way I can hold and pet her and spin at the same time."},
{"title": "Drawing Class and the Contemporary", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2017", "text": "I know I said today was going to be about ACA and Planned Parenthood, but after last night's post I was just to blue to contemplate it again this morning. Instead, my first class at The Contemporary Austin Art School! This is the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. It is on 12 acres tucked away at the end of a road, down by the river in near-north Austin. There are peacocks roaming the campus--including inside the ceramics kiln room, and lots of enormous live oaks shading the grounds. The live oaks weave through palm trees and bamboo and cast a shade surely welcome as the weather warms up. It was raining today when I arrived a little early for my class, but the rain didn't stop me from walking around and taking pictures.My class was wonderful--I made a new friend and I really like the instructor--she even has a YouTube page. Best of all, I feel like I might actually learn to draw! Completely unexpectedly, my posture was naturally perfect, I breathed just fine (the teacher exhorted us to breathe a lot), and I serenely let the drawings flow for all three techniques we learned today: gesture drawing, scribbled gesture drawing, and blind contour drawing. Each one was a little better than the one before it. (Until we got to blind contour drawing where you don't look at the paper while you're drawing. At all. Those were... interesting. I think the sheep below was my best.Our instructor said she has no expectation of us having any time to practice during the week, but she said we would improve much faster if we do. She said if we do opt to work outside class, she would recommend three drawings, one in each of the techniques we learned, for five minutes apiece each day. I'm going to give it a shot this week to see how it goes. Let's see, spin 15 minutes a day, practice piano 20 minutes a day, blog (about 45 min) daily, knit daily as much as possible, take pictures every day and post one to the 365 Project, and draw 15 minutes a day. And all of that is before doing any glass! My life truly has become a creative endeavor (internal little happy dance).When I got home from class I was so energized and inspired by my experience at the school that I did one more check of their online course catalog to see if there was a pottery class I could get into. Lo and behold, there is a class starting in March on Thursday mornings that has space. (Most of their classes are filled with waiting lists. There was a one-day Watercolor class That I was interested in that had ten students signed up, and another 35 on the waiting list!) The ceramics class is wheel throwing--both beginning and intermediate--and it will start up right about when we finish our sweaters in the KAL (my Thursday afternoon knit along which begins this week). Too bad the the Contemporary doesn't offer silversmithing. However I did find one place in Austin that does, Creative Side Jewelry Academy of Austin, and I may take a class with them later this spring or next fall--two classes a week is my absolute stretched out max (not including my half-hour piano class Wednesday mornings).I should do an ikebana or two tonight, but I'm going to wait till tomorrow morning when I'm fresh. So I'll post a few more pics from the class, the campus, the art on the grounds, and the peacocks, and then to bed!"},
{"title": "Let Us Remember--and Wake UP!", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2017", "text": "Today, this Dr. Martin Luther King Day, is a pivotal day in a volatile country. No matter how much I try to keep my cool, love my neighbor (and Zaga, I mean that in the figurative sense--not the literal), and be kind, I keep getting slapped in the face by people I like and respect who don't seem to be able to see anything negative happening on their side of the political spectrum. When I see posts and hear comments about the hate liberals are spewing, and read derogatory remarks about the hats some women are going to wear in the March on Washington (really? you're focusing on their hats and whether they resemble vaginas or cats?!?!), it makes my heart hurt.Don't these women get it that things are not looking good in our country for ourselves, our sisters, our friends, and our daughters--may they be straight, gay, or transgender. Intolerance and short-sightedness (or outright blinders) are becoming the norm in this country. Wake up people! Yes, Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States, but that doesn't mean we have to shut up, sit back, and watch him strip us of our rights, our values, and our freedoms.Yes, as with every public protest, there will be those who are righteous and angry, who rail and chant and burn articles of clothing. But that's not the core of the March or the idea behind it.This is the Mission Statement for the March:OUR MISSIONThe rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us - immigrants of all statuses, Muslims and those of diverse religious faiths, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, survivors of sexual assault - and our communities are hurting and scared. We are confronted with the question of how to move forward in the face of national and international concern and fear.In the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore. The Women’s March on Washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.We support the advocacy and resistance movements that reflect our multiple and intersecting identities. We call on all defenders of human rights to join us. This march is the first step towards unifying our communities, grounded in new relationships, to create change from the grassroots level up. We will not rest until women have parity and equity at all levels of leadership in society. We work peacefully while recognizing there is no true peace without justice and equity for all.HEAR OUR VOICE.The entire mission and vision can be read here.To put the upcoming March into historical context, a good friend's mother participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, and she wrote the following letter to her granddaughters about the experience. My friend posted it on Facebook a few years ago, and re-posted it today. I hope he doesn't mind me sharing it here.\"We had to catch the 3:00 am LIRR train from Lynbrook, especially put on to meet up with the Washington DC train from Penn Station to Union Station in DC to join whoever showed up for the March on Washington for Jobs. I had just finished my Junior year at Syracuse University and I knew when I first heard about it I would have to go. My then boyfriend XXXXXXX (later to be my husband) and my father, XXXXXXX joined me. We were told to dress well and to be orderly and polite to everyone. I wore a seersucker shirtwaist dress and loafers, my father wore a suit and tie and XXXXX wore a seersucker jacket, black slacks and a tie. This was the way the vast majority of the marchers dressed. The only exception was the enormous prevalence of beautiful Sunday hats worn by the majority of women. My Dad had printed up armbands that read, REMEMBER THE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE, BIRMINGHAM. We distributed them to anyone wanting them on the ride down on the train.I will never forget arriving in DC and not sure if anyone else was really coming - we came out of Union Station by 9:00 am and were greeted by the street filled with people and more importantly there was an endless stream of the most dilapidated buses imaginable - their windows were open and we were shouting and greeting each other and they were dressed, as ready for Church. The buses would have signs taped on saying, i.e., The Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama or another church from Mississippi, etc., etc., etc. - they seemed as thrilled to see us as we were to see them and honestly most of us were crying with the joy of the moment. Their hands and heads and hearts were out of the windows.This was probably the most peaceful assembly of people I had ever been with and that lasted for the entire day. The DC Police were wonderful and helpful and were pointing all of us in the correct direction. They wanted us all to go where the line was starting to form. We needed to be ready once the March would begin. Everyone obeyed, followed directions and everyone was so lovingly polite. We knew our every action would reflect on Dr. King and the Movement and we needed to show how important this was.When we first arrived, the murmur was that 25,000 were coming and we were so happy - but they just kept coming and coming in these worn out and tired buses across America to DC. We were shocked at the endless numbers of buses and people arriving. We would be marching with the giants... Dr. King, A. Philip Randolph, Mrs. Medgar Evers, John Lewis, James Farmer, Whitney Young, Jr., Roy Wilkins, Bayard Rustin (who along with Dr. King actually started this whole ball rolling for a March)... and so many more. I remember the priests, so many priests and so many nuns, marching in their heavy habits. And we were marching with all these incredible people who rode forever on these buses - how did they ever make it? What made them think these buses would make it? The whole thing started to feel surreal - some force was allowing this to happen. To happen so peacefully, so beautifully. They never stopped coming. Everyone shared any snacks, but we ate almost nothing - I do not remember having water.Shortly before we got to the Lincoln Memorial, something exciting was rippling through the crowd and it finally got to us - President Kennedy had invited the leaders of the March to the White House for a meeting on what the marchers were demanding. This was so much more than we ever thought would happen that day. We knew we had already made a difference.We were early and lucky to be nearer the front, which meant as we approached the Lincoln Memorial, we actually got to be under the first tree on the right, looking at the Memorial. It was the first shade of the day. We could see the podium and the speakers - far away, but there.I can really only remember one other speech from that day, besides THE SPEECH. That was John Lewis' speech. Dr. King's speech started out slowly and he seemed to be moving slowly and then he found it. Then it happened and we all started to look at each other because we knew these words, the words he was now saying would be remembered forever.\"Dr. King's speech was both strong and fiery, and peaceful and resolute:\"In the process of gaining our rightful placewe must not he guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us notseek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking fromthe cup of bitterness and hatred.We must forever conduct our struggle on the high planeof dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creativeprotests to degenerate into physical violence. Againand again we must rise to the majestic heights of meetingphysical force with soul force.\"Tomorrow the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood's removal from eligible Medicaid service centers."},
{"title": "Little Wooly Gnome", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2017", "text": "Today is all about the floors. And the laundry. And the utility room. On the bright side, that means no housework tomorrow. On the downside, I'm still doing the annual books (it would help if I did them more than once a year, as I do for the studio, and once every five years as I'm now doing for the house), and the website still isn't done--much less the winter marketing and the contacting of all the galleries that have carried my work. But I bet if I'm diligent in the task part of what I have to do, I can allocate two hours a day _during the day_ to artistic endeavors of some kind. I had to put the caveat of 'during the day' in there as everyone should have their evenings to do family things, which for me includes spinning and knitting as I do those while watching a movie or just hanging out with my peeps.To help ensure two hours a day I have the drawing class starting Tuesday morning, and I have joined a knitter's project group on Thursday afternoon at Happy Ewe. The knitter's group is so I can learn to modify patterns and size my knitting appropriately. Dave loves his sweater, but I can't get past feeling that it's a mite too large, and both the baby sweaters and the cardigan (the almost-finished cardigan) I knitted this fall are bigger than I planned. I only joined the group yesterday--I missed the first session so I went in, met the teacher, got the pattern, and picked my yarn yesterday--and already I want to modify the pattern. It's a fine sweater, but it's not a gorgeous sweater, and if I put all the effort into it of knitting it, then I'd like to come out of it with a gorgeous sweater. The pattern is a long cardigan, which is great, but I would also like to have the long drapey points in the front like there are on my current favorite cardigan which is industrially made and from a store instead of handknit. My cardie is getting very old (I wore it to BeCon at Bullseye in 2011) and worn out as I wear it almost everyday.The group, it's a KAL really (knit-along), is free to join and do the project with the guidance of an instructor, but they ask that you buy the yarn for it at the sponsoring shop, Happy Ewe. Very reasonable, but it is moving me outside of my comfort zone as the yarn that works best for the project is a cotton blend DK weight (on the finer side for yarn--smaller diameter than the standard worsted weight everyone's familiar with from growing up with Red Heart yarn). I've never knitted with cotton and wasn't sure I wanted to now, but it does make sense since we'll be finishing the cardies in the spring and it will be too hot here for wool or alpaca.I got two different yarns to try out, one is a soft heathery purple, and the other is a dark grey. The Purple is cotton and rayon, the grey is cotton, viscose, alpaca, wool and nylon. By my swatches, I am already over on the gauge--I'm supposed to get 10 stitches and 13 rows in a 2X2 inch swatch and I got 8 and 12 for the purple, and 8 and 11 for the grey. This is where the guidance with fitting from the instructor comes in, and I think it's going to mean MATH. That's okay, math doesn't scare me. You think I'm afraid of a little math? Hah, I eat math for breakfast... Okay, I married a mathematician and I solve most of my math by asking, \"Honey, how do I get from x to y?\"Enough of a break. Back to work. If I get everything done, I'll call this a really good day."},

I find myself at 10:30 pm after a wonderful day with my spouse, a great family meal, and a movie all cozy with my spouse and my child, and there's a kitten in my lap. It's hard to manage the laptop around the kitten. ANd I find I care more about the kitten than the post. I care more about the present than the past. Being present in my now, hearing the faint sound of the fountain on the back deck and the soft breathing of my husband between my taps on the keyboard, that's what's real. ANd it's good. What happened in the past 11 years was life, a full life. There was \"Comedy. Love. And a bit with a dog.\" (Just like in \"Shakespeare in Love.\") And there's still comedy, love, and bits of three dogs all over the house. And a kitten in my lap.So instead of writing more about the past, I'm going to take my present, dislodge the kitten and go to bed with my spouse. I'll really blog tomorrow."},

It may look like a cheesy horror movie title, but apparently there is some bad mojo attached to knitting a sweater for your boyfriend. Manfriend. Womanfriend. Whatever. As I look back, I did knit a sweater for a boyfriend once, and we did break up (obviously), but I'm not convinced that the relationship was doomed by the sweater. And I do feel safe with the sweater I just knitted for Dave as it's the second one I have knitted for him and I gave him the first one over 20 years ago. Okay, bullet dodged, on with my day.I would like to say I made something as cool as the metal clay box with a hinged lid that my friend Cynthia Morgan made, but, no. Except for my daily spinning, I seem to be on an entirely left-brain track right now. It was another day of Quicken and accounting--I even analyzed my little IRA and changed about 80% of the investments. The most creative thing I did today was take a picture 15 minutes ago for the 365 project. At first I just took a pic of Gallifrey because, hey, wolfhounds are always good for a photo op. But then I went up to J's room and took a pic of her succulent wreath inhabited by little kodama.While we have to do a lot of cleaning and straightening tomorrow, and the administrative work for taxes and Quicken seems never-ending, there will be time not only for something creative this weekend, but also for some games of Dominion with the spouse. I love long weekends!"},
{"title": "Bookkeeping Can Make You Go Blind", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2017", "text": "I have heard stories of people going blind from drinking hi-octane homemade liquor. Spending the entirety of the afternoon on bookkeeping--installing a virgin instance of Quicken and starting from scratch because I haven't used it since my hard drive failed a year or four ago--made me want to drink lots of hi-octane homemade liquor, post hoc, ergo propter hoc, bookkeeping can make you go blind. Or insane. Or both. C'mon Intuit, it's the 21st century, can't you list *all* of the financial institutions that have on-line banking and and their web addresses in your program? *Must* you make us set them up manually and forever enter the transactions and reconcile them manually?I have a love-hate relationship with Quicken and, to a lesser extent, Quickbooks. That greater-than-a-little-bit of my personality that wants to be organized and on top of every bit of information needs to use something to track my finances, and back in 1990 I settled on Quicken. When I got a new hard drive after a catastrophic failure sometime in the past one to four years, I moved all of files onto it and then manually installed the software instead of doing a mirror image copy of the drive. I took the drive failure as an excuse to clean up and get rid of a bunch of apps I wasn't using. I can't remember why I didn't reinstall Quicken--it was probably prompting me to upgrade.That's the main place the hate comes into my relationship with all Intuit products: I don't like upgrading *anything* that's working for me. I kept my iPhone One until the majority of the apps didn't work anymore and there weren't new versions for them that would work on a phone that old. Then I broke down and got an iPhone 5. I replaced my first gen Kindle several years ago after it failed with a Kindle Paperwhite, and I have no intention of replacing that one until I absolutely have to. Intuit, however, made it a part of their revenue plan that you would have to buy their new release every few years. They enforced their will by making it so you couldn't download transactions from your on-line accounts with the old software anymore. I didn't want their new, bloated features. I was happy as I was. If they had released something compelling in the software that made me want to upgrade, that would be one thing, but I hate being made to do anything.Fast forward to today when one of our contractors asked me if I could send him a record of all the checks we had written him over the past year. Because I've just been logging into individual accounts and managing our finances that way for awhile now, I had to go to our bank's on-line system with its crappy interface to slog through everything there. That experience was enough to prod me into buying and installing Quicken again. However I didn't hunt for my old data file. It's who knows how far out of date anyway, and I just didn't want to carry around 20+ years of outdated categories and data any longer. So I started from scratch. I estimate I'm about 20% through connecting my accounts and importing all the data from the arbitrary date of 1/1/14 on.Anyone have any homemade liquor to share?"},
{"title": "Minions", "date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2017", "text": "I have come to the conclusion that I need minions. I was talking to Dee yesterday about getting the studio set up, and I realized how much faster it would be going if she were here to help. It's not that I'm averse to heavy lifting and hard work. I'm happy to just keep doing until the doing is done--when someone else is there doing too. When I'm by myself I dither... a lot. And I am very easily distracted (Squirrel!).Yesterday afternoon I spent some time in the utility room trying to set up an area for gift wrap, bows, tissue paper, and all the paraphernalia for wrapping presents. I did get about a third of it done, but then I wandered off to buy more organizing tools to really optimize the set-up. Today as I was doing a FaceTime crafting session with Becky, I realized that I would have finished the job completely had she been here helping me with it--keeping me on task. Really, I don't need minions, I just need company--though minion is a much more fun word. Todd calls the people who help me (including himself) flying monkeys--mostly because I think he likes comparing me to the wicked witch of the west--and Judy likes the label studio elves. I like friends--or family.Last weekend it was time to take down the Christmas tree and put away the majority of the house decorations (I decided to leave the lights around all of the windows and the red bead garland on the chandelier up till March). I wasn't exactly dreading the task, but I did figure it would easily take me all day. But Dave had other ideas: Instead of me doing it myself, we did it together, and it went so fast! Ornaments off the tree, pottery angels neatly packed away, garland, lights, stockings, advent calendars, zip, zap, zup, and away. Putting away laundry is like that too. Many hands do make light work. I almost wish I lived in a time when women from the village would get together and do their chores. But as that would entail beating clothes on rocks on the banks of a muddy creek and carrying big, heavy baskets of wet clothes back home to dry, I think I'm better off alone in the here and now."},
{"title": "Positive Creativity Over Negative Fear", "date": "Tuesday, January 10, 2017", "text": "After checking in with Facebook this morning and seeing what someone had commented on one of my posts, I was very upset and started to write a blog post about history, Donald Trump, the rise of nationalism, and the bad things that follow when someone promises to make things better for you by blaming someone else for causing your problems. And then I had to stop. I know it's true, I'm afraid worse is coming--what we've got is certainly bad enough, and my heart begins to pound and hurt at the same time. But I can't right now. I just can't.So I choose to write about art, creation, beauty, and positive energy. Next week I start the drawing class I signed up for at the Art School at Laguna Gloria. Yesterday I bought all of my supplies for it, and I am both nervous that I'll fail--that I can't draw, and excited at the prospect of unlocking a new outlet for my internal creative voice.While I was out running around for errands, I also did my first shopping from Facebook messenger. The messenger app on the phone has a tab for people to sell things in your area--they should call it FaceList or CraigsBook. Anyway I picked up a handmade elm bench made locally from a fallen elm tree, and cool pub table and small dishwasher that are for the apartment. I wasn't planning on getting the dishwasher, but the very nice woman from whom I purchased the table also had the dishwasher from a recent kitchen remodel, and she just wanted it out of the garage so she gave it to me.I have to be honest: I chose both the bench and the table because of their eminent suitability for refinishing and inlay. Oh boy,  I feel the projects stacking up. We had to make a rule in the house that if you buy something for the house you have to deploy it immediately. You can't buy anything else until that thing is deployed. So, e.g., if I bought a shoe rack for the front hall that had to be assembled, it would have to be assembled and installed right away. This rule came to be because of Ikea. It's way to easy to buy stuff at Ikea and then not get it set up for months. Do you see the parallel? I am getting projects stacked up--a stash of a different sort, if you will. Now I need to start doing them. No more comes in until I do some of the ones I have. That's a good idea! New resolution: I cannot take on a new project until I complete two others. How about at least one other. Yeah, I can do that. But getting tools to do current projects, that's okay. And since I'm no longer in Atlanta and can't use Becky's, it's time to get a scroll saw."},

One of the ones I contemplated but discarded was a regular zentangle practice. I decided against making it a resolution as I already had enough daily activities planned and I didn't see a way of doing it less often than daily. One of the projects I did resolve to do, however, was to extend a steer skull. I say \"extend\" because I think of it less as an embellishment of the skull and more as an extension of its essence. In a way, it's my own version of the Chicago cow parade.Originally I thought to cover the surface with cut and polished stones or kiln-formed glass. But lately my vision is morphing into a zentangle skull. Don't ask. I'm not sure how my mind works some time. But I just have a picture of a series of beautiful tangles skimming across the landscape of the skull that I can't shake. I also still want to incorporate glass and stone into one or more other skulls, but I don't just want to put them on the surface. In my mind I see parts of the skull replaced by cut stone, cast glass, or even inlaid wood. And, heck, why use only technique at a time? The only medium I'm currently working in that I don't see incorporating into a skull is fiber. Maybe it's because fiber is also an animal product which makes too much similarity in theme. Whatever the reason, no wooly cow skulls."},

I know this because I started two sweaters at the same time--Dave's and another one I could work on when he was home--and that one is all but done too. The sweater I knitted for Dave is the first sweater I ever knitted on circular needles, and I am not as good at staying true to gauge on circular needles. Dave is still deciding whether he wants me to try to shrink it for him. I think a little tightened up would be good, but it is super soft as it is, and nice and long and slouchy. Okay, it's enormous. I need to shrink it!The other sweater that I started at the same time is also a gift, and it isn't done because I ran out of the exact yarn I needed. It is also my handspun alpaca, and the last ball of it I have was spun at a different time and is just enough thicker that I don't get the same gauge and thickness as the rest of the sweater. This is really a bummer because it is  the softest, lace-stitch fronted cardigan, and I was knitting for my friend Stacy in Atlanta. It was supposed to be her Christmas present, but I have been stalled for a couple of weeks now because of the yarn issue. Got to get back to it before it's too warm for her to wear it. Of course, there's always a need for a snuggly sweater on a cool evening in Beaufort, SC."},
{"title": "Before and After", "date": "Saturday, January 07, 2017", "text": "BeforeJust finished a breakfast of scratch buttermilk pancakes and sous vide bacon, and I have to say we've reached a new breakfast height. The bacon cooked for 17 hours in the sous vide and then Dave finished it by searing it on cast iron. It didn't shrink nearly as much as it does when cooked in a pan--Dave says this is because you don't get the extreme protein bunching that you get during higher heat cooking. You also don't get any carbonization (bcb's). Instead it came out decidedly crisp and chewy at the same time.While much of the accomplishment was due to my spouse's incomparable cooking, I am modestly pleased at my own contributions to breakfast. I buttered my pancake, then covered it with apple cider syrup (thank you Chris Hyams), topped it with whipped cream, drizzled on more syrup, and liberally garnished it with the bacon in bits. I accompanied it with some Foggie Morning Brekkie tea from T-WE. Oh Sweet Decadence! Breakfast was so good it got me thinking: Instead of just renting out our apartment, why not also offer B&B possibilities? Even full meal service! Oh not all the time, just as a special extra add-on. Dave has yet to be convinced. But I think it would be cool to offer the occasional full-on luxe experience. I also like to show off Dave's cooking. Well, even if we never end up doing it for the paying guests, friends and family who come to visit and stay in the apartment will definitely be fed!AfterAnd speaking of the apartment, it's time to get that little revenue stream on-line. The contractors are finally done in there, and it's now a two-bedroom space with hardwood floors and travertine marble throughout, new fixtures, and is fully painted. Today after putting away Christmas--except for the lights in the windows, those stay up till March, we're going to go clean the apartment, set-up the furniture that we have, and make lists of what we need to get. I love furnishing a space from the ground up--IKEA here we come! Goal: Have it on HomeAway and/or other appropriate sites by the end of next weekend. Fortunately we have some savvy connections in the VRBO (vacation rental by owner) space as three of the C's from data.world (Chief of Something Or Other) were previously at HomeAway and know how to optimize for maximum results.Talking about getting stuff done in the house makes me itch to get out in the yard to try out my new battery-operated chainsaw, but it's only 23 degrees out there and I just don't have the clothes for it. As I'm now going to Wisconsin for my Master Spinner class next month, and the high expected there today is only 8 degrees F (with a low of -3!), as soon as I finish this post I'm going to go on-line and get another pair of Minus 33 merino long underwear. Put them on under my skirt, add some of my Dad's old wool hunting socks, top it off with the cardigan my father-in-law knitted for me and the scarf my mother-in-law knitted for me, and I'll be ready to go! Though I might want to knit myself some fingerless gloves... More on knitting tomorrow."},

I also talked my partner Todd off a ledge. I think he thinks I'm not committed to my glass work. Well I've got news for everyone: If I'm not committed, I should be... Take that however you'd like. Finally I researched and evaluated spring break vacation options and made reservations. Roatán Honduras, here we come!On the home front it is bitterly cold (the water in the sous vide in the kitchen was 57 degrees tonight and Jessie said it was 54 up in her room). Dave and I are getting ready to snuggle under our One Dog Mr Big comforter from Three Dog Down. Even the cats are snuggling in tight tonight. Today was the second day of our solar panel installation, and I really felt sorry for the installers on the roof. If I had been home and thought of it, I would have had them inside to take a break, get warm and have some hot chocolate mid-day. If it's still cold Monday, I will.The Siyeh Studio Website progresses apace. I hope to have the first live version up by Sunday night--complete with on-line catalog. Access to the catalog will be restricted to the store owners who carry my work. What I most like about the website design tool I'm using is that it's trivial to change the backgrounds and use my own images. Thus I have a different colorway for every page--\"Iris\", shown at left, is on the second page (News).Okay, got to hit publish or I'll miss getting the post up today! Night all."},

Sadly, cleaning the utility room, sweeping and mopping the floors, and putting away Christmas don't qualify, but they're what I've got. What was I thinking last night that both sounded good and at least a little fun? Oh yeah, website development for the studio. Meh. Am I being too grown-up? What happened to the person who would say, \"Screw housework, I'm going to take a day off and (insert Fun Art Recreation Time verb here) today\"?A lot of it is the sheer enormity of getting everything ready to fart. Though this house, with it's myriad spaces, will eventually be the perfect fart space, right now there isn't a single studio that doesn't need a lot of work to get usable--and that's ignoring the fact that none of them are heated. However today's the warmest it's going to get until next Tuesday so if I want fart, I had better get setting up. Meh.

The rest of the day was spent on bookkeeping. I hope I can squeeze something more enjoyable in tomorrow. At least we have a Japanese language/English subtitled version of Hayao Miazaki's Princess Mononoke on the big screen tomorrow night to look forward to.Whatever I do tomorrow will be indoors. After a stunningly beautiful day yesterday, today it was FREEZING! I am back in merino wool long johns, my dad's wool hunting socks, and a comfy cardigan. One thing's for sure--it's too cold to be in the textile, jewelry (aka the greenhouse), or glass studios. Bet it'll be a a good day to finally get a website up.

{"title": "The Garden at Stone's Throw", "date": "Tuesday, January 03, 2017", "text": "It's a beautiful day to sit on the back deck sipping Earl Grey lavender tea and posting. Gallifrey would rather be at the dog park, but he'll get to go soon enough. Got a message from a friend in Missoula the other day saying it was 8 degrees there with a double digit below zero windchill. It's 62 degrees here now and will get up to 70. It feels warmer in the sun. Great day to do a post about gardening!In the better-late-than-never category, I put in my wildflower seeds the other day, and at the end of it all I'm not sure why I dragged my feet so much about it. True, I didn't use the lawn roller to press them into the soil, but I did mix them with a bit of sand and then liberally tossed them about. I also strewed handfuls of seedballs--blue bonnet seeds in clay balls put out by the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center. Those were supposed to be put out anytime between September and Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving, New Years... So maybe I won't get as lush a bloom or maybe also as early a bloom, but surely Something will come up, and I can do better next year.This being winter, it's the perfect time to plan next year's gardens. Over the weekend, I finished the initial design for the raised bed area of the yard which will account for about 1/3 of our property. When we moved in here, most of the yard was already done, or at least the hardscaping was in. It's true that all of the beds need to be cleaned out and replanted and everything could use use a bit of tweaking. But there was no real major design work to be done in the main yard.Our property is odd. It's \"L\" shaped, or, rather, upside down \"L\" shaped so the short leg runs to the right on the top instead of the bottom. The house sits about 2/3 of the way down the long vertical leg. Currently there is nothing in the short leg but the well house off to the side and a large rectangular gravel patch in the middle (where there used to be a commercial greenhouse) surrounded by scrub. This is not, for the curious, where I scattered wildflower seeds yesterday. The seeds went into the only patch of lawn this property has in the very front right over the septic field.The short leg is bounded by driveway or road on all sides: On the left is the private drive we share with two neighbors, on the top is the main street, on the right is our next-door neighbors driveway, and on the bottom is our driveway. As you can see from my sketch on the survey, the land area is about 270 feet long and 135 feet wide. My goal is to put the three beehives along the top of our property (shown on the left in the diagram because the survey is oriented to the north) screened from the private drive by ten feet of scrub, to take out everything but the live oaks, some cedar by the neighbors, the prickly pear stands, and the yucca, and to complete the gravel area with a winding path through raised beds and vertical focal points. And of course there will be a pond. The bees and other wildlife need a pond. I just hope the wildlife doesn't eat my koi.In the raised beds will be a bee and butterfly garden, a dyer's garden, an heirloom crop garden, and an ikebana cutting garden. I'm not planning the beds to be big rectangular plots. Instead they'll be polygons that fit in between the organic meanderings of the path, and in some places they'll be layered on top of each other more a more interesting shape and even easier access.I look forward to making a prettier and more legible plan after I've taken my drawing class! Thanks to my friend Bridget, I know I need to get ready to start planting seeds in little peat pots so I'll be ready to move them out into the garden in a month or so. Better also get the beds built...Now off to pay bills, bring the studio books up to date and send tax info off to our accountant. Of course that all won't get done today, but I have hope for the end of the week."},
{"title": "I Resolve...", "date": "Monday, January 02, 2017", "text": "I'm coming to the end of the second day of January and I have yet to formalize my New Year's resolutions! I had originally started blogging about the garden today, but that post can wait till tomorrow--I need to be resolved.As I mentioned the other day, I am over making big resolutions that are destined to crash and burn by March.  This year I like the sound of a few daily things, a couple of things based on the week, and everything else project-based--more of a goal for 2017 than a resolution. So what are these fine resolutions/goals? I give you... 2017!Daily. Either last year or the year before I thought I might meditate for 15 minutes or so a day. Turns out I'm pretty crappy at meditation. But I like the idea of having an in-the-present, mindful time every day. Should I resolve to do a zentangle a day? I have the book. (\"A Zentangle  A Day\". Really.) Though I am intrigued by the concept, I can't really see committing to doing it every day. Making a zentangle project, sure. But random tangles every day? Too much, too new. Nope, for daily meditation/mindfulness/focus, I'm going to spin 15 minutes a day every day. I even started a Facebook group, Spin15, for it and got a couple of friends in Atlanta to participate. I'd like to see it grow.Another daily goal is to take a picture and post it on Tookapic as part of their 365 project. I got this goal from Stacy Reno, and so far I'm loving it! My daily pics there have both been taken from the deck of Stone's Throw--one yesterday at sunset, and today's at sunrise. Even though I can only post a pic a day, I had to take this one tonight just because I could. It's amazing the way the iPhone can take photos even at night with no tripod.The final daily goal took both more thought and a convoluted direction. I had originally planned to keep it simple and just blog every day, but I don't want to set myself up for failure (again), and I have other outlets for writing. Besides the blog, I have a bound journal where I put the hard stuff, the ugly stuff. The stuff that's in my head, and occasionally my heart, that I can't share with anyone, but which I need to get out of there nonetheless. That journal is carefully handwritten forcing me to take it slow because there are no erasures or do-overs. I also dabble with the idea of writing a book--no, NOT another non-fiction how-to book. I'd have to slit my wrists first. Fiction, baby. One of the multitudes of stories that run around my brain getting little, fussy paw-prints everywhere. And then there's the Artist's Way project that I tried (and failed to complete) last year (or was it the year before?). So a daily focused writing or artist's pages. More than a Facebook post or a twit, I mean tweet (which I don't do anyway).And that's enough for every day.Weekly. I already wrote a mini-rant about the concept of the week--how the Babylonians screwed us over and how we should just ignore this concept of time that is not based on any earthly (day), lunar (month) or solar (year) event. However we have been inundated since birth with the idea of weekdays and weekends and starting over every seven days. My nod to this completely irrelevant marker comes in two goals, and both are health-oriented (what are the odds?). For the first, I am going to work out one day a week. I can do more, I can increase to two or more in later months, but I can't do fewer. I am also only going to have a cocktail or wine with dinner four nights a week. Yeah, that seems like a lot, but right now it's probably closer to seven so I'm going to set myself up for the win with four. In February, three.The Year. Now come the really fun goals--the ones for the year. This year I want to...Glass: Close out the Atlanta studio and sell it; finish setting up the Austin studio, build a strong website with a good on-line wholesale store and put a marketing plan in place that replaces the wholesale shows I used to do; develop new work (potentially including glass covered books); figure out the best way of photographing it for on-line sales.Wood: Design and build the headboard for our bed and my desk, and refinish and inlay our dining room table.Stone's Throw: Put in the raised bed gardens and a koi pond; start keeping bees; plant the existing gardens; repair and put back into service the waterfall, stream and ponds; furnish, list, and begin renting out the apartment; remodel the master bedroom (just the floor) and the master bathroom (everything).Ikebana: Start a study group and teach regular Ichiyo ikebana classes; continue working on my Master's certification.Spinning: Begin the Master certification process; put the great wheel together and paint on the finish and sealer.Farm2Yarn: Identify outlets for my roving; build an on-line store; develop a retail fiber business.Weaving: Sell or donate the 60\" LeClerc Nilus loom; finish setting up the textile studio; weave a first project on the AVL loom.Jewelry making: Set up a silversmithing/jewelry area; Join the Austin Gem and Mineral Society and start learning lapidary techniques.Paper: Experiment more with suminagashi and European paper marbling; learn book-binding.Cooking: Make fresh bread and pasta at least once a month; learn to make Kombucha and ferment vegetables with a mortier pilon; strain and finish the infusions I made.Soap Making: Make enough soap for our use and for gifts, and work though a good part of my soap supply stash.Art: Take a drawing class (already scheduled); restart wheel-throwing pottery (sign-up for another class); cover the longhorn skull I got in December with stones or glass.Entertainment: Dinner and a movie out with my sweetie at least twice a month; travel for spring break; summer in Montana.Wow. That sounds like a very full, very fun year!"},

Maybe that should be a New Year's resolution: Can't get up till I've posted for the day. Nope that sounds like a recipe for disaster--I'd just find myself in bed all day.The sun is shining here in Austin and it's supposed to be 74 degrees today. I'm going to get out into the yard and scatter my wildflower seeds. It's getting a bit late--especially for the bluebonnets--but I have been dragging my feet about using the seed roller--even after Dave so kindly put it together for me. I also want nothing more than to take down the Christmas tree, but I have a feeling would strenuously object so I can wait till Wednesday when she goes back to school. I'll leave the lights and glass snowflakes in the windows for awhile, but it's time for the ornaments and the Christmas towels, the angels and the garland, to be packed away for another year. One thing I will get to today is the all the gift-wrapping paraphernalia. We reuse bows and other package decoration and have literally boxes full of them. I also buy gift wrap on-sale and hadn't realized till this year just how many rolls we have. I really think we might not need to buy Christmas wrap for the rest of our lives... It's time to make a permanent package wrapping station. I took the idea from the container store and am tweaking it a bit to use some of the built-in drawers and pegboard in the utility room and the Elfa storage units I moved from Atlanta.Before getting to the chores, however, I think I'll see if I can get the spouse interested in a little walk to the end of our street with the dogs. It doesn't sound like much, but there are serious hills at each end so you do end up walking uphill both ways. And, hey, no snow!"},

{"title": "Timey Wimey", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2016", "text": "I sit cozy under the lovely English wool blanket I got at Stonehenge last year sipping English Breakfast tea in a Japanese style tea cup I bought from the artist at last year's American Made show, and I cast my gaze to the year to come. As so often happens at this time of the year I reevaluate my activities, routines, pursuits and passions, and I think of how I might tweak them for an even better year. We call this \"New Year's Resolutions\".I'm sure someone has drawn a lovely graph with time on the bottom and emotions marching up the left  showing how one goes from euphoric steadfast resoluteness, to anxiety at the thought of trying to live up to this monumental list, to harried just-keeping-up-with-it-all, to guilt at missing one instance of whatever but vowing not to let it bring you down, to complete and utter disgust at the time and energy wasted on resolving to change because you end up worse off than when you started! For me that cycle usually takes January through March.As I write this post I'm having a bit of déja vu. I suppose it's not surprising that I would have railed at the urge to make (and inevitably fail at) New Year's Resolutions sometime in the last ten years of blogging. But as I don't seem able to keep myself from making them, I'll go on writing and share a couple of ways I am hoping to be more successful this year.Start Small and Expand. Okay, (many) other (smarter) people have surely thought of this one, but it has never been in my nature to commit to do something at less than 100% so it's a new concept for me. What's not new to me is evaluating my physical state (who doesn't after the extreme gluttony of the holidays?) and deciding I need to make some changes. In the past I would join a gym, sign up for classes, plan to work out 3-5 days a week for 30-60 minutes a day and poop out within the first month. This year I am going to set a goal of working out one day a week for 30 minutes. I can do more if I feel like it once I'm at it, but 30 minutes on the elliptical once a week is enough to meet my initial goal. (I still have an LA Fitness membership that I signed up for over a year ago and haven't used since May.) My hope is that by March instead of doing nothing, I'll at least still be doing one day and maybe even have expanded to two.Screw the Babylonians. What, who? According to the BBC, the Babylonians are probably responsible for dividing the month into weeks--the one time period not derived from the movement of a celestial body. Apparently Babylonians were all about the number seven (based on the seven heavenly bodies of the sun, mars, the moon, mercury, venus, jupiter, and saturn) and thought rituals--like resolutions--should be performed every seven days. The Japanese and the Chinese thought so too. Well I think seven is a very stressful number. It's very hard to try to squeeze a whole bunch of things into seven days and trying to repeat it is just asking for a nervous breakdown. Making things rituals or routines based on seven days has NEVER worked for me. Instead, my resolutions are mostly going to be project and seasonally driven--not regular and routine.Project time is a better way to look at time for me. How many days does a project I resolve to do need? Days, unlike weeks, are not arbitrary. They are filled with the rhythms of eating and doing and sleeping, and even with the insomnia I've been having lately I am still physically grounded in the timing of a day as I need a certain number of hours of sleep in one, so I can only accomplish so much other stuff. If I'm smart, I can lay out a year's worth of projects and be happy and feel like I've accomplished them even as I swap one for another and let some go by the wayside.Don't make too many resolutions. Oh well. I won't succeed at this one as there are always so many things I want to do and the thought of not being able to do them sometime in the next year is unbearable because a year seems so long and the next one so far away. That's my inner child talking. A year used to be so long it was incomprehensible: I couldn't hold the concept of it in my mind. Now I blink and a week is over (what happened to this sacred break week which every year promises a great long space of time to do things and is now over with nothing done?). I sneeze and it's the next month. But in the same way I couldn't grasp the enormity of a year as a child, I can't quite equate the brevity of a year with my adult reality, so instead I resolve to make a list of things I want to accomplish now, to revisit it often throughout the year, and to make changes as appropriate. I resolve to be F-L-E-X-I-B-L-E. Maybe I should have titled this post \"Elastigirl\"..."},

Well she's not just in charge of making sure those who cut you off in traffic get what's coming to them. She's also the when-one-door-closes-another-door-opens chick, and she perks up when you invoke her name.I got an email this morning that the Master Spinner class I am registered for in Destin in February has been cancelled for lack of interest, i.e., people forking over dough to attend. This hole in my dance card has brought up options which I thought were closed and is making me rethink my continuing education choices for the year. Or, as Dave would say, \"I've got a date with Destiny, and she's ordered the lobster.\" I have the option of attending the same class, at the same time, but in Wisconsin, or I could see if there is still space at the Philly wholesale show also scheduled then. The show is probably full. I just went through a loooong post detailing why doing wholesale shows is not in my best business interest, and yet seeing friends, having a surety of orders for the year (if at a pretty high cost) is beguiling. Wisconsin in February, cold. Philly in February, cold. Wisconsin has SPINNING. Philly has glass friends and income instead of outgo (or at least more income than outgo--I would hope). It's a lot more expensive to fly to Wisconsin. And longer. It's a lot more expensive to stay in Philly.It's easy in these situations (for me at least) to immediately react instead of pausing to take a few moments to ask myself, \"Was my initial decision to follow this course well thought out? Do the circumstances that caused me to make it still hold true?\" My answers this time are sort of and maybe. Not so helpful. I thought out the Master Spinner program in terms of do I really want to do it, can I afford it both in terms of time and money, and is it scheduled for a good time for me. Those are all still true so I guess it's well thought out--though since all the criteria are pretty much about me and not my family, business, or long-term goals I had to go with \"sort of\". In terms of the circumstances causing me not to do the Philly wholesale show, all the reasons for not doing shows at all still hold true, but now the change in show management for Philly does make it more attractive to me--as does the post-Christmas bank balance.My brain hurt and I had to take a break so I called Dee to see what she knew about availability of booth space at the February show. She said she thought there were still booths available, but, having been a good friend and read my previous long business post, she talked me off the ledge by reminding me of all the reasons I didn't want to do it and encouraged me to sit this one out to see how everyone else likes it--and to give the new website and marketing ideas a chance.So. February. In Wisconsin. Time to source more warm clothes..."},

Then we're off to the antique mall so Jessie can take pictures of cool items and vignettes to use in her art class next semester--it's an over-the-break assignment from her art teacher.And speaking of art... If I weren't doing enough already, I've signed up to take a 12-week drawing class at The Contemporary Austin. The class is Tuesday mornings from 9:30-12:00 and I'm hoping to learn how to pull the ideas that float around my head out and accurately capture them on paper. I feel like a five year-old when I try to draw, and I get so caught up in the process that I lose the content.-------------We're back from an extended trip out which morphed to include picking up the license plates for Dave's car, buying some drawing and book-making supplies at Jerry's Artarama, and drooling over journals at Iona Handcrafted Books.

Not-quite-half my studio is also in Atlanta, and the other half is one eighth usable, three eighths a higgledy-piggledy mess, and a smidge unfinished. Another big change is that normally I would be frantically preparing for my big show of the year right now, but I don't have a show scheduled for this year so instead I sip my rapidly-cooling tea and try to figure out how to proceed.I could just go on a hunt for the apple tv remotes that have gotten lost in the couch cushions and forget all about pesky marketing, materials-sourcing, website development, and balancing the books for 2016. Or I could go clean the kitchen, sweep out the fireplace, put away the gift wrap, do laundry, or curl up with a good book and a hot, fresh, cup of tea and revel in the utter silence of a house without contractors. But no, I am not a quitter or an avoider. I am a head-on reinventor. So how am I going to reinvent and drive my business this year?Wholesale shows. The original lure of doing wholesale shows was that they would bring in reorders. After 11 years of doing them I can say that I could count the number of spontaneous reorders from galleries in that time on two hands. It's not a spontaneous order from a gallery if I have to contact them and nudge them into placing an order. I don't need the high dollar, physical, and mental energy cost of a wholesale show if I also have to make a nudge. Maybe I am just soured on the whole wholesale show experience. I didn't have success at the Gift Markets either in Atlanta or Dallas (I never tried New York), but maybe it's because I didn't give them enough chance by doing them for several years. Unfortunately they cost too much to keep trying, hoping to build up a clientele from them. I also can't compete in price with the mass-produced imported items which are also offered at those venues.The alternative to Gift Shows, the Fine American Craft Shows, went through a nasty little war that ended with the dissolution of one (the better one to my mind), and the sale of the other to Emerald Expositions Jewelry Group. There is a third which has one wholesale/retail show, but the wholesale component is reputed to be insignificant to the participating artists. That condition may change however, based on the happenings with the other two shows. Personally, I'm interested to see how the evolution of the one that was sold one turns out (interested like I might be to watch a boa constrictor devour a mouse, or a tarantula wasp parasitize its host). In any case, my gut feeling is that the $6,000+ I would spend to do a wholesale show could be better spent on other things.Retail shows. Is it time to get back to a balanced mixed of wholesale and retail sales? I have already applied for an 11-day show next December here in Austin that I have wanted to do for over 15 years, the Armadillo Christmas Bazaar. It's a show that's 41 years old and there are at least two artists still doing it that have done it for 40 years. I couldn't afford to do it if I had to come in from out of state (the main reason I am not doing the One of a Kind Show in Chicago anymore), but now that I live here again it becomes doable. It's a beast though: a marathon show that runs 10 am to 10 pm everyday with live music playing the whole time. Art shows with live music are always a tricky proposition as they can be sensorily overwhelming and extra exhausting depending on the music and how close your booth is to it. I leave myself in the hands of Karma for this one. If I get in or not, I can and will see the silver lining.But what about more? Should I consider doing more local Austin shows or shows local to where I am at different parts of the year? What shows are even still open for application? Then there's the whole indoor vs. outdoor show thing. It's been a loooong time since I did an outdoor show. I would need to replace the canopy for my Lightdome tent and completely redesign my display fixtures for my current work. And what work would I sell? Mine? Mine with Todd? Mine with Bill (the steel stands)?And am I really at a place in my life where I want to start a new course all over again? Let's be honest. To really be successful at weekend retail shows you can't just do one or two a year. That's how you make pocket money, and that pocket money comes at the cost of killing yourself. Unless you're lucky enough to get to set-up the day before the show starts, you get up at the crack of dawn having loaded everything in your vehicle the night before, drive to the show to wait in line to load in and set-up, stressing that you won't be ready when the show starts. After you've lugged everything to your booth location you wrestle with figuring out how to set up the tent, race to put out and price all the work, and then spend 2-3 days smiling and chatting with random strangers interspersed with infrequent potty breaks and cold sandwiches and snacks. At the end of it all is a hurried break-down of the tent--including the requisite pinched fingers--and pack-up of the work, followed by a mad dash to get your car in line for load-out before midnight and the drive home. To make retail shows worthwhile you can't just do one every so often; you would need to do them regularly and often so that you could take advantage of being packed and going straight from one to the next without the need to unpack and repack.The show warriors, the artists who make a living by doing weekend retail shows, don't do a couple of shows a year, and they don't wing it. They have spent years honing their schedule and streamlining their processes for maximal return and minimal fatigue and cost. They have built a circuit where they are known, and their presence is anticipated by an established customer base every year. Show warriors know before ever arriving at a show where to get in line for load-in and how to make it go more smoothly. They know where their booth is located, how best to set-up their tent at the site, and have equipment to get everything speedily from the vehicle to the site. They also know where to park their vehicle for the day or the show. They know where to stay and where to eat. Routine is the show artist's friend. The rhythm and process that come from repetition make everything go more smoothly and less strenuously to keep fatigue to a minimum. Energy is saved to handle a few new things instead of a continual barrage of them. This familiarity with venue and event extends to the actual flow of the show and break-down, leaving the artist able to move through it without much thought or effort, sparing their attention for unexpected things like bad weather, near-by construction affecting the event, or traffic accidents.I am not just blowing smoke out of my hat spouting all this stuff about show warriors. I remember building my own routines and rhythms over years of doing the Buyer's Market show in Philadelphia. I now believe that it was the anticipated effort of having to establish new routines that upset so many artists and buyers when the show moved from Philly to DC. It wasn't just that people don't like change, it was the wisdom and foresight that acknowledged how much more the show would cost in terms of energy and effort as we had to learn new processes and create new location-specific routines. In the end, the cost was just too much for the both the artists and the buyers and the show died.It would take me 2-3 years to suss out which weekend shows worked for me based on revenue, timing, and location. It would take 2-3 years to build up a strong clientele at new shows. I had a reminder of that truth this year when I got two calls from people who had seen my work at the One of a Kind Show in Chicago in previous years who were disappointed not to see me this year. It would probably also take 2-3 years to develop packing, load-in/set-up, sales, and break-down/load-out processes that wouldn't break me. In short, if I wanted to do weekend shows and earn more than just pocket money, I would need to become a show warrior which would mean extended time away from my home and family--or dragging some portion of them along with me... We all give a collective shudder at the prospect. I'm not up for either option. And I'd need a camper or an RV. Dave's not up for any of those options. Glad we could work through that one here and save me the expense of replacing my Lightdome canopy. No weekend art fairs unless I decide to do them with the goal and expectation of pocket money or some other reward.The Internet. Much has changed in the world of fine craft since the 1980's and early1990's. Before the Internet, people bought art and craft at galleries or art festivals. The perception--and it was mostly true--was that you could buy directly from the artist for half what you'd pay a gallery, and the artist would get all the money with none of it going to the money-grubbing gallery. The last bit was complete codswallop of course, but that's a subject for a different post on the value of galleries to an artist... Although that post might also have a bit more nostalgia than reality in it today too.Artists communicated new work to their gallery customers with printed catalogs ranging from expensive, glossy, and professionally printed to run-off-at-the-copy-shop and stapled together by hand. They sent postcards and mailed out newsletters detailing new work. Artists who did retail shows kept mailing lists and sent out postcards to the people who bought their work at craft fairs telling them when they'd be back in the area doing another show.Enter the Internet with Etsy, Wholesalecrafts.com, and a host of others. Welcome to email and websites and newsletter-generating services. Heck, welcome to digital photos instead of prints and slides (remember when applying to exhibit at a show meant sending them slides of your work?!?). Gallery owners--and retail customers--can browse on-line catalogs and watch videos of artists in their studios as they sip coffee. They can read the message, see the brand, catch the excitement all from their couches, and, with a quick click and a tap, they can send credit card numbers winging through the wires to purchase their heart's desire. All that without talking to anyone. There are many artists who have successfully moved (or started) their businesses online, and there is a lot to be said for that model in terms of minimizing physical effort, travel (time away from family), and cost (just saving the money from two $6,000 shows a year is a whole lot of Internet seed money).I remember sitting around the table with a bunch of artist friends after a long day at the Buyer's Market Show and saying, \"Wouldn't it be nice not to have to do set-up, and break-down, and spend all this money?\" It looks like now is my chance. So what do I need to do? First thing is to decide wholesale, retail, or both.Wholesale on-line. I already have a customer base of all the galleries I have worked with over the past 10+ years so I wouldn't need to start from scratch for wholesale marketing. Shipping is also easier with wholesale as it's big orders--not onsey-twosies--so I wouldn't spend as much time on it dollar for dollar. Making the jump from a primarily wholesale business to a wholesale on-line business doesn't seem to need such a big investment of time either.Retail on-line. While Etsy sounds grand, I don't think it's so easy to take an established wholesale business and turn it into an equally lucrative retail business on Etsy. It takes time, a lot of little sales, and a lot of followers/reviews to build a successful Etsy store--there's just too much competition out there to even be found on their site. So I'd probably do better with my own website and maybe Facebook. An on-line retail presence would also benefit from being paired with a year or so of doing weekend art fairs to get the word out and a market going. As we've already determined that the idea of becoming a show warrior is somewhat unattractive at my current age and place in life, I'd have to have a t-shirt graphically spelling out \"I'm too old for this shit\" to wear everyday to every show. So it looks like just retailing on-line is a non-starter. Wholesale and retail on-line. Short and sweet: If I started retailing on-line, that would (rightly so) piss off my wholesale accounts so I could kiss many of them good-bye. Looks like straight wholesale on-line is the way I'll go.I need a plan. So how to establish and grow a primarily on-line wholesale business? For my existing customers, I need to engage them electronically, and put new routines and processes into place to keep my work in front of them when they are placing orders and filling holes in inventory. I need to make my work pop for them in images as well as it does in real life. I need to make it easy for them to order, and I need to make it trivial for them to share my work and story with customers looking for special pieces to commission.  Once I have all of this set-up, I need to identify ways of attracting new customers. Regular communication in the form of old-fashioned postcards, e-cards, and new work notices will need to become routine.I need a place. There are a couple of marketplaces out there for wholesaling fine craft. I tried the one run by IndieMe (formerly Wholesalecrafts.com) for several years but was never able to make the way they designed their site work for me. It was cludgy, extremely time-consuming, and ultimately unattractive. There is another site just starting up called Best in American Made. I will give them a look, but I will not use any third-party marketplace as my primary presentation site--they are too just generic for me and the extra potential buyers are cancelled out by the extra competition. It's time for a new Siyeh Studio website with videos and text providing stories about the pieces and the studio, an on-line store (wholesale login required), an interactive map with locations of galleries that carry my work, and a blog for information about new work and artist in the gallery visits. Enter Wix.This time I am not going to open the web design application and just start winging it. This time I am going to sit down with some paper and colored pencils and do a layout and an old fashioned table of contents. I'll also have to put on my big girl panties and splash out the bucks for a real on-line store option that will have the work viewable by everyone, but the pricing and ordering options only visible to wholesale accounts.I need a schedule. All of these new activities that need to become routine need to be scheduled. Some of them I can tackle now, some are predicated upon others which do not exist yet, and some are part one and part the other. Take the website for example. I have images of some work. I have pieces of text that can be reused from previous sites. If I just sit down and start working on it, time will pass and it will probably never be made live. Instead, after I do my initial design, I am going to build a schedule of staged releases leading up to complete go-live so that I keep moving forward, and I have a series of incremental wins.I need new work. Everything described so far is outside of creating the actual work. I have been very lax at that in the past few years, but luckily Todd is all about creating new work. Since he cannot be tasked with anything electronic, this seems a perfect thing for him to take ownership of in our partnership. I still need to design new glass--not difficult with all the changes in color availability occurring at Bullseye Glass--but he can take my glass pieces and make new work out of them.I need a sandwich. Well, maybe not a sandwich, but something infinitely more tasty that involves a sort of bread, meat, and condiment-like things. There is one last piece of Dave's phenomenal Beef Wellington (rare beef tenderloin coated in butter-soaked mushroom paste, pâté de foie gras, and prosciutto and wrapped in puff pastry--there are other things in it, but those are the highlights for me) left in the fridge. I think I'll pair it with a Diet Coke (if the family has left me any) and go low-tech and sketch out a website and a plan."},
{"title": "Christmas 2016", "date": "Sunday, December 25, 2016", "text": "As Loreena McKennitt sings Emmanuel, and Dave tells me that George Michael has died, the sun sets on another Christmas Day. Now I settle into my comfy chair to post and sip a dram of the Highland Park 12 year old single malt whiskey that Dave generously shared with me from his advent calendar . He is enjoying a dram of the Half-Century Blend Batch 1--a blended Scotch whiskey over 50 years old. I love the flavor of that one but won't be buying a bottle any time soon. I would have thought that Dave would like the Highland Park as it tastes strongly of smokey peat (really strongly), and he has been all about the art of smoking (food, that is) today.For the food science geek in him we gave him a Polyscience hand-held food smoker and a lot of different flavored wood chips. As he played with it--smoking a Pillsbury orange roll from breakfast--he commented that back-of-the-envelope math said he could smoke over 12,000 scallops with all those wood chips. Geek indeed. As the day went on he contemplated smoking tomatoes, the Beef Wellington he is making for dinner, and bourbon. At least he admitted that smoking champagne would be odd.Thank you again to my sister-in-law Jan for her annual gift to me of the Isabel Bloom Christmas Angel. I have one for every Christmas Dave and I have been married--22 in all. It was especially wonderful to set them up this year in our new forever home.The opening of the Christmas presents did not begin early at our house today as Jessie and I were both up till 3:30 am finishing our gifts for Dave and wrapping our presents. Dave got up at 7:00 and wrapped his presents while we snored on. This Christmas marked a change in our family dynamic. It wasn't the first year Jessie made gifts for us, but it was the first year that we were both left in awe both of her artistic talent and her wonderfully quirky style. For her dad she is doing a colored pencil rendition of the cover of Terry Pratchett's book Small Gods--Dave's favorite of his works. She included the following Calvin and Hobbes cartoon in the box with it.I got to open the first present of the day at the J's insistence. Her wrapping was creative, and the best part of it was the handwritten text in the middle which stated, \"It's more me this way, accept it :)\". The Ho Ho Ho's covering the unwrapped part of the box were also handwritten. As everyone could have predicted--and she counted on--I cried when I saw her gift. She painted a series of watercolors from Studio Ghibli movies and a watercolor postcard for me. When she asked me which was my favorite it was difficult, but I'm going to have to go with the combination of the postcard based on a bit from Moulin Rouge and the still from My Neighbor Totoro. I can't wait to go out this week and have them all framed. (Well, as soon as she finishes them!)The chef theme carried on for Dave with a great set of measuring cups from his parents in odd sizes (2/3 c., 3/4 c., 1-1/2 c.) and a monogrammed spatula, and a data.world Chef Sparkle hoodie and set of dishcloths from me.The creative presentation of the day award at the end of it all went to Jessie for her other gift to her father--a replacement Gundum Calling t-shirt for the one he loved and left in San Antonio earlier in the fall. We were at dinner Friday night and he was bemoaning the loss of the shirt and that it was no longer available and Jessie, with her superior Internet fu, went on-line on her phone and found one for him. I ordered it for her and it won't be here for a week or so, but she photoshopped Gundum onto an image of a flip-phone, printed it out, folded the picture around my phone--onto which she had placed the ringtone for London Calling from the Clash and associated it with her phone number--and wrapped up my phone. When she gave the present to Dave to unwrap she also called my phone from hers so it was playing London Calling as he opened it. That kid has mad showmanship skills.After opening presents J took a nap, I took a shower, and Dave moved into the second stage of Beef Wellington prep. Then it was off to the movies to see \"Sing\". We all loved it. I cried. (Do you sense a theme for the day?).It was a poignant day for me--as all Christmas days are. It's a day when I contemplate the state of the world and the people and animals in it, when I wish wish for peace on earth and goodwill towards all, a day when I cherish my family and friends and give thanks for all of them. Sadly this year it's also a time for sensing the fragility of the world and the impending, waiting, breath-held feeling of bad things to come with the new year. But we will be strong, we will rationally, calmly, and with conviction and patience, weather whatever comes. We will support those who need our aid, and we will stand for justice and fairness. Gloria, in excelsis deo. Or, as Dave likes to say, \"Gloria, G-L-O-R-I-A, Glo-o-ria!\"Now I listen to Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring and prepare to feast on the most magnificent of Roast Beast Feasts: the many-times-aforementioned Beef Wellington. It will be served with a bottle of Roederer champagne and a Seghesio zinfandel, set with beeswax candles, and accompanied by part two of The Hogfather. Boy am I glad we didn't watch it all last night--it would have been 5:00 am before Jessie and I got to bed!Merry Christmas to my Christian friends, Happy Chanukah to my Jewish friends, Happy Solstice to my Wiccan friends. Be safe, be warm, be loved and love to everyone."},

The cats are already in their transport carrier waiting to go and not happy about any of it. Kaiju is probably going to snub me for the next few days until he gets over his huff. Boy, that cat can sulk!It's a grey, misty day here in Austin. The roofers have not finished the roof yet, and even though they assured me it was sealed against the rain, I spent a bit of time yesterday putting bowls and towels around the house to catch the drips and cataloguing the water ingress points. *Sigh*.I am back from a week and a half of travel for family, for ikebana, and for bees. It was all exciting and exhilerating, and my brain is full, but now it's time to get back to the projects I left in progress here at Stone's Throw. But for the moment, I'm going to sit curled up on the sectional with a cup of jasmine rose green tea, listening to my Daily Mix #2 from Spotify (Foreigner, old Doobie Brothers and Boston--to name a few), and writing a regrouping post. It is worthwhile to note that my favorite addition to the house so far is the on-demand water heater on the kitchen sink: Perfect temperature water for tea (adjustable based on tea variety) instantly. It's more than a feeling. ;-)A week and a half ago I headed to Atlanta for the annual Ichiyo Ikebana of Atlanta Retreat. While I was there I finished up the work for the Junior Associate Master certification. I should get my certificate from the Iemoto in Tokyo in the new year. It was an intense full day and two half days. At the end of it I had done six arrangements and regained both my confidence and my groove.Now to start teaching in Austin! (Corrected my first post which listed teaching in Atlanta instead of Austin--thanks Bill for the catch!) Jessie is my first student--she has expressed the desire to be the youngest ikebana master on record. This is probably not a good time of the year to begin offering classes with Thanksgiving and Christmas staring many people in the face, but I don't want to wait till next year. Better to start now and give people the idea of gifting lesson packages for Christmas.First step: a website. Actually my first step was to make sure I have the equipment and the confidence to be able to teach classes: check and check. So this week I begin the website! I own the domains austinichiyo.com, ichiyoaustin.com, and hillcountryikebana.com and the studio name will be some riff on them. Last night I practiced and made an arrangement for Jessie's birthday. The theme of the birthday celebration was Dr. Strange and the colors were red and yellow and I had picked up lilies, tulips and greenery from HEB (local grocery chain) on Friday, but didn't get the arrangement done before going out of town Saturday through yesterday.Back from the vet, and now I think it's time for a nap..."},
{"title": "The Colors of My Life", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2016", "text": "And now for something completely different... for me anyway. Yesterday was the quarterly visit to have the hair managed--could be cut, could be color, but usually something needs to happen about every three months. This time, on a complete whim as I sat there in the chair, I decided to go for a streak of color--no, make that two streaks. \"Should they be the same color? Different colors? Different colors shading into other different colors?\", Gabrielle asked. Oh heck, why do a little when you can do a lot, \"Different colors shading into other different colors!\" So now I have two mermaid hair streaks--or as I prefer to think of them, peacock feathers. They look pretty dramatic in these photos, but really they hide and shyly peek out from under a fall of natural hair (well, it's a natural color for some people...). I sported the new do at the Weaver's and Spinner's Association meeting last night and was surprised to see that every third or fourth person there had peacock hair of some variety. I guess people who deal regularly with textiles just gravitate towards color in fiber--even their own. Of course a less charitable person might say it's something women of a certain age who should know better also do. Come to think of it, I mostly see strong women artists of my age who show their inner beauty with an outer flair (flare?).It's been awhile since I've posted. Spinzilla is now over--I spun almost three miles (5008 yds) of fiber. That's more than I did last year, but less than I hoped to do this year. I really had it in my head that I had the bandwidth and the stamina to do 5 miles. Snort. Maybe next year during the flying pig migration. The yarn on the left, I plied from previous spinning sessions. In the middle is my super-secret project yarn that I intended to spin for Spinzilla, and to the right (looking much like the yarn in the middle) is the roving (black alpaca and white silk) from which the project yarn was spun. Besides completing my Spinzilla project yarn, I also finished my first baby sweater! The picture at right is from right after I finished knitting before I sewed it together, added the buttons, wove in the ends, washed and blocked it so it looks a bit rough. Of course I didn't take a picture of it when it was completely done... But maybe I can get a picture of the adorable Brynn Jacob (who was born just last week!) in it. Jessie was a bit miffed at this project as I still have four baby sweaters on the needles that I started for her and never finished. It was much easier with this one as all I had to do was knit. Had Brynn been my baby, this sweater would also still be on the needles and relegated to the corner of the textile studio.Today is a very special day for me, it's my wedding anniversary. Twenty one years ago today, after knowing each other for less than six months, Dave Griffith and I were wed. I made my dress (with a lot of hand-sewing help from my mom), Dave made the cake, wrote the vows, and wrote our invitations. The text on the invitation is as true today as it was then, and I can only hope for 2121  more years to come.Now it's time to get into the studio and get some glass in the kiln. I have much more to write--the promised details on Ichiyo ikebana, the current status of the renovations at Stone's Throw, the progress on the glass studio, the textile studio, and the greenhouse (aka as the wet studio), but there's plenty of time. Next week Becky is coming for a week of sybaritic pleasure (lots of fiber will be involved, some spa time, shopping, a fair bit of wine, laughter, and relaxation--as well as no housework, no cooking, no laundry, and no chauffering!). There might be posting."},
{"title": "Mastery", "date": "Tuesday, October 04, 2016", "text": "Spinning on the back deck yesterday by one of the new pondsI mentioned in my last post that I am recommencing my ikebana studies and working towards my Master's certification in the Ichiyo School. Well, as of yesterday, I am also beginning the Master Spinner Program through Olds College in Alberta, Canada. I have wanted to take that program for a few years and not had the bandwidth. Part of the beauty of the move to Austin and re-establishing myself is that I get to also reset my bandwidth. So come mid-February I will be in Orlando for a week immersed in the coursework for the first year of the Master Spinner program.After the week of in-class work, the rest of the coursework is independent study that will take anywhere from a couple of months to a year to complete. Work is sent back to the college for grading, and consists of spun samples and skeins and writings. The writings are regular college level and require standard formatting and bibliographic references. The program consists of six course levels (typically taking six years to complete) and covers all stages of fiber prep, a wide range of fiber types (specific sheep breeds to cellulose, cotton, silk, nylon, angora, etc.) spinning techniques (woolen, worsted, novelty), dyeing--in short, everything you'd expect to learn in a Master's program. I am so excited!!!!! This February course is a jump-start for me and I *might* even be able to also take level 2 next year while we're in Montana in June: Olds College is just north of us in Alberta and they offer all the courses in the Master's series every June during their Fiber Week.Plying from both ends of the same ball of singles yarnNow on with our regularly scheduled programming: Spinzilla! Yesterday I spent clearing off bobbins (plying the singles on them into yarn and then skeining it). I get to count the plying towards my Spinzilla yardage, just not the spinning... Since this is the first technical spinning post in a while I probably should revisit some terminology. Spinning fiber means twisting it so that it holds together and is stronger than it is untwisted. If you leave the fiber in this state it is called a single and there are things you can do to it to keep it from untwisting. Most commercial yarn you see has been plied which means to twist two or more singles together in the opposite direction from which they were originally spun. Because you twist them in the opposite direction when you ply them together, the twists balance out and the yarn hangs straight--it doesn't come untwisted.There was one project I had on a bobbin that I couldn't just ply off and that is a gradient yarn I am making from a couple of smooth batts from Lunabudknits. I bought two batts so that I could spin each one following the color gradient and then ply them together the same way. That will give me one long skein that goes from pale lilac through violet to soft dark grey. This isn't the project I wanted to do for Spinzilla, and yet I do want to finish it, and all yardage counts! Last night a few of us from our Spinzilla team got together at Hill Country Weavers and spun for a couple of hours and I finished spinning the first batt and made good progress on the second. I hope to finish it today--though it's already noon and I am still working on Other Things than spinning.dark brown llama roving and JigThe main project I had planned for Spinzilla is a blended yarn spun from dark brown llama and black merino sheep wool. The llama roving (roving is fiber which has been washed and then combed or brushed--brushing is called carding and is done with something that looks like a pet brush--so that it all lies in mostly one direction and is ready for easy spinning) is gorgeous, but I want to make a sweater out of it and llama fiber doesn't have any bounce to it like wool does. The bounce comes from the crimp of the fiber and it's what makes a baggy sweater go back into its original shape when you wash it. Llama fiber--at least the fiber I have--is more like silk and will have great drape, but it doesn't have crimp, so it won't have much memory and is likely to bag. That's why I want to blend it with the merino wool which is still a very soft fiber but also has good crimp and will help the sweater hold its shape. The bad news is that I don't know if I have any black merino on hand, and the batch I ordered from Ashland Bay isn't here yet and might not be before Spinzilla is over. The good news is that Austin is surrounded by great fiber stores, and the Happy Ewe in Jonestown has plenty of the exact roving I need. I'll take a road trip this afternoon after I get some more spinning in...Empty bobbins and plied yarns--Ready for Spinzilla!"},

Everything is out of our home of 13 years and we are scheduled to close on it, transferring it to the new family who will make it their own, this afternoon. I'd like to say I'm sad because of all the people I have in Atlanta, but I'm not. I'm sad at being away from them but not sad to let that house go and to embrace Stone's Throw more thoroughly. I need to move on.And I wasn't the only one who needed to move on: The three fish from the pond in our backyard also had to find another home as the contractor doing repairs for the new owners had to drain the pond and leave it empty for several days so he could re-line it. So I bought a cooler, a pump with a couple of aerator stones, and a cigarette lighter adapter to run the pump, and the fish rode in the front seat of the UHaul with me to Austin. Now they have their own little pond on the back deck with some of the plants from the Atlanta pond (which were also going to be displaced by the work there) to shelter them. In fact I had so much fun setting up the pond for them that I set up another one on the other side of the deck seating area and stocked it with six little koi from the water garden store here. The longterm plan is to put a big pond in the front yard next year for fish and water lilies, but for now they are good on the deck.I was in Atlanta last week and part of the week before to have another glass sale in the studio and for that one I even managed to part with some of my dragon's hoard: sheets of glass for stained glass from Youghiogheny, Kokomo, Fischer, St. Gobain, and even Fremont. I let go two of the unused fiberglass forms and patterns for Tiffany's koi and peony lamps that I had always planned to do, but never set aside the time. It felt good. I met a lovely couple of Makers and she wanted to pick up stained glass after a many-year hiatus. I enjoyed sharing my handpicked sheets from the past 30 years with her, and was even able to part with many of them with just a small twinge of regret. Domenick, who did date nights and taught glassblowing at the studio some years ago, bought the remainder of the hotshop equipment so now it's empty too. Oddly I am more sad writing about these endings now than I was when they happened.Now I'm home, and today is the first day I've posted since summer ended and my favorite season of the year, fall, began. I love fall! To me it is the season when everything begins. In fall I can work in my garden and plan and plant for spring. Fall is the start of the textile season with spinning, weaving, knitting and crocheting taking the upcoming project stage. After the heat of summer breaks I finally have energy again and a whole season of pent up ideas to get to (I don't have energy for anything in summer and one of these years I'm going to plan it so that all I have to do is swim for exercise and lie around in a hammock the rest of the time and read).Fall also ushers in Spinzilla, the annual handspinning event that starts today and takes place during American Craft Week to raise awareness of spinning yarn. Spinzilla is a great way to kick off the fall and winter fiber season as it's the perfect time to produce all the yarn needed for a a large project or to finish a spinner's split. Last year I worked on the alpaca roving that I split with Ruthann--the fleeces were from her animals, I spun the yarn and we each took half. This year I am going to make yarn from some Montana llama roving I have been saving and some black merino combed top I have coming from Ashland Bay for a big fall project. More on Spinzilla tomorrow.Other beginnings this week include starting the Post-Instructor course in Ichiyo Ikebana with Executive Master Elaine Jo. I studied with her for several years in Atlanta but had to give it up for time constraints after I finished the Instructor certification. Now I am picking up again and studying with her remotely to finish my Master certification, and I am also going to start a study group (the precursor to an official class) in Austin for Ichiyo Ikebana. As a special treat, I get to attend the fall Ichiyo retreat south of Atlanta the first of November for three days. Ikebana also gets its own post later this week.Lest ye think I have set glass on the wayside, fall is also time to work on websites, exhort galleries to order glass art for Christmas, and this year, it's time to finish setting up the glass studio! Last week's items moved from Atlanta included Bettina, the biggest glass kiln, and the rest of the furniture and tools (mostly molds) that I need for my work. I also brought my own stained glass tools--though no sheet glass yet: that's for the final move currently slated for the beginning of December. Yep, for this move I brought everything including the kitchen sink! Dan unhooked the big restaurant sink I had n the kitchen and now I need a plumber here to set it up. Later this afternoon I'll take a break from spinning to ship one order and work on two others.But now it's time to SPIN! And I think I'll sit myself outside on the deck, by the ponds, and spin there."},

The house is so still and quiet with all the people gone. I can almost hear the clock ticking from the other room in time with the kitten's softly jingling collar-bell. There may be no other humans here with me, but I am surrounded by all the animals. When I looked down at them I had to spend several minutes trying to get a good pano shot of them with the phone. I had to rule out the kitten right away as she is surveying us all from the top of the cat tower, but everyone else is on the floor surrounding my chair.The day started with a beautiful sky that will have to be preserved by my imperfect memory as the photo I took, while lovely, doesn't do it justice. It was the latest in a weekend filled with lovely things. On Saturday, the spouse came home with four different kinds of flowers from HEB that he thought I might like to make into an ikebana. It was a lovely coincidence as on Friday I had looked up local ikebana chapters and was crushed to find that not only is there no Ichiyo ikebana in Austin, but the closest organization of any kind is in San Antonio and I can't see making that trip weekly even if they did have weekly activities. It has been a long time since I studied Ichiyo ikebana under Grand Master Elaine Jo in Atlanta, but I do not make any excuses for my first creation in  several years.I whimsically called it wabi sabi ikebana--beauty in imperfection. But just making it was enough impetus for me to get out my ikebana books and start reviewing the principles of design and form again. While I am in Atlanta later this week and next, I hope to connect with Elaine to discuss other options for me to continue my study.Oh dear, it's already 11:30. So though I would like to stay and let my fingers muse the day away, it's time to get a couple of kiln loads in and orders packed to ship before it gets too hot!"},

Presumably it wouldn't have such a stimulating effect without the cold brewed coffee. Dave made banana bread last weekend and he made a loaf for me with walnuts instead of chocolate chips--what can I say, I'm a purist. So this morning I sit to post, and as I look at my desk I realize what a wonderful encapsulation of my life it is: the smoothie, the bread, the family photo, the lovely view, the new Siyeh Studio website (in progress, not yet live) and the complete and utter, wanton chaos of the surface. I couldn't be happier. Even fiber is represented by the weaving pattern to the right of the laptop. No, I did not stage this photo. I plopped my breakfast down, opened the laptop (okay, I did switch to the screen with the website open on it instead of the login screen), and took the shot.The past couple of days I spent solely doing things instead of trying to do them and write about them--it's all about the balance. Today it's Friday, I'm almost completely through the months-long backlog of drudgery on my to-to list, the kilns are cooling so I'm in no rush to fire, and my laurels feel pretty comfie for a bit of indulgent lounging and posting. To put the cherry on top of my morning, I just glanced over my right shoulder and said, \"Alexa, set entryway Nest to 74 degrees\", and the Amazon Echo Dot on my nightstand replied, \"Setting entryway Nest AC to 74 degrees.\"The one bit of potential strife looming on my list is a call to FedEx to ask why they keep leaving our packages (one of the ones yesterday weighed 40 lbs) on the street by our mailbox instead of delivering them to the porch. Not safe, bad if it rains (which it has been doing a lot), and inconvenient as dammit as we have to drive up to get the packages instead of just walking for the mail. (We're not talking a fifty-foot driveway here: we have to go the other end of the back 40 to get out mail.)Next week I'm in Atlanta for what I hope will be the final studio sale and clean-out, but I'm not counting on it. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to make another trip out to load the last of the glass some time later this year. Between the big kiln, the kitchen sink (literally), two pieces of furniture I purchased from friends in the past couple of weeks, the last wire shelving, and the cases and cases of glass, this truck is going to be full to bursting.Okay, off to Dirty Dog to (finally) bathe Baxter. I don't have the drain catchers to deal with all the fur he sheds, and I also don't have a way to tie him up while he's in the tub to keep him from jumping out. I'm going to take my own shampoo and rubber apron, and I am going to get him sparkly clean! Later today when he's dry, I'll clip his coat and his nails. Thanks Melinda for showing me how to clip him like a pro! Then it's time to do Gallifrey. Forget the tub: I'll just tie him up outside and use the hose..."},

In all of my focused list-making there has been one thing that consistently failed to get added: Make coffee! I'm going on three days in a row with a craving for bean water, and no bean water to be had. Oh, sure, I could've pulled the drip coffee maker out of the back pantry and brewed some up, but that felt too much like failure, so I'm drinking diet Coke and eating blueberry PopTarts (we are also out of milk so I couldn't have cereal). First thing I did before sitting down to post: Set up the Toddy cold brew coffee maker so I will have coffee tomorrow. It takes 12-24 hours to brew--a difficult concept for an instant-gratification girl like me--but it is hands down the best coffee I've ever had and the concentrate makes a perfect Thai iced coffee.Ah, lists. I need to get off of them and all the have-to-do's on them soon or I'm going to be finding myself in a \"Meh\" day again. You'd think at my age I'd know better, but I still see-saw between too much and too little in EVERYTHING. Today I will finish shopping for gifts for the teachers and staff at McCallum to whom I have chosen to be a secret pal this year, and I will deliver them. I will also fire two kiln loads. At long last I will finish our taxes for 2015 (I have never taken so long, and the end of the extension period is October 15). Everything on my list that is NOT one of those things can go hang itself and will be pushed off to another day. I have simply got to do something creative or I'll explode (you would think the kiln loads would count, but no). Of course what's probably going to happen is I'll get hijacked by a bunch of little things, and the three big things will stretch out, and before I know it the day will be over. Gah.On a happier note, Dave and I went to see Transpecos at the Violet Crown Cinema last night and Greg Kwedar, the Austin area writer/director was there and gave a talk with a Q&A session afterward. I didn't even know it was a special showing when I bought tickets and it was so cool! What I liked most about the movie was the role choice played in it It started with the random flow of daily life, people and events pinging off of each other like atoms in a warm room. Every minute bringing an opportunity to make a decision until one choice is made. That choice cut down the available next choices, and each subsequent choice kept cutting down the characters options. It was like a net tightened around them, pulling them closer and closer into a place where there were no more choices, just one way to go.The acting was incredible, and the cinematography was breathtaking. Kwedar said the entire movie was filmed in 16 days last June in the Chihuahuan Desert--the largest North  American desert covering over 140,000 square miles in New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. Can you imagine 18-hour days filming in 120 degree weather? I thought the film was superb before I heard his talk, but I was especially impressed with the way they filmed. I talked with him for a few minutes afterward to get tips for Jessie on pursuing her dream of being a Director of Photography. He was very open, sharing, and encouraging. I wish I had known he was going to be there as I would have encouraged her to come with us instead of making it a date night."},

Unfortunately, an incontinent senior cocker spaniel has driven me to it. Welcome to my Monday.On a happier, less smelly, note: Peyton and Lynne's tutelage last year on continental knitting has finally taken hold! I struggled and struggled with it last year and never quite got it. Last week I picked up the needles for a new project, pulled up the YouTube videos I had bookmarked on continental knitting for a refresher, and it just happened! I am now blissfully, speedily, knitting away on a gift with an upcoming deadline. Who knows? Maybe I'll actually finish this one!I spent Sunday unpacking fabric and tools into the textile studio and as I was working, I made a vow: From now on, every other project that I work on in each technique must be a UUFO (most people have UFO's or Un-Finished Objects in their stashes. I have Ubiquitous Un-Finished Objects because they're, well, everywhere). So one new knitting project, finish one already on the needles. If I want, I can do two UUFO's in a row, but never two new. Same for crochet.Today I'm all about the To Do list. I almost got through yesterday's tasks yesterday (for the first time in I-don't-know-how-long--I'm a bit over-scheduled) and I am determined to knock the rest of them out today along with today's. If I make it, there must be celebrating. One thing that might help me make this goal is if I STOP ADDING THINGS TO THE LIST!

All of the boxes of tools and supplies that will eventually live there have not yet been unearthed from the garage, but the furniture is set up, the first round of boxes has been unpacked, the surfaces have been dusted, and (gasp) the floor has been mopped! Planned activities for that space include glass bead making/torchwork, silversmithing, jewelry making, textile dyeing, and soapmaking. It is the best space for all wet crafts as there is a tile floor with a drain in the middle of it, and it has a good deep sink with ample countertops on either side. It's also good for torch work as it is already equipped with an exhaust fan.Unfortunately the motorized shades for it aren't currently working, nor is the exhaust fan so unless you get in there first thing in the morning and turn on the little AC unit asap, it rapidly gets to over 110 degrees and is unusable for anything but taking a sauna. In the winter it'll probably be a different story, but until I get the electrician to fix the broken systems, I won't be making soap, dyeing roving, or working on the torch!This weekend is dedicated to yet more unpacking and settling in. As soon as I finish this post I am off to the newly renamed sunroom (it's now the fiber studio :-) to finish unpacking yarn, fabric, tools and books. That room is much more temperate (and pleasant) now that we have had motorized shades installed on the east wall (which is all windows) that block 95% of the UV rays and a significant amount of the heat. The fabric is surprisingly see-through making it enjoyable to be in that room and not too dark even when the shades are all the way down. We are putting the same shades outside the two upstairs rooms (Jessie's bedroom and workroom) to help with the cooling up there, and I will eventually put them on the west side of the fiber studio too to both help with temperature and to protect the textiles from fading.Another improvement on the cooling front will be the installation of a couple of mini-split AC/heating units in the garage (glass studio). We already have one in the fiber studio and one in the third studio that the original owners of the house put in, and they turn out to be a great, economical, low-impact solution to cooling and heating ductless spaces. Sadly that project will have to wait until the garage doors have been replaced either with glass (my first choice for light and an open feeling to the studio, but more expensive and not really a good fit for the exterior style of the house) or new metal ones that are well-insulated.Now off to the fiber studio to unpack more STUFF!"},

After I dropped J off at school I stopped at Thunderbird Coffee and Taproom for the most incredible honey nut latte. and a jalapeño bagel with cream cheese. Replete and joyous, I then took in a two-hour presentation put on by the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension service called To Bee, or Not to Bee. It was a great introduction to beekeeping in this area not only from a climate and horticultural perspective, but also because of the issue of Africanization of hives in this area and how to deal with more aggressive bees. At the presentation I made friends with the woman sitting next to me who raises chickens, whose father has bees, who is considering getting alpaca or goats, who wants to do the master gardener training, and who loves fiber... Kindred spirits! We talked about doing some shopping together at the Best Little Yarn Crawl in Texas and exchanged contact info. The only disappointing aspect of the experience was the absolute abhorrence of the representatives of the local apiary groups to Flow hives, which is what I have (and which I am very excited about). In fact as I read more, a lot of experienced beekeepers went up in arms when the Flow came out. I'm going to just keep my head down (which I am sooo good at), absorb info like a sponge, and make up my own mind.Yesterday was pretty great too as I stopped off at Helios Fused Glass Studio to return the diamond hand pads Paul Tarlow so kindly had lent me and had a lovely long chat with him. I am very much looking forward to hanging out there and bonding with the others in the local Austin glass fusing community. Fusing Fridays, here I come!And if all that friendly interaction wasn't enough, I have a FaceTime crafting session set up with Becky tomorrow morning. We're going to see if we can replicate something like our former weekly crafting sessions in Atlanta. I already do my weekly piano lessons through FaceTime and that's going well, so why not the ubiquitous Stitch & Bitch too? Daily, I feel more like a pioneer woman out in my little patch of rural wildness and I embrace the modern version of the quilting or sewing circle. Us pioneers have to take our socialization how we can get it.Tonight is my first meeting with the Austin Weaver's and Spinner's Society. They seem to be a very active, friendly group with twice monthly meetings--one a program (tonight) and one a social spin (or whatever project you want to work on--they even have a weaving study group that starts meeting on September 22). I am glad to be joining this group because in addition to the super social and educational opportunities, I need a new outlet for all my alpaca roving, and I also have a 60\" LeClerc loom I need to sell now that I picked up Martha this summer (the 60\" 16-harness AVL production compu-dobby loom).Now I'm off to have the blueprints for our house scanned and put into pdf for the landscaper who might be putting a green roof over the textile studio. Since we are having our roof replaced this fall we need to know if this is an option first. Wouldn't want to do it twice!"},
{"title": "Settling In", "date": "Wednesday, September 07, 2016", "text": "It was a wonderful Labor Day weekend here in Austin, although we obviated the spirit of Labor Day by working hard unpacking all three days. Saturday, we hired a Task Rabbit worker and the three of us (Dave, the worker, and I) unpacked all the boxes of 5-lb frit jars. Sunday, Dave moved all of the boxes containing non-textile items out of the sunroom and into their proper location for eventual unpacking. Then we set-up the furniture in the sunroom and unpacked all the yarn. Monday, Dave got all the boxes of fabric out of the closet and into the sunroom, and we also unpacked all the 5-lb jars of glass powder in the studio. Dave finished by breaking down all the boxes and hauling them off to the side porch. In all he said we emptied over 100 boxes, moved 40 more, and the glass alone was just under 4,000 lbs... I can really see the textile studio and the glass studio coming together. (The former sunroom is so professionally laid out now that it has been renamed the textile studio.)After all the lifting and moving and unpacking, yesterday I took it easy. Took Jessie to school, got a driver's license, had the dogs' invisible fence collars adjusted, talked to Bill at Elliott Metal about some new designs, and met a friend for lunch. It was a perfect morning! Then Jessie texted me, sick at school and needing to go home. After getting her tucked into bed with cold water and fresh sheets, I spent the rest of the afternoon quietly signing up for groups and organizations, scheduling their meetings and gatherings on my calendar, and generally expanding my local network. That was great too.Today I started by making to-do lists and planning next steps for all my various undertakings, and in hindsight, I'm not sure forward-thinking is a good thing! Time seems to stretch on boundless and forever in front of me until I break it down into it's discrete units and pair those units with tasks. Then it all goes to hell. Putting all the different pieces of life and work that I am juggling into slots labeled days just doesn't work--they don't fit. It's like discovering outer space and instead of thinking of going to the moon, I am trying to plan (and schedule) the moon, mars, the next solar system, and a universe on the other side of the cosmos: The scope of the projects doesn't fit the tools I'm using to schedule them. The obvious answer is to put some things off for the distant, unscheduled future. In the past, the things put off would be the fun and exciting things. And then I would find myself hating my life as I trudged from have-to-get done to have-to-get done. This time I am going to take a suggestion from my friend Alyssa to heart: Instead of spending all of my time on drudgery until the drudgery is done, I am going to schedule two hours of fun project a day. That leaves seven hours of chores, and that's enough.With that plan in mind I am off to get some chores done and then end the day with a little knitting or crochet!"},

I had thought to maintain my Montana registration and get a Montana license in assertion of my rootedness (and legally because I own a residence there). But I love Austin. This was a good move--for all that moving and unpacking are a royal pain in my ass. I am... happy.It's a late post today because I wanted to write about my surprise for Dave (and I needed to make sure I could pull it off). Right now I'm listening to Paula Cole, \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?\" and gleefully awaiting Dave's return to the family manse. You wouldn't think registering the cars in Texas with its attendant mandatory two-hour wait at the DMV (with another abortive hour and a half trying to get a Texas driver's license--but that's another story) would be a source of joy and glee, but there you are.Dave's vehicular pride and joy is his mini cooper convertible. As a surprise for him for his birthday, I got him custom Texas plates. He used to have sticker on the window with the same phrase, but it faded and fell off. The plates are of a more permanent nature. I also got customized plates for the mini van as I got \"Siyeh\" (which I couldn't do in Montana--someone already has it on a permanent plate there).Tomorrow Dave is gifting me with his time and focus, and we are going to slay a significant number of boxes and move the sunroom (fiber place) and the garage (glass studio) to the next level. We are also task rabbiting someone to help with the hundred 35-lb boxes of frit. I have till 11:00 am to finally figure out where they are going to go so our task rabbit can move and unload them all.In the meantime I await the nightly return of the spouse with the family chalkboard all prepped."},

Interesting way of managing school hours. I would think this would be a great strategy for school districts that need to make up snow days.I also started the day feeling loved. I was a bit ashamed about my pity party yesterday, but I was amazed at the response to it! My next door neighbor--maybe coincidentally or maybe in response to my Facebook post--messaged me and asked me if I wanted to get lunch at an Indian buffet, and another friend texted to ask if I wanted to go for a pedicure this morning. I missed the lunch as I had bento with Dave, and I can't do the pedi as her schedule is very tightly tied into little ones' school and pre-school times and I have the Thermador tech coming to fix our oven this morning at the time she can go. But more important than participating in the activities was being asked. Now the next time I feel a bit cabin feverish, I know two people I can call about going out to do something.So today I sit at my desk, it's covered with papers, the sun is shining, I haven't yet bathed the dog, and it's going to be a great day.

I have a feeling today's post is going to be a pity party so feel free to skip off somewhere else now.I knew when we made this move that it would require a lot of work and would take a long time. But somehow I figured it would be done by the first of September and I would have all glorious fall to look forward to working in my studio, weaving, spinning, woodworking, baking, and gardening in addition to my regularly scheduled cleaning, laundry, maintenance chores. Instead, I have what feels like an unending stream of chores and tasks that do little to feed my creativity with no end in sight. I can't even look at a room in this house and says it's done (unpacked, fixed up, and ready for regular maintenance--preferably by someone else).  For the first time in years I am trying to do all the house cleaning myself, and it's not going well. Oddly enough, it's not the bathrooms, kitchen, or laundry that get me down; it's the hardwood floors. I have yet to figure out how to keep them dusted (with three dogs, two cats and a caged bunny all contributing daily fur) much less mopped. Toilets and catbox are the easiest as they are finite and quick. The floors go on forever and by the time I have dusted them from one end to the other, the first end is hairy again so I can't mop it.If that weren't enough--and trust me, it is--I am not doing as well with the daily solitude as I thought I would. Last Saturday when we went to Dave's office and the comic book store, I would normally have stayed home. That would have been a father/daughter outing. But I just couldn't bear to be alone in the house for another day. Dave encourages me to go out, go to Hill Country Weavers, meet people, get involved in something. But I feel guilty leaving the house in the state it's in. He says it's fine. I think it's a disaster. Any joy I get from going out is wiped away when I get home by the weight of everything I didn't get done because I was out.Today I am looking at shipping three orders for the studio, putting away a week's worth of laundry, changing the beds, vacuuming the carpets, cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the kitchen, attempting to dust the floors, thinking about mopping them, cleaning out the vacuum and the two robot vacuums which are all full of pet hair, bathing Baxter, finding an orthodontist for Jessie and making her an appointment, contacting social security about getting my mom's tax forms for 2015, and getting both cars registered in Texas. There is no way on earth I am going to get through that list--especially adding the two fun things I have on tap which are making fresh linguini and pesto and having lunch with Dave. So there is absolutely no chance that I will get any further on unpacking and setting up the utility room (so I can finally see the floor in there to mop it), the sunroom (ditto the mopping), my desk (thank god no mopping), and the greenhouse (really that's just mopping), and the studio (which I will NEVER, EVER MOP!).That means that when I wake up tomorrow, things will be pretty much the same as they are today with the exception of clean laundry and a clean dog. I still won't have found someone to mow the front grass (we no longer have a mower and I don't have the heavy work boots and long, thick pants to wear doing it to protect me from all the snakes that are probably in it), mopped the floors, or washed the windows. The apartment will still need painting, new floors, and some focused attention to get it ready to rent. And I still won't be comfortable inviting anyone over--for dinner or anything else--because I am so stressed about the state the house is still in three months after I moved in, and almost a year after we bought it.Okay. Pity party over. Going to crank some music, roll up my metaphorical sleeves, and get working on the laundry."},

Oh joy!), on our driveway as she was walking to get the bus to school. She wanted me to come out and look at it, but clothes were too much trouble, and I didn't think a large, naked woman in the driveway would fly--even in our rural neighborhood. The wildlife in our yard continues to be a source of joy and wonder--even if most of it is lethal in one way or another.I obviously didn't get a second post out yesterday so today is the day to talk about Jessie's high school experiences to date. I don't get a flood of information every day from her: she's a quiet kid. But at the end of a week and a day she has decided she hates school. Not unexpected as she has only mentioned talking (willingly) to one or two other kids, none of her classes are sparking her (yet), and she dodged the pep rally last week by hanging out in the cafeteria. Apparently there were enough other kids with the same idea that there weren't any places left to sit so she stood in the cafeteria for half an hour until it was time to catch the bus home.One of the first things she talked about (in amazement and with disgust) was the lack of respect the students show the teachers in many of her classes. They wear earbuds during class, talk loudly, and blatantly, repeatedly, ignore teacher instructions. This kind of behavior was not tolerated in Mr. Smith's class at the Waldorf School of Atlanta, and the one student who tried to pull it (a late-grade transferee from a public school) didn't last long in the class. McCallum is a different world. It's Austin's version of an older, inner-city high school with a fine arts program open to students across the district. With that designation comes diversity. Diversity, while good, doesn't mean good. Diverse is just lots of different. Exposure to different is good in that it expands one's world view and experience. But diversity in manners, diversity in politeness and kindness and honesty... those are just different, not good. J has been alienated, affronted, and appalled by some her fellow students' diverse behavior. At the end of her second or third day she mused that it might have been better if she'd gone to the Waldorf high school here because at least then she'd know what to expect.  But I have no doubts that, long term, this high school will provide a more meaningful experience for her and enable her to successfully interact with a more diverse group of people in the real world.On a more positive note she seems to be confident in her knowledge of the materials being covered in her classes. She doesn't feel behind the other students, she's keeping up on her homework, and she seems to like her teachers. Expectations of the students are a bit lower than they were at Waldorf: They can use calculators on their algebra tests, and when taking quizzes on mapping in world geography they can use their books and the big map on the wall.Of course Jessie wouldn't be Jessie if she wasn't practicing her super power. She is convinced that she has the power to make people overlook her--mostly teachers looking for someone to read aloud. However she said that she does raise her hand in class, and she does participate. Participation is good because a portion of her grade in every one of her classes is based on participation. She is already looking ahead to what film school she wants to go to after high school. But she is convinced that if she tries really hard she can make people ignore her. Heck, it works on me half the time.So while the lunchroom has yet to be conquered, and friends have yet to be made, high school is turning out okay."},
{"title": "I Have a Desk!", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2016", "text": "Sitting at my new \"desk\", drinking the morning smoothie and munching on more of the sesame bread. It didn't cause any digestive distress yesterday so I figure it's safe to eat. However it reminds me a lot of lembas bread: I can see it being very nutritional and filling (especially in conjunction with the aforementioned smoothie), but it's already getting old. So far this morning I have tidied, practiced piano, and cleaned the cat box.Now it's time to post and I have a couple of driving subjects for the day: the desk, and Jessie's first week at school. I may have to post twice today (gasp!). I don't think I have ever done that before. But before I go on, the dogs are jumping around like jacks so I think I need to take them for a quick walk down the street. They can look for lizards, and I can look for Pokemon. Back in a few........So about the \"desk\"... Got it set up this past weekend. It's a \"desk\" instead of a desk as it's really just a 3X6 sheet of plywood on sawhorses, but it's better than the dining room table. Dave and Jessie think so too as we might now be able to eat without having to shift mounds of papers out of the way! It's especially nice because it comes with a great view (out of the bedroom window into the backyard). Part of the view this morning included what looks to me like a juvenile hawk or eagle. It's definitley not a vulture which is what am used to seeing. (The turkey vultures are enormous and soar on the thermals looking for, I don't know, dead things.The desk even has its own cat tree already occupied with cats! Though the cat tree this morning is going against the natural order as Pavlova is on the top and Kaiju is on the bottom. Even after winning the top spot she still can't resist coming down to annoy him... I can tell it's going to be hard to get things done at this spiffy new desk--too many distractions!You might wonder why I didn't just buy a desk. I'm afraid I am lost in a new project space: Furniture. And everywhere I look, I see a potential building/redoing project. This new artisanal space was introduced to me back in the spring of 2015 when I did an inlay project for Jessie's class auction project for school. I have wanted to do more of that type of work ever since, but haven't had time. Arguably I still don't have time, but the idea stayed in my head and now it's expanded to include glass and lighting. And Dr. Who. In fact for the desk project, I may not do any wood inlay at all. Instead I may focus entirely on straight lines and common geometric shapes (circles, triangles, etc.) and if I do, I won't inlay. Instead I'll route out narrow grooves for all the lines, stain the wood on either side of the lines different colors (oak, ebony, walnut, ash, e.g.,) and then fill in the routed lines with black something-or-other. I'll still do glass inlay, however.As part of the work I do with Todd, I drill circles out of my finished pieces with a core drill and a drill press. Till now the glass circles were a by-product which occasionally got used in pieces by Todd, or which I thought might make interesting jewelry. They come in diameters from 1/2\" to 4\", but most of them are about 1.25\", and they are 1/4\" to 3/8\" thick. After they have been cut out, I grind the sides with my lap grinder and then fire polish them so they are all nice and shiny but still have straight sides and crisp edges.Now I want to inlay them in wood with the hole they are in going all the way through the wood so light shines up from underneath/behind. Because the glass is thick and the colors can be dark, if there is no light the glass will look meh. That's where the lighting comes in. I am working with our electrician here to create some led rings that can be mounted with the glass so that it's lit up. The wiring will be channeled through the wood and come out in a standard plug. We might even (at some point) make the lighting work with a rechargeable battery pack so furniture like tables and chairs won't have to be placed near an outlet. The other pieces of furniture I want to do this way are a headboard for our bed (built from scratch) and our dining room table refinished, inlaid and retrofitted with lights). The dining room table will definitely be inlaid with wood and the glass circles as I want to do organic, meandering cracks (like the one in the original games cabinet). I'll post pics as I go.Now it's time to head out to the studio to put a slump load in the kiln, finish a wall panel with a Hang Your Glass system, and wait for USPS to deliver my grinding pads so I can polish up an 8\"x13\"x1\" slab that I am supposed to ship to New Jersey today..."},
{"title": "Oculus Rift", "date": "Sunday, August 28, 2016", "text": "I woke this morning with the urge to post. The urge increased as I went through my (late--it's Sunday so I didn't get up early) morning routine. I had things to say. Things about the second taste of the sesame bread (which Dave liked and which hasn't caused either of us distress...yet), things about making another batch of killer smoothie. Things about practicing piano, the beauty of the sound of the alto Japanese scale windchimes in the light breeze. Just things. But I felt I needed to get my kiln load in before luxuriating in a post. So now the kiln is firing, and my earlier inspirations have gone away. The lesson learned is to take time to write when the fire of creativity strikes.However there is one subject worth covering and that is our experience playing on the Oculus Rift (the gameplaying thingie referenced in yesterday's post) at Dave's office yesterday.  Wow. Just, wow. It is to playing video games what IMAX is to small movie theatre screens. Think of the first time you saw the undersea movie at teh IMAX and were sure you were going to eaten by the shark.J and I both took turns on the OR and some of the things you can do/watch are very disorienting--like the Valkyrie game. Some of it is flat-out stunning (the intro to VR) and some of it is just so cool--the \"home screen\" which isn't a screen at all, it's a luxury home surrounding you with furnishings, art--and no dustbunnies or dirty dishes. Of course you have no body either so it's a bit disconcerting to look down. At least in Valkyrie you have a body--which totally creeped Jessie out when she looked down while playing. Apparently with just the right angle you see a headless body and that was just too much for her. I had to strain to get to see the top of the neck where the head should be--I mostly just saw my very cool, thin, black-leather-spacesuit-clad body.As I played some mountain goat game I harkened back to hanging out at Keith and Mike's and watching Keith play Super Mario Brothers. It was an addictive game, and I'm glad I never had it as I could see myself playing for hours. The Oculus Rift is a similar toy. If we had one at home, Dave and Jessie would leave for the day and I would just sit and play in my own little world all day. Dave did not try it out, though you can hear him snorting in the background in one of the videos as Jessie tried to take the controller away from me. When I think of some of the visually stunning (and disturbing), intense (and disturbing), and dark (did I mention disturbing?) video games he likes to play, like the Bioshock series and Batman Arkham I can't imagine them for the OR. Those were creepy enough on the big screen tv being surrounded by those worlds would drive me insane. Now back to Conman and Pokemon Go. Need to give my sensory input a rest."},
{"title": "Digestables", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2016", "text": "Getting ready to head to Dave's office with him and the J so she (okay, let's be honest, WE) can play Minecraft and other games with their ocular gameplaying thingy*. Sorry for the lack of technical jargon, but I can't remember what it's really called. Before we go, however, I wanted to get out a quick review of last week's Tassajara sesame wheat bread.Right up front I'm going to have reserve final judgement on this bread as the oven went on the fritz right in the middle of baking it, and I think I over-processed the sesame seeds when I ground them. But the bread felt wonderful during the kneading--if very dense and stiff. It rose very well during the sponge stage and the first two rising, it didn't rise as much as I thought it would when shaped into loaves.The flavor was distinctly sesame, but also had a bitter note at the end due to my grinding raw, unhulled sesame seeds instead of hulled ones. I bought what was available at Whole Foods (unhulled), and when I got home and reread the recipe for sesame meal (from the InterWeb), it called for hulled. So I looked up the difference between them, and Cook's Illustrated informed me that unhulled are much higher in calcium and also a bit more flavorful, but that the flavor is tinged with a bitterness absent in the hulled seeds. I figured I'd go ahead and try the unhulled to see how the bitterness would play out, and I am not a fan. Of course the problem may have been the recipe (or my making of it) for the sesame meal. The instructions were to cook the seeds in a heavy, unoiled pan until they turned a darker color and started popping, and then to grind them in a blender until they were crumbly but not a paste. My first batch was half crumbly, half pastey. The second batch was better.The bread recipe called for three cups of sesame meal, \"more if you can stand it\". I used about three, but it was hard to measure exactly as the recipe was expecting a meal which is not nearly as dense as the somewhat-paste I had so I may have used more. It definitely took more wheat flour at the end than the recipe called for in order to balance it out and get it to stop sticking.After the oven pooped out (low temps then high temps), and the bread got a bit burned on top, I didn't taste it till the next day. The loaves weren't as high as I thought they would be, and the bread was really dense. The flavor was interesting--more bitter and less sweet than I like in a dark bread, but maybe I just need to pair it with an appropriate food for the flavors to shine. Bread by itself is like wine by itself: Some stand alone fine, but others need to be paired with just the right food to engender an out-of-body experience in the consumer.The other thing I need to say about this bread is that it seems that I had significant colonic difficulty digesting it. It reminded me of the time that Dave made huckleberry cobbler with mesquite flour when we were visiting my uncle and aunt in Phoenix with my mom. We all like to have died that night as we apparently don't have the bacteria, enzymes, whatever, in our systems to digest that much of that kind of grain. It wasn't like food poisoning, it was definitely a too-much-of-something-you-can't-digest-all-at-once problem.The final verdict: Not yet a keeper, need to try again.*I have been informed it's an oculus rift."},
{"title": "Rural Housewife", "date": "Friday, August 26, 2016", "text": "Listening to \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone\" as Juan fixes one of our pull-out pantry doors. He will probably finish about the time the Invisible Fence guy shows up to put the transmitters in the kitchen and train the dogs to stay out of it. Gallifrey has discovered that good things live on the top of the counters and he has begun to surf obsessively. With him on the high road and Baxter on the low road the kitchen has become... fraught. I don't think June Cleaver ever yelled at the dogs to get out of the kitchen. Actually, I don't remember if the Cleavers even had a dog, but if they did it would have been a silky golden retriever, not a cranky spaniel, or a pony-sized wolfhound. Anyway, I need to distance myself from June. She didn't work out so well for me yesterday.I'm sure there are those who are curious as to how yesterday's adventures in the kitchen turned out. The results were mixed. The ravioli turned out as it was supposed to which was too thin for all of us (go figure, homemade pasta that is too thin and still holds together), too much parsley for the J, and too bland for me. The chipotle cream sauce was amazing. The Vitamix simultaneously blends and cooks, well, heats up. The friction of the blades through the mass is sufficient to generate considerable heat and finish a sauce--no stove required! I never got to the pesto--ran out of time. I'll make it today and save it for next week. The salad was promising, but would have been better with a different spring mix: The one I got was too much bland/sweet with no spicy (arugula) or lightly bitter (frisee), and I just whacked up the grapefruit. But Dave's avocado/jalapeño sauce from the Vitamix the other day was genius. Finally there was the bread. The bread went from difficult to disaster--thanks to our new Thermador range. First it wasn't cooking enough, then it burned. Oh well. More about the recipe in another post.Thermador is two for four with us right now. Getting the dishwasher (which was damaged and non-functional before it ever went in) replaced took a month and a half, and now the main oven for sure and possibly the smaller oven are not working on the range. At least it's smart enough to know it's broken: There is an error message on the temperature panel with a phone number to call. We were already suspicious that there was a problem as the big oven didn't seem to be heating so we put in a free-standing thermometer to check the temperature. Sure enough, busted. So I have a service call scheduled for next Friday.While I'm on the appliance rant, our new (replacement) Everpure Exubera is not only not dispensing sparkling water, it's not dispensing cold water either! At least the last (defective) one we had would dispense cold water. I have been shuffled around on the phone all morning only to find out there doesn't seem to be a distributor contact in Texas anymore... I now have a call in to the sales person for the region. We'll see how that goes.For now, a little time in the studio till the Invisible Fence guy shows up. Speaking of the studio, in case I forgot to update the status, the studio is now a MUCH more pleasant place to be. Let There Be Light! A quick visit from the electrician and the plumber and I can actually work now."},
{"title": "Learning My Pace", "date": "Thursday, August 25, 2016", "text": "I am beginning to get used to the new rhythm of the weekday. It's quiet. This morning there is only the faint hum of one of the ac units and a low ringing from the windchimes. I can even hear the dogs breathing. I'm glad I have the dogs, cats, and bunny for company--it would be eerily empty here without them.The morning I woke Jessie up at 6:30 with a 15 minute warning, then called her again at 6;45 to tell her it was time to get up. Yep, that's right, I called her. On the phone. I call her every morning twice--once to wake her up and give her 15 more minutes in bed to collect herself, and then again make sure she is awake enough to get up and get ready for school. In the evening, I call her down from her room to set the table for dinner. On the phone. In our old house I just called out loud (or bellowed, as the rest of the family called it). But this house is too spread out for that, and even the loudest of my bellows from the bedroom won't penetrate upstairs. I could walk up the stairs, get some exercise, and talk to her in person. But, I have to say, I'm pretty tired these days. And she's a teenager: she is glued to her phone. So the phone is the best way to reach her. Part of me is appalled at this style of parenting and communication. (The June Cleaver part, who wants to prance around in an apron and pearls baking all day. Really. I have that part.) Another part just shrugs and says go with the flow, whatever works and doesn't cause stress. (Which both bellowing and going up the stairs do to one family member or another).  I'm hoping to wean her onto an alarm clock next week. They haven't worked in the past, but, really, I have got to let go being responsible for her getting out of bed in the morning. It would be easier if I were a morning person. Then I would be up, and if I noticed she wasn't up, then I could get her up. But I can happily sleep until 10:00 and getting up regularly at 7:00 is just not going to happen anytime soon. I make myself get up at 8:00, but she would already have missed the bus if I didn't find out she was still asleep till 8:00. Of course, most days her father's already up by 7:00. Maybe he can be the back-up for awhile.This morning, after making sure J was awake and up, I went back to sleep. I woke to the front door shutting (it's heavy). Apparently I was so soundly asleep (and snoring so loudly) that J didn't want to wake me before heading off to catch the bus. But the phone saved me a day of angst at not getting to say 'I love you and have a great day' as I quickly texted her that message and ended the text with a little emoji heart ❤️. This was a better option than running naked out the door and down the drive to do it in person. I know, June Cleaver would have woken her with a chirpy \"Time to get up sleepy head!\", and then made breakfast and lunch for her, ruffled her hair as she kissed her goodbye and tenderly sent her out for the day. I called her on the phone, and then I snored. Operatically. *sigh*When I did finally rise for the day, shower, and get presentable, I practiced piano, poured myself a Killer Smoothie, and warmed a butter-slathered piece of the banana bread Dave and Jessie made over the weekend for breakfast. It felt like a good time to get a post in so I sat down to write, and there was a knock at the door... Unless it's UPS, USPS, FedEx, or a scheduled tradesman, we NEVER get knocks at the door. I thought it might be Zaga from next door come to set a time to go out for a drink with a couple of other women from the neighborhood, but no--there were two female silhouettes outside the door. We have been found by the Watchtower people. Inconceivable!!! Those girls are getting a lot of exercise for four houses worth of word-spreading. Interestingly they have savvied-up their publications. This one was entitled \"How To Harness Your Habits\" and showed a black woman smiling, and jogging with earbuds in on the cover. They waited until page seven to tell me that homosexuality is a sin and promptly lost me.Now I'm off to the studio to put two kiln loads in (with the size of the kilns I currently have here, this isn't as impressive as it sounds), then a delivery of Secret Pall gifts to two teachers at J's school, and then I will let June Cleaver out to play for the rest of the day. I'll do a little house cleaning, and a little cooking/baking. On the menu are a sesame wheat bread from The Tassajara Bread Book (grinding my own sesame meal with the Vitamix for it), fresh pasta dough for four-cheese ravioli, and a chipotle cream sauce (with tofu and cream cheese, among other ingredients) and a pesto sauce, the last two made in the Vitamix. When Dave gets home he will grill salmon to accompany the ravioli, and I will make a salad with spring greens, fresh grapefruit, crumbled feta, pine nuts, and a dollop of the avocado/jalapeño/garlic/lime/yoghurt sauce Dave made the other night (also with the Vitamix--Best Kitchen Appliance Ever). If we were empty nesters, I might even serve dinner in the apron and pearls..."},
{"title": "Killer Smoothie", "date": "Sunday, August 21, 2016", "text": "Today I finally got to make Alison Mayer's killer smoothie recipe! I first had this smoothie after a week of flat-out work when I was run-down, just getting over being horribly sick, stressed out, and at my physical, mental, and emotional limit. I was dropping Jessie off at Alison and Nick's--their son Mitch was in Jessie's Waldorf class from 1st through 8th grade--as they were hosting an end-of-the-year camping trip over Memorial Day up at their mountain property for J's entire class (kids and parents). I was getting our house ready to sell and could not go, and Dave was already moved to Austin, so they offered to take Jessie up with them. Alison took one look at me when we drove up and said I looked like I needed a smoothie. I had two. They were AMAAAAAZING! They will pump you up and enable you to take on the world (or, in may case that day: just stay awake and cognizant till the end of the day).The reason it took so long to make is that we were a couple of pieces of hardware short (we needed a cold press coffee maker and a working blender), and I also needed to get all the ingredients (turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, cocoa powder, and cayenne were the only ones we regularly stock). Last week I froze up the spinach and kale cubes and the banana, and last night I made the coffee (12 oz of coarse ground coffee and six cups of water), so I was finally ready to smoothie today. I hope Alison doesn't mind my sharing, 'cause this is just too great to keep to myself. Here's the recipe as I got it:12 oz almond/coco milkteaspoon coco oilscant teaspoon coco crystalsslug of cold brew (go by color, not too dark)dash of turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper (alloptional to taste)Tbs cocoa powder, tbs maca powderpulse together, then add3 kale/spinach cubes*1/4 frozen banana (half fine, just not a big banana person)blend really well til all cubes broken up - serve over iceand feel like a new woman!! Although the old woman is fantastic - don't gochanging!*blend a shit ton of kale (usually a bag) and alittle water then add a regular ton of spinach just adding enough water to keepit moving, then freeze in ice cube trays that will be permanently green afterthat - buy some at the thrift or dollar store for dedicated use. Store cubes inbaggie in freezer.Wow did it not disappoint! I kicked butt and took names today, and a lot of it was thanks to Alison's concoction. And I not only made some for today, but I saved some in the fridge for tomorrow so I can have one as I take Jessie to school for her First Day of High School. Woot!"},

{"title": "Once More Into the Studio", "date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2016", "text": "Another day is coming to a close, and while I did a lot today, I don't really feel any closer to moved in. I meant to spend the day in the studio, but we had piano lessons this morning, and then the child asked if I would take her to the comic book store as she only has three weekdays of summer left. By the time we got home (we had to stop for lunch too) it was almost 4:00, and I ran out of steam for the day. I caught up on a little email, created a Google calendar for Jessie's school schedule and set us all up on it, and puttered with other administrative things. And then Dave was home and it was time for dinner.But back to the studio. Last night I did my first firing in my new used KL-50 Denver kiln, and it was like Laurel and Hardy meet the glass studio. The way that it is right now, this might be the worst studio I have had in I don't know how long. Our electrician is still futzing with the City of Austin to get our service upgraded for the additional kiln load. Until he succeeds, we are limping along in Austin high summer (temps upwards of a 100 degrees in the shade most days) with no AC in the studio, only one kiln hooked up (no room in the breaker box for more), a few fluorescent light fixtures--none of them placed over any of my work spaces or kilns, one electrical outlet for mechanical tools, and none of the coldworking equipment hooked up (or even placed in position). Additionally, on the plumbing side, I have a grungy, nasty, little sink that I haven't been able to bring myself to turn on (the big studio sink is still in Austin).In the process of firing one piece last night I realized my kiln wash is still in Atlanta. My funnel (for refilling the 1 lb frit jars I use to make my pieces) is packed God-knows-where--along with my cutting oil, pencils, Sharpie, and measuring tape. I was barely able to get the piece done--and 24 hours after firing it is still cooling. Tomorrow I hope to make more progress and if I don't end up with a totally functional studio, at least I'll have a complete list for the electrician, the plumber, and the carpenter of what needs to be done."},
{"title": "Tassajara Bread", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2016", "text": "Can I cook? Many who have met me since I married Dave would be surprised to find out that I can, in fact, produce delectable foodstuffs. Just because I don't cook regularly (or almost ever) doesn't mean I can't. I like to cook, and I love to bake. If it has flour in it, I'm all about it. In fact I have long wanted to make bread and fresh pasta regularly but never could fit it into my schedule. But now with Dave and Jessie both heading out into the world for work and school all day, every day, starting next Monday, I'll have more time and fewer distractions.Last week I made my first foray back into bread-from-scratch, and it was a memorable effort--though not in a good way. I couldn't find my old, dog-eared copy of the Tassajara Bread Book so I looked on the web for a likely recipe. Neither the experience nor the bread lived up to my memories of baking from the TBB so I went on Amazon and ordered another copy to work from until mine shows up again. When it arrived, I spent a lovely evening reading through it and was so inspired by all the yummy looking recipes that I decided to commence a Julia and Julia-esque project of working my way through all the recipes in it and documenting the experience here.Today I opened it up, dusted it with flour, and started with the basic yeasted bread recipe. Right off the bat it was better than the web-recipe experience. Instead of measuring the temperature of the water with a thermometer, I used my wrist (and followed with a thermometer as back-up because I was wound a little tight). I also followed the process described in the book--not just the recipe. Edward Espe Brown, the author, goes into great detail about just how to stir the sponge and later, the dough. He lists the merits and qualities of each particular flour and expounds upon their effects on the final bread. He explains why to use milk powder as opposed to whole milk, what egg does to the crust, and exactly what yeast does in warm water with a sweetener.Then there's the whole zen aspect of kneading the bread. I have always loved the illustrations in this book and the eloquent verbal sketches of how your hands--fingers to palms--interact with the dough. To knead is to go for the stretch, not the tear. Done correctly it creates an elastic structure in the bread that supports the airy loft provided by the yeast. And unlike my previous experience, it wasn't done for a number of minutes, but for a number of actions, lending a more relaxed pace to the process.So my bread today contained 57% organic whole wheat flour and 43% organic unbleached white flour. A 1/4 cup of brown sugar was the sweetener for 2 tablespoons of yeast. Canola was my oil choice, I did add a cup of powdered non-fat milk, and I didn't either add an egg or wash the crust with egg before baking. The process for making this bread includes a rising for the sponge, two risings of the dough, and a final short rising of the loaves. The sponge rising and the second dough rising are optional, but I went ahead and did them all. Our new stove has a proofing setting for bread in the small oven so I used it for all the risings but the loaf rising. Unfortunately, we only have one metal loaf pan (I do NOT like silicon bread pans because the bread swells the sides of the pan way out) so I did a country loaf on a cookie sheet and a loaf in the loaf pan. Because the cookie sheet is too big to fit in the small proofing oven I had to use the large oven and I got the temperature too high for the last raise (the loaf raise). As a result, the bread was a bit more dense than I intended, and the country style loaf was pretty flat (the yeast started cooking and dying before it finished rising). But it was tasty!The crust never got to the shiny dark brown described in the book, but maybe that's because I didn't do the egg wash. By the end of the day I had learned a couple of important lessons. First, a large glass bowl (of the kind in a stacking set of glass bowls) is not a good bread bowl. You need a bowl that is tall so you can cover it with a damp towel and the dough will still have room to rise. Second, if you want to have fresh bread for dinner you really need to start making it about noon as it still needs an hour to cool after it has finished baking before you can cut it.Tonight's country loaf, better than last week's paltry effort but still needing some tweaks, was served slathered with butter, drizzled with honey, and alongside a delicious beef barley stew that Dave made. It was a perfect meal as our temps never got out of the 70's throughout our grey, rainy day--it almost felt like fall. Tomorrow I will cut into the loaf from the loaf pan and see if it is any different in texture or density.Next up: Sourdough starter!"},

Rather than trash it, I decided to have it lead into today's post as it fits my current mindset perfectly.June 10, 2016.Posting is hard with a kitten on your lap. Fortunately said kitten was spooked by the doorbell so I have a little time on the laptop when I can reach all the keys. Today is the fourth full day of our new life in Austin. I thought about writing sooner, but had little things to deal with in the house and yard, and big exhaustion to overcome in my mind and body. Today I am sort of waiting for an electrician and a plumber--both of whom I have a sneaking suspicion won't show--and determinedly and forcefully doing... nothing. My spouse threatened to tie me to the bed today and take away my phone so that I would be forced to rest and recuperate, but he left with a promise from me that I wouldn't do anything I didn't want to do today. So a little laundry, a little sweeping, a little organization... and now relaxing on the couch, posting and waiting for electrician and plumber.It's so quiet here. This house seems to suck up all sound--which is unexpected given the lack of carpeting and window coverings...And then something happened, and I got pulled away from posting for, well, three and a half weeks. But I'm back now, binge-watching Fixer Upper on HGTV from my hotel room in L.A. waiting to start filming as an extra on ConMan tomorrow through Friday before flying home Saturday. Then Sunday is when life really begins in Austin. Today I have been alternating between looking forward to my cinematic adventures tomorrow and the rest of the week (though I still don't have call time info and it's almost 9:00 pm...), and also anticipating the next steps at Stone's Throw. I am going back and setting up my studio (and working on the orders that have been steadily coming in since the move)! I'll slog through unpacking the house stuff--not really looking forward to that, but then I get to set up the new loom (and its siblings) and the rest of the sunroom (aka the loom room, textiles room, you get the idea).When the house is under control it'll be time to start on the apartment. I am kind of excited about painting, decorating, redoing the floors and making it into a fun place that people will want to rent on HomeAway. I even have someone who wants to earn a little extra money cleaning between rentals to help support her Etsy clothes habit!Further down the pike (after our house sells in Atlanta and we have finished moving the studio) it'll be time to take on the big renovation of the master bathroom and the smaller reno of the master bedroom. Somehow I don't see life slowing down anytime soon!"},
{"title": "First Saturday NOT Driving to or From Texas In...", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2016", "text": "It felt good to sleep in a bit this morning--though Dan, our carpenter, showed up right on time at 9:00 to work on the house here in Atlanta. Today is the first Saturday since January 23 that I have been in Atlanta--not away from home, not driving. Wow. I almost don't know what to do with myself--though, of course, the right answer is probably to pack something, clean something, get rid of something, or paint something. But I am not going to be \"right\" today. I am going to put two kiln loads in because I am backed up on orders right now, and then I'm going to shift gears and work on my websites and newsletters. In the sun. On the deck.Dan the carpenter is here because we want to sell out house here quickly when we are ready to put it on the market--which won't be till we're out in June. We also wish to get as much as we can for it as the house in Texas has sucked up more resources than we originally planned when we bought it. After 13 years of living in the Atlanta house there is a lot we need to do to make it shine again. The landscaping has gone to hell as I have spent every summer for the past five years in Montana and have not spent any time on the yard here. The interior of the house is a kaleidoscope with rooms in every color from deep purple, forest green, turquoise, tangerine, lime green, and raspberry to deep terracotta red. The wood floors have been mistreated by dogs, furniture, and ruthless cleaning people using inappropriate products on them. In short, the house has been well-lived in and well-loved. Now it needs to sparkle and strut again.So over the next six weeks the yard will be cleaned up with new sod, the overgrown shrubbery will be trimmed back and/or moved, the bamboo, wisteria and kiwi will be tamed, and the raised vegetable and herb gardens. will be reclaimed and replanted. Today Dan is taking down the framework and screening on the front porch, opening up the front of the house again and making it more welcoming. He is also going to repair/replace all the wood trim and railings on the porch, the playhouse in the back and the shed that need it. We decided last minute today NOT to take down the big pergola over the driveway in the back even though it blocks the view of the backyard from the livingroom. The decision makes me happy as the pergola is a riot of wisteria blossom right now and the sweet yellow flowers of the kiwi vine twined in with the wisteria will bloom in another week.After the basic repairs are done, the house, porch, deck, fence, little house and shed are being pressure-washed. After they're clean, the decks, porch, and front fencewill be restained, and all the trim on the porch, playhouse and the shed will be repainted. For the inside, I (with the help of my ever-valiant friend Becky) am repainting all the ceilings white, painting all the interior walls greige, and hiring a painter to paint all the interior trim white. In mid-May while Jessie is on her 8th-grade class trip and I am back in Texas for the week with the dogs, the floors are being sanded, restained and refinished. We are going to go with a dark stain on the main floor this time to update the house and set off the newer hickory floors upstairs. Much as I love the house in Austin, it's going to be tough to leave this house when all the work is done. It's going to be GORGEOUS!The Griffith family, however, are not the only ones moving: Siyeh Glass and Studio are both moving to Austin in a month and a half, and I need to do some serious divestiture before that happens. Divestiture means a big-assed garage sale. A week-long, combination flea market and fundraising-auction kind of garage sale. I think I'll even have raffles. I have everything from finished work to sheet glass and kilns that I do not wish to pack and move. The last truckload out went Saturday April 2 and comprised entirely studio materials, furniture and tools. The truck was comprehensively packed, and, yet, looking at the studio now I don't feel like I made a dent in it. But if I can sell most of the sheet glass, I'll be in good shape. To make that happen I need to get the word out, and now we're back to the website and newsletters. Wish I still had a sky chair here to lounge in while I work today. Maybe I'll have to work from Steinbeck's, or the Imperial... Yeah, that sounds good._____________Post-writing/pre-posting note: I never made it to the studio today, nor did I work on my website. But the pond is MUCH cleaner, and I am in the process of copying all my photos, videos (of the home variety), and music to one drive from which I will back them up to the cloud. Tonight: Papa John's pizza, and Paranorman with the J."},

My time in Austin last week is already a distant memory and I am thoroughly, exhaustedly grounded in the now of Atlanta. The exhaustion is the good kind, the physical kind--not the mental or emotional kinds. It is due to the workout (on which I elaborate below) and to the roughly 1500 lbs of glass (5 lb jars of frit) that Becky and I boxed up in the studio today for this week's loadout. I am wiped. If I were not on point helping the child with her essay on the civil war (which is still not done after two weeks of \"writing\") I would be going to bed as soon as this post is done. But the civil war calls, and the first draft of the essay MUST be done tonight. I will get to bed around 10:00--if I'm lucky.A less fragmented person might be wondering what carbohydrates has to do with all of this, but that person wasn't there at the beginning of my day today. This morning at 8:30 I had a half-hour session with Mario, the personal trainer I engaged at L.A. Fitness starting back in December to help me conquer the second half of my fifties. Even though I was in no mood to work out this morning and didn't have to get up to take the J to school as she has pinkeye, I trudged (in the minivan) to the gym and did a serious chest workout followed up with 30 minutes (sounds better than a half hour) on the elliptical machine with Becky. As I was doing five sets of benchpresses, Mario and I discussed the fact that I have not lost so much as a half pound since I started working out. My short-term goal for working out was to build muscle and gain energy with a long-term goal of weight loss, but, come on! Three months and exactly the same weight?Mario suggested that for the rest of the week I not eat carbs after 10:00 am. I said sure, thinking bread, potatoes, pasta, rice, crackers, etc. However when I got home from my grocery store run this afternoon (the only thing I had in the fridge was cold pizza and I knew that had carbs so I had to shop), I thought I had better check to see what foods have carbs. I vaguely remember beer being high in carbs and I wondered if hard cider might have them too. Yes it does so no cider for me. Wine is good (virtually no carbs) but the reference I found mentioned that the carbs in the grapes were lost in the fermentation process. Wait a minute, grapes have carbs? I didn't buy grapes, but I did buy apples and lettuce and tomatoes--all of which have/are carbohydrates. Well this is distressing!As I munched on a dinner of 1/2 lb of cold shrimp and 1/2 lb of imitation crab surimi and the first glass of wine, I discovered that peas, bananas, apples, grapes, and a swarm of my other go-to, eat well, lose weight \"diet\" foods are high in carbs. Of course I didn't think to look up the carbs in surimi until I was done with dinner... oops. At least I can still have cheese Gromit!And now I am off to bed. The paper is as done as it's going to get for the night, and I managed to blog and do other computer tasks for the past five hours since I started this post. Whew!"},

Oh the Shame. It's been 53 weeks to the day since my last post. Guess the whole posting-with-a-time-limit didn't work out. Last night I spoke to the lovely folk of the San Antonio Glass Guild who had graciously invited me to do a presentation for them on my second book. While I was there I was asked why I wasn't blogging anymore. I was also informed that Nikki and Lola are getting ALL the attention, and I should really Get Back To It. So here I am, back to blogging (though I have severe doubts about daily).As is life's wont, much has transpired in the past year...The view from our condo in St. CroixLast April, while we were all vacationing in St. Croix, my mother died peacefully in her sleep. As I was at both a loss and a loose end when Dave took his monthly work trip to Austin in May, I decided to go with him. The time alone with Dave and the town both were a comforting, warm balm to my soul and at the end of the week, we rethought our decision to move to Montana after Jessie finished school in June of 2016  and determined to move to Austin instead. June and July saw the regular, annual trip to Montana. August started the school year and the official house hunt in Austin (which ended after one house and one day).KaijuIn September we closed on Stone's Throw (the official name--thanks to Bill Paley--of the new manse), and Dave (the spouse) turned 50. (I couldn't find one photo that captured the essence of the house well enough so I linked to the realtor's slide show which sums it up pretty well.) We celebrated both (as they happened the same day) by attending an outdoor Alamo Drafthouse Roadshow performance of \"Serenity\" in a self-styled Old West Ghost Town outside of Austin. In September we also adopted a new family member, Kaiju, an adult male cat who is the first cat in our family since the passing of Ernie four years ago.20 years and still in loveOctober opened (mid-month) with Dave's and my 20th wedding anniversary (the picture is actually from Christmas day, but I like it so much I am using it for the anniversary) followed the next week by the first or many drive-out-to-Austin-for-a-week-to-take stuff trips for Dave and me--in the middle of the most horrific storm of an especially bad storm season.PavlovaNovember found us in the snowy midwest for Thanksgiving with Dave's P's--the day after we adopted ANOTHER cat, Pavlova, a tiny Russian blue kitten (Ernie Minor!) rescued from under a neighbor's porch and their dogs. We took her with us to Chicago not wanting to leave her to the tender mercies of an adult cat who hated her and three dogs who thought she'd make a fine chew toy--just playing, of course--with the house/pet sitter). The parents were very tolerant of us showing up with a cat. She is about the cutest thing ever and I would love to post pics of her here, but there just isn't enough room.Jessie and River Song!I also had another stint as a Staff Lieutenant at Chicago Tardis, the annual post-Thanksgiving Dr. Who convention in the burbs of Chicago. Big highlights this year were Alex Kingston who plays Dr. River Song, Burn Gorman (who I like best from Star Trek but he was also in Torchwood), and Ingrid Oliver who plays Osgood. Jessie reaped the benefits of my tenure by scoring autographs and photographs with all the guestsfinal American Made Show winter boothWe thought about going to Austin for Christmas, but Jessie wanted to spend a last Christmas in Atlanta, so in December we drove to Austin with a UHaul at the beginning of the month so Jessie could find out about applying and auditioning for the Fine Arts Program at McCallum High School and we could put the first furniture in the new place. January, a new paragraph and a new year, found Dave taking a new job, and me exhibiting at the last American Made Show (formerly the Buyer's Market of American Craft) in Washington DC. Let us pause and mourn the end of an era...London on our last night theretaken with my iPhoneFebruary had the Griffiths vacationing in London and Cardiff (home of The Dr. Who Experience) for winter break, and then in Austin for Jessie's audition for the Cinematic Arts section of the Fine Arts Academy at McCallum (she was accepted!).First UHaul disasterMarch started with another UHaul trip out for the whole family--Jessie came too even though she had to miss school as she had class registration stuff to do for high school. The trip unexpectedly lasted two weeks as we had septic problems I needed to stay to deal with, and ended with a permanent relocation for Dave who needed to be here full-time for the new job. J and I went back to Atlanta, I spent a week there, and then drove back to Austin with another UHaul load.Baxter waiting patiently to be loaded for a trip to AustinTomorrow I drive back to Atlanta for a week, Dave flies to Atlanta for an overnighter at the end of the week, and then we all drive back here (I need Dave to drive the UHaul so I can drive the minivan full of three dogs and a teenager) for spring break. The spring break trip will be the first UHaul load out for the studio (I knew we'd get to glass sometime in this post!) and I must admit to being relieved to start it--if for no other reason than to finally see how much stuff I have there.Given the move--which will stretch out at least until June--I'm not sure how much time I'll actually have to post, but I can feel life moving into a stage where daily musings once more have a place and a time.

{"title": "Posting Again", "date": "Friday, March 20, 2015", "text": "I am trying something new today: Posting with a time limit. I haven't posted in the past several weeks as I have been doing an Artist's Way daily journal of three pages of longhand, stream-of-consciousness writing instead. I noticed as I was doing it that it was much like blogging for me except without the spelling correction of the ability (and unfortunate reliance on) backspace. The other thing about the Artist's Way daily pages is that it takes a very finite amount of time (in part due to the afore-mentioned lack of backspace) as it is only three pages long. In the past I have spent much too much time days on blogging--to the detriment of accomplishing the things I was blogging about. So for the next little while I am going to split my time between daily pages days and blogging days--one for personal bitching and one for things worth sharing. I am writing all about this daily writing in the sharing venue as I truly believe in the value of starting the day with a mental purge from the squirrelly brain to page. It's my form of mediation or mental yoga (and has the side benefit of not being too physical!). To keep it manageable, I can blog for 15-20 minutes (the goal is 15 but I'm allowed 20) as there is no three page limit on the Internet.Today's streaming....I have a desk again! And in true Brenda fashion, it is already covered in STUFF. But it's a desk, and the laptop has a cool background today (it changes daily--of course it does). If I sit at it in the cool red chair for too long, my butt goes numb so I have go do actual work.  This is a good motivator for me.Happy Anniversary to my wonderful spouse who asked me out for the first time 20 years ago today. We met 20 years and two days ago (and we both forgot that anniversary till yesterday) and he started today by bringing me a kiss and a mocha from Kavarna in bed. Awww.Glass is flowing--literally--in the studio, though I am coming to the end of the orders I got at the American Made Show. Glass is also breaking with a higher frequency than usual with a gallery reporting two pieces--the largest and the smallest in their order--arriving broken. I now have a claim in with Hargrove for the AMS breakage and a claim in with UPS for the client breakage. That's over $1,000 in inventory I've had to replace. Hope it pays back.On the Farm2Yarn front, I also made a first pass logo (though I am still waiting for Debbie Suchy, my marketing and product consultant, to get back to me with her designs and recommendations) and updated the website and Facebook pages a bit. I have almost 2,000 likes on that Facebook page (wow!) and I feel I should update it regularly because of it. But who has time?Last weekend was the spring retreat for the Peachtree Handspinners' Guild (of which I am a member) and I spent from Friday at 6:00 pm till Sunday at 4:00 pm--excepting a tiny bit of time to sleep and eat--rolling roving into 4 oz balls and labeling it for sale. And even with all that I still have three bags left. I have a LOT of roving!! In order to decrease my inventory a bit, I signed up yesterday to be a sponsored vendor at the Georgia Fiber Festival in September. Though I have already sold all but six skeins (balls, whatever) of the llama roving, I still have tons of alpaca and a good bit of yak cloud for sale and I will also have a lot of dyed and painted rovings too. Though I have decided to specialize primarily in the natural colors as they are so varied and plentiful, I can't get away fro the blues, greens, purples and reds--and I have yet to see a fiber animal outside of Minecraft that is naturally deep blue. I do raise colored sheep in Minecraft and when I shear them I get colored wool all ready to make into carpets, but the real world requires slightly more work.Time--both for writing this post and for life--are in short supply right now. Dan the wonderful carpenter built the games cabinet that is the basis for this year's Waldorf 7th grade class auction project, and now I have a week to make the veneer inlay for it, do the inlying, and sand and finish the cabinet. The design chosen for the cabinet isa detail from The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo as the 7th grade studied the Renaissance this fall and spent a good bit of time on DaVinci and Michelangelo. I have all my tools and materials save the first one I need to use which is the tracing projector as there is no way I am going to try to freehand an enlargement of this work. But is it supposed to arrive tomorrow morning and then I have all day tomorrow to draw, cut veneer and glue. Gulp. Hope I have enough time as Sunday is the day to do a year's worth of Quickbooks for my business (and our personal) taxes.Now my time is up and it's off to the studio I go to meet Dee (who is coming down to help me today) and clean up the mudroom--it needs to be turned back into a coldworking room from the dumping ground it's been for the past year and a half."},
{"title": "The One Show Movement, AKA The American Made Show or ACRE Philly?", "date": "Tuesday, February 17, 2015", "text": "I have been sitting on this post for awhile. Every time I thought it was the right time to weigh in, something else happened in our community of artists and show producers that made me hold off. Now, given everything circulating from other artists who did ACRE and everything I have heard from the rumor mill, I think it's time to step up to the plate.Apparently I wasn't clear enough in my post about what kind of show I had this year at the American Made Show (AMS) in DC (formerly the Buyer's Market of American Craft) put on by the Rosen Group. That actually turns out to be a good lead-in for this post which addresses the current state of this show and what to do for a wholesale show for American handcrafts going forward. In short, it was a very good show for me. It wasn't the best ever, but it was very good. So why wasn't it better? Though it is never as simple as one reason, I believe it was primarily because attendance was diluted--both on the part of artists and buyers--by the emergence of another American handcraft show on the east coast in the winter.During the huge amount of downtime I had at the AMS, I had a very interesting conversation with Michael Golan, another artist at the show who has been doing it a lot longer than I have, and who has years of experience in wholesale going back to the boom days. Whether he intended it or not, he became a focal point this year for an artists' revolution--a fomentation complete with torches and pitchforks that started out at the American Made Show and, I assume, spilled over into the ACRE Show in Philly last weekend. While I was talking to Michael at the AMS, a couple of other artists actually came up to him, brandishing their pitchforks and cackling madly about how they were \"in\". They seemed to want to burn Wendy Rosen in effigy as the source of all their problems because she moved the show to DC in January from Philly in February. Consensus was that she did this (as well as change the name of the show) on a whim, or to screw over Nancy Vince from Wholesalecrafts--the ACRE show promoter. That was not at all what I understood Michael's call to arms was about.Instead, his proposal seemed to be quite reasonable and something I am definitely behind myself: There should only be one winter all American handmade show in the northeast. Artists should refuse to do two. Michael was encouraging artists to draw a line in the sand and say, \"Enough! We will not be squeezed any more! We will not be bullied into doing two shows in the northeast in the winter because we're afraid we won't see all of our buyers. We are going to pick one show based on solid business reasons--not hyperbole--and only do that one!\" At least that's that's the gist I got from speaking to him. If this is not what he meant--and I am as liable as the next person to hear what I want to in a conversation--I apologize profusely and publicly for misunderstanding his intent. But I want to say that I am 100% behind doing what I think MIchael said. It's ridiculous to add another show to an already over-burdened, under-served artist community. It's also a disservice to buyers to make them travel multiple times for essentially the same show. Down With Two Shows! Down With The Man.... Uh, sorry. I'm getting caught up and carried away by my own fervor. Where was I? Oh yes, one show.So how to decide what show should be the One Show to Rule Them All? Michael proposed having an artists' meeting at the end of the ACRE show (he did both shows) to talk about how both shows went, and to--as a group--pick one show to do next year. It was a brilliant, if flawed, idea. It was brilliant because people banding together DO have the power to affect change in their lives, but it was flawed, because most of the people making the decision would be doing so without all the facts and based on erroneous assumptions, and because a lot of the people who could add their voices and weight to the movement (like me) won't be there because WE ALREADY REFUSED TO BUY INTO THE HYPE AND  WON'T DO TWO ALL HANDMADE AMERICAN WHOLESALE SHOWS IN THE SAME AREA LESS THAN A MONTH APART.* But I'm perfectly willing to evaluate the shows on their own merits and then choose one of them to back in the future. I can't speak for everyone, but I absolutely, positively CANNOT afford to invest twice as much money, time, and energy to see the same number of--or fewer--buyers because now we have to do both the American Made Show and ACRE or be afraid that we'll miss out on orders from buyers who only attend one show.How about we start with some facts, and then finish off with some opinions driven by the afore-mentioned facts to inform our decision-making process. Fact: It is neither a secret nor a surprise that sales have been down across the board at wholesale shows for the past several years. There are many causes: a recession, increased access to products through the Internet (Amazon.com and Etsy just for starters), the aging out of the gallery owners and the artists who ruled the handcrafts world during the 90's, the emergence of a new generation of self-proclaimed makers--as opposed to artists or craftspeople--who don't do the American Handmade show circuit, and, finally, the ready availability of cheap or knock-off goods from China and the third world. We have to face facts: Artists who put three kids through college from the sales they made each winter at the Buyer's Market show will never see those days again. Those of us who still have kids to put through college had better be looking to diversify our revenue streams because we're not going to see those days at all. It doesn't do anyone any good to stand around whinging at a show about the good old days and pointing gnarled fingers at the show promoter in blame.Fact: There's been a lot of gossip and conflicting information floating around for the past few years about the Rosen Show changing dates and locations for their winter show. Personally, I don't care about gossip and rumor. If I want to know something, I go to an actual decision-maker and I ask until I get the straight bottom-line answer. So I went to Rebecca Mercado, the American Made Show Director. I asked specific, pointed questions, and am confident that I received complete and honest answers. I got no hype and no bull, just a complete several-year forecast of available space and options. For those who don't know me, I have no agenda to promote here. I am just sick and tired of having my business manipulated by other people. I want one show, at the same time, in the same place, every year, with enough hotels rooms for buyers and artists, and enough hall space for 700-800 artists. Period.So here's what I got from Rebecca: In 2014 the convention center in Philly was totally unavailable for the usual dates in February due to the Auto Show being given all the halls. In 2015, only Hall A was available for the February dates with other spaces elsewhere in the building (on a different floor) being offered instead. The show moved to DC because the convention center in Philly cut down on the space they were willing to give the Rosen Group in favor of the Auto Show which brings more money into the city than a wholesale American handmade show does. Without the space available, the show promoters wouldn't be able to host as many artists, without a good selection of artists, the buyers wouldn't attend, and the slow spiral down the drain that we have all been experiencing in this business would continue. The show moved to January because Congress is not in session yet, so hotel rooms are cheaper, the convention center was available with plenty of space for all the artists, and the Presidents' Day holiday meant a three-day weekend for buyer's. Fun as it might be to imagine one, there was no great conspiracy by an evil empire to manipulate the little people, to crush our dreams and control our lives. It was hoped that the January dates and the move to DC would not be to disaccommodating for everyone, but that doesn't seem to be the case, and now we have to move on. So we started out with the Rosen Group changing time and dates for their winter northeast show based solely on long-term strategic planning (emphasis on the \"long-term\") and incorporating stability, facilities availability, and other market considerations into the decision-making process. They knew that it would take time to move their customer base--both artists and retailers to the new place and dates. But they knew that for long-term growth of the show, the move was necessary. The Rosen Group knew they would take a hit financially, but figured they could weather it.Then Wholesalecrafts came in, snapped up the reduced space in the old time and location, grabbed a large percentage of the customers--both artists and retailers--for their show by capitalizing on the human dislike of change. I have heard that they have secured both Halls A and B (the traditional AMS space) for 2016 which means they could accommodate the same number of artists who used to do the Rosen show in the same space and at the same time. Wow! Aren't we lucky? I am sure that there are many people--artists and retailers alike--who are breathing a sigh of relief right now because they get to do a show where they are accustomed to doing it at the time they are accustomed to doing it. I, on the other hand, am so annoyed that we got to this state that I could cheerfully throttle someone!\"But, why, Brenda?\", you might be asking.  \"After all, buyers and artists came to Philly this year, and there is no reason to think they won't continue to come. So if we're only going to do one show, let's pick the easy show for next year: Let's stay in Philly with ACRE!\" Uh huh. The only way this scenario actually makes sense and is good for both artists and retailers is if the Rosen Group is headed by an idiot who walked away from a viable, vibrant situation in Philly for stupid reasons. But I think everyone who knows her can say with confidence that Wendy Rosen is no idiot. Like her, hate her, you've got to acknowledge that she built the strongest, longest all American handmade wholesale show in the country. She did it with a combination of good timing, good business sense, and sheer stainless-steel-balls grit. Wendy also has the best secret weapon in the world (for artists and retailers) in her toolbox: She has Rebecca Mercado as her show director. Rebecca understands planning, traffic patterns, dollars and sense (sic intentional). She does not react off the cuff. Instead she acts after careful deliberation, and executes deliberately and precisely. She is the best counter balance to Wendy's expansive, blue-sky visioning that you could imagine.But maybe Wendy did make a slip, and Philly is still the best place to be for the show and February is the best time. How do I want to bet? What do I know about Wholesalecrafts? After all, I want to place my business in the hands of the the show promoter in whom I have the most confidence. It's not about liking or disliking or personalities; for me it's strictly business and about performance.I have done shows with both promoters--I did ACRE Las Vegas for the first four years hoping it would be a good, strong, west-coast show for me, and it never worked out. Yes, there was a recession. Maybe that was the problem initially. But my biggest problem with the show was that I never felt like they knew what they were doing. They were very nice and seemed to genuinely want to put on a good show, but they lacked the experience (both the promoter and her support staff) to pull it off. Everything about the show was in constant flux. It felt like they could never make their minds up about anything because they were either too busy getting (conflicting) opinions and trying to act upon all of them, or they were making decisions based on the best price they could get year-to-year for facilities and dates--flying by the seat of their pants. In the nine years since Wholesale Crafts launched the Vegas show, I haven't seen them follow through long-term on anything. Yes, the show started just before a major down-turn in the market, but every single show they've done since the original Las Vegas show feels like trying something out to me. The Vegas show is limping along not nearly living up to its potential. ACRE Orlando came, and almost as soon as it came, it went. I think there was another show in the northeast, but it came and went so fast I don't even know what it was called. Now instead of focusing on their core show, building it up to a west-coast version of the American Made Show, they're in Philly. They're hopping all over place. Why?Regardless of why, I know that I have to look out for my own business. I have got to choose what shows I do based on consistent performance and the stability of the promoter. A lot of my peers are jumping on the she-said/she-said bandwagon and choosing based on personality or how the DC and Philly shows were THIS year. I'm more concerned with a year or two from now when Halls A and B aren't available again (it wasn't just a one-off problem for the Rosen Group when they were doing their planning) and Wholesalecrafts reacts in the same year-to-year fashion they have shown with their previous shows (either downsize, change dates, change venues, or cancel the show completely and move on to doing something else).By not having a strong forward-thinking planning strategy you cannot grow an enterprise. I've seen nothing so far to think that Wholesalecrafts has such a strategy in place. Every move seems to happen based on the Now. Lest you think I am sitting in my glass house casting stones, let me be the first to say that I can recognize the reactionary behavior because I am often guilty of it myself. I have fallen into the trap of making business decisions based on something that happened rather than on a calm analysis of all the facts. I have also given up on things I should have stuck with and grown. Had I not exhibited both of these behaviors, my business would doubtless by in a much better position and I would be doing all the shows and not worrying about picking the right one. Because of my own limitations, I have to be scrupulous these days about my choices and plans, and Wholesalecrafts has not shown me the stick-to-itedness that I need to have in a business partner. It is my great fear that they will coast the February Philly show along and not grow it until the slow spiral down the drain is complete. And then we, the artists, will be screwed. The American Made Show will be slowly ground down, the ACRE show will never grow, and we will have nothing.So here's my torch and pitchfork: I am not going to do ACRE Philly. I am not going to do it next year, I am not going to do it the year after, and if it is still around, I am not going to do it the year after that. I would be happy to do and support the Wholesalecrafts' Las Vegas show if the promoters put a serious amount of time and energy into growing it into its potential, and stopped futzing around and diluting their focus by moving into an area that is already (longterm) adequately served. I hope that many of my peers feel the same way, and make their own stand for One Show. If it turns out that the One Show is not the American Made Show, I will mourn, and I will drink a toast to the end of a great era. Then I will pull my big-girl panties up and figure out another way to market my work to my wholesale customers.*For those who say \"What about the ACC?\", my answer is it isn't the same as /American Made/ACRE: It's also a retail show. Arguably the retail component is stronger than the wholesale component, and many artists who do it wholesale have also traditionally done the American Made Show."},
{"title": "The American Made Show 2015", "date": "Monday, January 26, 2015", "text": "Front of the BoothAnd now the promised post on the American Made Show! Statistics out of the way first. We didn't do the show last year as I had to take care of my mother who was post-surgery (and had a major infection). So my comparison will be with the year before which was our best Buyer's Market show ever (we missed the boom times in the 90's and started just as the recession hit). We were down from 2013 by about 10 orders, but our average sale size was up a bit.32 orders15 new customers$636 average saleHello DC! (After a night on the train)New customer distribution:2 California1 Connecticut1 Delaware1 Florida1 Massachusetts1 Maryland1 Maine2 North Carolina2 New York1 Pennsylvania2 VirginiaExisting customer distribution:1 Arkansas1 California3 Florida2 Indiana2 Massachusetts1 Maryland1 Michigan2 North Carolina1 New Jersey2 Pennsylvania1 WisconsinBack of the Booth (Look Ma, no dead side!)Two existing customers (on from California and one from Hawaii) contacted me with orders prior to the show and said they would not be at any of the east coast shows this winter. Now it's up to me to contact everyone else I didn't see and send them images of the new work. I will also let them know how the show went and encourage them to attend next year. I did not see my buyers from Uncommon Goods, but I did meet the buyers from the Museum Fine Arts San Francisco. Mostly who I didn't see were the little shop buyers from Pennsylvania and Maryland who were so prevalent at the last Buyer's Market I attended. I have a feeling they are going to go to the ACRE show in Philly in February instead. Regardless, I will get in touch with them before that show to let them know about our new work, and to check their stock on what they have ordered from us previously. I did ask the Rosen Group for specific numbers of buyers for this show and was told that registration was higher that it has been in 4-5 years with 70% of those registered checking in at the show.Set-up went quickly once we decided what to do about our extra space.Crowns for all!Those were the facts of the show, now here are the impressions: It felt dead. Dead, dead, dead. The aisles were empty, we rarely had anyone waiting for us to take their order, and time crawled by. Despair was thick in the air. I talked to several artists who thought they were having a terrible show because of the feel--only to find out when they totaled up their sales after the second day that they were even or ahead of the previous year! As will always happen, there were also those who had a horrible show, and those who had a great show. No one was saying their numbers were anywhere close to what they had been in the 90's, but I doubt they will ever be there again (more on that tomorrow). The people who were there were placing orders, and the orders were good. Unfortunately they were also efficient which meant we artists had a lot of time on our hands to worry, and gossip, and--in some cases--gripe and foment. More on THAT tomorrow too.The traditional One Nice Night Out For Dinner photoIn our booth we spent the time getting to know our neighbors better, mentoring new exhibitors, and Todd made lots and lots of crowns. He made crowns for everyone around us with each artist's own work as the centerpiece of her (or his!) crown. We also took lots of pictures. In all, it was a very, very good show.For a personal experience, it was great. Todd, John, Dee and I took the train in from Atlanta--a sleeper and an adventure all on its own. Set-up was the quickest ever--in spite of a change in the floorplan that left our booth exposed on all sides and with five extra feet of width. Breakdown was also quicker than ever and we were back in the hotel room before 6:30 pm on Monday. It was very nice that the show ended at 2:00 instead of 3:00 or 4:00--though to be honest, it really doesn't need to be four days long. I can see the argument for having it run Friday through Monday so some buyers can attend Friday through Sunday while others can grab the other end of the long weekend Saturday through Monday. But it is very long--and boring--for the artists when there aren't a ton of buyers.Bottom line: I WILL do this show again next year, and I will do everything I can to promote it and keep it a vibrant, exciting place where artists can connect in person with buyers. Thank you Rebecca, Jen, Maria and all of the rest of the staff from the Rosen Group and Hargrove who worked tirelessly to fix problems and address concerns throughout the show. I was very impressed with the level of professionalism and personal commitment shown by all. And now, more pictures than I could comfortably share in the text.My goody bag for the train from ToddTodd on a train.Trying to get Todd and John's viewliner roomette.The dining car on the train was very cool.Narrow train aisleThe hall in the hotel was as wide as the entire train car--both cabins and the aisle!Booth: Back RightBooth: Front LeftBooth: Front RightBooth: Back Left insideBooth: Left Outside (Our kite wall)Hanging with the neighbors."},
{"title": "Back to Glass Incarnate and the Niche Award", "date": "Sunday, January 25, 2015", "text": "Unusually for me, I have several posts backed up in my head to write and I am having difficulty getting them out. This first one is easy--it's back to Glass Incarnate from Life Incarnate. The second one--my review of the American Made Show in DC last week--is also relatively easy--look for it tomorrow. But it's the prospect of writing the third one--the politics and future of shows for artists--that has been blocking me on writing at all for the past several days. I finally got past the block by separating out the first two posts, and I'll use them to ease into the third. The third post is the most important one and the one that I have really got to think through carefully to get just right. I hate that kind of pressure. But there are a lot of opinions and smack talk flying around out there now in the wake of the American Made Show and leading up to the ACRE and ACC shows next month, and I think it's essential that all of us who work in the handmade crafts industry stop, think, and act for our futures instead of reacting in fear to rumor and misinformation and making bad choices. I am also not one to keep my strong opinions to myself. So be it.But today, back to Glass Incarnate. For those who have followed this blog over the years, you know that it started back in 2006 as a tool to help me get back into the flow of writing so I could write my first book. I used it to chronicle my experiences writing, running a small glass studio, and later expanding the studio into a kiln glass resource center and teaching facility with a hotshop, a torchwork classroom, and 4-8 other artists and support staff. As I began writing book two, life both inside and outside of the studio got very complicated. Artists are like cats and herd just as well, and they also have lives just as complicated as mine with responsibilities and choices that affect their ability to contribute to the needs of the studio. My own personal life also became very complicated with my mother's health, my daughter switching from the Waldorf school to homeschooling, and splitting our family's time each year between Atlanta and Montana--two homes, one studio. Finally it came to the point where herding artists and trying to run a studio long-distance for 3-4 months of the year on top of everything else on my plate was just too much, and I closed the resource center/teaching facility and let go the remaining staff. It was a hard decision, but book 2 and life really kicked my butt for a couple of years, and I was finally tapped out. I limped by on the work that I sold to galleries and shops, but I didn't attempt to grow my business at all. I waited. I hibernated. And Glass Incarnate transformed into Life Incarnate.Then life cycled back around to the upside, as it is wont to do. My mother got better, my daughter went back to Waldorf, and I emerged from my den to find spring. I am now back in the studio regularly--though I am not opening it up again as a resource center--and I have a renewed vigor for both my business and my art. I missed vigor! I missed excitement and the tingle of an idea that just couldn't wait to be realized in glass! It's been three and a half years since I dreamed about glass, and I finally have the room in my brain to do it again. Oddly enough, in the weird way the universe has, that of which I dreamt three years ago and that which inspires me now are the same thing--3-D printing in glass (although I think of it more as 3-D silkscreening with glass than 3-D printing).I submitted a 3-D whatever piece that I created for book 2 as an entry for the 2015 Niche Awards in glass cast, fused, or slumped. Ten years ago was the first time I was a finalist for this award, and this year I finally won. Unsurprisingly, the recognition of the judges and my peers gave me a shot of confidence and energy  that I really needed after the past few years. Though it is time-consuming to the nth degree, I really want to do more of this work. I may or not be able to market and sell it, but for the first time, that isn't a consideration for me. I want to do it for art's sake, because it demands to be created--not for business. Ahhhh. That feels good! Now off to finish printing out my orders from the show and building the firing schedule for the next few months. Truth to tell, that feels good too."},
{"title": "Distaff Day", "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2015", "text": "\"Distaff Day, also called Roc Day, is 7 January, the day after the feast of the Epiphany. It is also known as Saint Distaff's Day, one of the many unofficial holidays in Catholic nations. Many St. Distaff's Day gatherings were held, large and small, throughout local fiber community. The distaff, or rock, used in spinning was the medieval symbol of women's work. In many European cultural traditions, women resumed their household work after the twelve days of Christmas. Women of all classes would spend their evenings spinning on the wheel. During the day, they would carry a drop spindle with them. Spinning was the only means of turning raw wool, cotton or flax into thread, which could then be woven into cloth.\" from WikipediaI celebrated Distaff Day for the first time yesterday with a day of social spinning with the Peachtree Handspinner's Guild, and it was MARVELOUS. We spun, chatted, ate, shared knowledge, and picked challenge projects for the year. I picked up a 3 oz bag of brightly colored ends to blend into roving, spin and weave into a project before the March meeting. And speaking of weaving, last week I finally finished my first handspun/handwoven project, the beaded scarf. It was a bear to do, but it turned out beautifully and has me very excited about this challenge and more weaving of handspun.Other challenges I am going to do this year are the fleece comparison--wash, card or comb, and spinthree different types of wool; and the The Spinner's Book of Yarn Designs: Techniques for Creating 80 Yarns challenge which is to work (as a group) through the book and create all 80 yarns.In the more immediate timeframe, I finished spinning and plying the three lbs of merino/camel down blend that I am going to dye and knit into a sweater for Dave. While I have no problem dyeing this fiber, I never thought I would want to dye any of my alpaca as it comes in such wonderful different colors naturally. But a few things have happened recently to make me open up to the idea. First, I am incapable of walking by any of Gale's skeins of hand-dyed alpaca/silk roving without buying one or more so clearly I like brightly colored alpaca. I am also intrigued by the color possibilities that result from overdyeing the heathery greys, browns, and even the black alpaca with greens, blues, red, yellow, purple--in short, just about every color. And, finally, as I look at the stash of roving I have left from 2013's alpaca processing and contemplate the amount I have coming in from 2014's, I feel a need to move the first on to something new to make room for the second. What better way to invigorate it than to dye it?As I was already ordering protein (acid) dye from Dharma for Dave's sweater, I went ahead and got some other colors to try on the alpaca roving. And because no project is complete without a book, I also ordered the book Hand Dyeing Yarn and Fleece: Custom-Color Your Favorite Fibers with Dip-Dyeing, Hand-Painting, Tie-Dyeing, and Other Creative Techniques. It's not that I don't have other excellent books and resources for dyeing, but this one looked really scrumptious.Finally, I am also about half way through spinning Levi's cria (baby alpaca) fleece that Ruthann sent me. We are doing a trade whereby she had her fleece processed into roving, I am spinning it, and we will split the finished yarn. This is another one that I think I'm going to dye (my share of the yarn) as it is a beautiful soft, light grey brown that I think will really be gorgeous with a bright overdye."},

What I Most Need are Long Johns...", "date": "Thursday, January 08, 2015", "text": "Glacier National Park (https://www.facebook.com/GlacierNPS)J has been dropped at school, and I am in my cosy chair wearing fuzzy black sweat pants, a heavy 3/4 sleeve cotton shirt, the huge sweater my father-in-law made for me, two scarves made for me by my sister-in-law and my friend Vanessa, my dad's old fuzzy socks (I would've worn the smartwool socks my sister-in-law gave me at Thanksgiving, but I could only find one), and my sheepskin slippers. And I have a fuzzy blanket on my lap. I am not yet warm and toasty, but by god I will be!I spent my entire life not knowing how to dress for the weather. It took having a child and sending her to the Waldorf School for me to learn about layering. Yeah, we layered when I was a child, but the layers were a big heavy sweater on top of a long-sleeved turtle neck shirt. There was no way you wouldn't end up too hot inside the house in the sweater (even in our house which was kept about 60 degrees during the day, 50 at night) and too cold if you took it off so I missed the whole point. and just suffered. Endlessly. Silently.  Now that I'm in my 50's, I think I finally know how to dress (except for the whole open-toed, open-sided shoes thing with the bulky socks, but I'll find my new boots before I go out again this morning). I like a lighter shirt with a sweater of cotton jacket over it, and a coat over that (with knitted scarves as necessary) and warm fuzzy gloves. Speaking of which, I need to find my gloves before I go out again too. For the drive to school I wrapped my hands in the sleeves of the sweater--not the best option. As it's going to be cold for the next several days and I need to prepare for winter in Montana (2016) I went on-line and ordered me up a pair of Merino tights from Amazon. They'll be here tomorrow. Thank you Uncle Ed and Aunt Susan, your Amazon Christmas gift card bought me a wonderful book on dyeing wool and a pair of merino wool tights.So the weather, I'm sure a hot (no pun intended) topic across many parts of the country today. It was 10 degrees when I got up this morning. At the same time it was 25 in Austin, -4 in Chicago, and though two hours earlier, 27 degrees in Polson (where we spend our summers up by Glacier Park). In Missoula, 75 miles southeast, it was only 14, but that STILL beats Atlanta! And they have snow! If I've got to have cold, I want to have snow too. Of course I know all of those temps because I huddled under my fluffy down comforter looking up temperatures on my iPhone instead of getting out of bed--anything to put off being the first one up and so the one who turns up the heat and on the shower. Can't wait till Dave is home Saturday. I'm sleeping in!Now off to pour hot water in the bunnies water container, check the pond pump, and put out warm water for the chickens (who are probably quite indignant about the weather)."},
{"title": "Change is Good", "date": "Wednesday, January 07, 2015", "text": "Today I reflect on the benefits of changing up life, and setting new records. Now that Jessie is back in the formal school system  some might wonder if the past year and a half of homeschooling was a failure. Today I say with confidence that it was not only a success, but it had positive implications for areas of life not even associated with education. I find myself setting a record today of three days of blogging in a row. I think I would have to look back far into the stacks to find the last time I managed that feat. Jessie has also risen, gotten ready for school, done all her chores (letting out the chickens and feeding the bunnies and chickens and feeding and watering the dogs), made and ate her breakfast, made and packed her lunch, and been ready by the door ON TIME for the past three days--with NO yelling from me. She has also completed two nights straight of homework, we have watched no tv at all, and she is getting to bed early every night. I have completed the tasks on my daily to do list for three straight days--including packing up the crate of work to be shipped to DC today. Now I have a few minutes to post while I wait for Becky Hinton to arrive for a handwork morning. This afternoon, piano lessons for J and me, and tonight the Reno girls are coming for dinner.What does this have to do with homeschooling? I'll tell you. Though there were aspects of it J liked, she really missed the daily interactions with all of her friends. And because she had the break from school, she appreciates the parts she likes enough that she is willing to maintain her performance on other aspects, e.g., the education and learning part, up to and including paying attention in class, trying not to get frustrated when parents and others work with her and explain things she doesn't get, doing her homework before it's due, and getting up in the morning without fussing.For me, though I knew I was spending a lot of time planning curriculum, teaching, assignments, and driving to all kinds of extra activities, I hadn't realized just how much time until I got it all back. Even with being on point every morning at 6:45 (6:45!!!!) and driving her to and from school, I have time to burn. And I have a renewed appreciation for the other things I do with my life. I am enthused about being back in the studio making glass, I have been cleaning my house, spinning, throwing out/giving away clutter, and ticking thing after thing off my list. And everything feels great.Had we not taken a break to homeschool , I think we would both be stuck in an ever-deepening rut of dislike of school for her, and dissatisfaction with life for me. So Huzzah for Waldorf and Tim Smith--the best teacher in the world."},

There was not only frost on the windshield when I took J to school, but she reported that the top part of the pond was also frozen. The temps were a great shock to me as it was considerably warmer yesterday. I might have been better prepared if I watched tv or read the news/weather. Alas, I live in my own world and am thus surprised when there are unforeseen climate changes. Unfortunately, today is the day Todd and Dee are coming to unpack the boxes from Chicago, repack them for DC and load them into the pallet for pick-up and shipping tomorrow. This would be a fine activity inside the studio where there is heat, but the studio is already bursting at the seams with other stuff so the boxes (and pallet) are all outside in the hotshop. I may have to spend the morning befire they get here cleaning out the shipping room so we can work in there and avoid the frigid outside as much as possible.The new year has started chez Griffith, and with it came many changes; the biggest of which is J rejoining her class at the Waldorf School. We had planned for her to go back next year as she wanted to graduate 8th grade with her class, but when the door opened on the possibility of her returning in January if I took a job in Montana, it did not close when the job went to someone else, lingering instead to become a stated desire for her,  and thus a reality for us. Yesterday was the first of many requiring us to rise with the sun to hustle to school and I frankly can't wait till Dave is back from Austin and can take over the morning chauffeur duties. I am already over being a morning person and it's only Tuesday.Now the vacuuming and sweeping from yesterday are still calling, and it's time to get on with the day."},

{"title": "Homeschooling Has Begun", "date": "Wednesday, September 03, 2014", "text": "The second day of homeschooling is over and done, and I declare it to have been a success--though I'm not doing it the way I thought I would. I had grandiose plans of using Common Curriculum or some other lesson planning/class management software to organize my homeschooling day/week/month/year. I saw myself planing out the units and lessons for each subject for the entire year and logging them meticulously in my little organizer. Alas, I'm just not wired that way. Maybe with the perfect piece of software I could do it, but I just don't have the patience for über slow servers, lack of critical features (a class scheduling software that doesn't let you put the vacation schedule for the year in in advance so lessons aren't scheduled on those days? Come on!), and the learning curve that goes along with any new software/process. Plus, I am not even sure how much to plan for a day as how long it takes to get through it depends on Jessie: her interest, her aptitude, her wakefulness...So instead of a super-slick administrative and pedagogical set-up, I am using Google calendar and a broad-strokes approach. I know what I plan to cover for the year, I have back-up and drop-off units stacked at the end of each subject (at least in theory), and I am putting together the materials a week or so at a time. For example, we are finishing the History channel series Mankind: The Story of All of Us episodes that we had left over from last year for this year's initial Social Studies, and the daily content summary write-ups provide the core of the grammar, spelling and punctuation lessons in Language Arts. The rest of Language Arts this week is spent reading her book (The Maze Runner), and I do have all the books for the year scheduled with an average of 20 pages per day of reading assigned.We are working independently through the Rosetta Stone Russian Level One course at a half hour a day--that one I don't plan how far J will get at all--she works for half an hour and then quits. The parts she had difficulty with she reviews again the next day and then picks up at the end of the last lesson. Sure, it's only been two days, but it seems to be working.Science is all about taxonomy with a short report on Charles Darwin due next Tuesday. We'll keep working in taxonomy for the next couple of weeks till we get home, and we'll move onto human biology. I haven't found my lesson materials for that subject yet, but I have great confidence in TeachersPayTeachers and I know I'll find the material I need for 3-4  weeks of study there.Art is the best of all as it is pretty much independent study. Yesterday was jewelry making, today was photography. For photography we read the intro and most of the first chapter of a book on color that interests her, and then we researched and tested what she needs to do with her camera to improve the shots of her jewelry and make them sharply in focus. For Friday's filmography course, I am going to have her script a stop-motion video and start filming it.She won't get to continue her piano or archery lessons until we get back to Atlanta, but she can definitely use the extra time to make jewelry as she has both her Etsy store and an upcoming art festival (Yea! in September) to stock. Looking at the Etsy store I see she already replaced several of her original photos with ones she took today (on the tile and wood backgrounds). She is really working hard on that venture.We even started the morning with family PE and a two-mile walk down the hill for coffee (hot chocolate for some) and back up. It was a Good Day."},
{"title": "Kamping", "date": "Thursday, August 28, 2014", "text": "I sit in my camp chair outside of our kabin at the KOA in Douglas WY, musing on a life of adventure. My child is still snoozing in the kabin, Buttercup is pacing the confines of her tether (two leashes tied together attached to the bbq grill pole), and Gallifrey is lounging on the porch behind me on his big dog bed. Jessie shared with me last night that she doesn't like this place, with this place defined as Wyoming (too wide open and empty--she likes cities) and the campground (too primitive--she likes 5-star hotels). The experience is somewhat different for me.On the one hand, it's total luxury compared to the camping I did growing up, but on the other, it’s a weird kind of primitive. Maybe it's just been too long since I stayed at a campground. Admittedly, I have only stayed in a campground a couple of times because my parents would have considered camping at a campground a luxury vacation and not at all like real camping. Our camping was done in the woods with gear you carried in on your back after hiking all day. Food was cooked over a little fire in a thin aluminum pot (we had two pots--one for water, one for the meal) and it was some freeze-dried ration in a light-weight packet. All of you slept together squashed into a tiny tent that wasn’t even close to tall enough to stand up in, in sleeping bags on thin mats (if you were lucky).Since then I have had occasion to camp  in a campground a few times. Once at Enota in GA with Jessie, all of her classmates, and their parents. We drove in with tons of food, firewood, big tents, air mattresses, chairs, linens, pillows, camping lanterns, extra clothes, etc. There was a communal bath area with flush toilets and hot showers, and there was even a dining hall for people who didn’t want to cook their own food. I have also camped in the Glacier and Waterton National Park campgrounds. Some of those sites even had electricity to them and their own firepits.But nothing can compare to where we are now. This campground has sites for tents, hook-ups for RV’s, three kamping kabins, and stalls and a corral for campers’ horses. There are communal bath areas for men and women, a laundry room, a general store, an outdoor swimming pool, a fenced dog run, a volleyball court, a basketball court, and a mini-golf course. Our kabin (though only about 12 X 12) has a double bed, a bunk bed, a tiny table, a porch with two chairs, a fire pit, a picnic table, a path of grass, a bbq grill, a wall mounted flat-screen tv (very small, but hey!), electricity, a ceiling fan, and wi-fi. Does that even count as camping?Now off to Wellington to check Buttercup into her stables and get settled into our hotel to get ready for the 2014 Rocky Mountain Irish Wolfhound Association Specialty Show, Puppy Sweepstakes, Obedience and Rally Trials."},
{"title": "Good Morning Sunshine!", "date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2014", "text": "In the midst of planning my part of the homeschool curriculum for last year, my laptop has decided to stop charging its battery and only work when the power cord is plugged in. Now all of life is fraught: You never know when a dog running through the room or a snag on a chair leg will rip the MagSafe cord from its mooring and plunge the screen into blackness. I am saving work every 30 seconds and biting my nails...So, homeschool curriculum. As Jessie wants to graduate from 8th grade with her Waldorf class, this is our last year of homeschooling, and I approaching it in a more organized, methodical way than I did last year. We kind of winged last year and focused on teaching to how J learns and tailoring our teaching methodology to fit her style and interests. Her biggest problems before last year were a complete lack of confidence in herself, a lack of interest in the majority of the subject material and the way it was presented, and no study skills or or habits what-so-ever. With one-on-one attention and an adjustment of the subject matter we were able to build her confidence in her abilities and engage her interest in the materials. At the end of the year, we finished up with the Iowa Basics standardized tests for math, languages arts, social studies, science, map reading, etc.In hindsight, we should've administered the test at first the summer preceding homeschooling and tailored our core curriculum a bit to focus on areas where she was struggling, but we'll address them more intensely this year. And J is invested in putting in the work and succeeding at the tasks presented to her as she knows going back to Waldorf for 8th grade hinges on her performance. She has got to demonstrate the ability to manage her time and schedule, work independently on tasks, and pay attention and focus even when the material is not necessarily interesting to her.Based on our upcoming family fieldtrip of a Mediterannean cruise this fall, her interests, and national core competency guidelines for her grade, here is a list of her courses for the year:     Social Studies         Special Unit: The Mediterranean Region       Overview           Areas of Study             History             Geography             Art             Architecture             Language             Politics           Italy               Rome             Florence             Pisa             Naples             Pompeii             Sardinia             Sicily           Monaco             Monte Carlo           France             Toulon           Spain             Barcelona             Valencia           Greece             Olympia             Athens           Turkey             Ephesus             Izmir             Istanbul         WWII         English             Grammer           Spelling           Reading           Writing         Art               Drawing/Painting         Piano           Photography         Filmography         Jewelry         Science             Taxonomy           Zoology           Botany           Physics           Chemistry         Astronomy         Geology           Ecology           Oceanography         Ethics of Science       Math             Basic           Statistics           Probability         Percentage         Ratio           Fractions           Geometry           Algebra           Programming       Physical Education         Archery           Walking           Rock ClimbingTrampolineBiking         We will evaluate and adjust as we go, and she may end up taking additional or substitute classes at LEAD or elsewhere starting in January, but I'm pretty happy with what we have, and finding the materials to support this curriculum has not been difficult.I love the Internet! It is a bountiful mine of information and resources. My first find was a free (in my situation) app called Common Curriculum Planner (Cc). It is the perfect tool to break a mass of information into the manageable chunks of units and lessons and then plug them into a schedule. There's also a web interface for the students (in this case just one) to get the lessons, homework, etc. each week as we do them. It can be set-up for self-paced study with all the lessons available from the beginning, but Jessie wanted to work in a more traditional approach in regards to both her daily class schedule and her work so that's the way I did it.After Cc, I found Teachers Pay Teachers \"A open marketplace where educators buys, sell & share teaching resources\". There are some great materials there for all the subjects I want to cover. I especially love the resources  (1, 2, 3, and 4) I found for teaching biological taxonomy. Instead of having to commit to a book with way more material than I could use for more than I wanted to spend, I was able to buy materials from real teachers (subsidizing the teachers directly), that had been peer-reviewed, and were very inexpensive. Win-win-win!Other sources for materials were the History Channel (videos on Ravensbrük and Buchenwald, and the Navajo code talkers) for our WWII unit, an on-line game site for Grammar Ninja, and Amazon.com for Grammar for Middle School: A Sentence-Composing Approach--A Student Worktext.I'm not done yet, but I have two more weeks to plan and tweak and prepare for a great year. It WILL be a great year.______________________*NOTE* I wrote this post uesterday morning and forgot to put it up. Then this morning I realized school for us starts one week from today--not in two weeks. Ack! I'm a bit more rushed now, but I'll make it."},
{"title": "Looking Back: The Sad Orphans", "date": "Sunday, August 24, 2014", "text": "Part of getting back into posting involves seeing in the blogger interface the list of all the posts I've started and left languishing unfinished and unpublished. Periodically I go through and delete them, and today started as one of those days. But, instead, I found myself reading those ever so naive words from months (and years) past and I decided to share them here in the hopes that they will help me stay on the path of enlightenment i.e., it's okay to spend a day playing Bejeweled or Solitaire if I am enjoying it, and remind me to learn from my hubris.From 12/29/11: I have to laugh. This was BEFORE the most difficult two years of my life...And finally, the long-awaited (at least by me) post on what's to come at Siyeh Glass and Siyeh Studio in 2012. If I weren't finishing it up (which means actually writing it from the notes and scribbles I've made throughout the week) on a day when I am struck low from a horrible cold (this is part of the post-time-warp-thing and I am actually writing on Saturday the 7th and posting on Sunday the 1st--now I just need to figure out how to trick networked blogs to put it up on Facebook. They don't seem to like pre-dated posts) it would probably be less rambling and more expansive. As it is, the ourlook for growth at Siyeh Glass and Studio is cautiously optimistic for next year.Obviously for me personally, the book is going to take the lion's share of my focus and energy this year. After researching and writing 240 pages by May 1, I am going to need a break and a rest. I can easily see myself sliding through the rest of the year and waking up Rip-Van-Winkle fashion just in time to do the Sleigh Ride. But maybe I can avoid that fate with a little pre-planning and advance scheduling. (In my Nyquil hazey daze I am sooo tempted to jump of into the semantics of pre-planning vs. planning and advance scheduling vs scheduling, but this post is going to be long enough so I am going to resist.) So let me talk about the what of the year and the why, and then, for the first time, let's try to figure out the how IN ADVANCE.Expanding torchwork classesmetalsmithing and jewelry-makingnew teacher for kiln-formingexpanding one-day workshop offeringsregular newslettersregular website updatesnew hourscastingnew pricing with constant specialssatellite studio in MontanaThen from 4/18/13--after the decision was made to homeschool, but before we were actually in the thick of it, smack in the middle of writing the book, and helping Mom through her surgeries:I thought earlier this morning that I might have (maybe) just enough time before teaching a  beginning kiln-forming class to get in a quick post. I also wanted to get in a load of laundry before heading to the studio. I got the laundry in, but not the post done.Life continues to be a juggling act. It took me a couple of years to settle into my forties and figure out that it was okay to be what I was when I grew up; I didn't need to be or want to be something definable or something other than I am. Now, as I settle into my fifties, the epiphany of this decade is shaping up to be that itis neither my occupation nor how many hours a week I work at it that actually either define either me or myI do not have to be defined by how many hours--and which actual hours--I \"work\". I don't have to be live  in eight-to-twelve-hour work-shift blocks, I do not have to do specific things at specific times in order to be effective or able to define my results as success, and I don't have to work a set number of hours at the glass studio in order for me to define it as my work. In fact, I am finally coming to see that I am defined as much by the intangibles I do as by the tangibles. My \"job\" is not to have an equal but separate career to Dave's and to bring in as much money as he does, and to maintain my ability to do everything he does in our life so that if we split back into two entities, I would be I *can* set some things up at some times--pottery on Monday mornings, jewelry fabrication on Friday mornings--and I can also let everything else fit into whatever time feels most appropriate.Jump ahead to 7/17/13 when a curse turned into a blessing (thank you post facto Spruill):Today registration for fall classes at the Spruill Center For the Arts opened up and I eagerly went on-line to check out my class descriptions... and they weren't there. Mystified, I called to see if there had been en error somewhere, but, nope, that wasn't the case.In the spring when the fall schedule was being put together I approached the educational director of the center about teaching and not only did she want me to teach, but she sat me down right then and there and gave me a space (classroom assignment and a date and time) on the spot. She also gave me a bunch of forms to fill out and asked me to write up the class based on our discussion. So in the throes of getting ready to head out for Montana I filled out a bunch of paperwork and wrote up a survey class called \"Around the Kiln in Eight Days\", targeted at both existing and new students and introducing some of the techniques detailed in my upcoming book.Today when I called I was told--not by the eduction director as she is on extended leave, nor by the interim director, nor even by the person who works on the course catalog who requested and filed all my materials... and the rant ends here. Too bad I can't reconstruct the end of the sentence.Moving right along another six months to 1/26/14:In the midst of everything else that's going on at our house right now, it's time to start a new semester of homeschooling. Sure, with homeschooling you don't have to follow quarters, semesters or any other defined timeframes. But Jessie also takes classes at LEAD, and they start a new semester next week so it’s a good time for us to evaluate our schedule and current classes and tweak them. One of the tweaks we are doing is adding a class on Anime Studio Debut software. I’m teaching it and I’ve never used the software so it’s a stretch, but I think a reasonable one. I watched a really good tutorial yesterday and found references to others so I think I can knit together a curriculum that will take Jessie from blank canvas to full animation (including multiple voice and music tracks) with her own anime characters by May.The schedule going forward looks like this:And life took over from there with no time left to post about it.Then there were two more danglers in quick succession in the spring of 2014 as I struggled to get back to regular posting:Standard home microwaved coffee from yesterday in the Chicago mug and energy to burn in my soul. It's been a long time since I've posted, but only lately has the creative fire pushed me to do it. The creative fire has been pushing at me a lot lately--a welcome relief after the past barren, soulless year (plus). I will not harp on the past, and I definitely learned from my choices, but I cannot express the joy I feel in having my studio back to myself. Don't get me wrong--I love the people with whom I shared it daily when it was seemingly always open to the public, but the act of sharing--of opening up my creative space to the constant presence of others--wore me down and took away every single solitary spark of divine fire I ever might have had.Now, my studio not just messy but having descended into actual dirtiness, is my nest; the creative place I go bursting with too many ideas and too much energy to fit the time constraints allowed by real world and real life. I still share it, but not everyday and not with everyone. Bliss. The front formerly-bead-making-classroom is now the home of Finley Point Soap Company. It will also soon hold the metalsmithing tools and the jeweler's bench currently tucked into the shipping room, and a single glass beadmaking station...AndLife has taken some very interesting twists and turns and meandered through some thorny woods in the past couple of years. First, I got lost in the bowels of (writing) a book and that experience truly was like being swallowed whole and spat back out covered in smelly slime. It wasn't the people I worked with that made it so difficult...As I read these posts there is something comforting about recognizing my continuing moth-like-ness: Even though I know I can't get to the light, and if I could it would fry me to a crispy (dead) critter, I keep battering myself against the glass in search of something... more. I am still over-enthused, over-committed, under-funded, and abundantly optimistic about life. I still try to plan and end up winging everything, and whatever I do, IT'S OKAY. No point in I-could've-done-it-this-way or I-could've-done-it-betters. It's over, move on, enjoy it, learn from it. Now off to plan the rest of the year ;-)"},
{"title": "Success or Failure?", "date": "Saturday, August 23, 2014", "text": "As I put together my portion of this year's homeschooling curriculum I look back on last year to evaluate my successes and failures. At first pass, my main contribution to homeschooling last year (other than driving her around to swimming, archery, film-making, and LEAD classes) which was a class on starting the soap business Finley Point Soap, looks to have been a failure. It was our first year of homeschooling, and I thought it would be good idea to do a class on creating and running a business. My goal was for Jessie to have a fully realized business that would provide her with on-going revenue and responsibility by the end of the year.As yet, the webpage is still half-created and wholly unpublished, the Facebook page languishes, there is no Etsy shop, we aren't doing the Farmer's Market here in Montana, we haven't made soap in months, and Jessie is lethrgic when I bring up working on the project. I am frustrated as we still have a considerable materials inventory, and invested moderately in equipment and infrastructure. And yet...Earlier this summer Jessie asked me to take her to a bead store so she could get some materials to make jewelry that she could sell on Etsy. She had watched me set up my Etsy store for Farm2Yarn and wanted to have her own store. I thought Finley Point Soap would make a fine Etsy store, but what do I know? So I took her to Mission Mountain Studio, the bead store here in Polson, and she bought a bunch of stuff. I did not buy it for her: She bought it out of her savings.She made a couple of pieces, and then got her grandmother to take her to WalMart so she could get fabric to use as a backdrop for photographing the work, a velvet bust on which to display the necklaces, and a few more components to make more pieces. However, as is so often the case, she felt she needed still more findings and beads so I took her into Missoula to Michael's and the Garden of Beadin'. (It's all about the stash, baby.)As we drove home, I stressed (gently) to her that in order to have a business, she really needed to track the costs of all of her inventory so she would be able to accurately determine the retail price. I then made her a deal that I would finance the day's purchases if she would not only calculate the cost of every single item she had chosen (from the first t-pin to the last spacer bead), but would continue to calculate the piece costs for all future purchases. She is a tight-fisted little thing so I was pretty confident she would go for the deal, and indeed she did. I'd like to say it was because the lecture was a review of material we'd already covered for Finley Point Soap that she took the deal, but I know better. What's important is that she spent the evening and much of the next day sorting beads, reviewing receipts, dividing the cost of a package by the number of items in it, and labeling containers with item prices. I admit to helping her a bit, as after several hours she was completely overwhelmed (but it was a good life lesson).Then, after she had her materials stowed away she treated herself to making a few pieces.Since then she has alternated between making pieces, photographing them, and then putting them up on Etsy. Putting them on Etsy (or any sales site) is a tedious process. You have to come up with a name for the piece, write a description, put in materials tags, measure and record size information, and price it. And she just keeps going. She starts each day making, and ends each day either on Etsy or facebook.So maybe Finley Point Soap wasn't the right venture for her, but it introduced her to the tools she needs to create the business she wants, and--after creating her initial product offering--she was able to take the business live and make her first sale in under two days. She knows how to choose materials based on both quality and probable return on investment. She understands the importance of branding and can create logos, banners, backgrounds, and the other graphical elements used in print and electronic media. She may not like writing marketing documentation, but she knows how to do it. She knows how to use Etsy, Facebook, and Weebly (web design). Her photography is first rate: She put together a set with good lighting and a variety of backgrounds, composed her shots, and took gorgeous photos of the finished work with her digital SLR--several images per piece. Before last year she couldn't have done any of it. Maybe this is a bit of post hoc ergo propter hoc on my part and she would've been in the same place now if she had continued in Waldorf, but I don't think so."},
{"title": "Summer (Life): Glass Half Full, or Half Empty?", "date": "Friday, August 22, 2014", "text": "Woke up this morning from a vivid dream in which I left Dave and ran away with James McMurtry (who in the dream was madly in love with me and already had been married and divorced nine times) and headed out to give Princess Buttercup her morning bottle. It's an overcast, chilly late summer day here in Montana, and as I fed the Buttercup, I reflected on my dream, my summer, and my life. Reflection led me to thoughts of posting, and I naturally fell into old patterns of \"what haven't I\" and I nestled into a sky chair on the deck and began thusly:I intended to do so many things this summer. For example, I intended to have coffee when I sat down to write this post. I put water in the reservoir, a filter in the basket, grounds in the filter, adjusted the water spout, and turned the coffeemaker on. And yet when I came back from feeding the yak her bottle, there was no coffee--the coffeemaker was not plugged in. Now the summer in Montana is 3/4 over and we go back to Atlanta a month from today.Back in the spring when I was planning the summer and making my packing lists, I had grandiose plans for making shirts for Dave out of the fabric I have bought over the past 11 years for just that purpose, spinning up all my fiber, weaving a rug, finishing crocheting an afghan I started for Jessie last year (the year before?), and setting up a soap studio for Jessie and me and a production glass studio for me. I was going to walk every day and take Gallifrey to the dog park at least three times a week. I was going to post every day. I dreamt of sunny days munching on fruit and salads and gradually shedding excess weight slowly, easily, and naturally. One of the projects I had planned was finishing the garden I started last summer. I got the area cleared and weed cloth put down last year, this year I needed to build a small retaining wall in back, fill in the dirt, and plant all the roses. So far on that one I bought the stone for the retaining wall and had it delivered. I also had a big project of tiling the downstairs bathroom which needed a lot of work after the house flooded in December. That project did get done, but not by me. I wimped out and let the tile guys lay all the tile for the floor, shower and walls. Sure, I chose and picked up the tile, designed the layout and made some fused glass tile to go in the accent strip, but then I just peeked in occasionally and said \"looks great!\".Then I started to write how I hadn't done anything on the projects starting with the section on the tile and then backtracking to the preceding paragraph so I could write how I hadn't walked, was drinking lots of wine and oj (I know, it's odd, but I'm getting more vitamins, minerals, and water than I would be if I just drank the wine) and eating lots of heavy carbs and buttery sauces...And then I had a Cher/Nicolas Cage moment where I was both of them in Moonstruck and I slapped myself while yelling \"Snap out of it!\". Sure, I brought a lot of things out from Atlanta that I'll have to schlepp back again untouched, but so what? In the grand scheme of life, so the f*k what?!?! This summer I am on the grand adventure of bottle-feeding and raising a baby yak to be an Irish wolfhound. I helped shear 24 alpaca. I started a new business (farm2yarn) including setting up a webpage, an Etsy site and a Facebook page and store. I mined for sapphires, rafted on the river, learned to use a GoPro camera, did some crochet, some spinning, and some glass.Some days I just play solitaire on my laptop or bejeweled on my iPhone for most of the day. Some days I read. Some days--like today--I start a post and then get distracted by helping J with Fireking Creations (her new jewelry business) and then it's time for a glass of wine as I finish the post. After I post I'll dine, then I'll feed and commune with the yak.This is life, with all its sloth, and gluttony, and joy, and bursts of frenzied activity, and things left undone, and things left unstarted... it's MY life! And it's okay to live without commemorating, and live without doing, and live without exercising or enriching my mind or bettering myself in any way. It's enough if I believe that what I am doing is living because if it is living, it's worthwhile. Amen."},

Most of my writing has gone to blog entries on Farm2Yarn, or the Siyeh Glass website or Facebook page, or the Farm2Yarn website Facebook page or Etsy store, or the Finley Point soap Facebook page. I haven't had much Life leftover to post anywhere else. but now there's something that has to go here. Something that deserves more than a one-off on Facebook and is more private than an ultimately commercial chatty posting on Farm2Yarn. I am in love.I was not expecting to fall in love again this year. Gallifrey in April was a special gift, the like of which I have not had for years—probably since Jessie was born (though obviously not to that level). And I never _ever_ saw a yak entering into my life. I’m not really a livestock person, you see. But fate brought Princess Buttercup my way, (she started out \"Inconceivable!\" and is now \"As you wish.\") and I am overwhelmed by how I feel about her. I am sitting writing this out in the backyard while she is curled up at my feet. She called me out earlier (and there is nothing funnier than a baby yak’s call: It sounds like a duck call that you would buy in a sporting goods store) not because she was hungry (she just played with the bottle), but because she wanted company and scritches. So I obliged and loved on her, and scritched her, and thought how I would like to clicker train her--and I know she is smart enough!Today I spent the morning visiting a ranch in Kalispell as a possible forever home for her, and honest to God it felt like touring my child’s first school and interviewing the teachers! I looked at the  other “kids” there, and I listened to the rancher manager’s philosophy of breeding and developing their lines, and all I could think was, “They’re not going to appreciate her for the special being she is.” They value size, and she will always be small. When I talked to them about the way they price their calves, they said that if she had been theirs, they would sell her for the very bottom of their range no matter how good her coloring, fiber and conformation atet because she was bottle-fed so she will be smaller and is really just good for a pet. But she is so much more!!!I looked at their animals—and I was able to look really closely as they are so amazingly gentle because that’s another thing this place breeds for—and their coats seemed of lesser quality than I had seen at the ranch where I got Buttercup. Maybe that’s something you sacrifice when you breed for a large (meat) animal, though they claim to breed for fiber too. I’m also not sure why they are breeding for larger size as that seems to go against the true domestic yak phenotype. The males aren’t supposed to be 1700 lbs, and the females aren’t supposed to be 800 lbs so why is that what they are going for? I can see why they wouldn’t want to add Buttercup to their herd and their breeding program because to breed her to one of their bulls would result in a calf that would be too big for her to carry and deliver. Their calves are usually 35-40 lbs when they are born. She was 34 lbs when she was a week old. She’s a month now and their two-week-old calves are her size.And yet, the people who run the ranch are kind and generous and would love and cuddle her as we do, and I know they would seamlessly take over the bottle-feeding when we have to go back to Atlanta (she won’t be ready to wean for a month after after we’re gone). I have more confidence in them to care for her well than the other ranch option I have here—through she would fit in better there long-term as the rest of that herd is her size and I think she would be valued there.It breaks my heart that I know I’m going to have to leave her—Atlanta is no place for a yak—and at the same time I know absolutely that I cannot keep her. This is a time out of time. This summer is not real life, and there is no way to integrate Buttercup into our real life even if Dave were willing to do so (which he is most decidedly not). Even I know that what I am doing with her now is not something I can sustain. I have homeschooling and a glass businesses as well as a life which is somehow just busier in Atlanta than it is here. She would be lonely and neglected with us—she needs her own herd that she’s with all day and night. Long-term I can't meet her needs. So I'm still looking for her forever herd. They don't have to be yak, they just need to live outdoors and be of comparable size and inquisitive, mischievous, energetic temperament.\"YFY seeks herd. Loves dogs, kids, wading pools, running full-out around the yard, playing in the sprinkler, dancing, and scritches. Not a big eater, quiet, social, very clean, and most beautiful eyes you've ever seen. Seeking high-altitude, cool dry weather, 24/7 companions to nestle in with at night and romp around with during the day that can stand up to being butted with horns.\""},
{"title": "Good-bye 2013, Can You Please Take the Beginning of 2014 With You?", "date": "Sunday, January 12, 2014", "text": "I had meant to write a year-in-review and a looking forward-to-the-new-year post as December slid into January, but Life had other plans for me. Now as I attempt them I'm not sure how to do it without it turning into a whiny pity party. But there's no other way to put it--2013 was a really crappy year for me. I was tested on every front, and, by the end of the year, all I could do was exhaustedly long for a better year to come. But just because a puny human sees a break in time, a point for change aligned with the changing of a month and a calendar year, doesn't mean the universe will go along with it. Clearly. This year--all 12 days of it--has been mostly as bad as the worst of 2013.in 2013 Mom's surgeries and recovery were emotionally, mentally and physically draining. Dave started a new job which necessitated him staying in Austin for months at a time leaving me to move the rest of the household to Montana for the summer, deal with major home maintenance projects there, provide home healthcare for Mom and take her to her twice-weekly physical therapy and wound care appointments in a neighboring town, take care of Jessie, and manage as much of the maintenance as I could on the family lake property--turning on water, cutting the grass, preparing for use, cleaning out the spring. I also spent most of the year finishing my second book--the writing project from hell. While I was in Montana the hotshop at the studio was hit by lightning, and, as I looked forward to a fall of continuing to care for my mother and beginning to homeschool Jessie, it became apparent that I was not going to be able to keep everything going. Something was going to have be let go, and I chose to close my kiln glass resource center and the hotshop, and to take a hiatus from teaching.However, even after summer was over, we were back from Montana, Dave was back from Austin, and the studio was closed, the fall was tough and it plodded into an even bleaker winter. The first semester of homeschooling was full of fits and starts as Dave and I worked its scheduling into our work days and the rest of life. It neither went as well nor as poorly as it could have. I am optimistic that it will be better this semester (because I have to be--there is no good alternative). Teaching Jessie how to manage her own time, assignments, responsibilities, and to self-motivate continues to be the biggest task.Last year ended with freezing cold in the northern parts of the country that disastrously affected my mother's house in Montana. Right before we went on vacation I got word that one of the pipes froze, broke, thawed, and flooded the entire house. The kitchen floor and lower cabinets are ruined. The subfloor upstairs is ruined. Part of the ceiling in the basement came down. The entire basement (our bedroom and Jessie's bedrooms and the rec room with the new sectional couch and flatscreen tv) were flooded and the carpet was ruined. The restoration company is still working through all the damage, and I will have to go out the beginning of February when the first stage of clean-up and restoration (walls and ceiling) is done to take care of the personal effect damage and replacing the carpet and kitchen floor.The new year started with the flu--not a cold, but the actual tested-positive flu--for me, Dave and my mom while we were trying to enjoy a Christmas vacation with Dave's family in the Florida Keys. Then Mom's hip (replaced on 10/18 for the third time in 2013) became infected, and by January 2 she was back in the hospital. She's since had two surgeries to clean it out as best as can be done without removing the entire prosthesis (not really an option after the three previous surgeries and the current state of the attachment to the bone), and came home Friday after eight days in the hospital.Dave was out of town last week so I was back and forth between the hospital and home. I had lots of meetings with the infectious disease specialist, the home healthcare providers (who will be coming out weekly to do physical therapy with her and change the dressing on her PICC line), her surgeon, and the wound care people, and I also had Jessie's homeschooling to manage. J and I hung out at the hospital and she worked on her reading, writing, and the website and Facebook page for Finley Point Soap (her company). It went as well as could be expected--it would definitely have been easier if I had been just shuffling her off to school every morning for someone else to deal with all day and getting her back in the evening--but that's not the road we've chosen. And there's another post in the making.In addition, I had a business to run. Said business came in in last place. to everything else and I am grateful to Dee and Todd for stepping in and picking things up for me. Dee ran Todd, glass for Todd, and Todd's work back and forth between his house and the studio so orders could ship, and she also organized and unloaded the Bullseye glass delivery on Friday (after two previous disastrous delivery attempts earlier in the week). She also cut glass for customers who came down from North Carolina to shop. Next week I am supposed to be going to Philadelphia to do the Buyer's Market of American Craft show--my only wholesale show of the year and the source of the majority of my annual revenue--but in light of the hands-on care I am giving my mom now that she is back home, I had to cancel. I am hopeful the Rosen Group will allow me to apply the majority of my booth fee to next year's show, but I don't know anything yet.I received the color lasers from the printer on Friday and I have to finish editing them by tomorrow morning, but the changed that can be made at this point are so minuscule as to be nonexistent anyway. The new Siyeh Studio website is in progress and I expect to have it up next week with the first half of my work. I have needed this website for years but it always got pushed behind something else that had to be done for the studio--mostly for the kiln glass resource center--and never got done. It's good to have the time to work on it now, and, because I can't be at the show next week, it has moved to the top of the priority stack. I had Liam in to do photography of half of the work before I left for Christmas, and I hope to have him in for another day next week to finish. This will be a good test for how much business I can generate without doing a show.And now we move into the immediate future. I won't beat around the bush: It's looking tough. For the next several weeks at least, I am--in addition to a wife, mother and business owner--a home nurse. I give medications, do daily IV and dressing changes, take vitals (temperature at least), as well as feed and clean up after my mother. The last medicines before bed are given at 11:00 pm, there is another set at 3:00 am, and then we start up again at 7:00 am. I've done it for a day and I'm already exhausted. This experience alone is worth an entire post, and maybe I'll do it in a day or two. For now, I'm tired, and I need to let my mind go for awhile. I need to hold onto the optimism that things really are getting better, because I don't know how much longer I can go on like this if they don't."},
{"title": "Who Knows What the Future WIll Bring ", "date": "Sunday, September 29, 2013", "text": "As the astute out there might have noticed, I have changed the name of this blog from Glass Incarnate to Life Incarnate. Life has shifted in focus for me over the past year and it's time for the blog to reflect the changes.Almost exactly six years ago today my husband and I purchased a 1920's Craftsman bungalow around the corner from our house with a backyard adjoining ours in which to house Siyeh Studio and allow me to move my business out of the basement and into the light. A year later I expanded the vision for my business and opened Siyeh Glass--a Bullseye Kiln Glass Resource Center with a kiln-forming classroom, a 7-torch beadmaking classroom, and a hotshop out back for glass blowing. I added more people to the studio family to teach and staff the facilities. And the wild rumpus began. It was a wild ride and rumpus indeed, and it's time to get off.So today I closed Siyeh Glass and the hotshop. I no longer have retail hours, regular kiln-forming classes, open studio every day, glassblowing date nights or classes, beadmaking classes, studio elves, or other regular teachers. There are many reasons why I felt compelled to take this step--first among them is a shift in my priorities to my family as my mother has had serious health issues all year and my husband and I are homeschooling our daughter for the first time. But the straws that finally broke me and forced the change now were the hotshop being struck by lightning while I was in Montana this summer (causing the furnace to go out AGAIN), and the website being hacked. I could have spent the money and time to deal with the one and the time and more time to deal with the other, but I just couldn't fix both on top of everything else.Will I still have open studio? Yes, if someone emails me and asks to come in and work, I'll schedule time for them. Will I still sell Bullseye glass and other glass supplies? Yes, by appointment (again, through email), and probably through a newsletter for people who would like to get in on a large order from Bullseye. Will I still teach/offer classes? Yes, occasionally, and maybe even for a wider variety of media than just glass--I have been approached about leasing space to teachers in other disciplines so they could offer classes in a studio configured for teaching messy hand-crafts.Mainly I will be focusing on my own production work and getting the website for it--Siyeh Studio--back up. I need to spend time developing new work and nurturing old relationships with my galleries.Life right now, though, is about a lot more than glass. Deep breath in, out, and moving on..."},

{"title": "Summer Winds Down", "date": "Monday, August 26, 2013", "text": "Sitting in a sky chair on the back deck in Polson, birdsong, a distant motorcycle and a barking dog for my morning music. Today the new contractor comes to fix the mess the last contractor made of the roof over the deck, and so the summer ends as it began with construction. This is the first morning I have been up and out on the deck this early, and it is truly wonderful. We got rain last night for only the second time in a hot month, and it cleared a lot of the dust and smoke from the air.  The fire danger has been listed as Extreme for over a month now and fires have been popping up all around us. Fires have been started by people mowing their fields, hitting a rock with the mower blades, and causing a spark--that's how dry it is. And there's the doorbell...Three hours later, I pick up this post, and now my music is the sound of a compressor, hammering, whistling, and the grunting of contractors (no kidding, real grunting interspersed with the occasional imprecation). Add the bass note of the mower in the front yard run by the lawn service guy, and my symphony is complete. Apparently I have lucked into the magic circle in Polson in terms of neighbors (now friends) and professional service people. Our next-door neighbor Ed knows (and thinks highly of) both the current and the previous lawn care guys, and the lawn care guys and Ed all know and think highly of the new contractor. The city building inspector also knows and thinks highly of the new contractor. It's been one, big happy reunion up here today.As I look down the last two weeks of summer it's time to plan and prepare for fall. Seems like a perfectly good waste of summer to me, but that's the way life works. It wouldn't do to land back in Atlanta with no idea what to do homeschooling the Sprout, no websites for either Siyeh Glass or Siyeh Studio, and nothing planned for the studio going forward. Though at this point I would be perfectly happy to stay in Polson for the fall, put a small studio in here (I am already having the wiring done for a big kiln and I could just put in an order with Bullseye for frit and clear irid), and just keep going on as I have been.The summer is ending way too fast, as it seems to every year. I brought so many projects out to Montana to work on, and easily 80% of them I never even got started. There was no work done on the quilt I started in a class last spring. I made no jewelry from findings and shells (though I bought the materials), nor did I finish any of the silver pieces I had left over from my Spruill jewelry classes (in spite of the lovely jewelry bench gifted me by my spouse for my birthday and shipped here). I did not get the garden weeded. We (J and I) did no pottery, nor did we dye either fabric or yarn. The sewing projects I had lined up with Jessie never happened. I still don't know how to do kumihimo or use a rigid-heddle loom (the Cricket).However I learned to spin, bought 13 alpaca fleeces and have made good progress in processing them for spinning (well, except for the one that I accidentally felted). I built my own table for blowing off the dirt and learned to use a picker box (think sandwich of slanted nails that the fleece goes between to get fluffed and picked over) and a drum carder in addition to the spinning wheel.My head is awhirl with thoughts of woolen and worsted, yarn for knitting and yarn for weaving, dyeing (not the alpaca), blending (silk, merino, angora and bamboo), and all the possibilities opened with creating one's own yarn. In my boundless enthusiasm, I would like to take it a step further and raise my own alpaca and angora rabbits, but my spouse has employed both the stick (\"No! No more animals!\") and the carrot (talk of living in different exotic foreign locations as we homeschool--not a realistic goal with a lot of animal dependents) as a means of putting down that revolution before it even had a chance to get started. So I plan to assist Rosemarie in shearing back in Atlanta as much as she will have me in exchange for fleeces. Fleeces don't eat, drink, breathe, or poop and can be left in a bag (if well washed) for years until you can get to them (lucky for me).I learned to play \"Fate\" (thanks a lot Kyla!) and have gotten to level 16, dyed my child's hair (twice) in rainbow shades of teal, aqua, magenta, and fuchsia, made (thus far--more to come) 25 qts of Everclear infusions from fresh, local. organic or wild produce (huckleberry, basil, rhubarb, and peach with rosehip, chokecherry, goathead peppers, anaheim peppers, backyard plum, and mint still to come). I have also begun (with my uncle) planning on a twin house (fancy duplex) on the lake property and almost put together family and business budgets. There has been passing thought given to redoing both my websites (damn robotic hackers injecting their silly malicious code into my sites--I fart in their general direction) and will actually follow through with action sometime later this week.For three weeks of the summer I had three little girls instead of my customary one, and I took them on adventures as diverse as the Happy Hippo amphibious vehicle tour, boat tours, hiking, and the Park After Dark Astronomy gathering in Glacier National Park (with the accompanying junior ranger badges), bungee jumping and exploring the 4-H animal exhibits at the Western Montana Fair, and go-cart racing and laser tagging. There were also many days at the lake swimming and afternoons snacking on yummy frozen yoghurt.In the spirit of home ever-improvement, I wrangled contractors and got two decks--one with a roof--built. The building included me preparing many of the boards, pickets, rails and beams with two coats of oil-based stain. I modestly conquered operation and maintenance of a riding lawnmower (for the lake property), researched, purchased and installed a portable air conditioner, and uninstalled a hard-wired dishwasher and prepared for the installation of a new one (picked and purchased by Mom). I have planned a new garden bed for the spot in front that used to be covered by the  old deck, but I don't think I'll get the retaining wall put up for it or the topsoil delivered to fill it--much less the plants chosen for it (that'll be a plan for winter when I'm cosied up on the couch in Atlanta dreaming of summer). I need to put in the 6-8 herbs, the 2 perennials and the 9 lilies I bought at the farmer's market (and I really should get the main big bed weeded!), but that shouldn't be too difficult. I did weed and tame the existing herb bed and I did plant six tomato plants that are beginning to bear fruit.Before I sat down to post today, I would have said my summer glass was half empty--that I had not done anything I had planned on or very much worthwhile at all. But now I'm thinking my cup runneth over with beer (Sip 'N' Go Naked Apricot Ale from the Tamarack Brewery in Lakeside) and it foams over the rim of the glass with an abundance of fullness. Good thing I occasionally post so I can review and take stock honestly to keep my life in perspective!"},
{"title": "I Run Amok", "date": "Monday, July 08, 2013", "text": "I take a deep breath and relax into the beginning of this post. It has been quite a time so far at Casa de Verano Griffith. In the spirit of Glass Incarnate, I'll start with the glass news first. But, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have to say that glass business takes a back seat to loads of other things in the Montana summer.A couple of weeks ago the J and I drove up past Kalispell to Whitefish and hand-delivered a big order to a new gallery (new for me) called the Purple Pomegranate. It is a lovely little shop on the main street in Whitefish--a quintessential summer and winter (lake and big ski area) resort town. I am looking forward to continuing my relationship with them--they're my first Montana gallery!On the way up J spotted a monster truck (one of her obsessions) at the local Toyota dealer and we just HAD to stop and get a picture. She really wanted to go to the monster truck show over the weekend, but, lucky for me, she forgot about it.Spent the first weekend after arriving in Missoula where I took a class in hand spinning from Janet Sullivan who owns Joseph's Coat Yarns and Fiber. It was a GREAT class as it was really a private lesson for the day, and I was able (finally) to get the feel for drafting (preparing the fiber to slip through your fingers and be twisted into yarn by the turning of the wheel).I ended the class by renting a wheel for the summer for her and hope to purchase one before going home. Gave Janet a ride home after class and we dropped a spinning wheel off at a friend of hers who is a rug weaver. She showed me her rug loom which she might be selling in the near future. Even I with my lust for new tools can't wrap my head around where to put this loom and how to use it. It's 16 feet long and you weave by walking back and forth across the front. You need a 32 foot side to side clearance for it just so you can get the hardware all in!In addition to the spinning class, we loaded up on supplies not easily found in Polson including two new shower-heads for both bathrooms; semi-permanent hair dye in cobalt, fuchsia, magenta, orange, lemon, and teal (the pic at the right shows the first pass with magenta, fuchsia, teal and cobalt); fabric and thread for summer sewing projects for the J along with a sewing table and cutting mat; summer books for the J; a hand-sander for a couple of wood-working projects I have; a rented cello from Morgenroth Music for J--and while we were there we picked up a used Yamaha keyboard in pristine condition for a song.The projects for the sander include a bit of grading-stamp removal prior to sanding my share of the new deck boards for the house and removing the varnish off the flat surfaces of a vanity I bought at a garage sale around the corner here in Polson right after we got here. It's a gorgeous little waterfall style laminated wood vanity with the original Art Nouveau brass handles from the 20's and it was only $10. I messed up a little on the sanding and went too deep into the laminate, but I got some retouching pencils and I will draw the grain back in before I finish it. Though we are having a contractor tear out the old deck and put in the new one, I am doing part of the staining to save a little cash and get the project done faster.To make sure I had enough going for the summer I picked up some origami paper in Missoula and have been busily making paper cranes when my hands aren't doing anything else. I am going to turn them into a hanging sculpture--or maybe a light fixture. I also brought up the cotton crochet afghan I have been working on for Jessie's room for a couple of months. It's a great project for in the evenings while we all sit around and listen to an audio book (currently Mom J and I are working through Jim Butcher's Furies of Calderon series and are in \"Captain's Fury\".Dave--who is here with us for the next couple of weeks before heading back to Austin--got me a jeweler's bench for Montana and I spent a day putting it together. It's SWEET and I am going to be able to get to it to use it as soon as I have finished staining deck boards and refinishing the vanity (which will be a desk for the J). Between the staining set-up, the furniture that normally goes on the deck but which is stored in the garage while the deck is being rebuilt, the vanity, the 13 alpaca fleeces I picked up from RuthAnn at her Racka Paca Alpaca ranch in Kila, and the glass/jewelry studio set-up, the garage is pretty full.Though alpaca is my new favorite fiber as it is so silky, soft, warm, naturally beautifully colored, and clean (alpaca don't have the lanolin in their fleece that sheep do so the fleece doesn't hold the dirt in the same way), I have been preparing George Edmund's and Irma Amelia's fleeces for spinning too. I washed them, and now I'm picking and teasing them so I can card them. I haven't decided whether to try to blend silk, merino or alpaca with them to create a nicer yarn, or just to make up sock yarn with them. It will definitely be fun to experiment with dyeing and blending their fleece (during carding) before spinning it. And speaking of carding; looking at all of it that I need to do, how long it takes to hand card, and how hard it is on my wrists, I am thinking I may need to invest in a drum carder.But back to alpaca for a minute: they are adorable, gentle, not too big, and make great pet/fiber animals. Best of all, they are not denied by City of Atlanta code. So what is stopping me from getting a couple? (You can't just get one--they need company.) While it would be fun to say something like \"marriage is a compromise\" or \"my spouse\", the reality is that I don't need to do anything to tie us down more geographically than I already have: it is difficult enough to summer in Montana with the chickens and bunnies back in Atlanta. I can't even imagine what 2-3 alpaca would add!I end this very long post with a thank-you to the universe for a truly lovely July 4th. I got to see good friends from grade-school on with their families, Dave performed his annual marriage proposal ritual (I said yes again), and we got to set off a whole boatload of fireworks--and we still had the baby display here in Little Baghdad on the Flathead.Happy Summer, everyone. Peace, Love and Joy."},
{"title": "Life Incarnate", "date": "Sunday, June 16, 2013", "text": "Irma Amelia and George Edmund sharing space with Jasmine and the rest of the bunnies. Puddy the goat is off eating the picnic tableI enjoyed my 20's more than my teens--but who doesn't? I became an adult in my 30's--finishing school, getting a job, and taking a husband. My 40's started well with a child, but turned rough within a couple of years when I looked back on life to date--thinking it was half over--and was dismayed at what I hadn't done, hadn't accomplished. Now I am settling into my 50's, and life seems to have split wide open and gushes with new things to learn and do.I am, for the first time, building conscious mental models of processes and knowledge in subjects ranging from mathematics to sheep shearing. I want to study and do everything--glass; ceramics; silver-smithing; black-smithing; spinning; weaving; crochet; wood carving and turning; knitting; soap-making; quilting; candle-making; bee-keeping; food science; goat, llama and sheep husbandry (before I do too much husband-scaring I need to note that a more precise way of phrasing that last desire is to say I want to participate in their care at the East Lake Community Learning Garden and Urban Farm--ELCLGUF--culminating in harvesting their fleece and hair for processing and spinning into yarn); and the list just goes on. I want to take up archery, develop a yoga practice, lose weight, and explore physics and mathematics--I'm sure there is more (Kumihimo, bead-weaving, Tai-Chi, meditation, Japanese, Italian, Thai--language and cooking, mosaics, and dyeing jump to mind), but you get the point. What I am finding in 50 is that things I was blocked on before--things I couldn't seem to learn or do no matter how I tried--I can suddenly do and understand.Blocks of batik shirt scraps from recent quilting workshopIn high school when math starting including Greek letters, it became, well, Greek to me. In fact I would have had an easier time learning Greek. Physics, with its formulae, was just as obscure. But as I totter into my 50's some veil has lifted, and I am finally beginning to see the models and concepts necessary for understanding and processing these disciplines--and they fascinate me.One of my first thrown pieces on the wheelIn my 30's I tried to learn wheel-throwing pottery and spinning fleece into yarn, but they were handcrafts that I just couldn't get a handle on so I let them go. But I picked up wheel-throwing again at the beginning of this year in a class at Spruill Center for the Arts, and it came naturally and easily. I could do it.With high hopes, I brought the fleeces from shearing George Edmund and Irma Amelia last Saturday at ELCLGUF to Montana, and this week I'll finish washing and start carding them. then next Sunday I am taking a spinning at Joseph's Coat in Missoula. When I succeed this time, I'll rent a spinning wheel from them for the rest of the summer.It used to feel like there weren't enough hours in the day to get done everything I had to do. Now it feels much more like there aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want to do--and I haven't even mentioned playing Minecraft, reading, creating websites, playing Euro board games (better than Monopoly), and sharing everything with Jessie.Assisting in the shearing of Irma Amelia on my 52nd birthdayTime passes so quickly now! When I was Jessie's age I seemed to notice every minute in a day, a week was interminable, and a month lasted forever. Anything further out than that was beyond y ability to measure. Maybe it's that very perception of time that kept me from going through this intense-desire-to-learn stage earlier. It's not that I didn't have the opportunity--I remember leaning to sew, knit, and crochet when I was little older than Jessie. But I was always an instant-gratification kind of girl, and what I remember from those times is how long it took to get something from what you were doing--the boring parts seemed to last forever.Shard samples for metal oxides from broken thrown pieceBut now, with days and weeks passing in blur, the amount of time it takes to get to the end of an endeavor--to see something from my effort--is so much shorter. I think the difference in perception of time between age 12 and age 52 is going to provide the biggest challenge in homeschooling Jessie this fall. I will have to remember not to get frustrated or disappointed when she doesn't share my wonder and joy in learning about everything and doing anything that takes our fancy. I have to remember that the boring parts--the long, trudging work parts--are going to seem really long to her making the projects not nearly as fun.So I sit--bundled in fuzzy socks, cosy pants, a t-shirt and a sweatshirt--in Montana and I ponder the summer and life spread before me, and I wonder again:  Is it time to change the title of this blog to the title of this post?"},
{"title": "Glass Clay Challenges", "date": "Thursday, May 23, 2013", "text": "Waiting for biscuits and gravy to arrive and coffee to kick-in at Radial Cafe listening to \"We Are Family\" by Sister Sledge with Dave. Had two late nights in the studio in a row working on book project redos and an order whose due date I screwed up, and I am pooped! It doesn't help that it's finally gotten hot here and I am too cheap to run the air conditioning in the studio at night when it's just me. Even with the fans on it was 80 degrees the night night before last in the studio (how did that happen? Lots of incandescent work lights I guess...) and humid.Yesterday was day one of the outside studio clean-up, and Becky H. came over to help clean out the second hot-shop which is now officially the ceramic and casting studio. Bella--the deep, shiny new dual media kiln--and Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee--the two big, round Jen-Kens I got from Sara and David--are set-up and waiting for Brian the electrician to wire them up this week. We'll be up and running by summer. Well, Becky and Danny will be running--J and I will be in Montana and doing our ceramics there. All that's left to do is install water. I'm thinking a big plastic laundry tub with a garden hose attached to it (we won't use it in the winter and can drain the hose out). But it's not time to talk about (or even think about) ceramics yet--this is still Glass Incarnate. On the glass front, yesterday I solved what had been previously an insurmountable problem with the colors in glass clay being dulled by the CMC. Of course it requires a tiny rewrite of the ceramic section of the book, but nothing that should put anyone out. And on the subject of the glass clay, I did a cool piece that's a solid cast face with a clay and fused glass shard mask on it.  The face has several areas of flashing on it from the old plaster mold cracking during firing which--in conjunction with the mask--evokes the image of a scarred super-hero.I also slumped my first coiled glass clay piece last night. I fuse-fired that piece a few times with undesirable results up until Monday night when I put it in with one of my normal full-fuse loads. Originally you could see all the details in the individual coils, but they shrank and pulled apart leaving holes on the first firing, and the colors were dull even after the second firing (done to patch the holes with more clay). I knew if I did a higher-temp fuse-fire on it I would lose all the detail of the coils so I brushed some black powder into the crevices between the coils to preserve the design, and then I covered the whole thing with clear powder to prevent devitrification. Both techniques worked, and I got bright, shiny color in the final piece! Now we'll see how it slumps.Now it's time to head off to the studio to change the thermocouple in the glass furnace and to measure space for a new (replacement) medium-sized kiln."},

And while there absolutely have been some high moments and downtime in the year, they were subsumed by the overwhelming difficulty of the year for all of us. Now, though, it looks like we've all turned a corner and are looking up and forward to what lies ahead.Dave took a new job yesterday and starts on June 10.

Priceless.", "date": "Saturday, May 11, 2013", "text": "I have just over an hour before my kiln-forming 3 starts and I am still in what passes for my jammies sipping the first coffee of the day from the Chicago skyline mug. I can either read a bit more Discount Armageddon, or I can post. Much as I am loving the book posting wins.I spent last summer in Montana on Flathead Lake. My mom--who has lived with us since my dad died--still has her house there, and we are all comfortably settling into a routine of nine months here in Atlanta and three months there. Last summer I was mostly working on the book, and in support of that effort I set-up a small studio in the garage at the house.My long-term plans are to set-up a a larger studio on the family lake property. Right now there is a small cabin built by my grandfather and a large metal building erected by my father on the land, and some day we hope to build a larger summer home there. Even though the house is not built, because a metal building the size of a two-car garage equipped with two big roll-up doors and one regular door is already in place, there is nothing stopping me from setting up the studio now. And if I have a studio, I can teach. Teaching is on my mind right now as I am enjoying it so much here, and the opportunity of sharing what I love to do AND my favorite place on earth is too compelling to pass up!Imagine a week of studying kiln-forming techniques interspersed with afternoons swimming in the lake, shopping at the galleries in Big Fork, dining at the Smokehouse surrounded by cavorting bunnies, a drive through the National Bison Range, and a day trip to Glacier National Park. I think I may be onto something!"},

I guess I had more work than I realized that had to be fired as I managed to fill my three biggest kilns and still had enough left over to send home with Dee to fire in her two bigger kilns! I was lucky she worked yesterday and today and offered to fire for me as otherwise I wouldn't have been able to ship everything that needs to go out. I'm even a bit ahead on firing right now as I have done most of the order that is scheduled to ship next Wednesday.I'm looking forward to tomorrow's final class in the kiln-forming 1-2-3 series. I taught it a bit differently this time as I had six very focused, enthusiastic students who were there for all three sessions and enabled me to up my game. I plan to continue the format for the next session and hope it goes as well. Basically the first week is about the different forms glass comes in (sheet, frit, rod, stringer, powder), how these forms can affect your perception of the color (transparent frit looks lighter in color as the size of the pieces gets smaller due to the way the light reflects and refracts off of them), bubbles, and viscosity and flow with the addition of heat and gravity. I meant to teach cutting glass in the second week along with color, but color is such a big topic--how combining results in individual points as opposed to a blended color, strikers, reactive glass, opal vs. transparent and their respective effects on depth perception, etc.--that I never got to it. We're going to start with cutting this week, and then move into more discussion of the direction of flow and how to affect the movement of the glass in the kiln by how the glass is placed in the piece (layering and stacking). We'll finish with an introduction to the kiln and the segments in various firing schedules.The other big thing I started with this class is beginning each class with an analysis of the pieces the students made in the previous class (they do an 8\" square based on the subjects discussed for each class) and how they fit or diverged from the students' expectations based on what they had learned. This analysis takes about 20 minutes, but they all seem to get a lot out of talking about what they did and looking at what others did. It also helps me with what I need to emphasize in the class. FOr example, it's been so long since I started fusing glass that it never even occurred to me that I needed to point out in the first class that the glass isn't going to flow a lot from side to side if you put it down so that you have a uniform piece about 1/4\" thick. The students thought the pieces would flow a lot more on the inside of their work than they did.Now it's time to head to jewelry class so I guess I had better finish. Tomorrow's post: Destination Glass in Montana! Come spend a week on the lake in Montana doing an intensive glass seminar with a visit to Glacier National Park, and art shopping in Big Fork thrown in!"},
{"title": "A Quick Post and On With the Day", "date": "Thursday, May 09, 2013", "text": "I am tired to my bones this morning. Last night I was in the studio until after 11:30 getting two big loads into Bertha and Bettina. Then this morning up and running to get J to school while Dan the carpenter finishes the installation of wood flooring in the upstairs of the house. The cleaning people are due to arrive within the hour, and everything is a mess. Anyone who has cleaning people knows that you have to clean before they clean (actually straighten in order for them to clean) and I am behind. Thank you Baxter (Psycho Spaniel) for pulling all the used Kleenex and toilet paper out of all the wastebaskets and shredding it all over the house during the night.On the plus side, the chicken sheep and goat are out, the rabbits are in, and all the animals (including the baby chicks in the guest bedroom) are fed and watered. It's also shaping up to be a beautiful day in Atlanta--looks like it won't rain today. Three more kiln loads in today, and I'll even be caught up on production--just in time to go into a full weekend teaching. I have kiln-forming 3 on Saturday and a new kiln-forming 1 class Sunday, and both are full. I hope this new batch of students is as enthused as the last group and signs up for the rest of the series (taught over the next two weekends). These are my last two intro series before heading to Montana.Yep, it's time again to escape what will be the heat in Atlanta for the cooler summer temps of the Montana mountains (and lake). We look to go the first of June, and I haven't even begun to set a final date and make the last arrangements with the house sitter. In retrospect, I think it's the cooler-than-usual spring temps that have delayed preparations this year. Usually it's so hot by now that we are in a hurry to flee. But this year with all the late rain and cold temps, it's just now getting into nice weather--and mostly pollen-free nice weather.Okay, time to get my butt in gear. More on classes tomorrow."},
{"title": "The Beat Goes On", "date": "Wednesday, May 01, 2013", "text": "I am sore, I am tired, and it's only 10:03 am. Today the carpet in the upstairs is coming up and over the next three days it will be replaced by hardwood floors. This is a difficult project as all our bedrooms are up there, but it is somewhat simplified by Mom still living in the office post surgery. This weekend, if all goes well, she'll move back upstairs. J is not down with the new floors even though her room was the most peed in first by the cat (may she rest in peace) and now by the two dogs (who, if they continue their bad habits once the carpet is gone, will also rest in peace... no I wouldn't, but it's awfully tempting!).The real work of the day for me is to figure out what happened to my manuscript after it left my hands and before it arrived in my editor's. When the copy-editor compiled it, it looks like an entire section was dropped. Now I need to see what else might have changed. I am also going to have to redo some of the projects to get more aesthetically pleasing finished pieces to photograph for the beauty shots. One of the major issues my publisher has is that the glass clay projects look more like clay than like glass--unsurprising as they are made with glass powder and (like pate de verre) will never have the shiny, transparent perfection of, say, cast glass. To make this technique more appealing I need to make it look more glass-like. Maybe the solution is to combine glass clay elements with sheet glass either as windows through the clay or as the support for twining clay pieces. Whatever I do, I need to do it quickly.It's been a really great spring in the studio with a lot of people interested in the beginning kiln-forming series of classes (kiln-forming 1-2-3). I taught part one last Saturday, and this Saturday I teach part two and next weekend part three. Part one was full, and I only have one spot left in each of two and three. Open studio has also been hopping with students from previous classes coming in and working on their own projects. Everyone is doing something different, and they are all interested in what others are working on and in sharing their own knowledge. This is why I opened my studio in the first place. Now we just need to keep the momentum going.We're also just about done with our show orders from the Buyer's Market. Once I have them behind me it'll be time to get the new Siyeh Studio website done. That's my big project for this summer in Montana--that and creating glass tiles based on Gaudi's floor tiles and sidewalk tiles from Barcelona. I brought back two different samples of the tile--one in plaster and a larger one in concrete--ten years ago and I am finally in a place where I can start to think about where I want to go with them. The concrete one has a more subtle, finer detail than the plaster one--for one thing it is not just in two heights of relief as the nautilus shell section undulates in waves--and the motif is also a reverse of the concrete one with the concrete being rendered primarily in the negative. The plaster one has a positive (raised) motif. Both can be found as sidewalks and floor tiles in Barcelona. I love the concrete one, but it is a bit big for glass floor tiles for a bathroom."},

I'm baaaaack! (Emphasis on the baaaa). Springtime in Atlanta--except for a few blissful days at the beginning--means lots and lots of pollen so I am writing from the comfort of the couch instead of the front porch even though it is a beautiful day. The cleaning people are also actually vacuuming the porch as I write as there is so much pollen on it. We even had it pressure-washed after the majority of the pollen fell and it was still covered in pollen this morning. Hello Allegra.Last Sunday we doubled the size of our flock--though the new additions currently live in Mom's bedroom upstairs (she's still in the main floor office/bedroom recovering from her surgery). They are only a bit over a week or two old so they will be in a plastic bin with a heat lamp for the next few weeks. We have two Polish Top Hats, two Salmon Favorelles, two Blue Cochins (the same breed as Sadie and Half Moon), and two Mottled Houdans.I'm going to start this next set off with a story about the North Atlanta/Southern Decatur urban farm industry. (Choctaw Bingo anyone? I am clearly counting down the minutes till I see James McMurtry live tonight--But back to the chickens). My right arm is very sore today. The night before last I was in the East Lake Community Learning Garden and Urban Farm (two blocks from our house and my studio) helping round up their sheep when I caught my foot on a nasty cut-off stump and took a major fall. I was lucky I didn't skewer my eyeball out on another pokey bit of wood (it hit me in the forehead instead), but not so lucky that the stumpy thing I tripped over didn't gash right through the meaty part of the ball of my foot. I was wearing my hiking Keenes which are closed-toed and heavily supportive while at the same time are still sandals with openings in the sides for air circulation--hence the gash. I was stunned enough by the fall that I didn't realize I had cut my foot until a few minutes later when (squeamish people stop reading here and skip ahead a bit) I felt the blood pooling in the shoe and squelched when I walked. I was focused on not letting the sheep get by me, you see. Of course I utterly failed to prohibit the getting-pastness when I fell, and they blithely and nimbly zoomed right by as I lay dazed in the muck.When I got home I was already ate for dinner and the wait at the ER would have been horrendous so I chose not to go in for professional cleaning and stitches, and I cleaned out the cut with hydrogen peroxide, slathered it in Neosporin, covered it with gauze, and wrapped it up tight. It looked like it had already started to close and seal up so I figured I didn't need stitches. Unfortunately the next morning when I went to change the bandage, the wound gaped open and gushed blood. I showered, recleaned and bandaged it, mopped the floor, and headed off to urgent care. The very nice doctore there told me the stitches probably wouldn't hold because it had already been 14 hours since I cut it, but he jabbed me with a few needles and sewed up the cut before giving me a prescription for antibiotics and painkillers. Then the nurse covered the bandage with a bright lime-green stretchy wrap and I hobbled out to the car and home.So, away from the blood and gore part of the story, why were we trying to catch the sheep? Because we were bringing them to our house for a play date with the bunnies and chickens. Really. Remember as I report this that we live in urban Atlanta--not even in the suburbs. The Garden is two blocks from our house. Unfortunately, over the past week the lamb (one of the three sheep) and three of the five goats were killed by one or more dogs and maybe coyotes in a series of nighttime attacks. The first night three of the goats were killed, and, as their bodies were left intact, it was surmised that it was an attack by dogs--coyotes would not leave the meat. But the next attack was either a coyote (fur left on the fence supports this hypothesis) or a hungry dog as the lamb was killed and partially eaten. Did I say we were away from the blood and gore part of the story? Apparently I lied. So to obviate any more deaths, the parent sheep (I call them George and Amelia, the Garden staff calls them Edmund and Irma, and Dave calls them Kebab and Biryani) were invited to spend some time in our yard, safely penned at night with the bunnies and free to range with the chickens during the day. When the last goat--who thinks she's a sheep anyway and was probably spared in the first attack because she hung with them and they protected her--is released from the vet's today, she will join them here. Welcome to the Siyeh Studio Urban Farm.But what about the chickens and bunnies, how do they feel about the newcomers, you ask. Well, the bunnies couldn't care less--they just dodge the sheep's feet and don't seem bothered at all. The chickens, on the other hand, are highly suspicious of the new ruminants in their midst. So suspicious, in fact, that said ruminants were not released from the play yard to roam free today*. Yesterday they roamed, and whenever they got spooked (like when we tried to get them back in with the bunnies) they would charge madly through the yard scattering chickens in their wake. Feathers were--to put it mildly--ruffled. The day ended when Dee (another Dee, not our studio elf Dee)--their primary caretaker--arrived and found Pearl (our pearl leghorn) in the middle of Memorial Drive during rush hour after she had been spooked over the fence by the sheep. We were (mostly Pearl was) VERY lucky no one hit her as she was in the middle of three lanes on a very fast, busy thoroughfare.That brings the current animal count at Siyeh Studio/Casa Griffith to two sheep, one goat, 15 chickens, two dogs, a cockatiel, four rabbits, and five fish. Whew! Hope they get the shelter built at the community gardens soon...Now this last little paragraph is about Glass. It's springtime which means we are running classes (something we don't do much int he summer as I am in Montana for most of it). Saturday I have a full class (the first of the Kiln-forming 1-2-3 series), we are still in full production from a stunningly successful Buyer's Market show in February, and date nights in the hotshop go on. Open Studio has been hopping with two very focused students preparing new work--one for a show and one for fun. In short, life at the studio is just STUPENDOUS (a last tip of my hat to the alliteration of the day).*The ruminants apparently roam having been released when the goat arrived. Dave and I are heading out to see them now. Awww, isn't that goat adorable? She's so little!! It must be the perspective of this photo that makes her look bigger. In person, she's tiny-lamb-sized."},

In ten minutes I will take the J to school and then swing by the feed store to pick up a metric ton of chicken food. I don't actually know what a metric ton is (it wasn't a quantity with which I had to familiarize myself in the writing of the book) but, surely, the bags and bags and bags I am off to buy qualify.It's good to back to a normal life (note that normal does not equal either quiet or restful). Orders to fill, a newsletter to write, glass to inventory... Oh yes, and a few more pesky book details to wrap up/projects to fire. The tjantings were fun yesterday, but the initial results were disappointing. Not surprisingly, if something is an advanced technique/breaking new ground it probably won't work out the first time (or everyone would be doing it).Transitions back into normal life are hard, and I'm actually kind of glad mine is happening at an already chaotic time of the year as the transition has a bit less impact. The past year has been filled with new things--most of them in glass. It has left me with nightly vibrant, active dreams and a restless need to play (mad scientist) every day. But I'm not a mad scientist. Right now I'm a Mom and a chicken feeder--time for posting is up."},

Also got out my tjantings (shown right) to do some drawing on glass with them. It's really too bad the book is (mostly) done and in the hands of the copy editor as I have visions of creating batik in glass dancing in my head and wouldn't mind adding a section on it. I just know it's possible... In the meantime the tjantings and beeswax are useful for another technique that *does* show up in the book so I'm not frittering my day away on FUN (heaven forbid).So, done. Wow. I want to revel on that idea for awhile before I have to add the caveat of the first draft is 98% done (I remember writing  finish later in a few places that I am pretty sure the copy editor is going to notice). The photography is also mostly done with just the beauty shots (finished project photos) and a couple of projects I am still futzing with (screen printing and the fused box) left to do. It seems like every time on those two I get to the \"this is it, this is how I'm going to do it and write it up\" stage, I tweak the process or the materials or SOMETHING a bit and have to work the changes into both the manuscript and the photos.Today is mostly over in terms of studio work. Managed to ship orders today, and I'll fire another order that needs to ship asap. I think I'll put another glass clay vessel in the kiln (I'm still tweaking the firing schedule on that project, but the clay itself is incredible), go get chicken food, take the child to cello, and prepare for a night of putting photos with text and more editing.Decided on Saturday to go ahead and do the artist studio show (the Siyeh Sleigh Ride) this year and spent yesterday putting together the email announcement and the web page for it. Tomorrow I will send out the end of the year newsletter and I am going to offer some sweet glass, kiln, and class deals.Life is good. Off to (live every day as if my hair is on) fire."},

Dee (the book minion and one of the studio elves) is exhausted. Exhaustion is rampant. And yet, I, at least, am also exhilarated. Barring unforeseen catastrophe, and with all requisite knocking on wood, I will finish on time. I have 191 pages of text out of 240, and we have been cranking out 6-12 pages a day for the past week or so.But hubris is ever the nemesis. I no sooner wrote the above paragraph than I discovered Baxter had been left in the backyard. With the chickens. And then there were eight. We mourn Willow, and I dread telling Jessie when she gets home. It took time, a shovel and a pick-ax--and I still didn't get very deep--but Willow is laid to rest in the bamboo with a very large rock over her grave. And wasn't I the one who was contemplating eating our girls at some point when they grew old? Guess that's right out when I am this undone by the end of one. And Baxter. Now that he's killed one, he can never be let out into the yard with them again. I'll need to find time this weekend to fix the front yard gates so they both close easily and he can be let out there.Now I need to gather myself back together and get on with work.

{"title": "I Live", "date": "Monday, September 10, 2012", "text": "I can see the promise of fall from where I sit in the Sky chair on the front porch sipping a ginormous iced coffee (the ice is also coffee so it will not dilute--serendipity, not design). The morning is cool and sweet, and--like the promise of spring in Chicago in April--not to last. It will be hot again this summer, but for now, it's beautiful.I have come up for air but briefly before being consumed by the book again. But I do not lament the coming plunge back into the deep. It may be taking more time than I ever thought possible to write, but it is also incredible. I cannot believe the joy and renewal I am finding in the techniques and projects. Even when I am exhausted (as I always am on Monday after staying up very late on Sunday to finish the weekly pages and send them to my editor) I dream both the creativity and science of glass so energetically and vividly that it is hard to stay asleep.It's funny how when I look back on first dabbling in the alchemy that is kiln-forming glass I didn't really care about the how and the why; I just wanted what came at the end. But now when I look at a technique from a different discipline that I want to adapt to glass, I find myself wanting to know all about it--the history, the science of how and why it works, and how it is being used (or not) today. Only a tenth of that background will make it into the book, but that doesn't stop me from being Tom Petty: I Need To Know. (Side note: It's been so long since I've posted here that I forgot for a minute how to add a link to text... Brain full).In spite of the book, or probably, becaue of it, I managed to do a piece yesterday to submit to the Niche Awards. It still needs a lot of coldworking... Actually it probably doesn't need much coldworking at all, but I need to (and am, indeed, looking forward to) coldwork it so coldworking it will get.Enough of a break: There are lists to make and a few pesky life and studio tasks to get out of the way before I can submerge into the depths again for a few hours (days). Bliss."},

Chan Chan by Buena Vista Social Club plays in my head. The book progresses (though slowly), the production work progresses (on schedule), and I spent the weekend learning to make paperweights in production. Making them in production is a lot harder than either making them for fun or making them for retail sale. Paperweights made for fun are always perfect, and if there is something you consider an imperfection in paperweights made for retail it doesn't matter as flaws are in the eye of the beholder so someone either buys it in spite of or because of the \"flaw\"--or doesn't see it as either--or doesn't buy it. But production paperweights (55 of them) made for the same client need to be perfect... and identical.Tadashi made most of the paperweights while helping me hone my skills, and this week it's up to me to grind and polish the bottoms--not because we didn't firepolish finish the bottoms, but because I then have to sandblast the client's logo on the flat, polished bottom. It will be a full week. Oh yes--and writing, and projects to write about.Right now I am sitting at the orthopedic (though they spell it orthopaedic) surgeon's office with my mom waiting for her to get in to see a doctor about removing the calcifications from the top of her foot that have grown into the tendon. Being old is hell. It's not so bad growing old, but I look around me at those who have arrived at old age (at least those dealing with orthopedic issues, which is probably all of them), and it doesn't look any fun at all. I want to live forever, but I don't want my body to wear out along the way (my mind either).But growing old (heck, maybe even growing up) is for future Brenda. Present Brenda needs to get back to writing about gravity and glass."},
{"title": "The Saddle Fits", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2012", "text": "I am back in the saddle again, so to speak. We returned from Montana a week ago now, J started school, and I filled my calendar with all the obligatory meetings, appointments, and stuff that comprise life in Atlanta. Even with a fuller schedule, the book goes well, and the orders for the studio are done and ready to ship as soon as I get stands from Bill...In a sad bit of news, Tadashi and Corinna have decided that it's just not working for them for Tadashi to commute down to the studio from North Carolina every week or two for three days so he can teach classes and date nights. Domenick has stepped up to the plate to take over as many dates and lessons as he can for the short term, and I am looking at hiring another glass blower. I am also taking on some of the production responsibilities myself--as was the original plan when I got the equipment from Sara and David. Tadashi is coming down this weekend for one last time to work with me and to teach me how to do the production paperweights and flowers myself--and none to soon as I have an order for 55 paperweights.Even though it's only been a week, Montana is a distant memory now. Life here is vibrant, color-saturated, full, and not unpleasant--though warm and moist it's also chicken-filled, and that's a plus. It's odd to have J back in school. I keep thinking that I hear her upstairs or that I need to take her to do something, but she's elsewhere.The big news and project for the next couple of months is, of course, The Book. It's coming along well, but the deadline is now exactly two months from today, and I am going to meet it this time.A book is an odd, living, thing. Like a child, it seems to come out with a mind and personality of its own. I certainly never expected to write so much (and still be writing it!) on the technical workings of a kiln, and yet today I am hoping to finish pyrometers, thermocouples and relays--after 20+ pages on insulation, elements, element placement and controllers I already wrote. The splitting headache I have from yesterday's dental ordeal is not helping, but I still plow on. Tomorrow, no later than Thursday, I need to have the tools and maintenance section finished and be on to the projects. Oh the fun I am having with the projects! I am doing things with glass that I had never seen or heard of anyone else doing before conceiving of them myself. I am messing around with ceramic powders, enamels, glass powders, and thin sheets this week--all things I do not usually incorporate into my own work. Research has, of course, turned up other people messing around with some of the same techniques, but I am studiously avoiding looking at their work or methodologies as I want to figure out how to do it on my own. These projects (and their write-ups) are the culmination of the work I started in Montana this summer, and just thinking about them gets me all enthused and excited in ways that hi-temp resistance wire properties and behavior just doesn't.Now it's time to take the glass furnace lid up to Olympic to get it replaced and pick up the rebuilt furnace that they did over the summer. Then projects (and shipping), then writing, then sleep. Wash, rinse, and repeat the previous sentence (minus the shipping) for the next two months and, voila! book!"},

We're not starting back to Atlanta till Saturday, but tomorrow and Friday will be filled with writing and packing. Dave already flew to Austin yesterday morning--thus avoiding all the madness and chaos sure to ensue after six people spend two months in Montana and four of them prepare to drive back. I still haven't decided what of the studio I'm taking back. Definitely not the kiln. Maybe not the glass--though I brought a lot of powders out with me that I would need to replace.Two months turns out to be the blink of an eye. I had many more projects scheduled than I was able to get to... but that is another post. Today is a look ahead to what little time remains. There will be one more lunch at the Smokehouse accompanied by girls romping with bunnies (and no bunnies making their way home with us--cute though they may be). I probably still won't get in the lake, but you never know--it's supposed to be pretty hot today and I may succumb.Tomorrow my uncle and Susan are taking the girls into Missoula to the Missoula County Fair. They get to see all the 4-H exhibits, eat cotton candy, ride the rides--maybe even see some horse racing (though I don't know if it's still a part of the fair--it used to be when I was a kid). I envy them, and would like to go, but my editor is adamant I write instead. *sigh* crack that whip!Kyla's parents arrive Friday night to scoop her up on their way further west to a wedding.

Also dug up an 1/8 of a bag of Doritos and a rice krispy treat in the pantry. Added them to the half roast beef sandwich, the banana, and the dregs of a bag of roasted almonds--all purchased at the airport in Salt Lake City this morning--and I had dinner! I meant to get right down to writing tonight, but instead I vegged in front of the tv and ate and drank watching Les Demoiselles de Rochefort and then The Decoy Bride. Now it's time for bed. The house is very quiet with not a living soul but me in it. I haven't been this alone at home in over 20 years! If not a person, there has always been at least a dog, a cat or a bird around (and I do have the chickens and bunnies here, but lonely though I am, I'm not inviting them in for the night). The dogs, Mom's bird, and all my peeps are cosied up in Montana tonight. I am in Atlanta to get a big commission and some other orders out, and to escort a couple of Jessie's friends back to Montana on the plane next week. I don't like it here alone, but maybe I'll get some good writing done.Tomorrow night I'll order pizza and open a bottle of champagne. Saturday night there'll be chicken livers up at Dee's.

{"title": "A Breather", "date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2012", "text": "I come up for air today after several very intense weeks of writing, researching, experimenting, and hypothesizing. Who knew mucking about with hot glass was so much like science? A few weeks ago I was delving into physics with the study of thermodynamics and electricity. Recently it's been chemistry with a focus on what pigments are how they react with heat (temperature and time), each other, glass, air, etc. I've been trying to beat colored things of different natures into shape and make them do my bidding, but so far they just keep laughing in my face. Cadmium is especially annoying. (Yes, I am mucking about with cadmium, chromium, cobalt, selenium, and a bunch of other um's that could probably end my life spectacularly if I did not take sufficient safety precautions. I am taking such precautions.)The reason for the post today after such a long hiatus is that I had another official slip in the book deadline and we are now looking at October 21. October seems simultaneously safely far away and terrifyingly near. It won't be easy to finish even with the extension, but at least I can envision finishing.....I sat down to write this post over an hour ago and now after all the distractions and phone calls I can't remember what more I had that I wanted to say.

I'm glad the weather is inclement today as yesterday it was so beautiful I ended up playing hooky with the family and heading out to the Lake and then on to dinner at the East Shore Smokehouse.Yesterday was a challenging day in the Atlanta studio as the crucible in the glass furnace finally gave up the ghost and cracked, spilling molten glass into the bottom of the furnace. The floor of the furnace is made from soft firebrick and it took the glass almost no time to eat right through it and start pouring out onto the cement floor of the hotshop. I have yet to see the gruesome photos of the carnage, but I did get a wake-up call first thing with a description of the damage. Tadashi has the weekend off which left Domenick on his own to deal with it (and Judy to deal with the people scheduled for dates). All dates in the hotshop for the weekend, of course, had to be rescheduled or refunded (at the participants' option). Fortunately the furnace was designed to handle this kind of failure as it has an inexpensive floor that is a separate piece from the rest of the furnace, attached with a couple of latches to the sides. Domenick even thinks he can replace the firebrick in the floor himself this evening and have the furnace up and running (with another crucible) by tomorrow. I hope he can as the timing--4th of July holiday coming up, Dee leaving for here, etc., couldn't be worse.Now I need coffee.

Then in the evening I had a couple of perfect parenting moments with Jessie and wife/partnering moments with Dave. I went to bed with a smile on my face and celebrated by getting up a little late this morning... whereupon everything went to shinola.Understanding what's going with Jessie at mealtimes and helping her to communicate more effectively and less offensively about eating is child's play compared to trying to help her with her summer school work. I not not planned to spend time on it with her this morning, but it needed to be done. I had planned to write, but now I'm so frazzled from trying to explain counting in fractions that I can't even remember what color theory is and I could care less what tools I have added to my inventory since the last book.Time for a couple of deep breaths and maybe a little medication, I mean meditation.

The warm aroma of the coffee wafts across the cool air coming in from outside, twining with it until they both caress my nose. It's going to be a good day.Dave is off on a walk, J, Mom and the dogs are still sleeping--Jig in with Jessie and Baxter in with Mom. Bailey, Mom's cockatiel, woken by my tapping on the keyboard as I sit next to his covered cage, has begun a drowsy morning song. I have been awake on and off since 4:24 (you know it's actually starting to get light here at 4:24 am, and it isn't dark till about 10:30--you gotta love summer in the far north) and I really need my coffee this morning.Yesterday I didn't do much writing, but I did do a bunch of research reading and fact-checking for the section on color and color theory. I read the color theories described by Leon Battista Alberti in 1435, Leonardo Da Vinci in 1490, and Sir Isaac Newton in 1704. From there I explored \"The Munsell Color System\" by T. M. McCleland from 1935 and read Munsell's own articles from The Psychological Bulletin in 1909 and The American Journal of Psychology in 1912 on the relation of the intensity of chromatic stimulus to chromatic sensation and a pigment color system and notation.  Munsell led to ordering copies of \"Josef Albers: Glass, Color, and Light\" (Guggenheim Museum) by Fred Licht, Nicholas Fox Weber, and \"Interaction of Color: Revised and Expanded Edition\" by Josef Albers, Nicholas Fox Weber. Then Dave brought up color and linguisitics right before dinner and......I got lost in the scholarly literature surrounding the misnamed Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity and the effect of one's native language on color perception (and ordered a copy of \"Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf\"). From there I jumped to \"Revisting Basic Color Terms\" by Barbara Saunders, and began delving into Levinson's \"Yeli Dnye and the Theory of Basic Color Terms\". I decided that, as much as I enjoyed Chomsky's principles of generative syntax in graduate school, I am not at heart a universalist, and I don't subscribe to the theories proposed in Berlin and Kay's \"Basic Color Terms\"......and now today I have already spent three hours back lost in the research docs and on this post--and have written nothing in the book. I did add Zotero to my writing tools and integrated it with Scrivener, but I don't think that is enough of a win to justify the lack of productive word count. Think I should get writing for real? Me too!"},
{"title": "Day 2", "date": "Tuesday, June 19, 2012", "text": "The alarm went off at 6:30, and both Dave and I groaned and said, \"Let's sleep some more.\" We had already decided before setting the alarm last night that we wouldn't walk this morning. Instead, we'd save our energy to load the old garage-floor carpets into the minivan for the dump and set-up the studio equipment. So when we decided to sleep a bit more, I was prepared to reset the alarm for 7:00. But Dave was a rebel and recommended that we just wake naturally. Of course 15 minutes later I was wide awake and guilty as all get out for not getting up on Day 2 of the summer regime. So showered and dressed by 7:15, I commenced my writing day as the rest of the household slept.*Yesterday no writing was done. I spent the morning ordering the last of the equipment I'll need for the studio here (a bench top blast cabinet) and starting Jessie on her summer homeschool program. The latter of those went surprisingly well. The afternoon began with a trip to the recycling center to empty out Mom's old minivan and make room in it for the carpet going to the dump (not only do you have to separate everything out here, but you also have to drive 15 miles a neighboring town to the recycling center as there's no pick-up). Then we came back to the house and switched vehicles for a trip to the lake property to unload everything stuffed into my minivan designated for storage there from it so we could stop at WalMart (the ONLY local version of the old-time mercantile store) on the way home to get J a new bookcase. I plan to take the metal storage shelving from her room today to use in the studio so she needed a replacement. And finally, we went to the post office to find out where, between Atlanta and here, our mail is. The only less-than-successful stop was the post office as they, unsurprisingly, have no clue where our mail is. The day ended with cello for J--and I'm going to have to rethink the cello timing a bit as doing it at the end of the day resulted in several meltdowns on J's part and a less-than-good practice. The carpenter also came to talk to me (again) about replacing the rotting deck here and adding a roof over a section of it in back. Today the electrician comes to put in the wiring for the kiln, and everything we bought last week gets delivered. It's going to be a chaotic day, and I am determined to write in spite of it! Now onward and penward.*Dave slept in for about 10 minutes after I began this post. So much for a sleepy morning in."},
{"title": "A New Chapter", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "text": "I've hemmed, and I've hawed. I've dillied and dallied. But now it's time for some metaphor that means let's get on with It. The first half of my year is over--with all its attendant requirements, obligations, responsibilities, and necessities. Now the next quarter begins, and I have been looking forward to it for months! This quarter is Montana and the book. That's it. I am setting up a small studio today in Polson for testing and experimental work--no production. The Atlanta studio continues to run without me thanks to the uber-capable Judy, Dee, Becky, Tadashi, Todd, Brian and Domenick. The house, chickens, bunnies and pond are being cared for by Stacy and my cousins Andrew and Rachel who just moved here from Tucson--as well as Judy and Dee (eggs ahoy!). I have shed my southern skin and settled into my northern roots--at least for awhile.A lot has happened since I last posted--so much that I didn't even have time to write about it. Fast forward to the first week in June. While Dave went to Austin for his regular work trip in the beginning of June, I moved the rest of the family (sans the aforementioned chickens and bunnies) to my mom's house in Polson for a summer up at Flathead Lake. On the way, we stopped in Florence Kentucky for a weekend so I could take a two-day enameling workshop in nearby Newport at the WW Carpenter Enamel Foundation--part of Thompson Enamels. It was an intense, amazing experience, and I look forward to adding enameling and cloisonne to the studio's class offerings and my personal work in the fall. In the meantime, the workshop will provide material for The Book.The Monday morning after the workshop we left Kentucky in the fully (and I mean to the ceiling fully) loaded minivan. In the way back was our luggage for the summer, everything I need to set up a small studio--including a medium-sized kiln on a stand. On top of the kiln and stretched across the rest of the boxes nestled up to the roof was Jessie's cello. It's going to be a summer for Jessie too--but more on that in a minute. In the middle if the car in the passenger seats were Jessie, her luggage, some more glass studio supplies, and the dogs with all their food and gear. Mom and I and her bird shared the front (the bird was in his travel cage between the front seats). The drive from Florence to Polson took two days and covered almost 2,000 miles, crossing three major rivers and winding through the massive mountain range that is the Rockies before finally traversing the continental divide into western Montana.The next couple of days after our arrival were not spent resting up. Instead we cleaned out the big family room downstairs preparatory to making it our main living space for the summer. We hauled out trash, recycling, stuff for the second-hand store, and stuff to store at the lake (there's a big metal building on our property there for storage and workshop). Dave flew into Missoula from Austin on Thursday, and I went and got him and brought him up to Polson.In the last couple of days we acquired the last things we need to make this house a complete home-away-from-home and put together Jessie's summer study schedule. Our acquisitions include a comfy couch, a big tv (we brought the Apple tv and all our movies on hard drives with us), an outdoor table and chair set, and a gas grill. I also upgraded the house wireless--turns out we still had a 256k pipe. As of tomorrow it will be 8Mb--and finally adequate for Dave to work form the house and us to rent movies on-line from Netflix.Jessie's summer study packet is a magnum opus all on its own. She has math worksheets, flashcards, timed worksheets and quizzes. She has over 2400 pages to read in eight books, weekly spelling lists, cello review and new songs, eye exercises (to strengthen her eye muscles), daily journaling (for writing), a photography course, and a programming class with her father. All the materials--including worksheets for extra credit (points she can use to buy things or get special treats)--are in a binder with these pages for guidance/reference. I now have a sense what homeschooling would entail, and I know that if push came to shove, I could definitely do it.This morning started at 6:30 with a four-mile walk with Dave. Now I'm posting, and in a few minutes I will roust Jessie to being her day, and I'll head into the new studio to set-up and begin working on the book again! Dave is off to the coffee shop for better bandwidth. This is truly the life."},

It limbers everything up and gets the juices flowing.Outside the window next to me, just past the end of the deck, the trees rise through the early morning fog. The tops of the dogwoods, maples, oaks and pines are revealed in varying degrees of relief as they march down the mountain. I'd be outside on the deck soaking in the silence and the feel of the morning's still silence were the chairs and everything else out there not covered with the tangible, moist presence of the fog. Like the fog in my brain, the fog outside the window will burn off in a few hours, leaving me with the rolling vista of trees covering the Blue Ridge mountains for as far as I can see. With my mental fog gone, I will be in full writing mode and immersed in pounding out my book for the next two months. At last.Of course I'm not in Atlanta. If you missed that, I'm a piss-poor writer and foggier than I thought. Yesterday after our silversmithing class, Becky brought Mom and me up to the Hinton cabin in the Blue Ridge mountains for a couple of days so I could forget the rest of the world and just write. The pic shown was actually taken here at the cabin, but by the security system and not during our visit. The first time I saw it I focused on the red table and chair set, but the real interest is the black object coming over the deck rail on the left...Mom is reading and crocheting (not right now, right now she's sleeping) and Becky is working on her own projects so we are all quite content in the silence of our own endeavors. I, as I mentioned before, am limbering up and straining to see and write clearly. I left my Kindle at home and am shunning Plants vs. Zombies on my iPhone (except in the bathroom--there are limits to my self-restraint after all). I am also reading email sparingly and avoiding surfing the net unless it's for book research. Such restraint...Though I have not been writing for the past several weeks, the studio has not been quiet. The dichroic glass from Sara has been processed into inventory (thank you Dee), one of the crucible kilns is being fitted with new lids of a modified design, and the latest Bullseye order will arrive today with Dee going down to direct the delivery and start unloading it. On a more somber note, Night Shadows, one of the studio hens, has gone to greener pastures/browner worms--or to a hawk, coyote or owl. Though we miss her, we are still getting 5-7 eggs a day so no one other than Jessie is even thinking of replacing her.Okay, the fog outside has not burned off, but it's time for me to get on with the real writing."},
{"title": "Feathering One's Nest", "date": "Friday, April 27, 2012", "text": "It looks like I didn't give away the last male baby bunny in time. When female bunnies are getting ready to give birth, they tear fur out of their bellies with which to line their nests for the babies. Jasmine did this the last time she gave birth and that is what alerted me to the fact that she was expecting--she didn't get very big and doesn't like anyone touching her belly so I didn't know by her tummy size. This time Jasmine apparently has decided she has a much better source of nesting material and treated me today to a gathering of it.In order to properly present the story I must needs provide a bit of background. Every morning the chickens clamor to be let out of the coop into the yard where they scatter and do their free-ranging thing. They usually do this without going first into the play yard where their food and water are located so they can break their fast. So round about noon, they want to go in to the plentiful food and water in the bins. Today when I let the chickens into the play yard--which they share with the bunnies--so they could have their midday snack, I witnessed an odd sight: As the chickens clustered around the food bin, Jasmine (momma bunny) went around behind them and starting checking out their butts. I wondered what the heck she was doing until she reached up, grabbed a bunch of soft, downy butt feathers with her teeth, and yanked! The targeted chicken squawked and pulled away--leaving Jasmin with a mouthful of feathers. She took off with them, and upon her return, grabbed another chicken.  On one of her butt-grabs, the chicken to which she was attached swung around and Jasmine didn't let go. Instead, she went arcing around and flew off with a wad of downy grey tufting out of her mouth. I so wish I had thought to snap a picture! When I told Dee about her activities, we went and looked out in the play yard/hutch for the nest, but I didn't see it. Then Dee pointed out where somebunny had dug a big burrow underneath the ramp and lined it with Timothy hay. Looks like this litter is going to be born in the natural and the wild. Maybe it's time to finally get the chicken and bunny cam.After the chickens were all let back out into the yard, Jasmine enjoyed her own drink and a nibble at the now-communal feed and water stations (the bunnies have their own in their hutch, but they like to share with the chickens)."},
{"title": "Sometimes it's all about the presentation", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2012", "text": "For the past couple of weeks, I've been working on a commission for gifts for a delegation from China.  The pieces that we made are exquisite and meticulously crafted. After all, that's what we do at Siyeh Studio. But for this particular commission, the packaging matters as much as the object. So I find myself, on this beautiful Sunday morning, finishing gluing satin lining on the inside of boxes, and handmade Mulberry paper on the outside. The pieces themselves, glass paperweights in swirling shades of green with dichroic dragonflies and ginkgo leaves dancing above, were also sandblast etched with the logo of the hosting organization. The paperweights, carefully nested in their custom-made boxes, will be picked up today. The delegation arrives Tuesday.The rest of this fine chilly Sunday is going to be spent gardening. Last night, in the midst of sandblasting logos and gluing boxes, I planted tomatoes, basil, marjoram, chives, and tarragon. Today I have all the flowers to put in in the pots in the front yard. Then it's time to put the child to use. After all, why have children, If not to use them as yard labor?______________________________________Sunday is over, and it was wonderful. Now it's Monday and, surprisingly, still wonderful! I didn't finish the post yesterday as I was writing it with Dragon Dictate to practice with it, and I was too self conscious to keep going while Dave was cooking breakfast--overhearing everything I was saying. Especially since he asked if I was paused because he wanted to play something for me. The something turned out to be the Georgia Satellite song \"I Love You Period\" (not surprising since one of the hardest parts of writing with Dragon is remembering to say the punctuation):\"I love you period Do you love me question mark Please, please exclamation point I want to hold you in parentheses I love you period Do you love me question mark Please, please exclamation point I want to hold you in parentheses\" After finishing the boxes for the paperweights and doing the last quality control with Mom and Dee, I did, indeed, get to garden for the rest of the day. I had such a glow of accomplishment at the end of the day for completing not one but TWO projects that I am rip rarin' to start something new today! Guess I'll just have to be satisfied with putting together the new classroom chairs for the studio and getting a kiln load in. Maybe I'll end the day by getting the rest of the plants in pots--I ran out of dirt yesterday and had to get more this morning. And speaking of dirt, the chickens have decided that the absolute bestest place to indulge in a group dust bath is in the corner of my vegetable garden... Need to break them of that habit before they tear up all the new tomato plants I put in yesterday!"},

I'm a writer too, doncha know. I'm a writer who produced in the past week Not One Single Word of my manuscript which is due in 1107 hours. Hours? What's this hours nonsense? I put it out in hours as it looks farther away that way than it does in days (45, for the inquiring minds).Monday through Saturday I was able to cope with Not Writing. Monday through Saturday I was a studio owner/studio artist/teacher, and I was swamped in those roles. I was even able to thoroughly enjoy some time carved out for my family over the weekend (dancing under the stars and sleeping on the trampoline). I was able to do all of those things because I held Sunday in front of me. Bright, shining, pure, empty Sunday--today, in other words--as the day I would finally conquer the structure of the book and the schedule of my time, and I would Begin To Write In Earnest. This epic Sunday would naturally prepare me for a stellar Monday and 90,000 words written in the next 45 days. (Do the math. Even without Real Life, it's not pretty, or, dare I say, even possible.)I meant to get up at 6:00 am this morning, but I didn't set an alarm because I figured if my body was able to get up, it would. If it needed a little more sleep, I should let it have it. I got up at 8:30. Then I worked on tax papers until 3:00--from 12:00 - 3:00 with our accountant. Then I had a couple of loose ends at the studio--materials and firings--to clear up. Then I had the last two baby bunnies to deliver to their new home. Then the Apple TV needed reset, and dinner was consumed, and family time spent, and cello practiced with J, and J showered and into bed... And now it's 9:20. I have consumed a bit of wine, and I am not able to make heads or tales of the outline from which I am to write this book. Is this it? Do I throw in the towel and myself on the publisher's mercy and beg for an extension through the summer? A cynical little corner of my brain just piped up with, \"Would it matter if they said yes?\".All I can do is think of the natural state of my business (and the theater business in Shakespeare in Love) and hope that it will all turn out ok (it's a mystery). Or I can beg."},

Suffice it to say I played throw the knife, catch the knife all day, and somehow managed to get everything done... except any writing. It is a sad, bleak little note that were it not for the book, my work-life would pretty perfect and balanced right now. But there is The Book, and sooner rather than later I am going to have to face it. But not today. Today I teach a class this morning and a private birthday party this afternoon. The birthday party is for six girls and they are going to make wind chimes. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.Yesterday the day started with my failing to change the blade on the tile saw. The screws to get into the assembly were rusted so badly that even after four applications of WD-40 I couldn't get them loose. I was ready to give up and finally invest in a good tile saw, but Tadashi gave it a try and now my little Workforce tile saw is back in business. Whew. I don't really have money to spend on a new upgraded tile saw right now.In the middle of the day we had a visit from one of our gallery clients, Skip MacLaren of Reflections Kaleidoscopes. We got to show him everything but the chickens before he had to head back to the kaleidoscope convention.Jessie also returned from her 20-mile hike last night. She was tired but exhilarated. We celebrated with homemade pizza (NOT baked in the kiln) and Steve Martin's \"Roxanne\". After the movie, we danced under the stars in the backyard and capped off the night by making a big family bed on the trampoline with the faux fur blankets under us and our big down comforter on top. Thanks to our mosquito system it was a BEAUTIFUL night (none of us got bitten once), and we will definitely do it again. Camping, Griffith style. If you look carefully you can see J's tousled head still nestled next to her grey rabbit Bun-Bun in the covers. I got to sleep in the middle and was warm and toasty all night. Dave and J had the outsides, but they both reported (when the chickens woke us at first light) having slept nicely toasty too even though it got down to 46 degrees. If I hadn't had to get up, I'd probably still be in sleeping with J!"},

The order is for a foreign delegation and everything in the presentation has to be just right so I find myself covering boxes with handmade mulberry paper and lining the insides with silk--or at least gathering all the materials so that I can do the actual covering and lining next week.I am getting stressed enough about the lack of writing that I'm not sleeping well. At all. Today I am booked solid through noon, then I have kiln loads to get in, THEN I hope to have time to write. I'm not too optimistic, however, as I am already exhausted from two nights of little sleep and late afternoon is already a low energy time for me. All I can do is try."},

Andrew and Rachel and mom are all still asleep, so the only sounds in the house by the ticking of the clock, and the snoring of the dogs.Jessie left for her class camping trip this morning with new hiking shoes, a Camelback water bladder, and a new pack that was fitted to her at REI. She weighs 71 lbs and--including shoes--is carrying 14 lbs of gear. Each child is supposed to carry 20% of his/her body weight so we nailed that one.Today begins the major writing on the book. Finally. I still have hopes of making my deadline of June 1. But I must admit that I am nervous, as time really is getting tight. I think I'll do a warm-up   by fixing the sagging elements in the furnace, and checking for any burned-out elements that need replacement.  I'll also do a vacuum and clean out of all the killed. Finally, I'll finish with changing out of thermocouple, and replacing relays. That should just about get me through the kiln maintenance section of the book. This is the section that I really wanted the Bluetooth headset for.  I need to be able to have my hands free while working in the kiln. (Switching back and forth from dictation mode to command mode to spelling mode is going to take time to get used to. Using DragonDictate requires a whole new way of thinking about thinking, and thinking about writing.)Today is also my 1st day back in the studio preparing for the new round of classes I have coming up.  Sign up for them so far has not been as good as I would like. I am considering whether or not to send out a mid-month newsletter with lists of the classes that still have space available in them, and the times they are offered. On the other hand, since I am teaching all but the Sunday classes  and one advanced class from now through the middle of June,  I need to think about how much time I really have to spend teaching while trying to get the book finished. And speaking of getting the book finished, it's time to get going for the day. Off to read the manual and go putter in the kiln guts."},

I am really tempted, but time is running out, and I just don't think I have it in me to do yet another road trip--even for Morganica and her encyclopedic knowledge of casting.  Alicia Lomne dangled the carrot of her coming down to hang out with us if I should visit, and I really, really want to... but I can't. *sigh* I can't wait till this book is done and I'm on to the next stage in life--which will be a quiet, slow one!Time to get a quick piece in the kiln and Find The Bluetooth Microphone!

The year's scheduled events are ticking by and now the only one left before summer is The Book. The book looms, and I am sorry to say but I am a bit lost in the weeds. The cause for my flailing may be the travel and production schedule I've been subject to since February, but whatever it is, it's got to stop. TODAY. Writing output has been negligible--as exemplified by the lack of blogging. Instead, I just keep adding to the outline and organization in non-organizational and non-helpful ways.There has, however, been one bright spot in my obsessive-compulsive ditzing around the book: I found Scrivener. It is helping me make sense of the tangle into which I have twisted my outline and topic ambitions. Today I finish the organization and Set In Stone. It's time to rise up, shake off the excess, the anxieties and the what-about-this-tools that are clinging to my skin (think golden retriever after a romp in the kiddie pool) and focus on what I already know and can do. In fact I think I remember how I did that for the first book: Every time I see some cool new tool or technique I have to say to myself, \"Wow. That's neat. I need to make a note of it for Book 3.\" Of course there won't BE a Book 3 (though I think I said that about Book 2 at this point in the process on Book 1) but that's besides the point. I just need a way to Let Things Go.The travel we just finished was a week in Arizona for a family wedding. First, Tucson for a couple of days (the wedding), then to Phoenix to stay with my favorite uncle for a few days. He has a front yard full of Gamble's quail, doves and a cottontail bunny (Jessie is all about the animal pics and she took all the pictures in this post). While there, we went to the Desert Botanical Gardens and J went nuts for the butterflies, lizards, roadrunner, grounds squirrels, and hummingbirds--oh yes, and the cacti too. Finally we had two days up north with a train ride to the Grand Canyon and a three-mile hike along the rim.Now we're home, I'm charging the bluetooth headset to start dictating the book to Dragon tomorrow, and everything spins up again."},

I don't know what was burning--Mom swears it wasn't the potato she put in the microwave for breakfast.Time continues to go by me at warp speed, but I hang on by my fingernails and avoid the wake. Since I last posted, I drove to Magdalena New Mexico for a business visit with Sara and David of Creekmore-Durham Glass. They are the friends from whom I bought all the hot-shop equipment a few years ago. This time around I got two large kilns, a watchmaker's cabinet, a Giberson (the first syllable rhymes with \"give\") head (and a good--though off-color--story to go with it), about 100 lbs of dichroic glass in sheet and scrap, a bunch of molds including another large sink mold, and various odds and sods.They also shared with me a luster and glass powder technique they developed so I could include it in the book. I am amping up my skills in it by teaching it this spring in the studio. Dee went with me--ostensibly to help with the driving and take dictation for the book--but I like to drive, and we listened to all three books in the Hunger Games trilogy instead.Since my return I got the new class write-ups on the website--and discovered flaws in my provider's infrastructure. I also wrote and sent out next quarter's newsletter--in the process uncovering if not flaws, at least serious weaknesses from my point of view--in my provider's sign-up process. Yesterday was an incredibly challenging day culminating in the Apple TV refusing to recognize the format (it's code for \"I won't play for you\") of any of the TV shows or movies in our home library. *sigh* I worked through that one too, but not till after we had already rented the new Three Musketeers.The highlight of the day yesterday was discovering that all nine of our chickens are, indeed, laying eggs almost daily. We have never had more than eight eggs a day--or so we thought. Turns out one of the girls has been disdaining the nesting boxes in favor of a downy nest she made under the prickly holly bush. Jessie discovered the nest on accident and we recovered 32 eggs from it! None of them are obviously rotten (none of them float or smell), but I think they'll probably end up blown out and the insides discarded unless I can come up with a use for 60(!) eggs--the current quantity in the fridge before today's production. I would be giving them away, but I'm out of cartons (ahem, people, when you take home eggs, bring back the cartons). The carton problem will be going away soon as I finally broke down and ordered a batch on-line.At the studio we finish the preparation for Judy's hip replacement surgery. Dee is stepping in to cover for her, my Mom deciding it was just more than she could take on--and rightly so, and Judy and Dee are reorganizing the studio, preparing for the bazillion classes I am teaching now through June, and generally making sure the baton is--temporarily--safely passed. I am confident that I can ignore them and everything will work out Just Fine.Now for me, back to the book. Deadlines loom, gallery contributors need prodding (or initial notification--I am bad AND behind), and text needs, well, written! It's going to be an exciting spring at Siyeh Glass. If you're anywhere in the area, make sure you stop in for some madness (and check out the latest newsletter!)."},
{"title": "Springing Ahead", "date": "Sunday, March 11, 2012", "text": "I think I'll take a couple of minutes right now to post as I'm not sure when next I'll have time. The past week has passed in a blur. I can't even remember a time when I was not going full out from the second I got out of bed to the minute I fell back into it--and there is no immediate end in sight. I am in full-on author mode for the book right now and try to write for a couple of hours every morning, regardless of what else I have going on for the rest of the day. The only way to pull that off is to get up at 5:30 or 6:00 am--not my favorite time of day.However, even with getting up that early every morning, I haven't had time to write for the past several days... What's up with that? Between the demo booth we have at the American Craft Council Show here in Atlanta, getting out the current batch of orders I have from the Buyer's Market Show, and Life (e.g., costumes for the giants and props for the dwarves for Jessie's upcoming class play, helping the 8th grade class create glass doors for the bookcase they're making for the school auction, and the silversmithing class I am taking at Spruill Center for the Arts), I have been SWAMPED! Further proof, if I needed it, that the adage \"The time a task takes will expand to fill the time allotted for it\" is true.Add to everything else the same old same old of equipment maintenance, quarterly newsletter, class schedule for next quarter and payroll, and well, I'm not only in the swamp, I am also up to my ass in alligators. Friday the glass furnace went down to two working pairs of elements--just enough to keep it warm enough to blow--so yesterday morning in addition to two kiln loads before going up to the ACC Show, I had to get the relays and the repaired thermocouple back in the other furnace so Tadashi could replace the broken elements in it. Next step for me is to swap the two furnaces out Monday. However last night he texted me to let me know that two pairs of elements in the replacement furnace aren't firing even after the relays were tested and put back in and the elements were changed out. So this morning, while I wait for the kilns to cool enough from yesterday's loads to unload them, I need to see if I can figure out what's up with the furnace--loose wiring, incorrect wiring, or something completely new. If I can't get it working I'll have to run it up to Olympic tomorrow (in the copiuos free time I have left unscheduled) to have the guys there look at it so I can get it up before Tuesday.Slipping back into marketing mode, I got all the new class descriptions written up with prices, now I have to get them scheduled on the calendar and more detailed write-ups on them done and posted to the website. People who visited us at the show are already clamoring for class times, and, as I would like to take their money (and make them happy new glass artists), I need to strike while I have their attention.As it's the end of the quarter I have a newsletter to write--and email addresses of all the new people from the ACC who signed up to get the newsletter on our mailing list. Dee may be doing a bit more of the driving than I initially planned on the way to New Mexico so I can write. Too bad I don't have an anywhere satellite network adapter for my laptop.New Mexico? What's this about New Mexico? Tuesday right after my metalsmithing class Dee and I are heading out to Sara and David's studio in Magdalena, just south of Albuquerque, so they can share their luster technique with me for the book and I can relieve them of more equipment--specifically big old kilns that I will use to equip the casting studio (second hotshop) that we built last year and have yet to equip. One of the kilns might also go to Montana this summer as the seed kiln for the studio there. Montana?!? I become quite the regular traveler.Finally, in the list of oh-my-heavens-I-have-a-lot-to-do, I circle back to the Buyer's Market show. I not only have orders to produce, but I need to make follow-up calls to the people I didn't see, get the Siyeh Studio website back up, and create new 12\" tiles for each colorway to photograph for said website. Yet another area wher people want access to my work and I need to give it to them.Okay, brain (and plate) full. Think I'll end with some pics Dee took  of our booth at the ACC. I'll look at them as I sip my coffee, and I'll be happy in how much we've done without worrying about how much I have to do. Happy Spring Ahead Day, everyone!"},

He said, \"I think you're just panicking\". Which made me think, are my feelings a product of the rational part of my mind trying to come up with something to make the irrational part of my mind feel better? I hope so. Otherwise I'm doomed.I spent the entire weekend--including much of Friday and this morning from 6:00 am on--writing, stuttering, attempting to write, and re-writing. I am happy with the quality of the content, but I am concerned about the quantity--and concerned that my editor will be less than happy as she was led to believe (I shamefully admit by me) that there would be More.Will the world end? No. Am I still stressed? Yes.We had an incredible photo shoot in the hotshop last Thursday with Liam Schatten. He took over 500 photos of Tadashi doing roll-ups. Thank heaven Tadashi is so calm and confident about everything, or the shoot could have been a disaster. I wish I had taken a picture of Liam's set-up in the hotshop as, between the tripod, reflectors, the laptop and it's tether to the camera, extension cord and other electronic cables, the hotshop was a labyrinthine mess! It was amazing to see Tadashi navigate through it all and produce three amazing pieces.Now back to writing for the book instead of the blog."},
{"title": "BMAC 2012 Wrap-Up", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2012", "text": "The last week passed in a daze and I never found time to post. Initially I had no time because I was trying to get new work finished prior to driving to Philly for the show--I was still grinding and polishing new glass for it at 1:30 pm last Wednesday and we were supposed to have left in the early morning. We (\"we\" being me, my mother and Jessie) left at 1:48 pm and got in at 2:00 am after two McDonald's meals and a marathon of driving. Then the next day was the first day of set-up. We weren't supposed to be able to unload the car or get into the hall until 3:00 pm, but fate was smiling on us and exhibitor services let us in just before 11:00 am. Then began the set-up.This year, again for the first time, Bill (of Black Cat) and I split an additional booth for our new collaborative work. It was only a 10 X 10, and we only had five new pieces and three older pieces in it, but I was very happy with how it turned out. Unfortunately I do not appear to have taken a picture of the whole booth--just the individual pieces. I hope John got one. I also don't have a picture of Todd's best new work which was a 6-1/2 ft long 3 ft wide flat wall sculpture of a man flying (or being flown by) a kite. It was the hit piece of the show. I am going to have to check with John on that one too--I'm sure he got a good one.Even with the additional booth to set-up--I was in glass with the extra booth next to me and Bill was in mixed media a few aisles away so John, Todd and I set-up both of the booths--we finished by Friday at 5:00 pm and we could have been out even sooner if we hadn't puttered. We even had almost everything priced--something I had never done before until the first day of the show.Good thing we were so prepared, too, as we wrote our first order right after the show opened on Saturday, and then we just kept writing. Usually I have time to post during the show, but we pretty much wrote orders non-stop for the entire show for the first time ever! Not posting meant I didn't get to use the line I had been saving up for days (since the Princess Bride quote posts): \"Hello, my name Is Inigo Montoya. You love my glass, prepare to buy.\" Now let's talk about the show itself. Hargrove exhibitor services was, as always for me, very nice and accommodating. The load-in and load-out were the smoothest and easiest I have have done in Philly. I was a bit disappointed that I never saw Rebecca, the new show manager who replaced Christine. I expected her to make a point of going around to personally greet the the artists. I also saw my section rep, Allison, less than I expected to, but I have since discovered that there were only two section reps for the entire floor so I'm amazed that I saw her at all. I was also dismayed at the email that went out a week before the show stating that exhibitors were limited to two additional crossbars. Unlimited free crossbars have been one of the best perks for this show for years and many of us count on them--or at least count on finding out in a timely manner that we won't have access to them. A one-line notice buried in the weekly show email one week before the show is *not* a timely manner. Fortunately, Hargrove did not stick to this rule, and, as far as I know, everyone who needed crossbars got them.The floor set-up itself was also disappointing--again, not unexpected with only two section reps. There were several places in our area (the back of the glass aisle) where either exhibitors never showed up or the floorplan was just weird and these areas had to be covered with carpet and furnished so they didn't look so bad. The carpet that went down was a real mismash, and the tables and chairs used to furnish the empty space lasted one day until they were carted off somewhere else. When an artist down from me asked Hargrove to provide replacement furniture, she was told that they would just be stolen again so what was the point. If I had seen the artists who took them, I would've hunted them down and gotten the furniture back--rent your own if you need it, don't make our section look like empty crap.The new exhibitors in the back were also stuck in a horrible place where the aisle just ended and there were no curtain walls or anything--just the back of the hall and the restrooms. As I walked the hall I saw several other places where the floorplan had large open holes and some of them didn't even have carpet. With the increase in booth fees and the decrease in show support staff, I would like to see where the additional money went as it certainly wasn't to making the show look better.Now, negatives out of the way, let's get back to buyers and sales. I again found this show to be increasingly a regional show with a majority of my new accounts coming from either Pennsylvania or from its bordering states. There isn't a good show in the west that I know about so where are those buyers going? Orlando? New York? Nowhere? Origin aside, the buyers were there, and they were active. In spite of the negatives, it was our best show ever. We took over 40 orders with an average size of just over $600 and sold 898 individual pieces. The work chosen ranged from Todd's littlest wire and glass ornaments to the large, new collaborative work with Black Cat. There were buyers for everything, and they placed good orders. There were also several good customers whom I did not see so I need to check-in with them.Most of the orders are due by the end of May, and we don't have another show scheduled this year so I am going to have to step up to the plate on my follow-up and on-line marketing to galleries so we get reorders. Todd had such a good show that right now he would rather I didn't follow-up so he wouldn't get any more orders, but he'll get over having to work. Next task: finishing the input of orders into the POS system, sending Bill his steel orders, Todd his wire orders, and putting together the firing schedule for the glass. Also need to get an image to Merle for an ad in the spring edition of Niche magazine."},
{"title": "Anything Can Be", "date": "Tuesday, February 14, 2012", "text": "“Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.”    ―      Shel Silverstein It is Valentine's Day, and I just gave Jessie the present I bought for her back in December. It's a blue jade and silver bead bracelet with a silver heart medallion hanging from it. On the medallion I had engraved \"Anything Can Be\" from the poem above. When she opened it, I had a misty-eyed, uplifting moment and thought how everything would be all right for the show, it would all work out--after all, anything can be. And then I thought of all the disasters that \"anything can be\" could also bring to life...Who pissed in my bean curd this morning, you might ask. The new work for the show--of course all left for last and for the last minute--has been kicking my butt and not even bothering to take my name. The night before last I was in the studio till after 1:00 am loading the kiln with the glass for the 1/2\" cast glass disks on copper rods for the new sculptural pieces. When I went back yesterday morning at 9:30 am, that kiln was still annealing--not a good omen for the prospects of getting yesterday's kiln load in (though perfectly predictable had I done the math on how long the firing would take). Not having an extra day to just walk away and let it cool, I pushed it and cracked the lid (1/4\") at 350 degrees (about 5:00 pm).Thick pieces, dammed with steel molds and on mullite shelves. I knew I was risking it, but there were no good choices. I also knew that though thermocouple read 350 degrees, that was the air temp in the kiln and the glass was significantly hotter. Finally about 9:00 pm I took the pieces--still in the steel molds and on the shelves--out of the kiln. The temperature--lid fully open--read 171 degrees. Had I stopped there, I think I would have been fine, but I needed the shelves and molds from the 9\" circle pieces to do another set. So I slipped the molds off and stacked the glass circles (now THAT was a stupid move--all I can say is, I was tired and thought the stack would preserve the heat better and allow them to cool more slowly). A few minutes later I heard the first, distinctive prack (a combination of a ping and a crack) and, sure enough, The lime green circle cracked starting at the exit point of one copper rod and running right through. Eventually it made it all the way across and I discovered that my discs are 5/8\" thick--not 1/2\". A couple of minutes later I heard another one go. It was the turquoise one. Another one, yellow, did not crack, but I didn't have the mold centered on the fiber paper so the bottom is not flat and I had to remake it too.Now it's Tuesday morning, and I know that the pieces I put in last night--I finished just after midnight--won't be cool enough to coldwork today at all. I'm not even going to unload them from the kiln till tomorrow morning. Then I'll need to coldwork and pack them before hitting the road and driving to Philadelphia with Mom and J in tow. (No, I'm not really towing them along behind. I'll let them ride in the car--if there's enough room.)If I'm lucky, tomorrow's post title will be \"It's A Mystery\". Right now it feels like more Princess Bride:Inigo: We're in a terrible rush.Miracle Max: Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles."},
{"title": "It Would Take a Miracle", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2012", "text": "It has been awhile since I posted as it's been awhile since I had time to post. Arguably my time right now could be better spent on something else--like getting ready for the Buyer's Market of American Craft in Philadelphia this week. but I am taking a minute (or 20) to post anyway.Since I last wrote on the horrificness of January, life, as it will do, has settled back down to normal. Dave did his monthly stint in Austin. Jessie is on winter break. It was briefly spring, now it's winter again. The sun rises and sets. The birds quarrel over seed and prime bathing spots at the pond. The magnolias, early prunus, quince, camellias, daffodils, hyacinth, and forsythia determinedly bloom in spite of the vagaries of the weather. As for me, well I spend a lot of time in the studio.In hindsight, it was probably not the right timing to add a completely separate 10X10 booth with all new work to the 10X20 booth I already need to fill with current work for the Buyer's Market. But Bill and Elaine (Black Cat ArtWorks) and I came up with some great ideas for new directions in our work together, and we committed to them before life came along with its big teeth-kicking boots. It took until last Thursday before I finally had a complete list of all the pieces I need for the show. I began firing everything Friday. Now it's Sunday, and I have so far managed not to have to drive up to Lori's studio in Dunwoody to borrow her kilns. Fingers crossed my luck holds today.As I review what's come out of the kilns so far, I realize that the new work has two different styles/feels, and I'm wondering how it's going to blend in one booth. I am also not thrilled with the display we have determined for that booth which is based on the materials we have--white walls, white pedestals and purple carpet. It matches the black steel and bright glass of half of the new work (similar in feel to our current pieces) just fine. But we also have a french vanilla and french vanilla and dense white series of fused and sandblast-carved pieces that I just don't think is going to work there. Maybe I need to think about setting up a niche with soft grey walls and black carpet for those pieces... Oh I need at least another week to do this right, and I don't have it!The other new work--the pieces similar in flavor to what we already do) is large (six-foot tall), three-dimensional, kinetic, and sculptural. The glass is thick (1/2 inch) and cast around copper rods so that it moves freely in the black steel frames. I am still playing with the colors and technique I want to use for the castings even though the final firing of all the pieces must happen today. This work is an interesting contrast to my other morceaux de verre pieces created from sheet, chunk and frit. When I create those pieces, I turn up the music and let the  glass fly. Tadashi watched me make a couple of pieces last night, and he said it looked like I was painting with frit. It's a very free and fluid style. I think the major difficulty I am having with the new pieces is that I am trying to be as free and fluid when I create them, but I have to carefully weigh the glass I use and balance them to make sure they'll float in the steel, moving freely.Okay, time for posting is up, and I need to head to the studio to wrangle two new employees in their first solo flights (Linda is in for Judy who has the day off, and Fawn is teaching her first kiln-forming date). Pics and more tomorrow--time permitting."},
{"title": "Friends", "date": "Sunday, February 05, 2012", "text": "I wasn't going to write about what a horrible week I had last week because I looked at it as focusing on the negative and the past instead of looking to the future. But I realized this morning (as I read Dee's comment on the post from yesterday) that I would be leaving behind a couple of pretty important things that deserve acknowledgement, and, in one case, thanks. The first and most important of those is the passing of Ernie Monstrocat.Last weekend it looked like he had a cold so we took him to the vet on Monday. The diagnosis was a sinus infection transmitted from his mouth. They gave him liquid antibiotics and a pill-form decongestant, and said he should probably have his teeth cleaned the following Monday. Because of his advanced age, they did some lab work to see if he could tolerate the general anesthetic for the cleaning, and promised to call with the results on Tuesday.When they called Tuesday it was with the information that the lab results revealed he had incurable, advanced kidney disease. They recommended we bring him in for a few days of hospitalization with IV fluids to flush out his kidneys so that he might be able to feel better and live a bit longer. I was very nervous when I took him in Tuesday because we had already been through a month-long hospitalization with Jester that ended with putting him to sleep and horrible guilt for having put him through it all on the first place. So before leaving Ernie to several days in a cage, needles and strangers, I asked to speak to our regular vet--who had not seen Ernie the previous day.She did a physical exam and was concerned at the 6-lb weight loss in conjunction with the kidney disease and sinus infection. She looked at his teeth and said they weren't as bad as she would have expected given the sinuses. She recommended taking a couple of x-rays before going through the IV fluids and hospitalization route because if he had another more serious issue--large, cancerous masses hidden by his still substantial bulk, e.g.--then putting him through the IV fluids and hospital stay would probably not be the best choice for him. The x-rays did not reveal any large masses, instead they showed a complete lack of right hip joint and areas on his spine and ribs that looked like bone cancer. The kidneys and liver also both looked abnormal, and everything together led our vet to believe metastatic bone cancer and nothing to be done but let him go. And the world crashed to a halt. It was only Tuesday afternoon. Dave was having a very stressful time with his work, Jessie was dealing with serious issues at school, and Mom was coping with the one-year anniversary of my Dad's death. I had already had to deal with the Siyeh Glass website being hacked and shut down by our ISP--right as we had new classes listed and a newsletter to get out, the hard drive on my laptop becoming corrupt and needing repaired (with no back-up of the 483 gigs of data on it), and the glass furnace going out in the hotshop with multiple failure points (not just elements or relays or thermocouple, but ALL of them) necessitating in canceling the Sunday glass dates in the studio. In a larger context, it was two weeks before the Buyer's Market show in Philadelphia where I have not one but TWO booths to fill with work (as yet undone), and also two weeks before the first 30 pages of my book (as yet unwritten) are due. And that's all I'm going to write about the trials of the week. Everyone in the house was having to deal with their own bad crap at the same time I was buried in the poop so it was REALLY lousy for all of us.Now on to the thanks. On Monday I posted on Facebook how horribly the week was going and stated that I needed chocolate. There were many, many notes of encouragement and support (and one even contained a virtual chocolate cake!), and I was comforted. But my friends went even farther than that. The next afternoon--within an hour of putting Ernie to sleep and before anyone knew about his passing--Becky the Bookkeeper showed up at the studio with a bottle of wine and a couple of big Scharffen Berger chocolate bars and she also brought in a basket from Morganica that had just been delivered. I cannot adequately describe how very cherished and loved I felt at that moment as I sat crying over Ernie and in despair of the week.That night when I got home I nibbled on caramel corn, Godiva chocolate, honey roasted peanuts, and white chocolate lime cookies accompanied by a lovely Malbec--all before dinner. And I raised a glass to Ernie and to friends. We'll get through somehow."},
{"title": "A Week", "date": "Saturday, February 04, 2012", "text": "It's Saturday morning--at least for another hour--and an incredibly horrible week looks to be behind me. Instead of re-hashing it here, I am am going to take this time to look ahead at what's coming up in the next couple of weeks. The agenda is scary, but doable. I hope. Getting all the work done for the Buyer's Market is the top line item, closely followed by writing 30 pages of the book. I don't foresee any problem doing the work, but the writing is a bit scary. I should also get the Siyeh Studio and FeSiO websites up, the work photographed, a postcard mailing put together, and a host of other promotional tasks done. At this point they all appear to be beyond a stretch goal, which is not good as doing a show without promoting  it--especially the new FeSiO work--risks throwing a lot of money down the toilet. However, right now it's a choice between money and time, and the money I will make from orders at the show exists as potential (a bird in the bush) and the time I have to prepare for the show (and accomplish everything else I have scheduled) has an exact, small quantity (the bird that pooped in my hand). Today I need to take apart the pressure pot for my sandblast cabinet, figure out why it isn't working well, and rebuild it. I also need to make a list of the pieces I want to take to the show of my current work, and fire a couple of pieces of the new work. Finally, need to try to sandblast some steel from Bill to see how I like the look for a new wall piece. Tomorrow is for writing. Wish me luck."},
{"title": "Wee Small Hours, More Than Wee Anxiety", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "text": "The world is silent and dark at 5:00 am, with only a little orange light from the early morning fog-haloed street lights shining in the living room windows. Baxter and Ernie greet me drowsily from their beds next to each other on the floor, and, after I nestle into the recliner with an afghan to keep me warm against the winter morning chill, Ernie climbs into my lap (displacing my laptop as only a 20-lb cat can do). His purr and the refrigerator's intermittent rattling provide the music in the otherwise slumbering house. Why am I awake? Oh let me count the ways...The Buyer's Market is three weeks away and I have not even begun the piece-list for the work I am taking for my primary booth. I say primary booth as, over-achiever that I am, I have two booths this year--a 10X10 and a 10X20. The 10X20 is for my current work in Morceaux de Verre, Todd's wire work with my glass, some small studio blown pieces, maybe the roll-ups, and my current line of pieces in steel stands from Black Cat (Bill and Elaine). I have been playing in my head with an idea for a new colorway, but I haven't progressed any further on it. The other 10X10 is a completely new direction in collaborative work with Black Cat: Kinetic glass and metal sculpture. The glass is a new thicker, cast design that is much more subtle and requires extensive cold-working (polishing, sandblast carving and etching). I have been working on those pieces, but am still (of course) behind.Beyond creating the pieces for the Buyer's Market, I need to do all the marketing and support materials work. I still don't have the website for Siyeh Studio back up since it got hacked two (three?) years ago. I need a website for the new work (debuting under the name FeSiO--fay-zee-oh--a union of steel and glass) and I need photos and advertising (a pre-show mailing) for both. Need, need, need, it's all about need.The manuscript for Book Deux is due May 1, though my editor has kindly offered me an extension to June 1. You might think the book could be finished any time, but as with other forms of entertainment, there are very precise seasons for new releases. Think of the summer block-buster movies. They aren't the March blockbusters. A studio saves the best of a certain genre of films (My Dinner With Andre would not be an example of such a film) for release starting Memorial Day weekend and going through the 4th of July. Likewise, spring is the best publishing season for how-to books, and, with a May release, I am already at the tail end of it. Note that I am talking about a May 2013 release if I turn in the completed manuscript by May 1, 2012.Finally, I have a retail and teaching studio that continues expanding daily. Yesterday I officially hired two new staff members--Fawn Lowery and Linda Queen. Both have glass backgrounds, and both are uber-excited about working in a glass studio. Fawn will be teaching some of the Intro to Kiln-Forming classes on Sundays (expanded the hours again this year) and Linda is the second studio elf. Judy will be out for several weeks this spring, and Linda will be filling in for her. She will also take over management of the retail side of the house--cutting glass, managing inventory, supervising open studio, etc. Though I am *thrilled* to have new people long-term, short-term I have a whole lotta paperwork, electronic access and permissions to set-up.Even with the new help there are responsibilities which are solely mine. The on-line class sign-up is not done. The new class descriptions are not on the website (for classes being offered February 4-5), I still don't have a retail POS system and the paper receipt books we have been using in lieu of computerized POS are just not adequate. If I didn't have enough to do, the February newsletter needs to go out by the end of the weekend.The frosting on the cake of incompletes is tied, somewhat ironically, to Becky who does my books as best I let her (somewhat ironically as she makes incredible cakes too). I have 2011 business administration including W-2's, 1099's, sales tax, corporate tax annual filing, business license filing, income tax prep, and annual inventory all to get done by the end of the month--and I haven't even mailed in my payroll tax forms yet from earlier this month! I would also like a wee small idea of how I did last year that would come from up-to-date bookkeeping, but, honestly, who has time? Clearly not me as I haven't even been good at blogging recently!"},

Jessie and her girl scout troop, along with several other local troops, are preparing sandwiches for 400 Decatur volunteers who are rehabbing residences for the elderly today. I am writing today, and doing a little bookkeeping (ugh).Saturday morning was my first class of the new year in the new classroom space and it was AWESOME (to borrow J's favorite word). The participants all had a good time--and stayed an extra hour working on their pieces (very detailed first works). It was the first Intro to Kiln-forming 1 class and though I did end up talking a bit more about the science of the process than I had planned, it went well.I am still putzing around with my cold so I am drinking lots of hot water and hot herb tea and getting plenty of rest. I have great hopes that it will be gone by the weekend if I continue to take care of myself. Once I am physically 100%, it's time to jump on the BMAC work. I have about 30 new pieces to do in the new style--kiln-cast, heavily cold-worked (ground, polished, sandblast etched, some pieces also carved and/or engraved. I designed these pieces under the assumption that there is truth in the title of Johnathon Schmuck's book \"The Joy Of Coldworking\". Now we shall see if I am right, or I am dead."},
{"title": "A Full Life", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2012", "text": "Nothing to sip as I post, the sound of J taking a shower and the wind gusting outside for my nighttime music. The day started with a drive to Commerce to meet Bill and Elaine to finalize our new designs for the Buyer's Market show. I left at 7:40 this morning and got back just after 3:00 pm. The rest of the day in the studio was spent pulling, packing and shipping a supplies order for a new KGRC customer in Ohio, talking to Amy at Bullseye, and... And that's about it! It amazes me how little I can get done in so much time anymore.Dave also left at dawn's first light this morning for a meeting in Alpharetta and he didn't get home till a little after 9:00--stopping at Publix to get fresh lettuce and carrots for the bunnies on his way home. I did the dinner, cello and homework thing. Mom took J to school and picked her up today and let the cleaning people in. Why, you might ask am I listing a whole bunch of non-glass things that made up today in my post on Glass Incarnate? I list them because more and more I am woven into the web of life and can no longer separate--not only the strands of work and home, but also the strands of me and the others in my household. We seem to be all becoming one entity with intertwining yet not necessarily complementary strands of needing and doing. Right now I am having a hard time even remembering what it felt like before Dave and Jessie and a house and a business. Back then I had a job and a condo (with an on-property maintenance man). I ate whatever I ate wherever I was when I was ready to eat, and it was just me--or maybe me and my bird or me and my dog and my bird. When I had a project to do,  I immersed myself for days on end during every non-working, waking hour. I could focus and power through massive projects in short amounts of time. Now it's seems to take all my time just to live a normal day. Face time with every member of my household on a daily basis is very important to everyone's (mine included) well-being and happiness. Time for hugs, time for snuggles, time to teach a little piano, play a little Race for the Galaxy, watch an old episode of The Greatest American Hero, play with the bunnies--all this time is no longer optional: It's life, it's now, it's every day, and it takes time--a surprising lot of time.Am I whining? Complaining? Wishing things were different? Not a bit, well, not much. Sometimes I do look back on the Other Life with nostalgia, but it's nostalgia like you get for the 50's watching Happy Days (I think Dave just went \"Nyah!\" and stuck a fork in his eye--not a fan of Happy Days is our Dave.) The 50's weren't really like that--nor was high school (my turn for a Nyah! moment). Nor, if I am honest, was my earlier, simpler life. Simpler lives are for lesser women.*(*Though I would like to end the post on that seemingly infinitely wise pronouncement, I have to give credit where credit is due: The original phrase is \"Simpler wives are for lesser husbands\", said by my spouse about me. :-)"},

I allowed myself a glass of wine (or two) tonight as my cold is *finally* on the downswing. No, I didn't go to the doctor. It was a cold. Horrible, but a cold. No fever. I am done talking about the cold.Today was the first day of my jewelry-making class and I was reminded both of why I like to take classes, and why I would rather learn from a book. I like taking classes in a well-equipped space because they have all the best tools. I like taking classes because the instructor always gives cool little tips that only come after a bezillion times of doing something. I like learning from books as the content covered in the first three-hour class is what I would do in the first 20 minutes on my own. Though I am very excited about my class, we spent today introducing ourselves, going over the syllabus, learning to light the torch, learning to move the torch back and forth with one hand while picking up small objects in tweezers with the other, and, finally, moving the flame back and forth over the metal at a consistent height for a minute and then quenching the metal in water at the end. Total time on torch/task: 10 minutes. I am not criticizing the instructor, the syllabus, ANYTHING. It is a reality of life that a class situation must move at the pace of the slowest possible participant, and, on the first day, the instructor has to assume we're ALL the slowest possible person.What I most got out of the class--and it was so appropriate for my current overwhelming life topic of the book that it looks like I made it up--is the incredible, invisible potential overlap between disciplines in tools, materials and techniques. Because each discipline uses its own esoteric lexicon, the potential for cross-discipline usage is often overlooked. For example, my instructor in class today was surprised to hear that the company that makes chemicals for use on copper jewelry (JAX) also makes a copper patina for the stained glass industry. Is it usable on jewelry too? Interesting question. Maybe other jewelers are familiar with it, but she was not.And speaking of the book, I stopped at Daven's today to pick up several ceramic tools and chemicals that I want to try using with glass. The experiments begin tomorrow! I might even get to making the traganth-gum pastels.... Oooh!!!!"},

The Year in Review and Upcoming Year posts  always take a lot of time, but I want them to be linked to the day of Intent to Publish rather than the day of publication. I know it's confusing but try to keep up--and I hope to have the Upcoming Year post up tomorrow.Yesterday it warmed up a little, and my cold seemed to be going away. The day started with getting Char off to the vet to be tutored, and then driving on down the road for the first KGRC meeting of the year with Lori and Judy. We reviewed the business process, partnership and class information Gail and Stacey at Wired Designs in San Antonio shared with us over three days in December. (I was only there for a short day, but Lori stayed at Gail's house, and Gail and Stacey both opened their brains and their business model to her.) We put together some classes, talked a bit about how we're going to work on the book (Lori has volunteered to work on the projects and techniques sections with me), and talked loosely of our goals for the upcoming year.When we got back to the studio, I was overjoyed to find the first egg from one of our chickens--go Tuxedo! It was small and white (and looked a little pitiful nestled in among the big, brown organic ones we've been getting from Publix), but Jessie was happy to have it for breakfast this morning. Char finished surgery early and could come, and it looked like the day couldn't get better. I was right. It couldn't. (Though the first interactions of Char with his progeny were very cute--they went right up to him, groomed him, and snuggled in to take a nap!)Round about 6:00 pm my cold swooped back with a vengeance, and it has been so bad--coughing, sore throat, congestion, head ache and fatigue--that I finally had to cancel my meeting in Commerce with Bill and Elaine set for this morning to go over the progress we've made on our new designs for the February BMAC. I rescheduled for Monday, which means I have to reschedule Dee from Monday to Wednesday--if she's available--to work on stenciling for her new show work and some book projects too. Tuesday is the first day of the jewelry-making class I'm taking up at Spruill.This morning I finally dragged myself out of bed about 9:18 (really), and Mom (who is as sick as I am) and I toddled off to the studio to clean up after my Christmas project (a present for Mom) of a custom-stenciled-acid-etched-hand-dyed-velvet fabric sewn into a three-piece outfit. I am still in midst of the acid-etching part. Never one to try something for the first time in a reasonable size like, say, a SCARF, I seriously underestimated the amount of time it would take to stencil and acid-etch four yards of 45\" wide fabric. Ah well, live and learn! I had hoped to finish the etching today so I could permanently remove it from the worktable in the classroom in order to be ready for my kiln-forming glass date this afternoon at 4:30. But given how I don't have the energy to be on my feet for more than 10 minutes at a time, I think I am going to have to just clean it up and put it back out another day. *sigh*"},

True, it's only been four days, but I have been drinking lots of hot tea, getting plenty of rest, taking supplements, yadda, yadda, yah. And I'm sicker today that I was yesterday. I'm about ready to go home and snuggle under the down comforter for a nap!Okay, grumbling out of the way, on to GLASS. Today is the first day the studio is open this year, and the first week with our New Hours! On the one hand, I feel like we change our business hours like we change our shoes. On the other, I see it as flexible adaptation in the face of changing needs. The current change--opening Sundays again--is in response to the addition of better classroom/open studio space, Studio Elf availability, and hiring another kiln-forming instructor/open studio monitor.We have several other changes taking effect today too, but I've decided not to re-list them here. You're going to have to check out the newsletter article on the front page of the website to see them."},

What a surprise as I am in thejurors’ room waiting to see if I am called for jury service.Dekalb county has a lovely room for their jurors to wait. The seats aremovie-theatre comfy, there are restrooms, vending machines, and frequentbreaks. After being processed in at 8:15 (it took about 10 minutes to getthrough security, register, and get my badge), we heard a nice little speech from one of the judges on the importance of performing one’s jury service. Thenwe settled in to watch a 30 minute movie of interviews of Georgia SuperiorCourt judges talking about what they do, what they like, don’t like, and want the public toknow about their jobs, and why they chose to become judges. It was well-done, thoughtful and interesting—anddefinitely livened up by the prospective jurors seated around me.Before the movie we were told to turn our cell phonesoff, so of course the cell phone of the man sitting diagonally behind me rang a couple ofminutes into the movie. Not surprising, something so common—thoughimpolite—that I wouldn’t even mention it but for the fact that instead ofturning it off, he answered it! When everyone around him (including me) turnedand glared at him in astonishment, he said helplessly that he didn’t know how to turn it off.The woman next to him took it from him, passed it to the man behind him, and thatman supposedly turned it off. Then we all went back to the movie. Not too muchlater the man seated next to the man with cell phone—directly behind me—startedto snore. At first it was just little snortles—and we all turned to look at himand then at each other, eyebrows raised and bemused grins on our faces—but then he really began to rumble long andloud. Finally when others in the room of 390 people started moving restlessly in protest, the man with the cell phone and the woman who grabbed his phonesimultaneously jabbed the snoring man to wakefulness. He grumbled at them to \"get off of me\",and settled back into his seat. I grinned and whispered to him that he had beensnoring, and he replied that he’d had to get up at 4:00 am to make it in forhis service. I commiserated, and we all settled back in to watch the movie. Notfive minutes passed before the man next to him’s phone rang again! I couldn’thelp but laugh at this real slice of jury duty.After the movie a few people were called to go up to thecourtrooms, and the rest of us were given a 20-minute break—and encouragedmore than once to go to Chick-Fil-A across the street (but not McDonald’s asthey are really slow there and we would surely be late getting back). I usedthe opportunity to move from my comfy/funny place to a one of the fourworkstations with little desks and power strips in the room and now I amsettled in till I get called or go to lunch. We get lunch for two hours from12:00-2:00 and I am going to try to meet up with Dave. Then we are back in the room waiting to be called for selection pool until 4:00. If I getpicked for a jury, I will be on jury duty till then end of thetrial—surprisingly, not an unwelcome prospect. I am actually quite looking forward to theexperience. If I don’t get picked today, my service ends today. Deciding who gets called up to a courtroom as one of the 20-50people in the pool for a single trial is done by randomly drawing the juror’snames—it isn’t linked to your juror number. I was kind of hoping it was, as I amjuror #1 and would have been sent up to be chosen early. The group that was justcalled was called for a trial starting at 1:00 and they were told that theycould leave and go home till then if they wanted, but they were abjured not tofall asleep as the court would then have to send the deputy to get them, andeveryone else would have to wait, and it “it would just be a big ‘ole mess”. Oooh, this is so much fun!"},
{"title": "The End...", "date": "Saturday, December 31, 2011", "text": "It's time for the year in review at Siyeh Glass. What were the highlights and lowlights of 2011? In preparation for writing about what we did do, I thought I'd start by looking at what I hoped/planned to do to see what was accomplished and what fell by the wayside. The post from 1/1/11 was very helpful for prodding my memory. Following its format, here is a brief summary of 2011:I wanted a new glass furnace, and we got one in January giving us a full-time and a back-up furnace for blowing. Even with the back-up we still had a few down times in the hotshop, but I feel that we ended 2011 *much* more reliably than we did 2010. Didn't get any new electrical service--nor did we add casting kilns, another annealer, or another gloryhole. Guess I was a bit too enthusiastic about equipment last year.2) Facilities: On the other hand, we did really well facilities-wise. I had hoped to add 1-3 more spaces, and we hit that one out of the park--we even have a new space that we aren't using yet! I had thought to screen in the back deck and put the kilns out there, instead, I got a whole new finished room there. We also built the second large outdoor facility--280 sq feet like the hotshop with its own little back deck. Right now it's being used for extra storage, but someday--maybe this year--it'll be a new classroom. We also bumped out the coldworking room and added enough room to it to comfortably house Licha's lathe--on long-term loan to us right now. And the front classroom became a full-time torchwork classroom with a built-in ventilation hood and fan. Never did do anything with the front porch, and don't think I will this year either.3) Techniques: Casting, moldmaking and lost wax techniques have all been on the studio schedule since the 2009 BeCon when I took Linda Ethier's wonderful week-long workshop out in Portland. Unfortunately, adding this piece to the studio has been my biggest unfulfilled wish/failed endeavor.4) Professional Development/Personal Work: At the end of 2010, I pinned a lot of personal growth on my time at BeCon and doing pre- and post-conference workshops there. Life intruded, and I was only able to do the conference and the pre-conference workshop with Steve Brown on manual 3-D printing--and that time was squeezed between other professional and personal demands. It, however, was a phenomenal workshop and I left extremely inspired to continue work in that technique. I haven't managed yet, but I have high hopes that progress will not go the way of the do-do bird and casting.5) Process Development: I hang my head in shame. I took baby steps on the Siyeh Glass website, didn't get anywhere on the Siyeh Studio website OR a POS system for the retail business OR on an accounting workflow that works. My books are almost as bad now as they were at the end of 2009--in spite of Becky's best efforts to whip me into shape.6) Staff:  It was a bittersweet year for studio staff. We were successful in recruiting two more glassblowers--Tadashi Torii and Domenick Peronti--onto our staff, and we are thrilled to have them. They bring new skills and energy to our program, and we were able--with their help--to refine our blowing schedule to be more efficient and economical. At the end of the summer, we also said goodbye to our founding glass blowing instructor, Lee Ritchie. Lee built our program to where its popularity necessitated the changes in its structure, and we thank him for two years of hard work and devotion to our studio.7) Book 2:  Ah, Book 2. I signed a contract with the publisher at the end of October for a 240-page tradepaper book of advanced techniques and studio best practices. The publisher is very excited about the book. I am very excited about the book, and the manuscript is due May 1. Wheeeee!So that's what we planned to do and did or did not. What came up during the year that was unexpected? I look back on 2011 as the year of personal adversity and eventual personal triumph. My father died last January, my mother moved in with us, and I spent a lot of the rest of the year rebuilding connections with and making time for members of my extended family. Family and a healthy balance between family and work are crucial to my happiness. I am glad that, at then end of a difficult year, I have a better feel for what I need to do and how I need to integrate it all together. More about what that means in the next post on 2012.Following the theme of Life, we added a chicken coop, bunny hutch and a chicken/bunny play yard connecting them behind the new outdoor classroom. Initial population was one rabbit (Jasmine). Then she was joined by another Montana bunny, Charcoal. Then seven chickens, then two more chickens. We ended the year with five baby bunnies joining the family as (oops) our second rabbit was NOT a girl.We also added to our vendor relationships during the year by becoming a Delphi Elite Dealer and and Olympic Kilns dealer. We look forward to growing all of our vendor relationships more in the coming year."},
{"title": "Socializin' and a Scattered Post", "date": "Thursday, December 29, 2011", "text": "Sitting at Kavarna sipping a medium Dancing Goats coffee with 1/2 'n' 1/2, and can't hear the music because the place is packed with chattering people. So far I have not even read my email as I keep seeing and stopping to catch up with so many friends I haven't seen in awhile. On this Thursday of the winter break (I am totally driven by the school and holiday schedule), it seems the most natural thing in the world to make time to look friends in the eye and casually chat with them--work be damned. But, finally,  the tide of friends has rolled out the door, and I'm ready to buckle down (knuckle down?) and work on The Book. I never did get the huge surge of energy I was expecting to offset the extreme lethargy of the week's beginning, but at least I'm on keel again and moving forward more than sluggishly.So it's December 29th. There are only two more days left in this month and this year. Why does that fact carry so much weight? I understand the hard stop in time for the fiscal year end, but there's more to it than merely a money break (after all, it's not like I could go out and buy something, give something, do something that would make an appreciable difference in my bottom line at this point). I feel a need to either get a whole bunch of stuff done (not too likely) or wipe off the to-do list and start fresh next week/next year with nothing carried over. Sadly that last option is not too likely either. I guess I need to resign myself to seeing time as a flowing constant without the human-imposed, non-real-deadline-oriented/purely temporal breaks.But we're programmed to see these invisible breaks! We eat and drink to excess at the end of *every* year, and we commence dieting and exercising at the beginning of every one. Sure, we sometimes start the diet and exercise thingies at other times of the year, but they are usually more event-driven--need to wear a swimsuit in public, attend a wedding, go on vacation, whatever. I can't think of a single other time of the year where we do something solely because it's a certain day of a certain month, and the time of year has no connection to the earth or seasons or anything else. Some people do things on certain days for religious reasons, but that seems more proscribed than ingrained in any case. But enough about why I am compelled to break time into these completely unnatural segments. Why ever I do it, I do it. Time to move on.What did I really do this past year, and what am I hoping to accomplish next year? Those are both questions big enough to deserve their own posts, so I have broken them out and will publish them tomorrow and Saturday. The rest of this post will zoom back in on the little things that any normal, not-the-end-of-the-year week would bring.When you get going in ninety different directions (as I am occasionally wont to do), things will inevitably fall through the cracks. Two weeks ago, the day after I got back from my trip to Austin, what fell through the cracks was remembering I had been called for jury duty. The State of Georgia Superior Court of the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit was NOT amused. I got a letter last week that included the words \"contempt\", \"fine\" and \"jail sentence\". I called them today abjectly sorry and am rescheduled for January 3. Dekalb county has a system whereby you can call the night before you are scheduled to appear to see if your block of juror numbers is needed. Given that I am juror #1 for my day, I am pretty sure I will be called. They probably save the first block of numbers for people who previously didn't show up--the way an airline will save the first block of seats on the plane for special people. It's good to be special. :-)I was hoping to have the monthly KGRC meeting on Wednesday January 4th to finalize plans for our next quarter, but I have a strong, sneaking suspicion that I am going to be chosen for jury duty, and it is going to tie me up for awhile. I hope not more than a week as I start a jewelry-making class on January 10th at 10:00 am for which the first class is mandatory... Nope. Not going to borrow trouble. Things will unfold as they are meant to do.And that's enough of a post for today. Happy Merry everyone!"},

I have been sleeping-in late, reading trashy novels, munching on snack food, cuddling with my family, playing games, visiting with friends, and watching movies--ignoring everything I still have piling up on my plate to do. There are Christmas presents to finish and ship, orders to do and ship, a book to get cracking on, and all the other studio year-end cleaning/organizing/inventory/marketing tasks to complete. I thought I would start the new year fresh and ready, but right now it looks like I will ring it in with a bunch of last year's baggage still attached. I WANT A FRESH SLATE, but I seem unable to compile the energy necessary to make it happen. *sigh*It's almost noon on Tuesday and I have yet to do anything this week but whinge and apathetically think about doing something. Yesterday I told myself that you have to listen to your body and honor the message it sends to you. If it says really loudly that you have to take A DAY OFF, you should do it. I consoled myself with the conviction that today would bring renewed energy and focus, and I would work better for the break. Nope, not happening. I have read and written email (one message), listened to and answered voicemail (one message), begun this post, and sighed a lot. What will the afternoon bring, I lethargically wonder? Maybe a nap..."},
{"title": "Welcome to the Future", "date": "Friday, December 23, 2011", "text": "Today I installed and configured a new software application called “Dragon Dictate” to help me work hands-free.  This post is my first attempt at using it, and I think I'm going to like being able to write while drinking my coffee and holding the mug with both hands. Not that I'm holding a coffee mug right now as it's after 10:00 in the evening, but it's the thought that counts. Ahhhh, no more hunting and pecking at the keyboard, all I have to do is think it, say it and, voilà! (Wow Dragon Dictate even put in the accent correctly!) If I can't get the book done by May 1st with all this technology at my fingertips, I'm completely hopeless. I've never dictated to anyone before, so it's very odd to have to say the words for punctuation. But this program seems to be remarkably accurate at processing what I'm saying and turning it into words, sentences, and paragraphs. One thing I don't have to worry about anymore is spell check! I don't even need to say a sentence smoothly and elegantly. It can come out jerky and hesitant, and, by the time it's translated into text, it flows beautifully. Of course without looking at the words as I type them--and being limited by the speed at which I type--I have a feeling it will be much easier to come across as a blithering idiot when my posts can come out of my mouth and onto the paper without being checked by my fingers. Clearly I will still need to review what I've written and edit it for clarity and meaning. (I wonder if I can get it to attach photos for me without having to use my hands?)Tomorrow is the last day the studio is open in 2011. If I weren't rushing so much to get ready for Christmas, I would think it a good time to do a Year in Review. However, I still have look worse to decant and process… Oh dear, not “look worse” but “liqueurs”. And there is a big project on the loom, another on the knitting needles, and yet a third textile project on the classroom table in the studio. All are Christmas presents, and none will be ready for Christmas Day. Good thing my family knows me! (Jessie said “wow” as she watched me finish up this post verbally.)Next week, Dragon Dictate firmly mastered, the book begins in earnest."},
{"title": "Somewhat Derailed", "date": "Monday, December 19, 2011", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans mug, Rolling In the Deep by Adele on iTunes, Brian on the phone giving me the information on the stencil material for the vinyl plotter the studio is leasing starting today. I love me more equipment! Brian is also bringing an old Windows computer to run the plotter software (and it will also print to the old laser printer Dee lent me to do the fusible photo paper designs). With this bonanza of really old equipment, we will be able to create computer-generated/plotter-cut stencils for sandblasting, airbrushing and silk screening AND we can make our own fusible decals for glass. Wheee! New classes ahoy.I missed posting a couple of days last week due to complete and utter studio chaos and madness. Never being one to let grass grow beneath my feet, I scheduled the swapping out of the kiln-forming classroom with my workroom for Friday--knowing that I had two full classes to teach on Saturday (over full--12 in one, 6 in the other) so it would have to be done. Dan the Wunder Carpenter came and moved the frit-storage wall units and cut them down to fit their new location. Dee and hubby Arno came to play Igor and schlep stuff from room to room. Even Becky the Bookkeeper pitched in and moved things after my books fried her brain. We didn't get everything moved on Friday--there is still 2800 lbs of frit and the three steel racks that holds it all to go. However the classes went great on Saturday, and I have to admit that the big yellow room is a *much* better classroom. Thanks to Lori for prodding me into finally giving it up._________________________________________________I wrote the preceding text yesterday  and got completely derailed before I could finish it. This morning it's coffee in the Atlanta skyline mug, the happy sounds of Baxter munching on a squeaky toy for background music. The new old equipment is installed and working (modulo the last driver for the printer). Dee, Arno and Brian are all coming back to the studio today to work on various pieces, and I may also put through a vitrigraph run. Brian is coming to work on the large-scale design we started yesterday--for a Christmas present for my Mom, not for new work. Dee is coming to learn that technique, help with printing the decal again so I can fire that new work for the Buyer's Market (and for a book project), continue moving the remaining 1800 lbs of frit and powder to my new workroom, and maybe pull some vitrigraph. Arno is coming to play Igor again.So how did I get derailed yesterday, you might ask. Well first it was everyone showing up to work, then it was the arrival of baby bunnies! Dee, Brian and I were heading out for a quick lunch and as we passed the chicken/bunny play yard, we noticed Jasmine with a a small pink/grey object. Sadly it was a dead baby and I was afraid we were having a repeat of the last bunny birth (two dead, no living). However it seems that that one was stillborn, and there were five squirming, snuffling ones in the nest Jasmine lined with chicken feathers and rabbit fur (mother rabbits pull out their own fur to make a nest). I relocated mother and babies to a smaller rabbit cage in the house, and the babies into a cardboard box lined with a towel and Jasmine's next for a nest box. It's December and though some days are warm, some days are really cold and hard on naked little bunnies. Everyone seems to be doing fine today.Now I'm going to get this post up before anything else happens to delay me yet again..."},

Today is the day of the big studio room swap--my workroom for the teaching classroom--and it's also Jessie's last day of school before the winter break. There is a school assembly at 11:30--which I must attend--and I have scheduled two people and a volunteer in the studio to help with the move this morning starting at 9:30. Somehow I don't think we're going to get everything done by 11:30, and I am going to have to leave them for a bit while I run to school. I hate dividing my energy, and I feel guilty leaving others working while I am gone. Unfortunately, my schedule for the next four and a half months doesn't really have any holes in it. In addition, tomorrow I teach two over-full classes and so need to have the move completed before then.On a more-glass-less-business topic, I have been working on a new series this week and the final step--which came out of the kiln this morning--failed. *sigh* Back to the drawing board. I am trying to use the photo fusing paper to make my own laser-printed image to fuse on one of my pieces, and for whatever reason, the image burned off completely in the firing. There are many ways I deviated from the instructions so it might be to be difficult to isolate the cause of the failure. I am not sure if the toner my laser cartridge uses has enough iron in it. I didn't put the transfer on a flat piece of glass so I wasn't able to squeegee it down as much as is called for in the instructions. I didn't dry the transfer over night on the glass--I fired it for an hour at 100 degrees before ramping the rest of the way up.I hope the problem was low iron as Dee brought down her laser printer that she has successfully used with this technique and transfer material, and we are going to try it today."},
{"title": "Social Media", "date": "Thursday, December 15, 2011", "text": "Though it took me till now to post, I spent the first several hours of the day on the computer working on integrating social media into Siyeh Glass. I have finally succumbed to Twitter (Really, you say? Sadly, yes.) I have finally determined an honest-to-biscuit use for it (for me). You see, first thing this morning I thought it would be good to put out into the world a reminder that there is still time to create a blown glass ornament at the studio before Christmas. I thought of putting it on Facebook, and while that would work, it doesn't seem the most elegant and appropriate use of the magical Internet. I almost like having Facebook as more of a place for images, lead paragraphs for the blog (go there and read it), and a place for other people to leave comments. The blog, this thing I do here, is obviously much more verbose than anything I can (or should) do in either Facebook or Twitter. I didn't even realize until today that I had a need for a different place for quick little pushes of data. And yet...I can see really having some fun with Twitter if I can get some local followers. It would be cool to use it for little teasers like: 50% off ALL glass and supplies today from 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm--reference TWIT1 (76 characters), and New class schedule up, register for a class today, and get another class (same or lesser value) FOR FREE!--reference TWIT2 (122 characters).But of course getting to the point where it will be fun is like going from being pregnant to having a 10 year-old. Ten is a great age, but it's preceded by morning sickness, waddling like a manatee on legs, childbirth, night feedings/no sleep, potty training, the terrible 2's (and 3's), etc. Today it took what felt like forever to get a \"follow us on Twitter\" link up on the website, and a link to our Facebook page. I wanted a Like button for Facebook that would link to Siyeh Glass, but I was never able to get one working so I settled with a Facebook \"badge\" and if people click on it they can \"like\" us from there.Now I need to get some followers for Twitter. I can see ways of speeding that up, but they require yet more effort (effort already allocated to The Book Deux). But if I WERE to try to get followers, I might put something like the following here (on the blog), on the website, and on Facebook: First 20 people to follow us on Twitter automatically signed up for a drawing for a free class, first 50 people to follow us automatically in a drawing for 50% off total purchase, first 100 people in a drawing for one of ten 25% off total purchase coupons. Or would it be better to save the big things (like a free class) for the masses and give it after the first 100 people have signed up. Maybe giving away something guaranteed but small to the first five, something a little bigger but not guaranteed--but still with good odds--to the first 15, etc. Here is where the small business owner needs a degree in marketing (or maybe statistics would help--though Dave laughed when I said that to him and assured me I needed marketing).And Twitter and Facebook are just the start. Now there's also Google + and who knows what else--all of which have to be integrated into Joomla and each other. *Groan*. As if being a small business owner wasn't complicated enough already!"},

I will blog until I am done blogging, and then move on with 100% focus to another task.Coming to Austin with Dave while he works is the best thing for professional me. Austin removes me completely from all of the other things and people at home who would distract me during the day.

Here there are no children with playdates or cello lessons, no chickens, no dogs, no cat, no pond, no rabbits, no studio, no classes, no dates, no house (with all of it's daily maintenance issues) to distract me and pull me off task.

Wired Designs is one of (if not the) first Bullseye Kiln Glass Resource Centers, and Gail and her partner Stacey Campbell are consummate businesswomen who have weathered the current economic downturn with poise and aplomb. As I prepare for the next stage of my business, I am very grateful for the insights Gail provided me into their business and what works/doesn't work for them, and I am looking forward to incorporating some of them into my plans for next year.

It's now after lunch (wonderful bun at Mekong River), and I have parked myself at BD Riley's to work the afternoon away. I have a shot of Knob Creek, a pint of Woodchuck cider, and the lovely guitar strummings of Josh Allen as my background music. Oh I miss Austin! Dave's office is around the corner, the Hideout is a block away and Mekong River is across the street--a greater sensory work/playground could not be found.I finished the morning at the Hideout by registering for Beginning Jewelry and Metalsmithing at Spruill Center for the Arts starting January 10 (and then getting Lori to join me). Then I talked to Dee about helping me put together some classes in copper and bronze clay. I've dabbled in silver clay, but never went farther than that. Dee has worked with the copper clay (and has all the tools necessary for firing it--steel tray, charcoal to prevent firescale, etc.,). When we first started offering beadmaking I had the idea that it would be nice to also sell findings so that the class participants could take their beads and turn them into jewelry when they picked up their beads, but it was the discussion with Gail yesterday that really has me ready to expand our class and materials offerings to include metals and jewelry too. So I updated the studio website today promising new classes, and... wheeeeee!Lori also gave me a suggestion yesterday that I'm going to have to put my big girl panties on and do--even though it's going to break my heart. The nicest room in the studio--by far--is my workroom. The kiln-forming classroom is the newest, smallest, and most... challenged room. For a variety of reasons, it only makes sense that I swap out those rooms. The benefits for me will be that I will be next to the kilnroom and I can close the door to the rest of the studio. The downsides are the sloping floor, the extreme temperature fluctuations and the noisy ceiling fan (all things I should have to put up with rather than the students in any case). I also *love* my workroom with it's west-facing windows, varnished southern pine floor, and beautiful Tuscan yellow walls. The kiln-forming classroom was originally the kilnroom and it was the last one I got around to painting so it was a bit rushed and not as well done as my workroom. But if I am going to focus on classes, I need an appropriate space for them, and the workroom is as close as my studio gets. *sigh*Okay, the day is over, the spouse will be here any second to collect me, and I have made great strides in a direction for next year (even if it did take me eight hours to write this post!)"},

Whew! Of course my books are in a total state of disarray as I neither let go of my laptop long enough for Becky to sort them out, nor do I keep them up myself. New Year's resolution: find an easier--i.e., more maintainable--accounting solution and process for me than ditzing around with Quickbooks. This will be (at least) the third year in a row where I have just thrown up my hands and said, \"I'll gather more useful sales and expense data next year to use in analyzing the profitability of the various parts of my business\", and I end up winging it again.I have heard that Mint is a good solution for personal finances. I need to find something similar for business. What makes Mint so powerful is that it automatically downloads your data--you don't have to remember to do it before it's been archived by your bank's server. Yes, the data is usually available for download for at least three months--some would say more than enough time to download it into the appropriate financial management software--but if you happen to miss those three months then you have a very painful manual add and reconcile task on your hands. When that happens to me (as it usually does by June) I just give up till December when I spend two weeks manually inputting and balancing everything--or I beg Becky to mash it all together as best she can.Of course the big downside to Mint is that it's made by Intuit--NOT my favorite company!"},

When you put your cursor in the last frame on the original page, the Alt tag (that extra little bit of text that pulls it all together) comes up. For this cartoon it says: \"The moment their arms spun freely in our air they were doomed -- for Man has earned is right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane.\" Yes. Do we really care if it is fine art or applied/decorative art? Um, no.This past Saturday was the kick-off of Taylor Kinzel's 8th annual glass show, and all the artists represented were there schmoozing. At the end we all stood with Mary and Patrick (the gallery owners) in front of a white Christmas tree and people, lots of people, snapped pictures of us. I kid you not--the flashes were popping all around us for several minutes (as we waited for Mary to take her place) and more than one comment was made that it felt like being rock stars at an event with the paparazzi.We were all there to talk about our work. For me that means the technique that goes into it, the play of color and light that come out of it, and how it feels in my hands. It's all about the sensuality of glass and the need to possess it and live with it. There isn't a \"meaning\" to individual pieces--a life outside of me--and I found myself explaining this concept on Saturday. I somehow found myself sucked back into the \"is it art\" mentality--i.e., is my work \"art\" and therefore \"worth\" as much as something that is a \"fine art\" (i.e., more than something simply \"decorative\")? Yes. Yes it is.Wikipedia has a very nice article about the historic and cultural distinctions between the fine and the decorative arts, and even before reading it I had realized that I am not meant to be a \"fine\" artist: All my heroes are cowboys, or, rather, architects and decorative artists. Antoni Gaudi, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Frank Lloyd Wright, Hector Guimard, Victor Horta, and Louis Comfort Tiffany. The Art Nouveau ideals of harmony with the natural environment, design according to the whole space and integration into ordinary life resonate with me in a way that the impact of an individual piece of fine art in isolation does not--especially if the fine art in question is all about the \"meaning\" of the piece.I often see colleagues struggling with being taken seriously as artists, developing their voices and realizing their visions under the perceived cloud of working in a \"minor\" art, and I am struck by the appropriateness of the use of the word \"fine\" in the phrase fine art. I cannot help but think of the song by Aerosmith (whose acronym also became popular with the self-aware set who don't believe \"fine\" is a good response to the question, \"How are you doing?\").  F.I.N.E. art. F*cked-up, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional. I think I'll stick to the decorative arts--thank you very much."},
{"title": "Value", "date": "Saturday, December 03, 2011", "text": "I spent a good amount of time yesterday working on the kiln, glass and tools package that I want to offer through the studio before the holidays, and I think my approach so far has been flawed. The goal should not be to put *everything* I would use in it, the goal should be to include what's truly necessary to start, and let the recipients build from there. I feel an analogy with the Intro to Kiln-forming class coming on: Break up what I see as the essentials into manageable stages. The kit I initially put together with help from Lori retailed at... Oh I am such an idiot.I just pulled up the spreadsheet that I so diligently compiled and discovered I had fallen victim to one of the classic blunders. No, I hadn't become involved in a land war in Asia, nor had I gone in against a Sicilian when death was on the line. Nonetheless, Bill Gates is turning away while shaking his head sadly at me. I wanted to offer two kiln options--a square and an octagon--and instead of giving a choice, I had included both in the total cost. It was such a Homer Simpson moment I have to say it... Doh!Okay, so the kit really retails at $1,787 (instead of the $2,596 I originally totaled). Unfortunately, I do not have a keystone markup on almost anything that goes into it, so my cost--without shipping--is still over $1,000. I want it to sell it for under $1,000, and I can't lose money on it. I don't have to make money on it--Ow! Lori just slapped me in the head from all the way up in Dunwoody. Okay, I *do* have to make *some* money on it as I reconcile myself to the fact that I am running an ostensibly for-profit business, not a 501 (c) for other people with a glass habit. So I go back to the drawing board and I start winnowing items off and putting them into the for-later bucket. I already have the strip and circle cutters in there, guess I need to add more so they won't be lonely.Later today I'll be heading up to Taylor Kinzel in Roswell where I have over $8,000 in new work for the 8th Annual Glass Show. It's my favorite time of the year to get gussied up, drink champagne with other artists, and talk to people about glass."},

Guilt much? But it's only December 2, and I only missed yesterday because the wireless at Highland Bakery, where we had our first ever monthly KGRC meeting yesterday morning, was out. Highland Bakery, let me rhapsodize for a moment... It's more than just a bakery, it may be the best breakfast place I have ever frequented *anywhere*. *Ever*.I had the Cilantro Corn Pancakes which were served over black beans and topped with 2 eggs over-easy, sour cream, salsa, shredded cheese, and cilantro (not necessarily in that order). Judy had the French Toast (I think it's a house specialty). My comment was \"Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head\"--good advice from my youth that I keep to today (the slices were easily almost 3\" thick).  But back to the menu; where else can you get Country Fried Steak Benedict, Fried Chicken Benedict, Ricotta Pancakes, AND Sweet Potato Pancakes (lightly sweet southern style pancakes served with a warm caramelized brown sugar syrup and toasted pecans)? Oh I feel the fat flying to my hips--and the food wasn't just perfectly conceptualized, it was was also perfectly executed. How rare is that?Enough about food. The glass business conversation was just as good as the food, and I left energized, motivated, and full of ideas for incremental changes to the studio classes, communication, open studio, etc., that will improve the studio experience and keep me happy. Today's newsletter (yes, you read right, TODAY's) will expound on some of them--as will the website. If you're not already getting our newsletter, it's time to sign-up (on the right side of this page works just fine). Time to put together the kiln-forming starter package now so I can include it. It will be a deal to end all deals..."},
{"title": "Last Day Of National Blog Posting Month (NaBloPoMo)", "date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2011", "text": "Got to get to the studio and the desk before Judy gets in at 11:00! Some days you just get a wild hair that can't be denied or plucked so you just go with it. Yesterday I had plenty of more pressing issues on my plate, but I found myself at the studio, sitting at my desk, surrounded by ancient piles of crumbling papers (truly) and who-knows-what in bins on the floor shoved under the desk from three years ago, and I just said what the heck. And I started to sort, and file, and organize and CLEAN. Dave came over about 3:00 and asked if I wanted him to pick up the Sprout from school--I had no idea it was so late. Then he came over again about 6:00 (I had said I would be home at 5:00 so we could go out on a date) and I remembered with a start that it was Date Night and I was still cleaning! I rushed off and left everything as was, but I would like to get it finished so I can see the proud look in Judy's eyes when she gets in this morning and sees that I am not a total slacker.Other interesting things happened yesterday--as they often will when I answer the phone on days the studio is closed. I got a call from one of the organizers of the ACC Show in Atlanta following up on an email he had sent a week or so ago about demoing glass during the show (March 9-11, 2012). The upshot of our conversation is that we at the studio are going to try to put together a full slate--three days worth--of demos of fusing, slumping, casting, torchworking, blowing, maybe rolling up glass, and moldmaking for casting. We'll have class lists and sign-ups, I think it will be pretty great. And we'll be the only ones there demoing hot glass.Now off to finish the desk, finish wiring the glass furnace back up after changing out the relays (it was too cold and wet last night to do it), and go to the next items on my never-ending to-do list. For all those in the area, don't forget that the Sleigh Ride continues through 12/24 (Jessie and Olivia's beaded animal ornaments shown on the tree above)."},

NaBloPoMo winds to a close and I am so far 21 for 29. Not 100%, but a heck of a lot better than I've been doing in recent months.Yesterday, in addition to not posting, I also ended the day with a big goose-egg in accomplishments. I moved lots of data around and around the Internet, and I still can't get my website working in its new location. All I want to do is move up one directory! It's not like I want to move servers or providers or something BIG. *sigh* For the time being I have two complete copies of my site in two different parent directories and a redirect sending everyone who goes to siyehglass.com to siyeh.net (which is how it's been since I put this site up a year or more ago). It's just going to have to sit and stew like that as the official kick-off of Book Deux is today (and I have no more hair to pull out trying to fix it). I have a conference call with my editor at 10:30, and we'll be putting together interim deadlines from now till May 1 when all 240+ pages are due. (eep)Today, though the studio is officially closed, is also a shipping day, a firing day, and a clean-up day to get the studio back in shape after the Sleigh Ride. On second thought, I think I'll leave clean-up for tomorrow when Judy is in as I have to swap out the relays in the second furnace today and get it firing back up so we can have glass blowing at the end of the week. No rest for the wickedly weary (wearily wicked?).Saturday is Taylor Kinzel's annual glass show, and, as one of the original artists, I'll be there all day. They already have all my work, but I need to send the list of pieces and pricing today too--through email, of course. What was it like to run a business before computers and the Internet? Not only no websites causing one to defoliate one's own head by tearing out tufts in frustration, but no email, no electronic bookkeeping, no on-line banking...

{"title": "It's Not Just Me", "date": "Friday, November 25, 2011", "text": "The other morning Dave made some slightly patronizing remark about my not having an automated blog aggregator, aka as an RSS reader so that I can follow blogs easily. Hah. Much he knows. It turns out that Blogger provides me with a very nice reader on my dashboard screen--where I go to write my posts. Out of curiosity--curiosity because it has been awhile since I read through any of the blogs I ostensibly follow (blush)--I read through the first long page of posts and then went searching for some old favorites that didn't show up on the RSS feed. Turns out that several of the people who wrote regularly back when I started up Glass Incarnate have tapered off or stopped writing altogether in recent years. Ren, Jodi, Chris, and Barbara have all been taken by life, and Sue has apparently reset the permissions on her blog as I got the message \"It doesn't look like you have been invited to read this blog. If you think this is a mistake, you might want to contact the blog author and request an invitation.\" when I tried to read it. Thank heaven for Cynthia, Bill, and Bridget who keep my world constant!The full-on Siyeh Sleigh Ride is over for another year (though we'll still have goodies to make and buy for those who were too busy stuffing themselves with left-over turkey in some other part of the country to make it on Saturday). Even though I was successful in replacing the relays in one of the glass furnaces on Friday, it's still only pulling 3/4 of the power it should if everything was working correctly, and the thermocouple failed yesterday morning (causing us to limp through the ornament-blowing and dates  during the Sleigh Ride). We shut it off at the end of the night yesterday and tomorrow I'll replace the relays in the other furnace and swap them out so we'll be up again by the time Tadashi gets in for the upcoming weekend's scheduled dates and lessons (and ornament blowing! Can't forget the ornament blowing!)Today, however, is a day of REST. It is a day of posting, reflecting, reading, weaving, knitting, getting the Christmas tree and carrying all the decorations down from the attic. It's a day of Christmas carols, butternut squash (or whatever variety of squash I grew that took over the weeping cherry tree in the backyard this year) soup, and board games with the family. Ahh, life is GOOD!It's a beautiful, slightly chilly morning after Thanksgiving and I am still giving thanks. Yesterday was a perfect blend of family, studio and friends that left me energized, empowered, and ready to take on today (the last day of set-up for the Sleigh Ride) and tomorrow, The Third Annual Siyeh Sleigh Ride! There is nothing like wrestling to the ground something that makes you feel stupid, powerless and at the whim of fate, and making it cry for its mommy. The thing I stomped all over (with a lot of help and encouragement) was the instability of our glass furnace. I started the day by meeting Sara from Olympic Kilns up in the parking lot of a BP station off I-85 in Suwanee--half-way between here house and mine. She wonderfully brought me eight relays that I purchased from Olympic on Wednesday but didn't have time to get up to pick up before they closed for the weekend. Without those relays we would not have been able to blow glass ornaments for the Sleigh Ride tomorrow, and we would have also had to cancel today's and tomorrow's dates.I left Dave baking the Thanksgiving pies with Jessie (she made all of the pumpkin but for the crust), got the relays, met Sara's Dad--who will be blowing glass in the studio this afternoon--and headed home. My one regret was that I had not yet purchased Dragon Dictate or any other means of dictating for automatic transcription so I couldn't start the intro to the kiln maintenance chapter of the book as I was driving back home. When the spirit moves you really need to be able to write--no matter where you are or what else you're doing.Back at the studio, I rolled up my sleeves, turned off the glass furnace (which was barely holding at 1975 degrees and pulling just over 12 amps of power--the amount it it uses to run one of the four pairs of elements), unplugged it, and started the Great Relay Swap. Brian the electrician was in Wednesday and, after a lot of metering and tinkering and checking, determined that the cause of the furnace not holding power was that the relays were not reliably closing and completing the circuit when they were activated. The elements were fine, as were the controller (a relief), the small 12 V master relay, and the thermocouple, and all the wires were solidly attached.So I took the controller box off the side of the furnace (carefully as it was HOT), removed the thermocouple from the furnace (slowly as it was even HOTTER), and detached all 16 wires connecting the elements to the relays. Once it was disconnected, I was able to remove the insulation and the steel cover inside the box to expose the relays. Lots more wires there to disconnect, and then nuts and bolts to unscrew to release the old relays. But with patience and fortitude--and by only disconnecting one relay at a time and swapping it out--I was able to get them all done and get the box back on the furnace and the furnace firing in just over an hour. I now feel confident that I can identify and repair (*myself*) 90-95% of what could go wrong with it.Bad news now is that either one set of elements has gone down or there is another problem as it's still only pulling 38-40 amps with all the relays and elements switched on and it should be using 50-52. But 38-40 is more than enough for our needs and Brian is coming back on Monday night to do a little more trouble-shooting and I'll get him to teach me to check the resistance on the elements so I can be even more proactive in my furnace and kiln troubleshooting and maintenance (and I'll really have a leg up on the material for that chapter of the book).Now off to put together more deals and give-aways for tomorrow and to post to Facebook about Small Business Saturday again."},
{"title": "Getting Ready For the Sleigh Ride", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2011", "text": "Quick post and then off to bed. Got the glass furnace working again last night. Changed out one element, fired it up and we were good to go. I wish that were good news... I still have no idea what caused it to go down in the first place. One pair of elements out is not enough to keep it from holding temp, and yet it wouldn't hold temp on Saturday with only one pair of elements out. Today it's holding just fine with only two pairs of elements working. Brian the electrician is coming tomorrow at 10:00 am with his probes and clamps and meters. I hope he can get to the root cause of our problems. It's not elements. It's not relays. What's left? Controller? Thermocouple? The ones in the know (the electrician types) seem to think them unlikely at this point. But what else is there?!?Though we were closed today, I taught a class for a group of Living Social folk. They were nice, but remind me NOT to do anything like Living Social or Groupon again--it really doesn't make sense for a small business that cares about it reputation and customer satisfaction to do this kind of bargain-basement-shopper program.Tomorrow is the set-up day for the Siyeh Sleigh Ride. Am I a lesser person for wishing we weren't doing it after all? I have a horrible fear that no one will come even though I sent out the invitation to over 900 people and AmEx has been advertising it through their site (though I'm not exactly sure how... they just said it was part of the package if I registered, which I did). Today I also cut and shipped a glass order to another artist/friend/customer. After I spent the time cutting the glass, wrapping it for shipping, boxing it up and putting it out, I wonder if I even broke even on the transaction... I have GOT to get better (i.e., more realistic) about my pricing--even for friends.Okay, that's about it. Sad news on the studio chicks and buns front: Looks like Char is a boy bunny, and he and Jasmine had two little babies that didn't make it. I found them in the hutch today, tiny, cold, and eyes still closed. I don't know what happened, but I have closed down the doorway of the hutch so the chickens can't get in it anymore (they were kind of making themselves at home there in the day) and cleaned and spruced it back up for the bunnies. I am sad for Jasmine. I hope she is and will be okay. Char is getting tutored, er,  neutered as soon as I can get an appointment with the vet."},

I *did* get the email invitation to the Sleigh Ride out, but that was the extent of glass yesterday. I played Dominion for the first time with Dave. I took Jessie to Michael's crafts so she could use her birthday gift certificate to buy more beads and wire. She's going to be one of the artists at the sleigh ride this year and sell beaded animal Christmas ornaments. She makes platypuses, bees, lizards, dragonflies, and butterflies so far. I think frogs are on the slate too.Why the sudden interst in selling her work? J spent the latter half of the weekend trying to figure out all the ways she could earn money to buy an iPad. If she saves half, I told her we'd pay the other half. So far she has her allowance which is $10 a week. For it she must feed and water the dogs and cat twice a day; take care of the chickens and bunnies: letting them out in the morning, filling food and water, putting them [the chickens] back in the coop at night and gathering the theoretical eggs [again, from the chickens only]; clean her room, and set and clear the table at meal times). She has taken on scooping the cat box; helping Grandma with the laundry, and loading and unloading the dishwasher; and chopping vegetables for her father for additional small fees. She charges $2-$4 for an incredible massage (back, hands and/or feet)--I take advantage of this one. She's also opening a \"store\" in her room selling beaded animals and duct-tape objects. Should I tell her the City of Atlanta will want her to have a business license? I don't want to scar her...The day ended with a viewing of Hubble at the IMAX and dinner at Sushi Avenue for the whole family. Then home to a shower, two chapters of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone (she is *finally* letting me read it to her after three years of my begging), and bed for everyone but Dave who was still working at midnight. Ah well, we can't all be slackers.In short, yesterday was a Day Off. Today it's back to glass. I talk to my editor tomorrow about interim deadlines for the book so I need to go over my outline and do some preliminary planning today. The Sleigh Ride is Saturday and I need to figure out a way to increase buzz and traffic for it. I think I might make posters and see if I can get other small local businesses (like Kavarna and My Coffee Shop) to put them up.And speaking of the Sleigh Ride, I need to decide how much to give away. For the first time I am melding both halves of my business--sales of finished work (mine and others') with sales of materials, tools and supplies. I want to have people interested in buying both in, and I would like to have the much-earlier-promised 3rd birthday party specials running (beginner's kiln-forming outfit, glass specials, glass rod specials, etc.). Guess I should get going on all that and Stop Talking About It!"},

I should have karma points up the Wazoo right now.Yesterday I rose (I was the phoenix). I worked like a dog till 11:30 last night and got up and tweaked the website some more this morning. Then I taught my first kiln-forming class of the day. At the beginning of it, one of the young girls in the class (two young girlfriends, one mother and her friend) asked if I had pets. I said yes, at the house, and didn't think anything more of it.Midway through the class Brian came in and told me we were out of oxygen. He had two full bead-making classes scheduled. To get by, he took the oxygen tank from the hotshop leaving Domenick unable to firepolish any of the blown pieces from the rest of the day's dates and classes, but the bead-making classes could go on.Not too much later, Domenick came in to tell me that the glass furnace was not holding temperature. I went out and futzed with it (a highly technical process that includes, of course, a reboot). And we all crossed our fingers. I got through the rest of my class without incident, and then at the end of the class as Judy was walking around the table, she found a smushed pile of dog poo left by a friend's dog who was visiting the studio yesterday. Apparently the girl had stepped in it at the beginning of the class, asked about the pets, and then didn't say anything else. Judy, bless her heart, cleaned it up and sprayed Ozium, but the 45 minutes between classes were not enough to get the smell out of the air (the smell was actually much worse after cleaning--a combination of cleaner, ozium and poo). For the next class, guess who had that corner seat? The pregnant woman. I felt so bad for her and asked if she would like to change places with me, but she said she was fine. I would've hurled had I been in that corner and pregnant.Halfway through that class--also halfway through Brian's second class--Brian came in to tell me we were out of oxygen. I comped everyone's class and told them they could sign up another day--they were all Living Social 2-for-1 whose coupons expire this week.A little while later Domenick came in and said the glass in the furnace was so stiff for the end of his class that he thought he was going to pull the crucible out on the last gather. I went out and looked at the furnace, and to my untrained but jaundiced eye, it looked like three of the elements were either out or not getting juice for some other reason. I went back inside and had Judy call the other two dates for the day to reschedule. The second date had already been rescheduled once in August for the furnace being out. They were NOT happy, and I ended up refunding their date night and telling them to reschedule for whenever would be convenient for them and it was on me.The work day is now over and I am home in the comfy chair with a glass of wine. I could be crushed right now. Arguably I *should* be crushed right now. But I'm in the comfy chair. My spouse is home from Austin. I have a glass of wine and my family around me (well, not Jessie--she's still at a friend's house and will be home soon--but my Mom and Dave). The frosting on my cake is the justifiably cliched \"and I have my health\". All of those things add up to I have to give \"crushed\" a pass. Maybe I'm a little squished, but not crushed. Tomorrow, after all, is another day (and the studio is closed!!).Happy weekend."},
{"title": "Like the South and the Phoenix, I Rise Again", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "The phoenix is Fully, Gloriously Feathered with no dust required (see yesterday's post for the reference). I spent today leaving yesterday--and the couple of crappy days that came before it-- behind.In a whirlwind of activity I met with Lori and Judy and we discussed plans for the the Siyeh Glass Resource Center for 2012--highlight: we're opening back up on Sundays in January. I emailed back and forth with another fuser that I am considering hiring to teach classes starting in January and it looks like that will be a go. I spoke with Nancy G. at length about her fusing techniques that she has so graciously offered for inclusion in Le Book, and set-up preliminary deadlines with her. I redesigned our Intro To Kiln-Forming and Intro To Bead-Making classes, put up the schedule for first quarter 2012 classes, and rewrote the pages on the website to match.Finally, I conferred with my fellow sleigh-riders and we decided to do a short, sweet, intense Siyeh Sleigh ride in conjunction with Small Business Saturday next Saturday, November 26. Got the web page up for that one too. The highlight of the day was the meshing my realization that the way I have been teaching the Intro To Kiln-Forming class just doesn't work with Brian's description of how Intro To Bead-Making needs to be extended. I can't realistically get out--nor can the students take in--all the material necessary to prepare students to be on their own in open studio, and Brian has the same problem--compounded with a need for longer practicing times. As I put on the classes page:\"Over the past three years we have determined that trying to stuff all the things we think you need to learn in a two-hour Intro to Kiln-Forming or Intro To Bead-Making class doesn't work. We have to talk way too fast, and your brains get way too full--or you just need more time to practice the techniques as you learn them. On the other hand, many of you either can't--or don't know up front if you're ready to--make either the time or the financial commitment to come three weeks in a row to three separate sessions. The conundrum posed us by these issues was great and troublesome, but we think we have solved it (huzzah); Welcome to Intro 1 2 3!We have redesigned our Intro To Kiln-Forming and Intro To Bead-Making classes and broken them up into three separate sessions. You can take one, two, or all three of them at your own pace, on your own schedule. And because you don't have to decide up front, you can try Intro 1, make a cool project, and if you like it and want to go on, Intros 2 and 3 will provide you with the skills and comfort level you need to progress to Open Studio (working on your own in the studio with your own glass).\" And here is the write-up on Intro To Kiln-Forming 1 2 3:\"Intro 1: In this two hour class you will be introduced to the basics of fusing and slumping—the  foundation techniques of kiln-forming glass—and the various tools and equipment used in them. Learn what happens when glass is melted—how it flows, what happens to   air trapped in it, how it combines with other glasses—and apply what you   learn as you design and execute your own piece.  We'll keep the science to a minimum (viscosity, thermal coefficient of expansion and surface tension can all wait); this first time it's all about compatibility and falling in love. Think of us as a matchmaker: Whether or not glass turns out to be your soulmate, you'll end the class with a gorgeous 8” square plate that you can proudly point to and say, \"I made that myself\".Intro 2: You've had the first date, now it's time to start learning all about each other. We start with cutting glass, and move onto designing glass work for the kiln-forming. It's time to meet the parents—aka the kiln—and get to that science we skipped earlier as we find out why it turns out the way it does. But don't worry, you'll still be so warm and fuzzy from the flush of Intro 1 that finding out there will be bubbles in the glass (no matter what) won't daunt you.You'll make another 8” square plate, probably as a gift for a person you love (one cannot live by glass alone).Intro 3: This session covers everything you'll need to know about being on your own with glass. You'll use advanced cutting tools that enable you to easily prepare your own circles and straight-edged pieces and cut big sheets down to size. We'll discuss the nature of relationships as we delve into the effects of opalescent and transparent glasses on depth perception and color. We'll explore what happens from chemical reactions between different glasses, and we'll see that sometimes the color you start with is not the color you end up with when you use striker glasses. We'll address safe-fusing practices from the design stage through firing. Finally, you'll learn how to prepare a kiln shelf, and load and program a kiln for firing.Each session in the Intro series is a prerequisite for the next.\" Tomorrow I teach two, full, Intro classes, and I absolutely, positively must get the newsletter done and out for the Sleigh Ride.Nothing like rising with a vengeance."},

{"title": "Whinging 2", "date": "Wednesday, November 16, 2011", "text": "You whine, you moan, you play a little Diablo... and then you get on with your life--and it's quietly good. I had the Holiday Fair wrap-up meeting this morning. I turned in my expenses, my write-up, gave a report and made recommendations for next year, and I'm done--for the year and maybe for next year too. We'll see. Then I taught an Intro to Kiln-forming Glass II class. After that, off to the optometrist with J, followed by a visit to City Hall to pay for my business license--that whole experience left a very bad, corrupted taste in my mouth, at the end of which I just moved on. Whatever.In all, the day was varied, full, and satisfying in a gentle, non-flashy way. I was approached about maybe helping make a project with the 8th grade students for the school auction in the spring, and I jumped on it (it sounds way cool). As a result, I had the personal and professional satisfaction of seeing the stunned gratitude on the teacher's face when I said sure I'd do it, and no, it wouldn't cost anything--I'd donate my time and the materials. She hugged me, and that made my day.Has anything really changed since yesterday? No. Are there still parts of my business life I think I seriously need to overhaul? Absolutely. But I put together the schedule for the Intro to Beadmaking I, II and III classes through March today, and I'll do the same for the Intro to Kiln-forming classes tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll also write a newsletter. I'll start on a new website, and eventually I'll plan an artist open house in the spring (early summer--after the manuscript is due) and skip a holiday show that has to compete with everything else going on in the few, short weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas.Now I've had a lovely dinner with a good friend and her children (Dave is in Austin), and It's time to go to bed so I can be in court at 8:00 am tomorrow, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, to deal with the farce that is the course of my Atlanta City business license process."},
{"title": "The Times They Need To Be A-Changing", "date": "Tuesday, November 15, 2011", "text": "Today has been a very frustrating day. I have been pinged and dinged and beaten down since 8:30 this morning. It seems like everyone wants something, wants money, wants time, wants extensions, wants exceptions, wants special treatment from me, or can't pay me, or something else that leaves me feeling marginalized, undervalued, and under-appreciated. Back in March I wrote that we don't do what we do for the money, and I still believe that to be true. The following paragraph from that post hit me especially hard today:When we start thinking about how much we're making for our work compared to how much we're working and we begin to feel resentful, it's not about the money--however much we might say it is--it's about the work. Something about the work is not or is no longer meeting our needs. The answer really isn't to ask for a raise. More money for the same work environment is a short term sop that initially makes us feel more self-worth but doesn't address the real problem. The real problem is either that the negative aspects of the job or the job environment outweigh the positives and leave us feeling down at the end of the day, or that we have intrinsic self-worth issues that keep us from being fulfilled and validated external to the job. In my case, my self-esteem is just fine, but my job has evolved into management and ownership in the most non-creative of ways. When I get the opportunity to create, I throw myself completely into the experience--as in the Bullseye conference workshop on manual 3-D printing earlier this year, or the fall Advanced Beginning Weaving workshop I took in New Hampshire in October. I love those times and I am energized and excited again by what I Do--whether or not I make any money from it. Even the Waldorf Holiday Fair (though Dave will never believe it) was very satisfying for me in spite of the extreme hard work, high level of responsibility, and complete lack of remuneration.Today's tasks--dealing with the City of Atlanta Department of Revenue (again) over my business license issue, managing orders which were/are delayed, calling customers about paying their invoices that have been past due for over 180 days, filling out and mailing payroll tax forms, and appealing a water bill that was four times higher than it should have/ever has been--were almost more than I could bear. But the real cherry on the top of the day was answering phone calls and emails from the never-ending stream of people who purchased our class deal through Living Social last November and waited until the last minute to try to schedule a class before the deal expires on November 24 (\"Well it didn't say I couldn't wait till the last minute! How do I get a refund?\"). I have quadrupled our class offerings to try to fit everyone in, and I extended the expiration to the end of January, and yet I *still* feel harangued and like they think I'm trying to cheat them. At one point I looked at my Mom with despair (sometimes you've just got to have your Mom around, and I'm very lucky that mine lives with us), and she sympathetically said to me, \"Let's run away to Greece.\" I was sorely tempted.So what to do? Well, my first step was to cancel this year's Siyeh Sleigh Ride. I have not been looking forward to it, I have been viewing it as an obligatory millstone around my neck--something I *should* do. I am also re-evaluating doing the Buyer's Market show in February--I have three days to cancel. Christine, the excellent former show director, is no longer with the Rosen Group, Wendy Rosen is absorbed by her bid for a Congressional seat, and her daughter Rebecca, who has taken over the show, is an unknown quantity to me. My one exposure to Rebecca was a few years ago when she tried to have a world handcrafts show run concurrently with the Buyer's Market of American Craft. This idea did not fill me with confidence that she understands what it means to be a North American artisan buying North-American-made materials, paying North American production costs, wages, insurance, mortgage/rent, cost of living, etc., and having to compete against third-world wages and cost of living. Yes, it might have been a great idea for boosting buyer attendance numbers--less costly goods are always good for buyers, but it didn't show her to be behind the idea of building up an awareness and appreciation for fine North American-made (and all that that label entails) craft. Would it have been good for their main supporters and the reason for the show--the American and Canadian artisans who have been exhibiting there for almost 30 years? No.Canceling the sleigh ride and re-evaluating my one remaining wholesale show feel like the baby-steps to bigger changes. If I am not Doing It for the money--and we should all be clear by this point that I am not--then I need to be more true to doing the It that gives me joy, makes my heart sing, and doesn't make me feel a drudge. Guess it's time to shake things up a bit."},

I promised pictures of Ed's and Susan's first kiln-formed pieces today, but they will have to wait till tomorrow when they are finished slumping.Today was another transitional day for me. Because it was Ed and Susan's last day, I took them to a late breakfast, then they helped me unload the minivan from the holiday fair, then we visited a little... and then it was time to go to the airport. When I got back I defied popular opinion on Facebook and played Diablo for awhile (I picked up a saved game from three years ago... I really don't get out much).Now I post and stubbornly put off thinking about the Siyeh Studio website, the newsletter, my court date Thursday, kicking the book into gear, orders, shipping, bills, and Dave going to Austin for three days tomorrow--leaving me to the dreaded single-parenthood (and the Waldorf lantern walk). Really. I'm not thinking about them At All. I am aiming for limbo and the perfect float in time. My aim is terrible, and I dread the resurgence in importance of tasks that have been on the to-do list for weeks (months), but which were relegated to obscurity by the all-consuming holiday fair.

I have no projects, no plans, no duties. I am trying very hard to just rest in the me and the moment. I am not entirely successful. Like Ellen, I am having a hard time posting right now. Part of it is probably because there is not much of interest to anyone but me in the lint in my navel--which is about all I have resting in the me and the moment. Sadly the lack of projects, obligations and deadlines did not stop me from a wakeful semi-anxious hour in the middle of the night last night, and I can feel another one coming on tonight. I had the hardest time trying to convince my subconscious that there really wasn't anything triggering a dark anxiety attack, and I I am bummed that I feel it lurking again tonight.I really am not very good with the transition between projects/balls-to-the-wall activity. When I am in the throes of a Big Project, I yearn for a time of rest and a cessation of activity with all my being. But when it comes, I twiddle my thumbs and think, \"Now what?\" The only good answer to that question is one of the chocolate chip cookies Dave and Jessie made today, but I think we took them all to Jessie's cello recital this afternoon.

However I am *very* good at holiday fair prep! Tomorrow there will be pictures--maybe even a movie.The activity begins with a journey through the time before time in viking mythology. Back when neither our world, nor the universe, nor the stars existed. There was only Nifflheim, the world of ice, Muspleheim, the world of fire, and the Ginnungagap, the great void between. You navigate the stalactites and fog in Nifflheim, the eerie black lighting of the Ginnungap, and the roaring flames of Muspleheim before arriving at the great giant Ymir from whose body came our world, Midgard, the universe and the stars in the heavens. After you pass under the legs of the great Ymir, the next part of your adventure begins.In part two, you help Odin and Loki as they repay a debt. You gather gold from the dwarf's treasure at the base of the waterfall and you carry it around the corner to where you place it on an otter's pelt. Odin and Loki's task is to completely cover the otter's pelt. As a reward for your help, you receive a glass rune stone. You reach into a velvet bag and take a stone, and the guardian will tell you the meaning of your rune.Okay, I am officially exhausted and heading off to rest up for a full day tomorrow...."},

I take this as a challenge, and I am up to it. Unfortunately, nothing is likely to save me from a boring recital of a post. What can I say? One can't scintillate everyday.It is a sad commentary on life when the most difficult part of the preparation for the Waldorf Holiday Fair is the making of the glass rune stones. The stencils were interminable to prepare--for Dee anyway; I was ensconced with hot chai and snoring dogs. Then today the etching was just as teeth-gnashing as the last person to use the sandblaster blew a hole in the hose, tried a quick duct-tape fix, and didn't bother to tell me about it. Then I used a bit of spray adhesive as an additional hold for the stencil, and the adhesive was almost impossible to blast off. Dee had been concerned about the age and stickiness of the stencils, but when I finally gave up on the spray in exasperation, the stencils adhered just fine to the glass without it. And the glass was a heck of a lot easier to clean up. Lesson learned.Tomorrow and Friday I teach intro to kiln-forming  classes (the piece at right is a student piece from one of last week's classes, pre-firing), and Friday is also the set-up for the Holiday Fair (I got a fog machine for Nifflheim today. Whoo hoo.) Tomorrow I also head back to Dee's so she can cut all the runes for me on her fancy schmancy tile saw with the super blade. Licha is coming down to the studio to do roll-ups in the morning--I hope Tadashi gets the slabs in tonight as I have been out of the loop on that one and I have not seen him yet.Okay, time's up, brain's empty--off to bed."},

Both bunnies and all the chickens except Sundust are in the picture, eating in harmony. We haven't had any eggs yet (from either chicks or buns), and Dave thinks maybe the bunnies are eating them.

I am at Dee's cozied up in chair with my hot chai and a warm cinnamon roll while she makes the stencils for the runes for the Holiday Fair for me. Well, she will be making the stencils for me. Right now we are still debating final size and techniques needed to get there. I think it's time to give up on putting channels in them and making it so they can be either stones or pendants. These are going to be stones. Rune Stones.There is not much going on in the glass studio this week. Orders continue to trickle in--mostly for Todd--and I am teaching both Thursday and Friday, but in general we are enjoying a slow season. Some might not enjoy a slow season. Some might lament the lack of pre-holiday season rush. Some are not me. I revel in my current lack of speed--and not just because I am sick.

It was the sixth day of NaBloPoMo, and I meant to post, I had things I wanted to write, my dog didn't eat my homework, but I got sick instead. Really. Yesterday was my favorite day of the year--the day the clocks fall back and we get an extra hour to sleep in. Sadly for me, I started coming down with a cold the night before and had a very rough night trying to sleep and only partially succeeding at it. I dragged myself out of bed for the final time about 9:00 am to get ready to host the final parent workday before the Waldorf Holiday Fair. I felt so crappy and tired that I could barely focus on what needed to be done.Turnout for the aforementioned workday was pretty much limited to the faithful friends, but we still managed to patch and paint the paper mache giant Ymir, weight and paint the paper mache stalagmites, dry and finish painting the gold, paint the treasure chest, hang and touch-up the stalactites, and drill and paint the Muspleheim floor. There is still a bit left for me to do this week, but in the interests of not stressing my spouse out any more than he already is about my level of effort in the holiday fair, I will keep that list to myself.The evening started with a last dinner with our extended family--Dave's parents and his sister all visiting from the north, my Mom, Dave Jessie and me. Dave made his special cassoulet, and it was excellent. But by 8:00 I was so exhausted I wasn't even sure if I had a name--much less was able to remember it. So I went upstairs to rest and post--and promptly fell asleep, thus ending my posting aspirations. Today was spent on this post (really) and napping (the pets napped too). You can clearly see that napping got the bigger piece of the time pie. For once I let my body shut down and drift without complaint. Yes, my Inbox is still full, and it will be full tomorrow.

Actually, though we missed her, we did okay without her as there was no walk-in traffic and the phones were relatively quiet. It was still the busiest day, however, as I taught two full classes, Brian had two full bead-making classes, and Tadashi and Domenick had five glass blowing lessons/dates between them. That's all the people we can currently run through in a day. And they loved it, and many of them want to come back again and do more glass. And this is why I teach and have a teaching studio. I love the enthusiasm of the fresh beginner. I remember anew the fantastic feeling I got when I worked with glass for the first time and how I couldn't wait till I got to do it again.It's kind of like falling in love. I remember when I met Dave and I was so in love with him, and I knew I'd marry him, and I was so extraordinarily happy but for one thing: I knew that as long as I loved him--and I couldn't (and still can't) imagine not loving him--I would never have that breathless feeling of falling in love again. I would never have the anxiety and the heights and the depths that come with new love. New love comes and consumes and terrifies and exhorts, and then it either skitters away, or calms down into something daily, deep and rich. Don't get me wrong. Daily, deep and rich are like swimming in dark chocolate--there is nothing better. But no matter how wonderful it is, you can't help but feel a twinge of longing for the knife-edged uncertainty and extreme sensation of New Love.My relationship with glass is long and deep now. We are 24-year happily marrieds with all the complexity and comfort that that amount of time implies. I may temporarily lose myself in a new technique, or become entranced with a new color, but I know that I'll never again have the all-consuming obsession with glass that I did when I first met it.And yet, when I teach a class, every now and then I see in someone else's face that fascination, that tactile lust for glass that I once felt, and I bask in the reflected glow of falling love all over again. Today was a day like that for me.Now I curl up in bed next to my spouse. I feel the deep, warm comfort that comes from 16 wonderful years, and I know that somewhere else in Atlanta, someone is going to sleep alight with the fire of  New Love. New love for glass, to which I provided the introduction. And I am happy."},

But the biggest order of the day was the Sprout's birthday. All of her grandparents are here as is her aunt Jan. We had Nancy's thin crust pizza, champagne (J and the two friends she had over had eggnog), and old fashioned chocolate cake from Southern Sweets. The girls spent six hours making beaded platypi and duct tape and felt houses for them, and are now ensconced in front of a movie--making more platypi.Besides the birthday preparations (and the ruana I managed to cut and sew from the wool fabric I wove in New Hampshire), I also picked up the 8-ft giant Ymir that I made with J's class on Wednesday. Here's a tip on paper mache: don't let the flour and water paste ferment before you use it. We had three gallons that wouldn't fit in the fridge and evidently there was a little feral yeast in the flour as the morning after we made it it was already bubbling up. I didn't think anything of it and used it with the kids. Their teacher was very glad that I got it out of the classroom today as it was beginning to smell like a brewery in there (and that's not as pleasant as you might think). My minivan might never be the same. Now Ymir rests in our garage till Sunday when we host another parent work day and I get some people to duct tape his joints up and to patch a few tears from moving him. Then we'll paint him white... or blue... or some other frost-giant-like color.So was there glass done today? In a sense, yes. I started the day by appealing my $2,000 penalty for failure to file for a City of Atlanta business license. I used the grounds that the penalty is four times the tax and interest due which is inequitable, and that it would be a serious hardship from my small business to pay it and stay in business. My request was granted. Yea!!!Judy prepared me for a big day in the studio tomorrow as she is taking the day off. Tomorrow I teach two full fusing classes, Brian teaches two full beadmaking classes, and we have five glass blowing dates/lessons scheduled too. Thank heaven my Mom is going to come in and help while Judy is gone. NO MORE SATURDAYS OFF FOR JUDY!Now it is late and my spouse is snoring dulcetly next to me (really).

It's also always my busiest, and the one in which I am most likely to overdo. Between the start of school--and all of the volunteering opportunities it brings, Jessie's birthday, the holidays, and all the projects it's now cool enough to do, I tend to get over-committed and over-stimulated really easily.

I appear to be dragging my feet. Why? Well, it's a HUGE commitment and I am a bit afraid of the impact it will have on my life. Didn't I just vow (sometime in the past few months) to slow down? Writing a 240 page book with all high-level subject matter is NOT slowing down. It will consume my life, my time, my business. Dave says it will be fine. He is fully behind me. Has he forgotten what the last book (half this size) was like? Is this like the masculine version of childbirth for him? It must be, otherwise he'd never be willing to do it again (and no one would either write books or have children and our species would become illiterate and die out--take your pick as to which would come first).I am terrified of the impact this oeuvre will have on my and my family's lives.

{"title": "Time Be Time", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "text": "In the shower this morning I had, well not exactly an epiphany but close. When I was Jessie's age, time was measured in minutes--minutes till recess, minutes till dinner, minutes in a cartoon. The minutes (about 15) it took to walk to school took FOREVER. By high school minutes had ceded place of prominence to hours--a class period, hours till the end of the school day, hours till a party or a date. Neither of these statements is to say that days and weeks didn't count. The big events--summer vacation, Christmas, my birthday--were still anticipated weeks and days in advance, but the dominant measurement of the passing of time was the hour.Sometime in my 20's--probably commensurate with leaving school and entering the Working World (entering at least for awhile before fleeing back to school) the class hour gave way to the work day and days began to shape life events--TGIF, I hate Mondays, Wednesday is hump day. There was also a vague grouping into weeks and months (never years unless in the past), but it remained firmly vague.Side note: I *love* writing. I hated it when I was forced to do it on some else's schedule for class assignments and to conform to someone else's rules (grammar--smack my knuckles with a ruler). Now, the juxtaposition of the words \"firmly\" and \"vague\" actually gives me a little burst of satisfied happiness at having found just the right phrase. But time passes as I digress so let's get back to the passage of time.Now, as I wander the other side of the fifty-year mark, I could care less about hours anymore (an hour, isn't that about the time it takes to sneeze and find the tissues?), and days have begun to clump into a week-shaped blob. In fact days only get recognized when I find or lose them. For instance, last week in my weaving class, on Thursday night as I was planning my last project, I was sure I had two days left to complete it--that it was, in effect, Wednesday night. I was not so lucky (hence working till 1:00 am Saturday). Other weeks I will be stressing because I think it's Wednesday, and then I realize it's only Tuesday, and the relief that floods my system along with the realization is almost intoxicating. Weekends are no longer the days Saturday and Sunday, they are a differential break in the rhythm of Monday through Friday (or not, depending on the studio's work load). Compare it to finding or losing a dollar at age nine to finding or losing $20 now...A lot of the contemplation (in the shower, as I cleaned the lint out of my navel) that resulted in the post above, was triggered by the realization that I am 50, and 50 seems like a reasonable half-way point in life. The time it took to get here seemed comfortably long. But as my perception of time compresses, are the next 50 years going to rush by? I don't want them to rush! I want more time! Maybe I'll need to live to 150. Time to start working on that goal."},
{"title": "Thursday and STILL Posting!", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2011", "text": "It's almost a record for this year--four posts in a row! It is embarrassing how little I've posted, but with the new book a reality and no longer just a theory, writing has jumped to the top of my daily to-do's. Today will also see more activity in the studio--though I doubt if I will be firing anything of my own. Houston is coming today so we can experiment with Bullseye powders fired on copper, and Becky is scheduled to whip my books a little more into shape. Tadashi is in the hotshop, and Judy is running the desk/phones. Do they really need me? Well I suppose Houston does.Right now I pore over my new book contract, comparing it to my last contract. Five years ago there was a section pertaining to \"electronic rights\" that mentioned \"...photographic, video, audio, digital... for copying, recording, or transmission\". Now that section has been replaced by a big, shiny, new section on \"electronic editions\" with a better royalty structure than previously. The royalty structure is also much better than for printed copies. Too bad I don't write fiction.And that's enough writing to qualify for a post. Now off to so... something else."},
{"title": "The Weaving of Life and Work", "date": "Wednesday, October 26, 2011", "text": "Some days are work days with a twist. This theme is really an extension of my writings earlier this week on what work Is and how you Do it. Today I was in the studio for half an hour, and prior to now I was on the computer for about another half an hour, and yet I worked. Though it will make my husband cringe to hear it, I spent the rest of the day today on the Waldorf Holiday Fair and Viking Tales. And it gave me GREAT joy. The morning began with some lively discourse over coffee in front of the grades building at school after I dropped Jessie off (they put out coffee and home-baked bread on Wednesday mornings for any parents who wish to drop by and mingle). She has to be there at 8:00 and I had a meeting there at 8:30 (for said Holiday Fair) so it was serendipitous to have them provide me with coffee (though I talked too much to get to the bread--surprise, surprise).Then there was a meeting--meetings in my life now that I own my own business are very rare. I meet with the studio staff maybe once every two months so in a way it's kind of a nice socializing opportunity to have the Holiday Fair meetings (and there are only two more this year). When the meeting was over, one of the other parents--in charge of the candle-dipping activity--followed me back to the studio to collect some deadfall from the pecan tree from which to make the candle bases.Then it was off to the dollar store for bowls and the Home Depot for chicken wire to prepare for my afternoon's activity--making paper mache stalactites and stalagmites with Jessie's class for Nifflheim in Viking Tales. Emded with a quick stop at the recycling center drop-off to scavenge (despite the prominent \"No Scavenging\" signs) a bunch of newspaper to use in the paper mache. At home I quick whipped up nine chicken wire armatures of the stalcs and stalgs while Mom whipped up five batches of paper mache paste and filled a gallon milk jug with them. That entire paragraph took an hour fifteen to complete (do, not write)--we were like marines on a beach, Mom and I.By 1:30 I was back at the Waldorf School and sitting down with 26 fourth graders and their teachers to do paper mache. It was a blast!! I think they all turned out really well, and we will paint them at the Holiday Fair parent workday at our house this Sunday. Now it is time to  confess that I have only done paper mache once in my life before, and that was 20 years ago. I have never made armatures before. In fact the word \"armature\" just entered my vocabulary in conjunction with the Holiday Fair event. My take-away from the experience? Just decide you can do it, go balls to the wall, and it will work out. After the week I have had so far, today was an overwhelming win.But how does this whole post (and day's activities) relate to Glass Incarnate? Today was also the first day I have ever worked with chicken wire, and now I feel MUCH more sanguine about creating mold armatures--further evidence that every experience, every moment is intertwined with every other building and layering into A Life.Thus ends my hump day this week. (And have you noticed that I have managed to post every day this week? woot woot.)"},
{"title": "Work With a Vengeance", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2011", "text": "The day started with Dave heading off to Austin for his regular three-day stint and me wrangling the Sprout off to school. When I got home from dropping her off, I realized I had microwaved yesterday's coffee, put it in a go-mug, taken it all the way to school and back without a sip, and now needed to put it back in a regular mug. All for microwaved coffee. Which I microwaved because I am trying to save money. Which I need to save because the City of Atlanta's pound of flesh yesterday was almost more pounds than I can manage. I hope it's not a harbinger of the day. (And can I just say \"ewww\"? I'm making a new pot and to hell with frugality.)Yesterday at City Hall getting a City of Atlanta business license took all day, but it's done. I had to go through the Dept of Revenue, the Zoning Dept, the Planning Dept, the Dept of Revenue again, then finally the cashier. After several hours I had a few slips of paper and a Big Bill. Everybody wants their piece of the corpse, er, pie. There are days when I think (no, I absolutely *know*) that it would cost me and my family less if I didn't work. Heck, I have enough of a yarn and fabric stash that I could weave, knit sew, scrapbook (I still haven't done my wedding scrapbook--much less one for Jessie) and garden to my heart's content--probably without ever having to buy another thing.But that's not What I Do. I run a glass studio and make objects of beauty to enrich people's lives and homes. I make my neighborhood a better place by the existence of my studio and the experiences it offers. I employ five people, adding to their ability to make a living. I give my daughter an example of hard work and perseverance for hard work and perseverance's sake as opposed to financial gain.Do I sound bitter this morning? I feel a bit bitter. I feel (more than) a bit ripped off by a City Government that needs money and is looking anywhere they can for it--with a poor, but honest, small businesses making a good target for them. Proof of that statement? I have made so little revenue in the past four business tax years that I have had the studio open that my back taxes--even including interest--are almost nothing. However my penalty for not filing a return is $500 *a year*. Had I known I had to register and file not only with the State of Georgia, Dekalb County, and the federal government, but also with the City, I would have done it. I did not know until they told me... four tax years after I opened the business. But ignorance of the law does not mean you don't have to follow the law so I now owe $2,000 in penalties for not filing.It used to be that the penalty for not filing was 10% of the tax due plus interest on the tax. For a business that makes a lot of money and doesn't cut the government in, 10% is a tidy sum. For a small business that scrabbles along just trying to make it (and which probably doesn't have an accounting and compliance department to make sure all the proper forms and registrations and taxes and fees and, and, and are filed on time) the amount due would be trivial. So who is the government going after by making the fee $500 a year? The big businesses that are depriving the government of a lot of money, or the small businesses who probably owe--at most--$125 in taxes for a year? Bingo.I got very close to the point yesterday where I said no, I'll just close my studio and lay off all my people. I have had enough being nickle-and-dimed and ripped off by a bloated, greedy, inefficient local government. I will not have a business here. But I didn't. And this morning I reviewed an old post to help bring me back into balance. Yes, I got screwed yesterday, but it's only money. Time to move on (and make another pot of coffee)."},

Apparently they can cite anyone (and require them to go to court) if that person happens to be the only one present (a Person of Authority) in a business without the right piece of paper. She showed him my prominently displayed state registration certificate, and she showed him my prominently displayed employer registration forms for workman's comp and unemployment, but he wanted more.

{"title": "A Week At Warp Speed", "date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "text": "Warp speed indeed. I sit, attempting calm, at the gate in the Manchester NH airport after having discovered (at the TSA check-in) that I LOST MY DRIVER'S LICENSE (!!!) sometime during the week. Either that or I packed it. I could easily have packed it (or left it in the rental car) as I am in an exhausted (but happy) fog after a week of advanced weaving with Tom Jipson at Harrisville Designs. Before I write anything else, I have to say that if there is ANY way I can do this again next year, I will (as will most of my classmates--some of whom were repeaters this time).Some might think that a week spent in a weaving class would be relaxing, calming and balancing--and for some I'm sure it was. But in my usual fashion I threw myself headlong into the class determined to wring every drop of experience from it that I could, and to push my projects to the limits. For example, for the first project we were asked to weave a color blanket to demonstrate perception of color based on the colors' value and proximity to each other. Harrisville has 64 colors of Shetland wool in production from white to black. The looms we worked on were 22\" wide so we could, at most, weave 22 1\"-wide samples in the warp and then use all 64 colors for the weft.We could extend the project by doing it on a 36\" wide loom (36 colors max), or we could extend it by weaving a black thread in between all the colors in the warp and in the weft. Guess who was the only one (out of the four advanced students) in the class who did either the 36\" or the black boundary. And in the interest of full disclosure, I did both. I finished my color blanket the same day as two of the others did (the fourth advanced student was *really* fast), but where they finished by 4:00 pm on day 2, and only worked until 8:00 at the latest on day 1, I finished at 10:00 pm on day 2 after also working till 10:00 pm on day 1.I had a guilt-free (no fall-out on others if I failed) opportunity to push everything to the maximum--and, as is so rarely the case, I actually finished every task in the time I allotted myself. Which is not to say I did not occasionally have help. Somehow, no matter where I go, I manage to accrue a village. On Thursday night at 11:00, when it was time to wind a humongous warp onto the loom, four of my fellow students stepped up and helped me get it done. I could not have managed without them that night. Left to my own devices (and tears--there would have been tears) it would have taken the entire next day to get the warp on--leaving me no time at all for weaving it as the class ended (for most) Friday at 4:00.But enough on pushing limits. This time was good for me on so many levels. I had planned to have a single room as historically I have not shared a room well with others (Todd and Dee at the BMAC and ACRE being the exceptions). However I was so happy with my roommate Charlotte that when the opportunity arose two days into the class to move into a single room, I chose not to.More than half of the class stayed in the old mill boarding house, me included. The boarding house is a large brick building with the town's one daycare on the first floor, artist studios on the second floor, and several bedrooms, two tiny bathrooms, an eating area and a living room for the students in the attic/third floor. None of the rooms has locks on the door--not even the bathrooms. They, at least, have hooks on the inside, but the bedroom doors don't even have those, and the front doors are never locked. The town is not on the way to anywhere, and the inhabitants' philosophy seems to be, if you locked your doors, how would anyone leave anything for you?Other peculiarities of the town which greatly add to it's charm are the lack of modern businesses: There are no gas stations, no supermarkets, no fast food restaurants--in fact I'm not sure there are any restaurants. I certainly didn't go to one. There is a General Store/ Cafe that has an eclectic selection of everything including daily specials to take home and reheat for dinner. One day I had a pound of stuffed grape leaves for lunch and dinner (with some soup, bread and wine) and they were delicious. The coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and breakfasts were also wonderful. Even the local post office with it's quirky postmaster (the only person working the window) was an exquisite slice of life from another, slower, more community-focused time.I could go on and on waxing rhapsodic about Harrisville Designs, the class, the town, the people (new Englanders in general), my classmates, the wool--in short EVERYTHING about the last week, but I am home now, and my family awaits. Today we are all pitching in to clean up the basement. When that's done I will be able to get to my loom again, and maybe I will be able to carve out some time to re-create my experience of wonder here at home. You can read more about Historic Harrisville, a truly innovative model of historic conservation, on their website. And of you ever get the chance to visit, don't hesitate."},
{"title": "The Day Flies Already", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2011", "text": "In the spirit of Posting Every Day, I am dashing off a quick one before getting the kiln loads in. Yesterday really had its ups and downs. I am having great difficulty making any headway on the items on my To Do list. While this sounds like an inconsequential problem as problems go, it is causing me Great Anxiety. Enough anxiety that I was up and stressed at 5:30 am again this morning. Well, maybe \"up\" is a bit of a stretch. I did get up for a couple of minutes for nature, but I wasn't really \"up\". In fact I wasn't even totally awake; I was in more of a half state, plagued with horrible, anxious dreams and semi-lucid fears of deadlines looming. I am reminded of one of my favorite signature tags: \"I love deadlines. I especially like the whooshing sound they make as they go flying by.\" --  Douglas Adams. Only I am not so much loving them right now (where did I put the Tums?). Let's move on to yesterday's highlights. The phone rang right after we opened and it was an enameling artist wanting to know about using Bullseye powders for copper enameling. After a few minutes of talking, he announced that he was really more of a visual person and could he come over and see what I was talking about. I said sure, and thus began a very enjoyable couple of hours picking the brain of another wholesale production glass artist/small business owner (jack-of-all-business). Houston Llewllyn has not been making a living at enameling copper art pieces for long, but he sure has built an incredible business. He is so organized I feel like a total slacker--and the quality of both the art and the manufacturing are amazing. He casually left one of his pieces for us as thanks for the time we gave him, and it now has pride of place on our mantle. He left with several bottles of Bullseye powders, and though I fear they are not going to work for him as well as true enamels do (color saturation issues), I really hope they work out and we see more of him. (And I want to pick his brain for the enameling section of the new book.)But after Houston left, everything went to hell in a handbasket (I can't resist: \"Houston, we have a problem\"). I didn't have time to get my kiln loads in for the day, and, Primus, the first glass furnace and the one I put back into service after bring both of them back from Olympic Kilns on Tuesday, started acting up again. He errored out on Tuesday night so I had to cancel yesterday's lesson and started his warm-up all over again. He reached temp (2100 degrees F) between 5:00 and 6:00, and the temperature suddenly and inexplicably started dropping. Tadashi and I both tried everything we could think of to figure out what was wrong, but we failed. Fortunately, Secondus, the second glass furnace (I just noticed that all the Olympic Kilns are male and the Denvers and the Skutt are female... wonder what that's all about) was ready to jump in and take over... but his cord wouldn't reach the outlet with Primus in the way. Sigh. After a run to Lowe's by Tadashi and some electrical-extension creation, we got Secondus loaded up and he seems to be chugging along fine this morning. Now I need to figure out when I can get Primus back to Olympic for some extended testing (I leave Sunday for a week-long weaving workshop at Harrisville Designs on Sunday).But I must end on a happy note. Today is my 16th wedding anniversary and I couldn't be luckier or happier in my marriage. Thank you, Dave, for the best 16 years of my life. Now off to load those kilns!!!!"},

I'm sure there are people who fell into the Net years ago and someday they will wake, like Rip Van Winkle, to peer blearily around and find decades have passed since they sat down. I try to carefully manage my loose browsing time, but occasionally I'll just surf to see what's out there--usually to see if someone has put up anything new about Siyeh Studio, or to see how we rank in Google for different search queries. Yesterday I found out I am being seriously dinged for using the term \"kiln-forming\" instead of fusing and slumping on my website. I say dinged because it's the newbies I want to find me, and they most likely think of the technique as glass fusing or glass fusion. (Maybe I need a terminology page on the website and I can say \"fusing\" there a lot to boost my rank...).But enough asides. Part of my search motivation yesterday came from a call I got out of the blue from Carolyn Edlund at the Artsy Shark. She wanted to know if I'd be willing to have her feature our Date Night in the Glass Studio in an article on her site. She was also planning to include the video of me speaking on Outside-The-Box-Thinking: Secrets of Retail Success at last winter's Buyer's Market of American Craft in Philadelphia. Video? I didn't know there was a video. I have mixed reactions to the existence of a video without my knowledge, but at least I was apparently having a Good Hair Day and I don't think I sounded too stupid. However it would have been nice to be asked if I minded being slapped up on YouTube. (I got permission from all of our date night attendees before I plastered them all over the Net!)Last note of the day: It's a good thing I didn't let hubris get the best of me yesterday as I didn't even get through the three things I had on the list--the newsletter lies fallow, the glass order is not yet unloaded, the glass furnace is acting up again (Error-1 last night some time--I think it's balking at heating a solid 80 lb block of glass in a 50 lb crucible), and I didn't get my kiln loads in. Add to that that I ended yesterday's post with the thought that there was something I wanted to start with this morning and I can't remember what it is now (senior moment), and, well, no room for hubris here."},

I just got back from a wonderful family vacation (and as shown by the photo, I even got a kiss from a sea lion--as did Jessie), and it's a good thing it was wonderful as I had to scramble right back into the saddle again. Of course I spent much of yesterday trying to find the saddle...This morning I am working from Olympic Kilns while they service our two glass furnaces. I should have brought the back-up in for service a couple of months ago, but I was lazy and thus caught with my pants down when the main furnace went down right before I left for the aforementioned vacation. Now I pay the price as I had to schlep two heavy furnaces up here at the same time. When I get back to the studio this afternoon Dave will help me unload them, and then I'll have to charge and fire one up for the dates this weekend.Also on tap for today is the unloading of the latest order from Bullseye--cullet, sheet, frit, stringer and rod--everything I need for a big fall sale. Dee is coming down to help me unload (hope it's stopped raining by the time we're ready to start). And speaking of sales; the infamous-not-yet-published fall newsletter will feature a great deal on a beginner's fusing and slumping kit which includes our favorite tools, kiln and a selection of glass. What could be better? (I know--actually getting the newsletter done!). In the spirit of slowing down and being reasonable with the amount I plan for a day, I think I'll stop there. I was going to say I'll round the day off with updating the studio mailing list, redoing the front page on the website, and working on integrating my retail materials/tools/kiln inventory into my point of sale software--including incorporating the barcode system, but, come on, there are only so many hours left in the day!!"},
{"title": "Hubris and Happy Birthday", "date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "text": "I post from Radial Cafe as I enjoy a birthday breakfast with my spouse (his birthday, not mine). He returned home late last night from his regular 3-day-long-every-3-week stint in Austin. I was (and still am to some extent) exhausted to the point where he expressed concern. I was at a loss to explain my unusual fatigue as I have been doing pretty much my normal amount of work all week (plan curtains and painting--for the house not the studio, make and ship orders, commission new storage for the studio, have it installed and fill it (or, rather, watch as Dee mostly fills it), do a complete materials inventory, show planning... you know, a little of everything). Then I had an epiphany! Judy is also on vacation this week so I have been doing her work as well as mine--scheduling and payment for date nights, lessons and classes, chatting with everyone coming in to pick up the work, and endless hours on the phone. It's no wonder I am exhausted--I have been doing the work of three! Don't get me wrong, it's not that I didn't realize how much they both do, I just lost track of the fact that, if they were gone, their work would still need to done and I would be the one doing it. Actually I roped Mom into doing it too--she made J's lunch and got her off to school Wednesday while I drove to Commerce to get work from Black Cat ArtWorks, and she also picked her up Wednesday afternoon while I worked at the studio. She also worked in the studio yesterday afternoon while I went to an appointment, she'll work there again this afternoon while I clean up the back yard for Dave's party tonight, and she made dinner and got J to bed last night while I put kiln-loads in. (I bet she's exhausted too!) Even with her help, however, I had a hard time staying on top of everything home and studio-related. I'm glad Dave's home and Judy will be home next week. I let hubris my nemesis get the best of me, and I am sorely chastened.On a slightly happier note, Book Deux is official; yesterday the publisher approved the editor's proposal for a (gulp) 240 page softcover book to be published May of 2013--manuscript due May 1, 2012.

My schedule for the next couple of weeks is a nice blend of production work, planning (winter BMAC booth location and size), and development (website/newsletter--I can always hope!) with a dash of artist interaction as I spend a day with Dee in her studio playing studio elf for her. There are about 15 things on the to-do list that have been making me procrastinate, and I *will* knock them out this morning (focus, focus, focus). I also need to put some time into (drum roll, please) Book Two.Book Two is in early stages; no green light (approval meeting at the publishers later this week), no contract yet (after publisher approval that takes another month), but there is a preliminary manuscript deadline (May 1), and a preliminary publication date (May 2013). I have a target length (200-240 pages), and a pretty complete outline. The content will include best studio practices, advanced techniques and projects, and it will finish with other artist collaboration (i.e., roll-ups). That, at least, is the first-pass plan. It will be interesting to look back at this post in seven months to compare reality with plan.I am much more relaxed, much less naive, and much more organized about the initial processes of this book. This time around--especially given the serious size jump (128 pages to over 200) and the concomitant lack of increase in time to get it done (I either have the same amount or slightly less)--I am proactively, officially setting up an Open Project project plan with resources (contributors), tasks and a schedule (tote that barge, lift that bale!). I even have a trial run to learn Open Project--the Waldorf Holiday Fair 4th Grade activity, code name: Viking Tales. Last year I managed the mummies in an obstacle course through the excavation of a mummy's tomb complete with lots of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. This year I am calling on ALL of the other 4th grade parents to help conceptualize, construct, co-ordinate and staff this year's Viking adventure complete with Norse Runes.But now it's time to get to that mountainous to-do list so I have time for another glass blowing lesson this week. Last week all I did was blow bubbles for two hours (an example shown at the beginning of this post) and IT WAS FANTASTIC. I really felt like I learned not only different techniques, but the rationale for them, historical/cultural context (Italian vs. Swedish vs. German techniques), and whole-body integration of them.

Oh yes, and I detox... again.The new girls, Sadie and Half MoonIt's the end-of-summer detox through Kashi Yoga and I am so stressed and off-balance from the last six months that I decided to take a wee pause and immerse myself in the detox. Well I'm immersed alright. I'm caffeine-deprived, sugar-deprived, alcohol-deprived and seriously craving donuts!! This is the toughest detox I've done since the first one. (I'm sure Judy is going to hide under her bead after reading this post and not come in tomorrow.)The Villager, AuburnSpeaking of tomorrow, Dee is coming down to help me put the final touches on the book outline which heads to the publisher for review and approval Thursday. I am *finally* moving ahead with this project after ten months of inactivity! Well, inactivity on it at least. And now that I think a bit more, I might be right to be scared right now as last year when I thought I'd finally have the margin to do the book, everything went to hell in a handbasket. I WILL slow down, I WILL slow down, I WILL slow down, I WILL slow down, (Brenda \"the Train\" Griffith).The rolling of the Toomer OaksLast weekend Todd and I spent a couple of days at Ingrid Brown's The Villager gallery in Auburn, Alabama. It was an Auburn football weekend, and it is very difficult to convey to someone who has not lived through it exactly what that means. It means that over 87,000 people were in the stadium watching the game. Thousands of them (quite literally) came through the gallery while we were there. It had the same feel as the One of a Kind Show and Sale in the Merchandise Mart in Chicago with throngs of people packing the aisles all the times for two days--except during the game. We had a lot of fun (and sold a lot of work) and are looking forward to going back next year. We were also fortunate enough to see the \"rolling\" of the live oaks kitty corner from Toomer's Drugstore when Auburn won. Those trees have a long history (with a recent sad entry), and it was interesting to see the sea of toilet paper covering them. The toilet paper (interesting note) is now hand cleaned off since the poisoning.____________________ Now since it's really Wednesday and Dee has come and gone, I best get on to today's post!"},
{"title": "Roll-Ups In the Fall", "date": "Wednesday, September 07, 2011", "text": "Some may shout with glee when spring has sprung, but for me there is no  greater joy to be found than that of the first cold day of impending  fall. Today we (Tadashi, Amy Dee and I) did Pop Art roll-ups in the  hotshop to send to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston for the grand  opening of their renovated flagship store in the contemporary wing. It  was a *very* challenging day and I'm afraid Tadashi was tested almost to  his limits.Challenges (opportunities!) began with the very first piece when I overheated the collar and covered the hole on the blow pipe with glass. With roll-ups you do a lot of work  before ever starting to blow the piece out so it was a long time later before we discovered the piece wouldn't expand properly. Others might have given up and chucked the piece--it was a practice slab after all--not predestined for a specific gallery. But Tadashi is a consummate professional. He puntied the piece up, made another collar on a new blow pipe, sealed it to the opening where the old blow pipe had been and continued to blow it out. However no sooner had we recovered from that disaster when, during a re-heat, I jumped the yolk off the rails in front of the glory hole and bumped the piece into the top of the glory hole doors (covering it with schmutz) while trying to get it out. Tadashi, calm and unflappable, used a Dremel with a diamond bit to clean the schmutz off, and we continued on again. It took an hour 45 to complete that one roll-up--and it was the practice piece for the order! Amy and Dee showed up to help before the first piece was finished and marveled at the quality (and quantity) of the save. But even with their help and the cool weather, the rest of the pieces didn't flow as smoothly as they might have. I'm not going to actually write up the entire litany of our woes  in this post, but just know that there was much woe, and Tadashi pulled out a perfect save on each and every piece. We finished another three roll-ups before 5:00, and we were pretty wiped. Amy brought over a Giordano's pizza (carried back frozen ready-to-bake from Chicago) and cooked it in our oven for lunch and it helped maintain our energy, but there is no doubt that a couple of months of no roll-ups took their toll on everyone.After Amy and Dee left, I finished getting in my last kiln load of the day and Tadashi started on midnight blue and orange twist paperweights for me to take to Auburn tomorrow for the weekend in the gallery Todd and I are doing at The Villager. I am both looking forward to the trip and wishing I had another three days in the studio. The deadline for Niche Award submissions looms and I still have my piece to do (3-D dry screen printing in glass--oooooh!). I also have a conference with my editor at Lark on Monday about book deux, and she would like to see the outline in advance... Tomorrow is another week!"},

It was a Monday almost OFF. Not quite all--I answered some email, did some planning, and made some calls--but I did keep it low key. Tomorrow Dave heads off to Austin again and I have three days of heads down work. First thing I need to do is update the answering machine with the new days and hours.\r\rBut today's post is not about tomorrow's minutiae. Today's post is about the chicks! And the buns! You've probably heard about chicks in the city. Well, I have chicks in the studio--chickens, that is. We have a small flock--seven hens: Willow, Creamy, Tuxedo, Cookies & Cream, Sundust, Nightshadow, and Pearl--and they now live in the back of the studio yard with Jessie's two bunnies. The bunnies are Jasmine and Char--1129 Charcoal Grey (she is a Bullseye bunny, after all). J wouldn't let me retroactively name Jasmine to 1429 Silver Grey--more's the pity. Dan, our wonderful carpenter built us a Bullseye play yard and coop (got to love all those empty glass crates) in the studio yard and now all we have to do is wait for the eggs... till December or so. They're young chicks. The rest of their pictures can be found on our Facebook page here.\r\rSo why did we get chickens for the studio? I'm not really sure, but it made sense at the time--and we like eggs. And our backyard was full. It's really all of a piece as Jessie runs over to the yard and lets them out of the coop every morning and feeds and waters them (she'll also be on egg collection when there are eggs to collect), and then puts them back in at night. The bunnies and chicks living together are purely the fault of the Hencam lady..."},
{"title": "Late, Late, Late!", "date": "Thursday, August 25, 2011", "text": "It seems like just yesterday I wrote I'd be posting every day again... Life, it's what's happening! This morning I sit in Kavarna poised to move full-time into a new studio direction. How exactly I will implement this new vision is still being fleshed out. Certainly the cut-back in the open hours of the studio will be a part of it, but at the same time I am looking to increase the accessibility and value of the studio for our customers. Right now we are open a lot of days a week for walk-in traffic in a non-walk-in-friendly location and have a decent-ish web presence. I need to turn that around. Bullseye has begun two new programs for education and affiliation that look like a perfect match for where I would like to be--more virtual and virtually full-time without killing myself by trying to be *really* full-time. I have said for years that I need a couple of clones of myself. Well what better way to clone oneself than through the web?\r\rOf course as soon as I come up with a plan, Loki (the trickster), tries to throw a monkey wrench in it. I taught yesterday and two of the students really loved kiln forming and want to take more classes. I, of course, said yes there are more classes they can take, and they can also come in for open studio... Then I remembered I am cutting back on teaching and open studio this fall and felt awkward. Today I have a family group of 7-10 people coming in to do a little glass blowing with Tadashi and a little kiln-forming with me and I am a bit grumpy because I don't have an uninterrupted day (again) to spend with my family. Balance. It's all about balance.\r\rNow I need to get this post out, have breakfast, and get to the studio to finish preparing for the group. Tomorrow's post Studio Chicks and Buns!"},
{"title": "Coming of Age", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2011", "text": "They say (the ubiquitous \"they\", arbiters of life) not to make any major decisions for six months after the death of a loved one. We are now homing in on six months after my father's death, my mother moving in with us, and a major tilt of my world axis. Even before then, however, I was straining for a path, balance, satisfaction--searching for that 'click' that happens when you know you're where you're supposed to be and doing what you're meant to do. I've come close before, but the deep, resonating 'click' has eluded me. Now, after a decade of mostly reacting, jumping first and looking later, talking about building my business and slowing down with the same breath, I sit in a calm, centered place (sadly not Montana), and I see what I need to do. And I feel peace and the rumbling purr of a choice well-made and in the right direction. What can I say? I'm a late bloomer (or 50--it's the new 40!).\r\rSo here are the personal facts (note how all of them begin with \"I\"... get it? Personal?):\rI like people in small doses.\rI do not like the obligation of five or six days a week of retail, phones, lessons, date nights, classes, and people trampling around in my artistic space.\rI really don't like being identified to said people as \"our kiln-forming instructor\" (talented or otherwise) instead of The Studio Owner, Empress Of All She Surveys (I only have my tongue a little in my cheek there--even Artist Extraordinaire, or Author of the best-selling (on Amazon anyway) \"A Beginner's Guide to Kiln-Formed Glass\" would be better than what I currently get.)I like my production work and have not had any time or spare energy to develop more of it in the past two years.I would like to grow in other artistic directions, e.g., the 3-D printing technique I learned from Steve Royston Brown prior to BECon this year, casting (introduced to me by Linda Ethier in a pre-BECon workshop *two years ago*), silkscreening glass on glass, pottery (glaze is glass, after all, and I am fascinated with integrating glass and clay), etc.I need family time that happens naturally and doesn't feel stolen. If I have to wrench myself away and suffer great guilt when I stop working before 9:00 pm, I had damn well really be raking in the Big Bucks so that I have something to show for all my hard work in my old(er) age and wow is this one not happening!Okay. Enough whinging about poor, pitiful me (I was going to say whining, but I really like the Aussie term). Now let's look at how I run the studio from the cold, analytical space of business and finance:\rThe most profitable activity in the studio is my production work.Classes (as I have set them up) are profitable if there is only one person eating the tuition pie, i.e., if I want to do all the teaching (and if each class has at least four people in it). Otherwise classes require more time, effort, salary, and materials (money) than they bring in (a net loss). Classes that are profitable (i.e., cost more and last longer--check out the Bullseye Resource Center class lists) do not fill here. I don't know if they fill for Brad Walker, Judith Conway, Paul Tarlow, Kari Minnick, or any of the other studio owners whose businesses I admire, and who seem to be able to pull off all the marketing and community-building required for a good retail business.Date Night is fun, a great concept, and a good way for someone working for me to make a living. It's another net loss for me as it is just not priced (or price-able)  to share the income pie (especially when the personal cost of my space and peace enters into it).Other factors in my decision-making process are the wishes and needs of the people who work for me. Not only do I no longer want to go full speed ahead, they do not want to either. One of them has also moved a significant distance from the studio so a daily commute for a couple of hours of work is out of the question--he needs scheduled, full days.\r\rSo it's time to give up on the Kevin Costner model of retail (if you build it, they will come), and move to something a little more 21st virtual century, and, dang it, something a little less at everyone else's whim and convenience (I'm whinging again, aren't I...). My proof on the evidence for the wisdom of the decision comes from last year's Date Night data. Last August was our busiest month ever (!), or so we thought.\r\rHowever, last August we only offered 11 date slots a week. We were pretty much booked in advance all the time. I thought if we expanded our offering we would book the expansion too because we were booked so far out. Turns out that 14-18 hours a week is about the time Atlanta wants to spend on Date Night at the Glass Studio no matter how many times are available. The extra times just seem to make them feel more sanguine about getting in whenever they want so we get a lot more last-minute bookings than we used to--unsettling for the staff who don't know till the last minute if they will be working or not.\r\rAs far as the retail part goes, if I were in a shopping center or other retail area, I would feel much more obliged to be open at least five days a week. But I'm not: I'm in a 1920's Craftsman bungalow that was originally purchased to be my personal studio--not a retail/teaching space. I'm happy to run over to the studio anytime someone wants to buy something (it's not like it's a huge commute). I just don't feel the need to be responsible for being there working set hours each day (nor is it cost-effective to pay someone else to sit there twiddling her thumbs waiting for customers to show up all day every day). I am not--nor do I wish to be--the WalMart of glass open whenever οἱ πολλοί feel like shopping.\r\rFinally, my extended time in Montana this summer shoved my face in the benefits of being able to focus on one thing at a time instead of running around flapping like a headless chicken. And I liked it. Now that I have finally come up for air for the first time since January, I am ready to winnow, to pare down, to divest, to find serenity, joy, calm and my groove again. And my decision 'clicks' down to my toes.\r\rThe result: I am changing the studio hours for fall to Thursday - Saturday, 10-5. I am offering regular beginning kiln-forming classes one weekday and one weekend day every three weeks. Glassblowing--both lessons and Date Nights--will be offered Thursday - Saturday (still tentative on those days, but it will be only three days) until the slots are regularly filled and then expansion will be done one day at a time, staff permitting. These changes take effect September 7. I feel better already."},

{"title": "Dear UPS Claims", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2011", "text": "As I indicated in the message I left Monday, I am not at the studio number for the next week. I am in Montana and need to be called on my cell phone (XXX-XXX-XXXX) with any questions. You can also use the following land line number (XXX-XXX-XXXX). Alternatively, email (to the return address on this letter) also works for any questions you might have as to how it was packed (bubble wrap, 2\" clearance on all sides, Styrofoam peanuts packed tight around all the bubble wrap--makes the amount of crushing even more impressive), or what the claim amount was (one piece--which was valued at $155--out of the box--which was valued at $940--out of the shipment--which was valued at $1,703).I left two messages with your agent asking her to please call me to clear up conflicting voicemail, email, carrier, and postal mail communication I received about this claim. I never received a call back. I was told the claim had been denied (postal mail). I was told you needed more information (voicemail). My carrier tried twice (the first time I wasn't there) to pick up the package for inspection from me when I had clearly stated that it was (quite logically) at the receiver's. I was asked to send photos of the damage--supposedly after it was inspected--when I got the package back. This was all very confusing, and, quite honestly, I felt like you hoped I would just give up and go away if you made it confusing enough.So let's cut to the chase:I am a glass artist. My clients are galleries and stores across the country. I ship with UPS almost daily when I am in production (most of the year). My breakage rate is extremely low. I have watched a carrier drop one of my boxes from the top of his dolly to the ground when he was loading it onto the truck (all glass contents, nothing broken). I pack my work for rough handling.And, yet, those times when I do have a claim, it is invariably, immediately denied and I have to go through a long song and dance (just like I'm doing now) to get it approved. I have shipped over $49,000 in work with UPS so far this year (since January 1). This is the only claim I have had in that time period. The claim is for $155 + shipping to replace the one piece broken in the shipment. It is not for the $960 listed on the claim status page on my UPS online. I would appreciate any further questions to me regarding this claim be directed to the contact points listed above, and, frankly, I would appreciate the claim being paid asap so I don't have to spend any more time (which is money) on it. Thank you."},
{"title": "Why I Like Production Work", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "text": "The past few days have been filled with firings of production work for orders and examples of production work for the upcoming Buyer's Market of American Craft show in Baltimore. As I sweltered in my 82 degree, humid studio Saturday afternoon and evening, I realized anew how much I like doing my current work. Yes, it is production work--which means that I might make anywhere from one to 40 of the same piece at the same time--but it is so much fun to make each and every one that I can't even think of it as making \"the same thing\" over and over. Color-blending frit rules. Then there is the beauty in the layout of the many as well as the beauty of the one. It's almost like quilting with glass.When I crank the iPod up and rock out my 80's music, I like to focus on the larger patterns of the layout on my work table that will be lost as soon as the pieces are moved to the kiln. For example, the layouts shown are of 24 6\" square plates in the \"Fresh\" colorway. I laid up 12 pieces at a time and got lost in the flow of the frit across piece boundaries. Notice the direction of the color in the squares in the first set above (photos taken after layers four and six) and the layout of the squares in the second set (also after layers four and six). I try to use the same pattern whenever I lay up a large number of square pieces, to minimize errors from exuberant but careless frit flinging, and in the second lay up I accidentally flipped one of the squares 180 degrees. The difference was obvious--and fascinated me--after the fourth layer, but it was much tougher to spot after the sixth.Can you see how I would get lost in the patterns? Every piece is the same, and every piece is different. Each layer of frit and color brings a new pattern, a new watercolor painting for me to admire before I move each piece to the kiln for the glass to be transformed in texture, color, transparency by the heat. These 24 pieces are part of the current order from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. I fused 78 pieces for them since I got back from Portland last Tuesday night.Notice I said \"fused\". I am on my way to Montana today after only five days in the studio. I had over 160 pieces to make between my return from Portland and leaving for the BMAC next week and even firing full loads in every kiln every day, there was no way to get them all done. The only way to meet all the deadlines was to outsource some of the work. Clearly it wouldn't be efficient to both fuse and slump some pieces, but it worked out quite well for me to do all the fusing and then have someone step in to help with the slumping.Lucky for me I have A Village--in this case, my long-suffering husband and Judy are stepping in to slump everything for me. It will take them five or six days to get it all done (and require meticulous instructions and firing schedules from me to make it work), but I have faith that they will rise to the occasion and I will come back from Montana next Wednesday to all orders shipped, and all my new work for the BMAC done and ready to load up Thursday (I leave for Baltimore Friday... WHEEEEE!!!!!) After 16 years, am I making a glass artist of my spouse, or does he just feel really, really sorry for how overwhelmed I am right now??I took this final picture a couple of weeks ago when I had an order for four large award pieces and 58 earring trees in cobalt blue and lime green. I didn't have the cobalt/lime glass already made so I had to run up a few sheets to smash. The picture is of the four awards--16\" X 24\" each--and the six 4\" X 20\" strips of cobalt and blue.

{"title": "Life Changes", "date": "Friday, June 24, 2011", "text": "Today we got our first twinge of empty nest/how-fast-she's-growing-up syndrome as we packed Mom, Jessie, Baxter, Jig (the dogs) and Bailey (Mom's bird) into the car and sent them off to Montana. Even though I am flying out on Monday to meet them in Missoula and do the final driving lap with them, it was still an emotional parting. I think one thing that made it so big was I decided at 8:45 last night to see if I could activate J's iPhone and turn it from an iPod to a real phone. We weren't going to let her have a phone until she was 20--or at least 12--because we didn't see the need. But my Mom is trying hard to be the last person left on the planet without a cell phone and we really didn't want them driving 2200 miles without one. How life has changed in the past 20 years. I (as did everyone else) thought nothing of heading across country on my own in a less-than-reliable car with not even a phone card--much less a cell phone.So now J has a phone, and it's as much so she can call us whenever she wants to as it is for safety. Maybe more. We just had our first chat (she called from Nashville) and I miss her so!!! The saga of the phone was quite funny. Turns out once a SIM card in a phone has been used it can never be provisioned again. As J has a used iPhone the card was no longer viable. No problem, you can buy a SIM card at CVS or WalMart. So while I am setting everything up with AT&T on the phone, Dave heads to WalMart (and we pause the Princess Bride--we had all been watching it for the 9000th time). Unfortunately when he gets back he tells me that they didn't have any SIM cards  so he had to buy a disposable phone instead. But we live in the days of Miracles and Wonder, and the AT&T rep walks me through taking the SIM card from the disposable and putting it into J's iPhone. Voila--a new phone for $9.99 and no contract added to our family plan! It was pretty smooth and amazing.We finished the Princess Bride (all but Mom who had given up and gone to bed in the middle of the tech storm) and fell into bed for a short five hours sleep before getting up to have a last family breakfast and send the travelers off. The last photos of the evening are of Dave and the J in their new BECon wear (J had to stand on the coffee table so I could get them both in the pic with my iPhone)."},

I am hoping that my upcoming visit to Hugh McKay's Cast Glass Forms foundry with Cynthia with rekindle the zest and sharpen my laser focus on casting.Even more compelling to me right now than casting, however, is to continue my explorations of creating 3-D glass forms from glass powder cradled in clay powder and laid down on the kiln shelf through a series of screens--the lo-tech 3-D printing I learned in Steve Brown's workshop. Think of it as dry silkscreen printing over and over in the same spot until it's really, really thick.   This is work I could easily do with a bag of clay powder, a kiln shelf, some mullite dams, a bunch of glass powders and a kiln. Oh yes and some screens (which I have from my class) sieves, sifters and brushes. It seems like a lot, but unlike lost wax casting, it's a very clean process with none of the messy boiling, spitting water from a wallpaper steamer melting out wax from a mold. A table, a box of dust masks, a little hand broom and dustpan and I'm good to go!So how am I going to accomplish new work this post-BECon when I failed so ignominiously before? Heh. I am going to run away. I mentioned previously that I am going to Montana a bit this summer. The truth is that I am spending the bulk of the summer there, and there isn't a glass studio. Yet. I am looking forward to  beginning one this year. For the present I am not going to try to do my  current production work. Instead, I want to set up a medium-sized  kiln and work in casting with traditional plaster  silica molds and the lo-tech 3-D printing described above. I am leaving Judy in charge of the studio in Atlanta, and Lori, Tadashi, Lee, Domenick, Amy, and Brian will keep the studio running smoothly without me. No equipment will break, nothing outside of the usual course of business will happen, there won't be any art emergencies where a client needs some thing RIGHT NOW... Well, I can dream, can't I?I promised Dave that when I turned 50 I would SLOW DOWN. It's time to make good on that promise, and stepping away from the Atlanta studio a bit  (and setting up a Montana studio) is a good start. Really. Did I mention I am completely obsessed with this screen/powder technique?"},
{"title": "BECon and Artists", "date": "Sunday, June 19, 2011", "text": "Champagne in a lovely highball glass (for breakfast! with toast!), French press coffee with lots of cream in a mug next to it, and the rising and falling conversation of Tadashi and Morganica (Cynthia Morgan) for my music. BECon 2011 is over. My batteries are refilled to the bursting--as is my spleen... (appendix? Liver? Heart? What organ is the creative seat of the body?) I don't know from where the creative juices flow, but they have welled and filled every nook and cranny in my body and I need to get home and let them out. Thank you Steve Royston Brown.The workshop I took from Brown was incredible. Even though my second and third pieces did not turn out (incorrect firing schedules--not enough heat so the middles of each piece [made of glass powder] stayed powder and crumbled to dust when I de-molded them) I am completely inspired to continue this body of work when I return to my own studio practice (more on studio practice in a minute) next week.Who am I kidding?!? When I get back to the studio I am going to dive head-first into orders, work for both the wholesale and retail portions of the BMAC show in Baltimore, running a teaching studio, selling glass and tools, managing a hotshop, setting up a second hotshop/casting studio, having glass date nights, scheduling torchwork beadmaking classes, and managing employees... Making art. *snort* Like I have time for *that*! (But I will, and I'll tell you how tomorrow. Promise. I'm going to take a page from Cynthia's book and write tomorrow's post now--as soon as I finish this one--and schedule it to run tomorrow. Heh. Now more about, well, being an artist.)I have retreated to Morganica's red leather couch with the heather purple knitted throw her mother made over my legs. It's time to really post. The problem with not posting  for a month... er, two months(!) is that if I don't post, it means a LOT is happening that is worth posting about, and the task of getting it all documented may be critically important (at least to me), but it is also physically impossible. Life doesn't stand still just so I can catch up. But I am in charge. I am the adult (snicker). I'm going to jump around a bit and not worry about chronology. Linear order be damned--it may be how things happen, but it doesn't have to be how we think about them, remember them, or chronicle them.Though I just wrote that life doesn't stand still, today, for me, I am making it do just that. I am ruthlessly avoiding any external stimuli. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to meet anyone. I don't want to see anyone else's work or studio or learn about their technique. Today is a day to process everything I took in over the last week and figure out a way to ease it into my own studio practice. See? I now have a studio practice. All the presenters at BECon talked about their practices. For a couple of moments I thought I was at a medical convention, but then I, too, became taken by the imagery of an artistic practice. Hopefully less than doctors (really, hopefully) we actually are all practicing all the time.I am also not an artist, I'm a \"maker\" (the other term used by all the presenters)--which is great because I can't quite get my skin around being an \"artist\"--even after an hour lounging on Morganica's entryway floor last night floor passionately debating what is art and do I do it with her and Tadashi. I woke up this morning with the strong, clear thought that I am an artist. Then I got over it. I don't create just to convey a message or make a statement, and I have a problem with complete lack of utility. Sure, some of my makings are entirely decorative and not at all utilitarian, and I look forward to creating new work that is just as useless but edgy rather than decorative. But whatever I make needs to engage more than the brain through the eyes. I need it to have a touch--a coolness, a softly catching slipperiness, a weight. I need it to change in different lights and contexts.Like an artist, I want my work to provoke a response upon first sight and to continually engage the viewer/toucher. But unlike many artists I have met, I am thrilled with the the response being a completely unintellectual reaction of \"how beautiful!\". Someone wanting to hold and touch my work and to pass it through different lights is the reaction I am usually working to provoke. I don't often want my work to be just a touchstone to provoke an emotional response from the viewer based on his/her philosophical/religious/cultural response. I am not looking to change the world with every (heck, maybe not any) piece I create. It is more important to me to comfort and nurture than it is to shock. Don't get me wrong--I might do work to provoke and shock too, but, if that's all I did, it would simultaneously exhaust me and bore me to tears.There were many artists presenting at and attending BECon. They came from a variety of backgrounds, though painting was a common thread. They had art degrees--many of the presenters had multiple art degrees and academic credentials. (So many, in fact, that I wondered aloud last night if I should pursue an art degree in order to claim a respectable place in the community. Cynthia and Tadashi vetoed the idea.) The artists were as passionate and high-strung as thoroughbred racehorses and I marveled that the worth-of-work issues (reference \"art degrees\" above) I have (usually after being around artists) in my self-identified place on the craft side of the art-craft chasm are apparently vastly smaller than those of the artists on the other side.The people who identify themselves as artists still seem to have as much or more difficulty with their work being accepted by artists in the traditional fine arts media as I do having my work accepted by glass artists. Fortunately for me, it doesn't seem to bother me as much. I was reminded a bit of my time in academia where faculty members used to squabble over the the size of their offices, the number of chairs and windows in said offices, and how they all related to the faculty member's importance in the department. All that said, I am glad to have the title of \"maker\" to adopt."},

(INSERT NOTE: It is now five days since I started this post so make it the most challenging THREE weeks in the studio ever!) Why has it been challenging? Well for one thing, expansion construction continues apace with the extension on the coldworking room almost finished, the new hotshop done but for electric--and a new in-ground trampoline, raised vegetable garden, cinderblock bog pond and 16'X12' 2'-3' deep pond being added to our backyard next to the studio. The design and construction alone were enough to keep me busy full-time, but I didn't HAVE full-time for them. Nope.The Chihuly exhibit at the MFAB continues to be very, very good to me. The museum did a normal order for their stores at the BMAC in February requesting 64 pieces for a 4/1 ship. The exhibit opened on 4/7, and they put in a rush order for another 116 pieces for a 4/15 ship. Now one frazzled month later they are up to 665 pieces to be shipped between 4/1 and 5/31--and the exhibit goes through August 7! I begin to be concerned for my summer travel plans to Montana (and the weaving class I was going to take in New Hampshire in June is now right out...).I already over 100 pieces to ship the first of May from the Buyer's Market (BMAC) show in February--many of them very large. Bertha, Bettina (the big-girl kilns) and I have become very good friends these past few weeks as I have spent every night from 7 pm to 11 or 12 pm with them. I was not alone. My Mom came over every night after dinner for the past week or so and unloaded Bertha and washed and ground the edges (as necessary) on all the newly fused pieces from her so they could g into Bettina for a slump. Dave kept me company and occasionally unloaded Bettina if I hadn't gotten around to it. Jessie swept the studio floors and watered the flowers in the front bed. Judy kept the frit filled and Amy made the morceaux.Roll-ups have also kept us quite busy at the studio, and it's coming up time to review our paperweight line and plan the colors and designs for the upcoming BMAC. Speaking of the BMAC, the calendar looms: the BMAC is hot on the heels of BECon, which begins (for me) the day after my birthday which is just over two weeks away--right after I get back from Phoenix (where I am now with Mom and J visiting Mom's brother, my uncle Ed--shown here with J). Before the BMAC I need to get two more big orders out, figure out what work I'm going to show and make it, have the roll-ups and paperweights photographed, have postcards made... oh yes, and make a new website for Siyeh Studio (as opposed to Siyeh Glass) for my production work.I begin to think my 50th year may be my busiest yet!"},

{"title": "We Now Pause For Station Identifiction", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2011", "text": "I love Mondays anymore. I used to be like any other commuter and hate both the thought and the acts of getting in the car, driving to work. and starting another week. Now Monday is still a work day, and I still have a commute (across the backyards though it may be), but the studio is CLOSED. No one is scheduled to work but me. Can you say \"regroup\"?I have had the fervid intention to post every day since the year began. Last week, not so successful. Was I slacking? Heck no! I taught three classes--two of them with no preparation as they were not on the calendar and when the participants arrived for their classes I was hip-deep in other projects. But they all three went well. I also finalized the schedule and processed the paperwork for the four (four!) new (new!) studio employees, and Judy left Friday on vacation for two weeks... That Judy keeps the entire studio running has never been more apparent than in the past few days. To add another ring to our circus, Dan our wondermous carpenter came and put the sliding glass doors in between the kiln room and the kiln-forming classroom, and today he was scheduled to begin the coldworking room and hotshop expansions and build the ventilation system for the beadmaking classroom. (I say scheduled as he had car trouble and we had to postpone till tomorrow--Whew!)But the cherry on top of the whipped cream on top of the triple-scoop sundae that was my full week last week came when the buyer from the Museum of Fine Arts Boston called Thursday afternoon in  a panic. I shipped them 66 (66!) pieces on 4/1 which were destined to be split between three of their gift store locations. They had another 50 on order to be shipped today as they currently have a self-curated Chihuly exhibit (Chihuly being the self--not the exhibit) in the Art of the Americas Wing and they thought they might sell some glass art in conjunction with it. Yeah. Uhuh. They put out my work on Tuesday to fill in some empty spots in a location they hadn't planned on putting it, and people grabbed it up like it was on sale in Filene's Basement. My buyer upped her order to *116* pieces on Friday and we pushed back the ship date a day (maybe two). That's why I have been in the studio till midnight every night.So the Pause For Station Identification... There are so many directions I am going in right now that I am not sure who I am. Am I still a production glass artist? Not really--production time is relegated to the evenings after my \"real job\". And isn't that a kicker as it's the production work that's bringing in the money to fund everything else right now! Usually it's the day job that pays for the evening's \"art\". No more. In just over a month I'll be 50 and I STILL don't know who I'll be when I grow up. Nevermind who I want to be--who stands still long enough to think about wanting something? Do or Do Not--there is no Want.On the plus side, if I died tomorrow no one could say I hadn't lived a really full life!"},
{"title": "Adversity, Your Name Is Hotshop", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2011", "text": "\"The mark of your true nature is in the grace with which you face adversity.\" Thank you Alicia Lomne for the wonderful quote on Facebook this morning.Yesterday was packed AND challenging for me, as were the two preceding days and as will be today. Yesterday's biggest challenge came in the staff cost of running the hotshop last week with the thermocouple not functioning. When you run a business--no matter how well you run it--there will be weeks you only make a little to bank for the next rainy day, and there will be weeks when you just break even and you're glad to be alive to fight another week. Last week we hemorrhaged money babysitting the thermocouple--It would have cost far less to have just shut the hotshop down rather than to keep it operating sub-optimally.I keep trying to tell myself that it was a one-off week, hindsight is 20-20, etc., but the reality is that last week hit really hard and we can't have another like it. Period. Not a good day to have to go through when planning a hotshop expansion."},
{"title": "Almost Caught Up!", "date": "Wednesday, April 13, 2011", "text": "After two days of post-vacation stress, I am hair-on-fire, full speed ahead. I think I am wearing the very nice people at Olympic Kilns out with me requests for modifications and tweaks to their kilns. I dropped the furnace off yesterday morning to get the thermocouple fixed/replaced and picked up the new bead annealer. Tomorrow I'll take the bead annealer back up to get the doors cut down a little and pick up the furnace. I wish they weren't 40+ miles away, but at least I have the option of going in person and not shipping.Today is payday in the studio--the first payday with all the new staff. On April 1 we had to switch to a formal bi-weekly pay schedule from having one person bi-weekly and two others whenever-there-was-a-sufficient-amount-due as I have hired *four* more people in the past three weeks! Wheeee! We (the current staff) are excited to be joined by Domenick Peronti, production glassblower and teacher; Amy DeBaets, hotshop assistant (extraordinaire); Lori Schinelli, retail glass manager and kiln-forming instructor; and Tadashi Torii, hotshop manager and lead production artist (for roll-up work we finally get to formally add to our studio offerings). Lee will be the lead teacher in the new expanded space. Brian is still a little lonely up in the beadroom all by himself, but Lee is VERY relieved to be cutting back a bit and giving his knees (and fiery hair) a respite from the 50-60 hour weeks in the hotshop. More info on these wonderful new Siyeh staff Coming Soon to the website (and the newsletter--which is not late unless I call it a quarterly newsletter :-).In typical how-much-more-can-I-chew fashion, Dan will be in to start the hotshop expansion (a second hotshop off of the first one about half the size of the original) next week, and I'm also going to ask him to expand the coldworking room at the same time. No time like the present! I just hope the payments for the orders I've shipped so far this year start coming in or things could get ugly. Yes, I could have waited to have the money in hand before scheduling the work, but the stars have aligned for getting the new hotshop done NOW and who am I to argue with the stars? Now that I have three glassblowers chomping at the Date Night/lessons/production bit, I need to have a workspace (and work) for them all. Part of the work will be a renewal of roll-up work in the studio. With only one glassblower, we could barely keep up with Date Nights--much less lessons and, far down the line, new production work. But with Domenick and Tadashi--who worked with Johnathan Schmuck doing roll-ups a few years ago and who has produced them for local artists in his own studio since--we are ready to have an entirely new line of work for this summer's BMAC!Okay, people and projects waiting in the studio, more tomorrow!"},

While no one could ever say it is a copied design, the  similarities are striking enough to me that I thought I'd put the work  out there for comment. What do you think? Did someone see our Balance piece and say, \"Hey, I like that shape! I want to do something like that and call it mine!\"?Today is the ante penultimate day at the beach. Spring break is almost over and we will have to return home to our lives. I have used the time here very productively... to sleep. Yep, I've managed at least 11 hours a day of sleep since we got here last Sunday. I've done a bit of planning and web design work, caught up on date night photo issues and started preparing the next newsletter (already a week late), but mostly I've slept. And as I've slept, I've dreamed. In my dreams I have felt the stirrings of ideas for new designs and a build-up of the energy necessary to realize them. The goal when I get back to the real world (also known as the studio) is to hoard this energy and use it slowly and wisely--no more 17-hour studio days.Of course, I look at my list of the projects I have awaiting me there and it's depressingly long and diverse--nothing sucks up energy more than a bunch of little to medium projects all requiring development of new skills or reawakening of rusty ones. Give me one or two big projects any day. I have to learn to say \"No\" to little repairs--especially stained glass ones. I don't even work in stained glass anymore and I am way out of practice.But worrying about the little things is for after the ultimate (in the sense of last) day at the beach. I'll grumble more next week.Postscript:I went a little ways further through the Artful Home catalog and found the work below (the pieces at right are mine). Even more depressing is that this is someone I mentored at the BMAC a few years ago and encourage every time I see him. There were many times he could have said, \"Gee, I really like your Pop Art series, I think I'll do something like it!\". Am I wrong or petty for thinking he should have?"},
{"title": "Over the Hump!", "date": "Wednesday, March 30, 2011", "text": "Allow me to explain about the glass studio business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. So what do we do? Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery.I finished in the studio at 11:30 tonight and celebrate with another glass of sauvignon blanc which will undoubtedly be finished before I head up to the shower so I'll have to get another one with which to share the shower steam. It was definitely a two-glass-of-wine day.Becky the bookkeeper finished up my 2010 books in her Quickbooks 2011 for Windows last evening just in time for my meeting with my accountant this morning. She sent them to me about 9:30 am so I could import them back into my Quickbooks 2009 for Mac (from whence they originated). Already you know this isn't going to end well...Though I could go on for several scathing paragraphs filled with blistering invective about the absolute ethical impoverishment of the Quickbooks products and Intuit's customer service, it's already all been said (ad nauseum) elsewhere on the web. If they didn't hold all our data hostage, we would have risen up and skinned and eaten every last Intuit employee long ago. Bottom line for me is that after spending *eight hours* trying to get to my own business data (does everyone remember that it is theoretically tax season?), I am still unable to even find out how much I made/lost last year.Those eight hours were filled with entertaining anecdotes including the story of how I had to upgrade my Mac's OS from Leopard to Snow Leopard (the LAST thing you ever want to hear when you are having an application problem is that you'll need to upgrade your computer's operating system in order to run the version of the application that will fix your problem--especially when it doesn't). They were enlivened by having to spend $174 for a new version of QB for Mac (2011). But the REAL frosting on the experience was Becky being told by pro tech support at Intuit (she PAYS them in order to receive service as an accounting professional--she's not just some schmo [like me] calling in) that we would have to pay $750 for them to expedite them fixing my file which is broken due to a bug in the software. Laugh? Cry? You tell me. Pay $750? I think not.Now, as I finish my first glass of wine, I am undaunted, of good cheer and stout heart, and slightly more mellow than I was earlier today. I taught a class tonight, unloaded yesterday's monster kilns loads, loaded all four kilns with new fuse loads, and am home in the same day I left the house. It's a Good Thing. Helen, my accountant is meeting me for breakfast Saturday morning at 9:00 to take my finished books and turn them into a business tax return. Becky is lending me her Windows laptop from tomorrow morning through Saturday morning so I can enter my last 2010 data (mileage, expenses paid from personal accounts, etc.) into Quickbooks for Windows prior to dumping the whole mess in Helen's lap.I should get my glass order in to Bullseye now, but that's going to have to wait till first thing tomorrow. I'm too tigh-tigh. Night all!"},

I shudder to think what time Bertha and Bettina (the big kilns) will be cool enough to unload tomorrow. It'll probably be another late night just because of the timing of the unload. Tomorrow, one last big fuse and the slump loads begin. Thursday is all slump all the time, and Friday we ship.When all is said and done, I like when Dave is in Austin for these big production pushes. He worries when I start work at 8:30 am and end at 12:30 am with just a couple of hours off in the evening for family time (not that he won't worry now from reading this post). Of course I couldn't do it without my mother here to get the J showered and into bed while I head back to the studio.So why am I still up when I have to get up at 7:00 to get the J up, pack her lunch, fix her breakfast, and take her to school? I have to transition. I am sipping a glass of sauvignon blanc, and in another line or two I'll carry it upstairs where it and I will share a hot shower. By the end of the shower, it will be gone, and I will be totally relaxed and ready to crash for six short hours. Tomorrow we crest the hump and start the slide to the bottom of the week.

Wow. Is the universe talking to me through music again? Is it telling me (as my mother hinted this morning) that I am already pretty (over)extended and taking on yet another project at this time might not be in my (or my business' or my family's) best interest? But then Annie Lenox comes on singing that \"sweet dreams are made of these and who am I to disagree?\" and so I must post on about my New Direction. I think it's finally time to bring the F-Word into my business model.At first (as I wrote before), I didn't think I had anything to offer that would make someone want to F=word with me. So I decided to just write up a little e-how-to instead. But Dave remarked again last night how his boss--a very business-savvy man--thought I just should do the F-word, and for whatever reason, this time the idea really resonated with me. Dave also pointed out that you don't make any money writing about something (unless you're Deepak Chopra). Do or Do Not, but don't waste your time writing about for $10 a copy.I even have the perfect candidate in mind for my first partner. She talked to me for well over an hour at the BMAC show in February about how to start. Then she called last week to see where I was on the e-how-to as she had been hoping to get it in time for her first anniversary next week. This morning I am going to call and offer her a different sort of deal.So why has Franchising (Date Night in the Glass Studio) suddenly become so enticing to me? Two reasons: 1) I have finally begun to believe in the uniqueness and value of the business process I have created and the uses of marketing technology that I bring to the table (what's easy and obvious to me ISN'T necessarily to everyone else), and 2) I would happily pay someone else to give me this level of assistance, skill, experience and physical support to get up and running  quickly, so it must be worth it.Now I need to put it all together. What services will we offer? How much will we charge for them, and will it be a flat annual fee or a percentage of bookings? We will need to have a buy-in fee for training and initial materials, but there are advantages and disadvantages to flat fee vs. percentage ongoing. What about equipment? Marketing? Managing the calendar and sign-up? The picture upload system?__________________________________Even after over two hours on the phone with my proposed partner I still have more questions than answers.

{"title": "Doing It For the Money", "date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2011", "text": "As I anticipate the great 50 year marker at which I will arrive in a couple of months, I spend increasingly more time introspecting. This morning's epiphany was about Doing It. Why do we Do It, what do we want/need/get out of Doing It, (and I'm sure you're wondering, what IS It)? Most of us know as we're growing up that we're going to have to Do It. We dream about It, we think about what It will be for us and where we want to Do It, and when we picture ourselves Doing It, it's always the most fun and exciting, novel and unique aspects of It that we see--we certainly never see ourselves being bored Doing It (though we often will be).Our parents encourage us to choose It based on how much we will make Doing It, how much security there is, how much demand for It. They want It to be able to provide for us and our families financially--and, don't get me wrong, financial stability IS important. But when push comes to shove, as it always does, how many of us can really Do It just--or even primarily--for the money? I can't. My spouse can't. Maybe my father did, and he was often miserable--though that brings up another point to address below.My epiphany was brought on this morning when I ran into a parent from Jessie's school  here at Kavarna who works at the school in a parental representative position. She (as always) was full of energy and enthusiasm, zest and focus for her job and the rest of her life. I looked at her as an employer (more on that below) and thought how lucky I would be if I could hire her for the studio. She's educated, articulate, enthusiastic, energetic--and not at all focused on The Money. She couldn't be. Though I don't know how much she makes for the school, I know that if she thought about how many hours she works and how much she makes she would realize that she could Do It at the Publix deli counter and make more money and have more free time for her family than she does now. She doesn't work at the Publix deli counter.Doing It, aka Working, cannot be about the money you garner from the work. If it were, you would inevitably become dissatisfied and think you are worth more than you are making--the expression of which would undoubtedly make your employer think you were worth less. As I looked at this woman this morning I realized that we do not work because we have to for money, we work because we have to to live. Work enables us to feel worth, participate in a community, exercise our brains, be anchored, have a purpose--in other words, to live.When we start thinking about how much we're making for our work compared to how much we're working and we begin to feel resentful, it's not about the money--however much we might say it is--it's about the work. Something about the work is not or is no longer meeting our needs. The answer really isn't to ask for a raise. More money for the same work environment is a short term sop that initially makes us feel more self-worth but doesn't address the real problem. The real problem is either that the negative aspects of the job or the job environment outweigh the positives and leave us feeling down at the end of the day, or that we have intrinsic self-worth issues that keep us from being fulfilled and validated external to the job. In the former case a reworking of the job or it's environmental factors (co-workers) might fix the problem, in the latter, a good therapist would be a good start. In both cases, I really don't believe money is the issue.A physical need for an increase in money may dictate a request for a raise or a job change, but it won't decrease our satisfaction level with our job. Instead we're more likely to regret the change that's being forced upon us by financial responsibility--and we hope we'll be lucky enough to be happy in the next job we have to take based on the remuneration for it.So why am I thinking as an employer right now? Because we are expanding the studio again and I have been putting together salary and benefit packages for potential employees. I have to balance being fair with how much the studio can afford--and it's made me really think about how much (or in this case little) I make and what that means to me. At the end of the day, it doesn't mean a thing. Dave has always said that he'd code even if no one paid him. If he ever works for a company that goes public or is bought by Google or Amazon resulting in millions of dollars for him, nothing about his relationship with his laptop will change--he'll still be plugged in all day every day writing code. He has to code. It gives him joy that cannot matched by anything else long-term. He would wither and die if he couldn't code anymore.I own/run a business and am not burdened with paying the mortgage, the property taxes or our household bills--Dave's salary covers those things. So because I don't HAVE to work for a salary does that mean I work less or take it less seriously? It is to laugh (as Mike would say). I work as I work because of who I am, not what I make, and I work damn hard. I am very fortunate that I lucked into Judy, my studio elf, because she is just the same. She attacks every task with zest and verve and joy. I was very, very lucky to have found her (thank you Lori), and I hope I am as lucky in my upcoming hires. If you have an employee whose first question is always \"What's in it for me/what's it going to cost me?\", no one is going to be happy.Back to my father for a second. He was not happy to actively miserable in his job for much of his 30 years of service (same job, same office, US Forest Service). He was also not happy in his personal life. Was he unhappy in his job because of the job and therefore unhappy in his personal life because of his job, or was he unhappy because that's the way he was? If it had been the job, I would have expected him to be happier in the 20+ years after he retired, but that wasn't the case. There was always something that made him mad, unhappy or just discontented--illegal immigrants were stealing American jobs, there was favoritism in the ski school (he was also a ski instructor), the environment was being wrecked, Someone Somewhere getting Something they shouldn't have and didn't Deserve... (I feel a rant coming on about being so obsessed with what's fair and right that we miss enjoying what is. No time for that today. Need to stay on topic.) My conclusion is that Dad was who he was and all of his experiences were colored by his own inner unhappiness. His unhappiness did not have external causes--it was internally driven. He could be happy for short bursts by achieving some goal, but every success was doomed to be followed by a failure because of how he felt about himself.Now back to the upcoming hires and managing the expectations/happiness of current staff. It's Not About the Money! I cannot let myself be convinced that it is. The idea of a level of experience and education being worth a certain amount of money and having that as a driving concern for a prospective employee is going to be an immediate strong negative flag for me. I need to trust that I have been fair because that's who I am. I have to trust that I do the right thing because that's who I am. I have to Trust and stick to my vision because I can't Do It for the money, and I really don't want anyone around me who thinks they need to.Now, anyone know anyone in the Atlanta area who might be interested in teaching glassblowing, working as a hotshop assistant, or teaching kilnforming/cutting and stocking glass?"},
{"title": "It's a Square World", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2011", "text": "Good morning wet world! It is truly spring in Atlanta. All the cherries, plums, bradford pears, forsythia, and early deciduous magnolias burst into glorious bloom a couple of weeks ago, and now the redbuds are starting to open... and it's raining. I don't mind the rain though, today is a day for getting to studio projects that have languished for too long--repairs, screen-print fuses, and the first round of orders from the BMAC. I'll probably even finish up the bills and supply orders I need to get paid and in (in that order).A hot topic lately in the small artist world is credit card processing with a Square or similar device. Dave, my uber-geeky-technological-and financial-industry-cred-out-the-wazoo spouse got me one (and even set up the account for me--not that I plan to use it) and got himself one too, who knows why! I don't plant to use it as my card processing needs are more geared to card-not-present scenarios (over the phone, over the web sales), and I also have a high enough credit card sales volume that a real business account with lower rates makes more sense to me.However I have been following with interest one of the recent debates as to the safety of the square that has been politely raging on Wendy Rosen's Facebook page for the past couple of days. I know (and highly respect) Cynthia personally, and Guy at TeaMac has been my credit card processor for many years. It's worth a look. (And for the record, I, too, would like more hard reputable test data provided and less the-sky-is-falling hyperbole.)Happy Tuesday!"},

I promised a post on the BMAC, but, sadly, I've already forgotten what I was going to say. (There's a lot of forgetfulness going on here.)The past couple of weeks have been filled with studio and life activity. The new kilnroom is finished, furnished, and I have already taught three days in it. I don't say three classes as the second day was an all-day studio experience for 18 homeschoolers aged 10-15. They divided into groups of six and each group spent two hours with me, Brian and Lee/Becky H. In the Lee/Becky group, they did glassblowing with Lee and read about the history of glassmaking with Becky. It was a wonderful, exhausting day. Last night I had a group of travel planners in town for a workshop who came in and learned some kilnforming, ate pizza, drank wine and made plates. They didn't finish till 10:30 and I am wiped today!Wiped or no, it's time to get last year's accounting finished so I can get everything to my accountant for taxes (late). It's also time to get the newsletter out with next quarter's class schedule and glass specials. Bullseye is tempting me with a special dealers-only curious sale and it could be a lot of fun to have it to offer it this spring with all the new open studio kilnformers.Okay, though blogging is fun, it's time to work on the website!"},
{"title": "Let 2011 Begin", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "text": "It's February 23 and the year has finally settled in for me. Hawaii at the end of last year was wonderful, but I came back all discombobulated. Then there was the Week of Weather in Atlanta. Then my father's death. Then rushing to get ready for the BMAC. Now I am back from the show and FINALLY feeling grounded in the new year! It doesn't hurt that the star magnolias and the camellias in our front yard are blooming now and I had my Best Show Ever at the BMAC last week. Really. And it was the best on so many levels--fastest set-up since going to the big booth, made Great New Friends, sang karaoke for the first time (\"Call Me\" by Blondie--a particularly amusing choice to Todd as he knows how much I dislike talking on the phone), and both my best personal AND best studio sales. I also was tapped by Wendy Rosen to participate in a panel discussion on great outside-the-box ideas for studios and retailers (I presented Date Night). That presentation is now spinning off into an e-document for setting up your own date night--available soon for, oh, probably about $10.Today I spent some time looking at the little 2/2 house next door to our home (which also backs up to the studio property) which has gone on the market for $62,500. It is a pestilent little pit of a place in which the rats and squirrels have reigned unchecked for several years, and the local thieves have stripped all the wire (for copper) and plumbing (also for copper). It needs complete electrical, plumbing, a new roof, new flooring, new kitchen, and structural support in the living room (the owner at some point took out a support column in the middle of the room and put in 2- 2 X 10 beams to support the entire roof system). The windows are in decent shape, the walls are nice (plaster) and the general bone structure is good, but, $62,500... Really?As the day has gone so late (it's almost 5:00) and I still haven't done much of anything, I'll post more tomorrow including an analysis of show sales, a review of set-up and breakdown, and some amusing highlights."},

We did, indeed, pretty much finish setting up yesterday. We went back in this morning about 10:00 and puttered and futzed with Todd's work, the wall pieces, the tabletop display in the center of the booth, vacuuming, adjusting the lights--in short, everything we could think of until 2:00 when we finally packed it in and headed out. I have to admit, it felt really good to walk down the aisles towards the doors between the booths packed with harried, scurrying exhibitors who were trying to get set-up.So this afternoon I worked a bit on my website. I got my on-line payment system set-up and configured for the new class payment processing. I napped. Yes, I napped. And now, with one minute remaining before a new day, I finish my glass of pinot noir and head off to sleep. Tomorrow is going to be another glorious day--beginning with breakfast across the street at Lil Pete's Diner."},
{"title": "Things Come in Threes", "date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2011", "text": "Good Morning Campers! I apologize for the long absence from posting, it's been a hard few weeks. Thank you to everyone who has sent me private condolences on the death of my father. I will be writing to you all individually, I have just been too overwhelmed up to now. This post is for Dee (even though she already knows the contents as she is right here--we're sharing a room  in Philadelphia).It's that time of year again and we're gearing up for this weekend's Buyer's Market of American Craft 2001 part 1 (part 2 is in Baltimore in July). The past 28 hours have already been an exciting rollercoaster ride--Here's to the hope that the rest of the show isn't \"Interesting Times\" too. The title of today's post about things coming in threes refers to studio disasters coming in threes, as so far this morning I have had to fix three doozies.Disaster #1: Right before I left for Philly yesterday, the studio phone rang and it was a woman who wanted more information about the DealSwarm offer. Umm, the offer wasn't supposed to go live yesterday, it was supposed to go live today. Today when the studio is open  so we can answer the phone calls from people with questions about the deal (we were closed yesterday as we were open Monday for Valentine's Day). Today when I have an article about our website clarifying the deal details. Today when we are ready. NOT Yesterday! the article is up, Judy is in and answering the phone, we'll see what we can do.Disaster #2: I noticed this morning that my bank reversed a $3,000 check I deposited in my account on Monday. The check was from one of my business accounts to another so I know it was good. When I called to ask what had happened (I have checks to my vendors and service providers out against that money), I was told that there was \"an erasure\" on the check so the ATM rejected it. I miswrote the first letter on the payee line, crossed it out, initialed it, and wrote the rest of the check out fine. The ATM took it, credited me, and then a day later (apparently without a real person seeing the check) spit it back out. When I called to find out how they were going to fix the error, I was told I would have to wait for the check to arrive in the mail and then I could redeposit it. I very reasonably and extremely forcefully explained that I am in Philadelphia, it was their error, I do NOT want checks bouncing from Atlanta to Athens, and they needed to fix it. With Capital One or Wachovia/Wells Fargo I would now be in a serious frustrated huff and planning to move all my accounts to another bank. But the thing I love best about Chase is their customer service. They have given me a provisional credit for the check and when I get back to Atlanta and the check arrives in the mail, I can take it to the bank for re-depositing. Business will go on as usual.Disaster #3: The question fields on the Date Night Reservation form on the web all got overwritten with a customer's data. So instead of seeing \"Date Requested\" you would see a date. Instead of being asked for your name, you would be told someone else's name. And worst of all, instead of having to read and acknowledge our cancellation, clothing and other policies, you would just see the word \"yes\". It took some time, but I got that straightened out too.Now it's time to have some food, get to the show, and start setting up. Can we finish today? I sure hope so..."},
{"title": "Alright Already, I'll Post!", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2011", "text": "It's been a week since my last (admittedly lame) post, and after being NAGGED TO DEATH, I thought I'd better post again. Just a hint, if you don't hear from me it's because we're HOPPING! Since I last really posted we got the new crucible glass melting kiln from Olympic Kilns and are up and running with date nights in the hotshop again. I also taught two FULL kilnforming classes on Saturday, finished and shipped the large cast awards commission (and cracked my Dyson shelf in half in the process), put together a proposal for a local homeschooling group for a day in the glass studio, received a HUGE glass delivery from Bullseye, and we began construction on the new kiln room! The old kiln room will be the new kiln-forming classroom and kiln-forming open studio space, leaving the front room as a 100% torchwork classroom and open studio space. Now if I could just get the online class sign-up and payment processing finished, I'd be ready for the hordes of eager glass artists.I expect the new kiln room to be finished in a week or so, right before I head of to the winter Buyer's Market show in Philadelphia and just in time for the opening of a new wi-fi enabled coffee, pastry and sandwich shop in the little commercial shopping center next door to the studio. I am looking forward to working with its owner for our classes, dates and workshops. She is interested in providing fresh hot coffee and pastries for our events, and I am interested in: a) not making coffee myself, and b) supporting another little local small business. And speaking of other local small business, I hope to meet with a woman who is the choclatier and owner of a new business in Decatur this week. She called me in December and proposed being our new chocolate provider for Date Night. With the Valentine's Day weekend coming up and us being booked solid except for one slot, we need to get moving on this one.Speaking of the Buyer's Market, I have been asked to participate in a panel discussion on \"Outside the Box Thinking: Great Promotions\" there on Saturday morning. I'm going to talk about our Date Night program and its impact on the studio. Got to get the slides into the Rosen Group today. If you're doing the show, please come to the panel discussion.One last item to bring up; we're planning an expansion of the hotshop this spring too. I would like to add another smaller studio space onto the existing hotshop so we can run simultaneous date nights while still providing a quality, private experience for all the participants. It'll not only mean another space but also another annealing kiln, another glory hole and another glass melting kiln. We love Olympic Kilns!Okay, I'm late, the studio is open, and I have the Date Night book at home leaving Judy powerless. I also have the power cord for her laptop (which has no battery) leaving her even MORE powerless. Got to get a new one of those today."},

{"title": "Snow Day FOUR", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "I sit sipping hot water, having already had my 6 teaspoons of melted clarified butter and meditated this morning. The steel cut oats with craisins just finished cooking in the rice cooker, and I will have them for breakfast in the next hour or so. The rice cooker will keep them warm for me till I'm ready, and I won't eat till I'm hungry--which will be awhile even though I haven't had anything to eat other than the butter this morning (and I drank that) since noon yesterday. Ah I love detox days. I have lost 11.0 lbs this year (since returning from Hawaii), and I am only on day six of the detox! I know the numbers on the scale are illusory, but they put a bounce in my bungee nonetheless.Today, the fourth snow day in Atlanta, starts off with 20 degree temps, icy roads where not dry, and food at the grocery store again! When Dave went last night there were no fresh fruits or vegetables, no milk, bread, or meat other than pork jowls (shudder). The bakery was bare, and the deli had no rotisserie chicken or other hot tasty goodies. Truly apocalyptic. Today, looks like we're back to normal--I might even get my glass delivery today.In the meantime I have plenty of Quickbooks data to enter from last year (my annual sales tax report is due next week and I don't yet know what my base sales from last year were... Ooops). Welcome to another fun January.Just got off the phone with Roadway and the Atlanta terminal has a skeleton crew on today so my glass won't be delivered today. They HOPE to get it out tomorrow! Me too. In the meantime my website and plenty of paperwork await!"},
{"title": "Snow Day Three!", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2011", "text": "I initially had great hope and optimism that today's would be the final snow day this week. But it's only supposed to get up to 30 degrees (it's 21 now) and then plummet into the teens again tonight so I doubt much snow/slush/ice will melt. But what am I saying? Why would I wish snow days to end? EVERYTHING in Atlanta is closed. We haven't had mail, the MARTA buses aren't running, and I'm pretty sure garbage isn't going to be picked up today. Our big grocery store (Publix) was closed Monday and open yesterday only till 4:00. Today they're open now and don't know how early they'll close. J had a playdate and sleepover at a friend's house yesterday (yes, I got out and drove--and I'm glad most of the Atlantans stayed in) and these past few days truly have been like a vacation for us.A snow almost-week is the ultimate vacation at home! For me it's impossible under normal circumstances to take a vacation at home. Think about it--when you go away on vacation, you insert yourself into a new place and the only constant in your daily life and routine is you. When you try to take time off--time out of mind--at home, you still have friends, mail, all the daily routines of life except your job. How are you supposed to break your physical and mental habits and patterns so you can relax? But on a snow day or days, all routines are broken--whether you want them to be or not. And for me, the best part is that I still get to work--I just get to work without all the interruptions, stresses, and crises of my normal \"job\". What a great, creative week I'm having!Of course my last glass order from Bullseye still hasn't been delivered--the freight terminal for Roadway is also closed for the third straight day so they haven't been able to get it out to me. But there was nothing I needed really urgently (I would have liked the opaline frit, but I can wait).Today I'll work on the website for awhile this morning, then head over to the studio about noon to fire a few pieces, and I'll finish back on the website. Ah, bliss!"},

Jessie only went as far as the yard to play in the snow. I went to the studio and worked a bit in the total solitude and quiet. Today will follow much the same pattern. I already meditated, did my breath work, and drank 6 t. of clarified butter (it was only supposed to be 4... oops). When I finish posting I'll answer an incredible backlog of emails that I haven't managed to purge since before Hawaii and put together my piece list for the BMAC--I think I'll call Todd too--it's been awhile since I harassed him. Then a midmorning breakfast of steelcut oats and dried berries cooked in the rice cooker, and off to the studio to begin experimenting with the new work for the BMAC! I don't know if Roadway will be delivering my glass today or not--I'm betting not--but I'll be there anyway. I wish I had remembered to ask Lee to move the barrels of cullet from right by the back door as that is the staging area I need to the cases of glass. Ah well, they aren't moving in the snow and ice!Haven't heard back from Bob at Olympic Kilns yet about the new furnace--I'm sure they were closed yesterday too (and probably today). It is very weird when the whole world shuts down and hunkers in bunkers around you. I can't remember any times in Montana or Chicago where we were holed up for snow for more than a day.The last time in memory of an event that had this effect on me was when Mount St. Helen's went off in 1980. We were told to remain in our dorm rooms, all classes on the University of Montana campus were canceled, non-essential businesses were shut down, and people were told to avoid going outside if at all possible. My not-so-perfect memory says the ash fall (Missoula is about 400 miles east of Mount St Helens) kept us indoors and out of class for a few days. Too bad that was back in the non-digital days and my pictures are all hardcopy or I'd post one here. Of course the Mass Mind (aka Google) supplied me with a retrospective from the Missoulian--my favorite quote from which is:\"By Monday, nearly everything in town was closed, including the bars.\"We certainly had a lot of responsibilities making sure places were closed down, particularly with the bars,\" said Missoula County Sheriff's Capt. Greg Hintz, who was working night shift in May of 1980. \"Beyond that, police work was pretty easy. The streets were just vacant.\" \"(Some might question the Business nature of this post, but heck, I say a natural disaster (aka \"snow\" in the south) counts!) Now I've dawdled enough. Someone just called and registered for a beadmaking class for this Sunday--a sure sign that I need to get the on-line registration thing working. Hmmm. Maybe I should readjust my plans for the day and work on it instead of firing--especially since I don't think I'm going to have glass delivered today!"},

I am continually amazed how 3\" of snow can completely shut down a city this size. I am betting that the businesses that are open today are running with seriously diminished staffing.

If Ernie has his way, I'll miss posting right now too--he is either oblivious to the physical realities imposed by his mass (e.g., it is not possible to fit both him AND the laptop in my lap simultaneously) or he flat out doesn't care about the laptop. I'm betting on the latter. However physically improbable his presence in my lap might be, his warm, contentedly rumbling catness is comforting. A little comfort goes a long way right now. Last night when I unloaded the four 1\" thick cast award slabs, I discovered that my firing had cracked my lovely Dyson shelf in half. :-0 I should have considered the ramifications of putting 2\" X 2\" vermiculite dams around all of the glass and the effect they would have on the heating and cooling of the shelf. Ah well, live and learn (and pay).______________________________After writing that small bit I fell asleep to the cat and got up in time to teach a beginning Kiln-forming class--taking in the first of the LivingSocial vouchers in the process.

Not actually enough time to post and start the real day's work at 9:00, but I'll pretend. Heck, what good is it to be the boss if you can't set the work hours? So far today I got the J up (the most difficult task), made her lunch and breakfast and delivered her to school, and prepped for the cleaning people (you know--the cleaning you have to do BEFORE the cleaning). Then filled the car with gas and did the paper goods grocery shopping ('tis the season of Kleenex, doncha know). Now I have just under an hour before my first appointment to work on facilities scheduling.I realized last night as I was working through the snarl of upcoming glass date requests that with our current loosey goosey system there is a very real chance of scheduling a bead date/class at the same time as a kiln date/class. Since right now they share a classroom and each fill it when used, that would be Very Bad. Yesterday when I talked with Lee about the upcoming expansion plans I put the new kilnforming classroom/open studio room on a back burner and prioritized the hotshop. But the reminder of the LivingSocial deal (and another upcoming marketing push for kilnforming) is making me rethink that schedule. Poor Lee-everyday, when he comes in, he has no idea whether his hair will be on fire or not.Okay, off to schedule and plan. Oh, hey, and thanks Cynthia for the casting tips! I would like to talk to you off-line about the studio casting plans and BECon!"},

(Just a side note--wow they were young then!). Yesterday Lee and I spent a very informative and profitable morning with Bob Hogan at Olympic Kilns up in Flowery Branch and the upshot is that they are going to build our new melt furnace for us with a minimum of muss, fuss, cost, and time. Whew! One big problem down. While we were there I also talked to him about doing a small casting kiln for me--18\" X 18\" with side and bottom elements (maybe top too--any casters out there have opinions on that one?) and three zone (four if top elements too) temperature control. The cost is amazingly reasonable, and I have always loved the solid durability and reliability of my current little Olympic kiln.Also spent last night installing, configuring and testing an on-line class registration system in Joomla. I purchased DT Register back in June and was a bit disappointed by the limitations placed on it by the integration with JEvents at that time so I didn't rush to install it when our new site went live. Last night when I tried again I was VERY impressed with the improvements to their current release (2.7.1). It looks like I might even be able to move the date night registration over to it and obviate any duplicate requests by having it manage the maximum number of participants who can register. It also sends out customized confirmation letters--with attachments (liability and photo release)--upon submission and allows for integration with a variety of on-line payment systems from authorize.net to google checkout to paypal. Definitely worth pursuing.This morning I wrote and posted a quick article on the website about our furnace issues--that's what having a content-management-based website is all about--and now I go back to slab casting for the awards project and to plan the piece list for the BMAC. That's enough, I think. (Thanks, Dee, for the suggestions on how to juggle multiple crucial projects in the same day and get to all of them). I know I'll be back messing around with DT Register tonight. Judy is also back to work today for the first open day since Christmas Eve.

James McMurtry's lovely rendition of \"Ruby and Carlos\" provides a background to my fear:Ruby said \"You're gettin' us in a world of hurt.Down below the Mason-Dumbass line the food gets worse.I can't go back to Tennesseethat NASCAR country's not for me.Go on, if you think you must.\"Carlos packed his drums up in the dark of nightRuby's standing just outside the front porch lightchain-smoking Camel straightsthe sky off to the east got grayAnd he rolled off in a cloud of dust.And the gray colt nickered at the gateShe said \"You're right its getting late.You and me got work to dowe can't be burning daylight too.\"She took down the long lead ropeand stayed off that slippery slopeThe aspen trees were turning gold up topThe talk was buzzin' 'round the beauty shop\"Wasn't he barely half her age.Well that's just how they do now days.We should all had been so lucky.\"By spring she'd had the run of the free born menRuby turned 50 in a sheep camp tenther body still could rock all nightbut her heart was closed and locked up tightPotato fields all muddy and brownthe gossip long since quieted downAnd after one more Coggins testPouring coffee for the county vetPictures on the ice box doorof Carlos in the first Gulf WarBlack-eyed brown and youthful facesmiling back from a Saudi baseAnd then Carlos on the big bay mareHeavier now and longer hairLooking past the saddle shedFrom way on back inside his headAnd the old vet said, \"One day, Rube,that colt will break an egg in you.Now and then one comes alongyou just can't ride.\" And he went on home.And the storm door didn't catchIt blew back hard as she struck a matchBut she cupped it just in timeAnd she sent that ash tray flyin'And holding back the floodJust don't do no goodYou can't unclench your teethTo howl the way you shouldSo you curl your lips aroundThe taste, the tears, and the hollow soundThat no one owns but youNo one owns but you.Carlos took the road gig and he saw it throughHe rode the tour bus while the singer flewManaged out of music rowCarlos never saw the studioSession guys had that all sewn up.He looks out the window and it starts to sleetLaying on a friend's couch on Nevada StreetLately he's been staying highSick all winter and they don't know whyThey don't know why or they just won't sayThey don't talk much down at the V.A.And Ruby's in his thoughts sometimesWhat thoughts can get out past the wineHe feels her fingers on his browAnd right then he misses howShe looked in that gray morning lightShe never shaved like they all do nowHe sees it all behind his eyesand his hands go searching but they come up dryAnd half way in that wakin' dreamCarlos lets the land line ringHe never guessed it was Ruby callingThe pin in her hip from the gray colt fallingFigure eight in a lazy lopeStumbled on that slippery slopeAnd holding back the floodJust don't do no goodYou can't unclench your teethTo howl the way you shouldSo you curl your lips aroundThe taste, the tears, and the hollow soundThat no one owns but youNo one owns but you.I try to stay off the slippery slope. I'm turning 50 this year, and the introspection and life-weighing have begun already. Man, my teeth are clenched so tight, and I want to howl...I wrote up my plan for the year on Saturday hoping that putting it down, putting boundaries and borders on it and evaluating it would make me easier in my heart. But it hasn't. Sunday was supposed to be a last family vacation day with no thoughts of work, but of course it didn't work out that way (just like the last day in Hawaii was consumed with issues of the ESPN filming and long LONG distance phone calls). Then today began as all workdays do with a deluge of phone calls, technical issues, clamors for attention and time, work left undone from days/weeks/months past... and I'm behind again/already. Right now all I want to do is flee back to Hawaii, or to Montana, or just to the couch with a box of bon-bons and a good book.The hotshop is in complete flux with the furnace issues--new/rebuild/what kind/how much/when/who/how to finance it--and I just haven't been able to hand it all to Lee and say \"This one is yours.\" Why? Because this one ISN'T his--it's mine. It's my studio, my growth/expansion plan, my responsibility, my liability, and my investment. As much as he would like to step in and step up, when push comes to shove I can't abrogate any of the above. Decisions made now will have a direct and consequential impact on everything I do going forward. Had I not just spent upwards of $900 on new elements, a new controller and a new thermocouple, I would feel less tight on the whole control thing for the new system, but I just can't get there.I sit, almost in the pit of despair, and \"Get Lucky\" by Mark Knopfler comes on:I'm better with my musclesThan I am with my mouthI worked the fairgrounds in the summerAnd go pick fruit down southAnd when I'm feel them chilly windsWhere the weather goes I followPack up my traveling things go with the swallowsAnd I might get lucky now and thenYou win some, you might get lucky now and thenYou win someI wake up every morningKeep on eye on what I spentGotta think about eatingGotta think about paying the rentI always think it's funnyIt gets me everytimeI wonder about the happiness and moneyTell it to the breadlineBut you might get lucky now and thenYou win some, you might get lucky now and thenYou win someNow I'm rambling through this meadow happy as a man can beThink I just lay me down under this old treeOn and on we go through this old world of shufflingIf you got a truffle dog, you can go trufflingBut you might get lucky now and thenYou win some, you might get lucky now and thenYou win someWhy this song comforts me, I don't know. Maybe it's because I can't help but feel that if I just keep pushing, I'll get lucky. I'll win some. Heck, right now I'd settle for I'll get caught up.Is it okay to write all this here for anyone to read--to show such doubt and weakness? Heck yeah. This is what it IS to be a small business owner struggling with bills and employees and vendors and customers and expansion and websites and life in this very fast millennium. This is what it is to be The Owner. Yes, I understand now exactly what it means to say \"The buck stops here\". I always thought it was about the money, but it's so much more."},
{"title": "What Lies Ahead?", "date": "Saturday, January 01, 2011", "text": "Fireworks and champagne at the studio started the new year for me. Are they harbingers? What will the upcoming year bring? Last year was... difficult, and from a business standpoint this year is set to be even more complicated. Am I exhilarated? Terrified? Both? 2010 ended in a rush of projects slipped in just under the wire, partially completed, and left hanging in the wind. Bookkeeping falls into the latter category as I haven't done any for either the business or us personally since, oh, March. Money came in, money went out. I did tiny window analyses of profitability on segments of studio activity, but what I wouldn't give for an entire *month* to do nothing but crunch numbers and plan the expansion for the year! Yeah, right. Time to dig out those big girl panties again, suck it up and do the best I can--I leave for the Buyer's Market show 46 days from today and that's only one reason I don't have a month to crunch and plan.Instead, here on this fine January 1, 2011, let's jump to some big-stroke goals, plans, dreams, projects for the upcoming year--then back to enjoying a final couple of days off before the world, the week, and the year begin for real.1) Equipment: This year--heck this week!--will bring a new glass furnace. With the last element failure in the current little furnace and resultant lost week (+) of date night and class revenue--not to mention the expense of fixing it... again--it's time to go new, maybe gas, definitely bigger. The little furnace--with it's new controller and new thermocouple--will be good back-up/secondary color or alternative glass pot. I also hope to add two casting kilns, another annealer and a small gloryhole. Oh yes, and 200 amps more electrical service to manage it all!2) Facilities: Time to add on 1-3 new spaces in the studio. First will be a new room to house the big sister kilns and the new casting kilns.  We're going to remodel the back deck--expand and enclose it with screens (kilns are just as happy outdoors here as in). Currently there are French doors from the kiln room onto the back deck and once we've moved the big kilns out through them onto the new deck, I can turn the current kiln room into a kiln-forming classroom/open studio area--which frees up the front room to be set-up full-time for torchwork. Second will be an expansion onto the back of the hotshop for another bench area, the second gloryhole, and the back-up furnace. Third is a potential splitting of the front screened-in porch into porch and additional front room (indoor) space. This process entails moving the front door and putting in front windows--and maybe an architect (not putting in an architect, just hiring one)--but I think we can do it.3) Techniques: Time to add casting to the studio repertoire. I have two artists waiting for me to start casting their work in glass for them, and I want to both get good national instructors in to present workshops and to start teaching basic casting as part of our class offerings. Along with casting comes mold making, plaster and lost wax. Wheee!4) Professional development/Personal Work: The almost two weeks in Hawaii and away from the studio gave me time to think about my own work and develop some new design ideas. I don't know if I'll have time to do much on them before the Buyer's Market--it'll certainly be hard to both make the pieces and to create the promotional materials for them before the show. Bullseye is also facilitating my creative process by hosting BECon again this year. I am very excited about the theme: Crossover: A Material Exchange. I will turn 50 the week before the conference and two weeks of professional development in Portland will be my present to myself (a pre-conference workshop, the conference, and then a post-conference workshop!).5) Process Development: The Siyeh Glass website is coming together, now it's time to get the Siyeh Studio website of my work back up and tied into it. Also need to finally pull the trigger on the POS software integration for Siyeh Glass (supplies, classes and materials). Then there's the process for bookkeeping... A real business needs a real accounting solution, and I am *NOT* it. Time  to officially hire someone who likes data entry and clean looking  ledgers. I look at this hire as analogous to finally getting a cleaning  person for our house: Once you've made the switch, you wonder why you  resisted it for so long.6) Staff: I am hopefully expectant that the new year is going to bring an increase in the demand for classes, open studio, and date nights at the studio, and I would like to add additional glassblowing and kiln-forming staff to our family to pick up the work. It takes a village, and it's also nice to be able to support a village. I am looking forward to turning over much of the teaching to someone else so I can get on with the next book...7) Book 2: There has been enough said about writing another book that I don't need to go into it here. Book 1 comes out in paperback this year, Amazon has already dropped it's price to under half of list, and the publisher is really, really, REALLY interested in Book 2.And there you have it--2011 at Siyeh Glass, An Intimate Urban Studio. Let's see how it all plays out."},
{"title": "Hau'oli Makahiki Hou!", "date": "Friday, December 31, 2010", "text": "In the better-late-than-never category, I am finally getting around to posting that Siyeh Glass is going to be featured in a a spot on ESPN tonight during the Chick-Filet-A Bowl. They came by and filmed us yesterday as one of the Hot Spots in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. I am particularly excited to see how the filming turns out as we had to do it all without a glass furnace! The little pot furnace went down again Wednesday morning--another element burned through (one of the three new elements I just purchased) and yet another one looks like it's going to go soon (there's a blob of drizzled glass/muck on it).I am continually amazed at how blessed I am by my Village (you know, the village that it takes to raise a child or support a glass studio owner). Yesterday while I was on a plane winging back from Hawaii, Lee, Carol, Austin, Amy and Brian were working out how to pick up pre-warmed (1000 degree) cullet on a blowpipe from the pick-up oven and melt it in the gloryhole for blowing out. Judy was decorating up a storm with all the New Year's bling we got for our New Year's Date Nights--and then Judy and Carol evened starred as our kiln-forming date couple inside. I arrived 20 minutes before the ESPN team--just enough time to put on make-up, change clothes, and check everything out. As I had been more or less awake for 26 hours at that time I *think* everything went well... We'll see tonight.As we here in the Griffith household do not have live tv, we will be  watching the game (or maybe just the commercials :-) on ESPN's live streaming sports page. I am relying on the kindness of strangers--or at least geeky friends--to get a copy of the spot so we can put it on our website. Oh hey, It's almost game time! Got to run. If you miss it, I think it will be on the replays page on ESPN3 tomorrow."},

The pic of the sea turtle at right was taken by the J on our first day here. Tonight at 10:00 we begin the long journey back to Atlanta--where I understand there is still some snow in the shade--and to the the studio where I further understand that the glass furnace went down AGAIN last night. Apparently the new lower element fried. We had to cancel/reschedule all our glass blowing dates AGAIN for the next several days--including the New Year's Eve special  that I just spent another $80 advertising.All of the above is business as usual and part of the everyday peril of the small business owner's life. What is not business as usual is that ESPN is going to come into the studio tomorrow afternoon to film our date night experience for a couple of hours somewhere between 3:00 and 5:00 so they can show it during the Chick-Fil-A Bowl the next day... Our flight is due in at 1:38. I will have been on a packed plane for, oh, several thousand hours at that point having had little or no sleep. We will take a quick cab home so I can freshen and prep for filming. (Judy and Lee will have been wrangling everything till then). As the furnace is down, we are going to Wing It (appropriate for the Chick-Fil-A Bowl) even more than usual.If I live through the day before New Year's then I will cover the morning glass date from New Year's Eve who decided kiln-forming would be fun since they can't do glass blowing. See the post below and marvel at the continuity in my life! Could be worse, I could be in Montana (my parents' driveway at left)."},

After two hours of calls to tech support, reading of the manual and futzing in the freezing cold in the hotshop (and getting Austin to read the teeny tiny model numbers on the controller), it looks like we might have both a workaround and a new thermocouple on order. Let's cross fingers and toes."},

Really?", "date": "Monday, December 06, 2010", "text": "Almost finished with a medium mocha in a Kavarna go-cup, listening to Gillbert O' Sullivan \"Alone Again, Naturally\" and a couple of other of his songs over the sound system, and recovering/regrouping from the first weekend of the 2010 Siyeh Sleigh Ride. We are entering the homestretch of 2010 and I, like the groundhog in February, pop my head up, look around, and say \"What the hell?\" I mean, October, November, five days in December--where'd they go?!?Now Simon and Garfunkel are singing and I can't help but concur that, indeed, leaves are brown (though there isn't a patch of snow on the ground--not in Hotlanta on Dec 6), and the sky *is* a hazy shade of winter. Wasn't it just August? Didn't I just voice this same time-loss lament recently (i.e., five months ago)? Ah well, the beauty of time is that there's always more of it--till you die anyway.As it's now December, it's time to update the open studio hours and January/February class lists. As I add the additional lines on the Google Docs spreadsheet which is the open studio sign-up sheet I am faced with a dilemma: Do I continue the Children's Studio full-time, do I keep it as a once-a-year activity, or do I tie it into the school calendar and offer it whenever the local schools are on break?Right now our open studio space is a bit tight (at least in theory--in reality the demand has only once completely filled it)--but I have a plan to address that need (an expansion! an expansion! It's time for another expansion!). Maybe the smartest thing to do is take baby steps (didn't I say that's how I was going to proceed from now on anyway?) and offer the Children's Studio when we have the new space. Or I should offer it until the demand for Open Studio overwhelms the space... so many options! Okay, for now I'll just leave it as it is (offered full-time)--it's easier than editing the spreadsheet. :-)Time also to look into hiring someone to teach intro to kiln-forming. I have been thinking long and hard about adding a lot of classes, and, while it fits the business model in terms of optimizing the use of the space and the equipment, the last thing I need to do is add regularly scheduled evenings and weekends to my already full-time business. Smart thing to do is make a little less by hiring the work out, but make more than not doing it all. Regular classes lead to sales in supplies and use of open studio--both of which bring revenue into the studio (and thus are a Good Thing). I feel a bit like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams--I'm building it, will they come?Enough mid to long term musings. The rest of the week  and through the weekend the Sleigh Ride is in full swing and the studio looks great! Everyone has really nice work this year with price points from $3 (I kid you not, $3) to $585. Access Atlanta/ZVents did us well--we had several people from Friday through Sunday who came in because they saw our event on one of those sites. I didn't get as positive a response about our emailing--think I'll send out the December newsletter today or tomorrow and put in both the Sleigh Ride and the Glass Project Gifts I put together for a holiday offering.I close with some pics of the Siyeh Family taken during a lull on Sunday. They got a bit squirrely with the elf hats and the blown ornaments (check out the ornament hanging from Austin's pierced ear--ouch!)."},

There are--as usual--a million and one last minute details to take care of (not least of which are creating a gift certificate template and putting together the class and project packages to offer during the Sleigh Ride).\"Hurricane Party\" just came on and I was struck again by the realization that you just can't listen to too much McMurtry. Why did we move from Austin again? (And the bigger question: Why didn't I ever see him when we lived there?). Okay, enough distractions! Judy, Carol, Lee, Amy (our little hotshoppie and the latest addition to the studio family), Dee, Todd, and Becky (V) are all showing up between 10-10:30 to Whip The Studio Into Shape (or blow roll-ups for an order due tomorrow).I think Dee and Todd are expecting/hoping we'll be further along than we are in clearing off the flat surfaces for display space. Judy and V have been there in the thick all week and know exactly what they're in for, and the other three will be blowing glass in the hotshop and ignoring our indoor frenzy. Some time later today Brian and Becky S. will arrive with their work--by which time we will be calm, ready, and sipping toddies. ROFLMAO (Mom, that means rolling on the floor laughing my ass off.)Still have to buy the food and wine for the artist reception tonight from 6-9. Got studio lights yesterday--24 8 ft florescent tubes--and I am afraid I might have gotten the wrong ones. They only had one kind at Lowe's but I think they said one pin...

Since there is no IE for the Mac anymore, I hadn't tested it. *sigh* Leave it to Microsoft to make my life more difficult.In spite of IE, I have been making progress on coming up with creative ideas for kiln-forming (and beadmaking) packages to offer for gift-giving. First I have a whole series of Project Packages--e.g., The Orchid-Pot Melt: Get a signed copy of A Beginner's Guide to Kiln-Formed Glass, an orchid pot filled with glass, and a coupon to come in and fire it, all for $65.

Then I showered and quickly dressed in warm fuzzies as it is a cold one in Hotlanta today. Thus prepped, I opened my laptop for the first time since Wednesday night at 6:00 pm. I have been trying to figure out how long it had been since I went two days without checking email, puttering with a spreadsheet, reading the news, or any of 100 other things I do on the computer every day (blog), and I have failed. The last time has already passed out of memory. But I did it for Thanksgiving (and the day after--aptly called Black Friday as the computer screens were black) as did the spouse.Instead of working--at all--we had two full family days with just the three of us. We read. We cooked (rather Jessie and Dave cooked), we walked, we gathered leaves and made holiday placemats. We ate, we played games and watched movies. We even went out for a double-feature yesterday \"Mega Mind\" and \"Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows\". Then we ate some more (ham, ham, ham, ham, ham, ham, ham, ham, hammity ham, ham, ham!), watched another movie, and played Carcassone before heading off to bed. What a great time out of mind/studio!But all good things must come to an end, and when I woke this morning filled with dread at the prospect of all I had ignored, I almost regretted taking the time off. I mentally girded my loins to wade through an ENORMOUS pile of email, date night requests, voice messages, and art emergencies which I was sure had been languishing unattended for the past two days. I armed myself with the first cup of coffee and... I'm already done! In less than an hour I read or trashed all the new email (answered where appropriate), updated the Date Night calendar, and left the voicemail for Judy to pick up today at 10:00 when she gets in and the studio opens.

{"title": "New Week, New Wonders, New Woes", "date": "Monday, November 08, 2010", "text": "Welcome to a New Week! I start of the week with a meeting for the Waldorf Holiday Fair (happening this Saturday from 10-4) as I am the grade 3 holiday fair rep. Then it's off to another meeting with my insurance agent to review the studio coverage and make sure I have adequate coverage for everything we're doing--and everyone working in the studio. By afternoon I should be on to the creative part of the day--juggling what will go in what kiln and casting the first award slab. (And beginning to build the mummy's tomb for the holiday fair).Biggest project of the day--mummy's notwithstanding is--the award slabs which aren't exactly eating my lunch, but they are stretching my brain in ways it doesn't usually (and tries hard not to) go. In a nutshell, it's too early (in the day, the week, my life) for specific gravity. Last night it was too early for some water-quantity divination (the formula for how much water to use and then how much plaster/silica flour to mix in). I don't remember it being so difficult, but it has been awhile since the last time I built molds. My notes (from Linda Ethier and Bullseye) require lots of weighing and multi-decimal numbers (and decimal points too!) to figure things out. Sigh.If you have little artists in your house, next time they ask you why they have to do all that dumb math, and confidently state that they'll never use it, send them my way. I've gone from having to muck around with sin and cosine in order to make an angled stained glass window to discounting and repricing product (percentages) to this whole volume, weight and specific gravity thing. When it comes to math, I know I'm not smarter than a 5th grader.New milestone in the studio today--got the first call from a wife who wanted to verify that her husband and his girlfriend had been in for a date night in the hotshop. They had. :-("},

It was all about the \"stuff\". But now that I am older and wiser, today is my favorite day. Oh it's still about the presents, but today I (as do we all) get a gift that can never be purchased and cannot be given any other day of the year. Today I get the gift of time--one extra hour of it to be precise. I take this gift and I revel in it, I luxuriate in it, I roll around in it and hug it to myself... and I inevitably squander it. Ah well, all good things must come to an end--even time.Today is another class day in the studio--kilnformed glass ornaments from 1-3, and we have a full glass blowing date slate starting at 10:00 and going till 9:00 tonight. That long time is not as impressive as it sounds as we only do three dates per day (which uses the max amount of melted glass we can have in the furnace in a given day). It's also a casting day for me--plaster today, glass tomorrow for the first of a series of thick slab awards I am doing this month--and a fusing/slumping day for gallery orders. I can think of a couple more things I would like to add to today but 1) it IS Sunday (not a workday for me), and 2) an extra hour only gets you so much.Maybe when I am even older and wiser I will be ready to forgo both stuff  AND time. One can hope."},
{"title": "The Intense Wee Hour", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Why is it that everything has more intense meaning and significance at 3:00 am, but only if you were sleeping and woke up to it? You don't have panic attacks at 3:00 am if you've been up all night. At least I don't. (Note that it is significantly more difficult to type at 3:00 am because of the active, purring presence of Ernie demanding one hand all to himself for pets.)Judy had jury duty all last week and had it not been for Debbie and Becky H. helping out in the studio, everything would have completely fallen to pieces--me included. I have *got* to become okay with telling people no! Of course one of the people I am not (and should not be) saying no to right now is J who will be nine next week and who would like an old-fashioned birthday party with pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey, a treasure hunt, chocolate cake and vanilla cupcakes, a dart and balloon game, and a pinata. I can hand the food bits off to Dave, but I need to get cracking on the rest. She has a swim meet all weekend so the party is going to have to be right after early dismissal on Thursday afternoon.Looking back on the (really-should-have-been-but-wasn't) terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad week, probably the biggest snafu was caused by UPS shutting my account off yesterday, Friday,  and me discovering it at 5:55 pm as I was trying to schedule and process for same-day pick-up and shipment an order that absolutely, positively had to go out RIGHT THEN. And why did they do this? Because they have been trying to pay my invoices (I have auto-draft set-up) against my old checking account in spite of the fact that I changed the information back in August in their on-line billing center/account management interface AND faxed them a cancellation request. I still have not been able to get an answer--satisfactory or not--as to why I can change my information on-line in their system and have the new, correct information show up *for months* and yet that's not what they have and use for billing!!! (Yes, it's really worth three exclamation points.) It was almost 7:00 when I got the right department on the phone and got everything straightened out with them culminating in the assurance that my account would be back on and functional...by midnight. It's now just after 4:00 am and I don't have the heart to check.Later this morning I have my first official beginning kiln-forming class in the studio. I ran a special at our birthday/anniversary party offering a 10 hour open studio card free if you signed up that day for a class. Of course I forgot Judy has the day off today AND I am running a special for the Atlanta Glass Artists Guild today... One of the people I really have to work on saying no to is myself!Okay, I'll update the firing schedule for tomorrow (today!) and go back to bed. I feel like I can sleep again."},

Debbie Suchy, friend, marketer-extraordinaire, blue-sky dreamer, gallery owner, savvy business woman supreme (no, the superlatives are not overdone) is coming to visit for five days, lend a hand, and play in the studio.She'll be helping with shipping this afternoon in Judy's absence. She'll also be helping me comfort Todd-of-the-bleeding-fingers when I pick up the next 35 trees (shown at right) and 72 keychains for another order. As of today he has done 200 trees in the past few months just for this one store an he has 70 more to go. I called him this morning with an order from another client for 6 people and he practically started to cry. Be careful what you wish for (retail success and popular acclaim), you just might get it.I continue to struggle through the newly-renamed-but-I-don't-know-to-what obstacle course project for the Waldorf Holiday Fair. It looms over me like a heavy cloud (Dave and Todd are both muttering very grim I-told-you-sos at my confession). Just over two weeks to go, a mummy to design and make, canopic jars to create, and a set of amulets to find, AND obstacle course to design. I'll make it, it'll be fine, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, I will find a whole new village to get through this one.Another looming project is a set of 1\" thick award slabs with \"mountainous\" rough-cut top edges. I agreed to the project (and priced it) before I had a clear understanding of what they wanted for this edge. Oh boy. I can do it (I think I can, I think I can, I think I can), but it is just one more stresser right now.My other casting projects have been delayed (again) and at least one of the artists is chomping at the bit to get a finished piece from me. I think I am going to have to do some really heavy-duty scheduling this fall to see progress on the current in-processes.Oh my, people to pay, orders to fire. Got to run!"},

As soon as I start to see the faintest hint of light at the end of the tunnel, WHAM I'm flat on my back again. If I'm lucky, I'll be able to just sit on this bench outside the courtroom for the day and work on-line (there is open wi-fi, after all). Of course it would be nice if the prosecutor had given me SOME idea what to do after I told her I was here. But she was talking to the person hit in the accident, and when she finished with him, they both walked back into the courtroom. I told her my name, she saw me sit on this fine bench outside the courtroom door... I'll give it a few hours to see what happens. Hmm. I just need an electrical outlet and I'm all set."},

The morning started late and poorly with the loss of another pet (J's hamster Tuffy). Seraph last week, Tuffy today... I am not looking forward to telling J when she gets home from school. (She fed him and \"let him sleep\" this morning. Little did she know how soundly he was sleeping.)So a quick post to stay in the posting groove, an hour and a half on the website, and off to the studio! I was only over there briefly yesterday as we were closed and I was working on other things, but I hope Lee was able to fix the glass furnace. The auto shut-off stopped working the middle of last week and gave him a tremendous shock in the middle of date night. Since then he's been doing a manual shut-off for every gather, but that isn't a good solution as it's a manual shut-off of the computer which then has to reboot every time.Okay, enough post.

Right now I have my website, my book (the second), and the design and direction of the realization of the \"obstacle course\" for the Waldorf Holiday Festival (in three weeks) in active mode. This past Saturday was our birthday and it was a major project too--one that has been replaced by a marketing push to fill classes and boost the sale of materials and supplies for the studio (Living Social, Sparkfly, Kudzu all contacted me in the last week and I need to put together proposals for them). Then there's the web-based date night picture and video distribution system that Dave coded up for me and is in the process of implementing. He is ready for final spec info from me today so he can finish up.Every single one of these projects is individually fascinating to me and each also requires wholehearted, wholeminded attention. But there are the day-to-day activities that also must be done--confirmation emails for date night to send, payments to process, orders to fire, pack and ship, supply orders to place... AAAAAAGHHHH! There is simply too much for one little (or not so little) me!So why do I take on so much? Because I love it all! I am a gourmet and a gourmand all rolled into one.

Let's see if I can finish the post before the song ends (it's 8 minutes and 47 seconds long).Yesterday was a 16 hour day and man did I kick glass butt. Started the day with Dee and mocha from Stabucks, continuing the work we started last week on the outline of the second book (working title: Studio Practices and Projects for the Advanced Kiln-former). I am really excited about this book--though I still can't believe I'm writing another one. I guess books are like children--nature clouds the memory of the birthing event and makes you focus on the outcome so you'll do it again. But back to the long day... Ended with a full kiln load in at 11:15 pm and then an hour of email, exporting date night photos to make cd's and bookkeeping before heading home. J had a sleepover at a friend's so it was just me and the pets at the house. A bottle of hard cider (well, two) and a half hour of reading to settle down and I was off to sleep! I think this is only the second night I have been alone in the house (save for the four-legged) in nine years.Tomorrow I head to Austin to celebrate Dave's and my 15th wedding anniversary (Dave is working there this week) with a mini vacation. Well, sort of a vacation. Dave has to work through Friday and I am going to take advantage of the out-of-studio time to FINISH the website layout (got to talk to Mike today to make sure he is willing to take on merging the websites and redo project--it's a monster) and the book outline/project list.In our absence Judy and Carol are managing the J and the house and the dogs and the cat and the bunny and the hamster and the swim lessons and the cello practice and the studio... I don't pay her enough. But it's good for J to have a third set of grandparents (and local!) and Judy loves to decorate for holidays so I am expecting them to go to town with the plethora Halloween stuff we have boxed in the basement. (\"Choctaw Bingo\" the studio version just came on iTunes--guess I couldn't get the whole post done in eight minutes. Got to stop fixing my spelling typos as I go.)The newsletter for October is done and we are preparing for our One Year Birthday Party! No, it never does slow down here.

We are opening two hours earlier (three on Saturday), and adding Sunday hours. I am still debating cutting Tuesday hours, but it is turning into a decent day and I guess I can put myself on the hook for one full, solo day a week (Judy has Tuesday off as she is picking up Sunday).

Got to practice writing doncha know now that I'm officially starting the second book ;-) .Last night I got the date night videos through 10/2 up on YouTube. The next step is to send a personal email out to each of the participants with the link to their video.

Overloaded? No sirree. Maybe it's the beautiful fall weather (I am wearing a *sweater* over my t-shirt this morning!), maybe it's the establishment of a regular(ish) schedule and the routine that comes in fall with the resumption of school. I don't know, and this is one gift horse whose dentals I am not going to peruse. I'm just going to go with it.Date nights have also been extreme. We now book 10-11 per week--that's almost every slot we offer filled. I need to get on Craig's List today and find a real fridge--we have outgrown the little dorm fridge we've been using. We're about out of brochures and I am taking our busyness and lack of brochures to mean that it's finally time to Raise Our Prices. It's also past time to have an on-line sign-up process on our website and to eliminate cd's in favor of photos on-line and a slideshow on YouTube. That will also encourage people to sign the photo release--you sign, I make you a slideshow. You don't sign, you bring your own camera and do the work yourself.

Fall is here, summer isn't even a memory. It went by so fast, so chaotically, and so stressfully that I am lucky to not remember it through my exhausted haze. Fall has brought cool weather, rain, and the long-anticipated Slowing Down for me (really). It's also brought a return to blogging (yay!) so let's get on with it.Last Saturday was our first big event in the studio in a long time. We had a fish-themed project day aligned with a charity event--Gumbo for the Gulf--with all proceeds from the gumbo going to the Nature Conservancy's Fund for Gulf Coast Restoration.We had quite the team lined up for the day. Brian demoed making fish beads. Lee helped former date nighters (or anyone who had taken an intro to glassblowing from us) blow glass fish. Todd assisted anyone age four or up in making a kilnformed fish. Dave (my wunder spouse) served gumbo and beer all day. Dee ran the front desk/cashier station greeting people and managing the donations/payments. Judy ran the information room which featured a running slideshow of all our date nights to date (over 110), a board with photos of all the daters in order of their dates, and sign-up sheets for several upcoming classes. Lee's daughter Evie and two of his regular students/protegees Austin and Christie assisted Lee with the flow in the hotshop. Judy's husband Carol was on-hand to help with whatever unassigned tasks might manifest, and I was the designated floater for pitching in wherever needed. It was the most prepared I have been for anything in the studio ever--and it took more than a village to make it happen.Even before Saturday we were preparing. I spent two days organizing and cleaning in the studio during the prior week, and then Judy, Dee, Lee, Austin, Carol, Brian, and Todd all pitched in on Friday for the final straighten/organize schlep-it-to-the-shed push. Dee also picked up the 1/2 keg (15 gallons) of Shiner Bock for the big day and delivered it to the studio.Food preparation started Thursday--at least the physical part. The mental preparation and organization had been going on for over a month since Dave read about the Gumbo for the Gulf dinner concept and decided he wanted to do one for our friends. I shanghaied both him and his idea and turned it from food for 10-15 at our home into food for 160 at the studio. He rose admirably to the occasion and got several of our friends (thank you Becky-the-bookkeeper, Keith and Arno-Dee's-husband) to pitch in and help.On Friday Arno trimmed and chopped 20 lbs of chicken thighs. Becky and Dave chopped 15 onions, 20 green peppers, 40 celery stalks, and ten bunches of scallions. All choppers slayed  10 lbs of andouille sausage. Keith made the roux from scratch and directed construction. Arno and Dave baked cornbread. Dave planned 10 batches of the recipe cooked in three segments. Food chopping and prep began at 9:00 am Friday and actual cooking began at 9:00 pm and went till midnight. Dee, Mike and I supported the chefs by drinking beer and eating Thai take-out. Dave was up and cooking again at 4:30 am on Saturday and we opened the studio doors at 10:00 am.We were mostly ready and in our places for the first two attendees who showed up right at 10:00 am sharp (I always have at least an hour of last-minute putzing to do for shows and big events, and Saturday was no exception). And then we waited. And we waited some more. Maybe people were afraid they wouldn't find parking. I sent out another email with instructions for free parking. And then we waited some more. By the time we closed the doors, 11 people had come to our Fish Saturday in the Studio and Gumbo for  the Gulf event. Three or four of them blew fish, three or four of them  donated money to the Nature Conservancy in exchange for a bowl of gumbo  and (maybe) a beer, some of them just donated money because they had eaten before they came.It was hard for me to decide to write this post. It's easy to write about successes, plans, exciting developments--even bad shows. Writing about Saturday feels like telling the world you threw a party and no one came, or sharing how you went to a dance and spent the night standing by the wall--the only one never asked to dance. But I'm not 16 anymore, and business isn't a popularity contest. If I didn't get the attendance I thought I would (/deserved) then I need to try something else next time. There were a lot of reasons people stayed away Saturday and I would venture none of them were about me. Well, no more than one or two of them were about me. I'm sure some of them were about Todd, or Dee, or Lee...All kidding aside, it was a really rough day, and I hope both that our one year anniversary party next month goes better, and that I still have a village that'll show up to help! Here's a last shot of Carol heading home with a thermos of gumbo and a thermos of Shiner. What a way to end the day."},

Did I forget any prepositions? What a week! Month! Summer! Year! whew.Yesterday I not only got out the September newsletter, but I also outlined the October one. There are 98 new photos up on the Siyeh Glass Facebook page (only of the first 100 couples for whom we have photo releases). We celebrated our 100th date in the glass studio yesterday morning. Am I repeating myself? I feel like I'm repeating myself. Must be because I wrote THE SAME THING IN THE NEWSLETTER AND ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE! There might be such a thing as too much social networking (ya think?)._________________Okay, one meeting down, one to go, then breakdown the exhibit at MODA and finally into the studio! Maybe I should fire some kiln loads today... Judy, the studio elf, is on vacation leaving me running the inside of the studio alone. Oy. I forgot how much work it is. Lee is smart--he's taking the hotshop offline for maintenance this week (I think he just wants some time not running like a madman with his hair on fire). No doubt about it, we have been popular lately. The strategy of many baskets with a few eggs each is paying off for everything except getting enough family time and sleep.Also got a bunch of the date night slideshows up on YouTube yesterday. Hope to get most (if not all) of the rest of them up today. Later today I'll get all the date night night cd's mailed out--whew! I made almost 40 slideshows and burned more than 50 cd's since I got back from the Buyer's Market in Baltimore. If you do the math, that's almost half our date nights happening in about six weeks. No wonder I'm tired (and Lee melted away from the August heat in the hotshop). But I'm caught up through this past Friday, and I'm going to try really hard to stay caught up. Things just get ugly otherwise.Okay, off to make more slideshows! (Oh who am I trying to kid?! I'm off to take a nap THEN get in the kiln loads and do the slideshows while J is at swim practice.)"},

Day Three of the Patagonian Death Flu and I feel... better. I feel well enough--and have enough margin--to post anyway. Since everything I do today will probably have to be done from a chair and in between naps, posting isn't a great stretch. Sure there are many other things higher in the priority list--hence the paucity of posts over the past couple of months--but I have no physical energy and my mental acuity is only so-so (though my vocabulary appears to be in fine fettle). I also appear to be having some difficulty focusing (literally and figuratively). But let's try to move on to glass.I promised a post on the Buyer's Market and have not yet delivered. Here we go in a nutshell.Staff, Facilities, LocationExcellent service from Joe and Maria at Hargrove. Got off to a rocky start with damaged crates, and out-of-reality shipping charges, but they took care of everything smoothly and efficiently. The Rosen team--right up to the chief Rosen--were both attentive and appreciative of our needs. I saw either Christine (the show manager) or Laura (my floor rep) walking our aisle several times a day everyday to make sure no one needed anything. The Baltimore Convention Center was very nice with indoor unloading on the same floor as the show (no interminable lines in front of the freight elevators). We got a cheap, cheap, cheap deal at the Sheraton a couple of blocks from the Convention Center and the rooms were very nice. Local restaurants (predictably) had hot and cold running crabcakes and smoked-hamhock-and-bacon-infused martinis (well, to be honest, only ONE restaurant had the martini but it was so yummy I had to mention it). The American Visionary Art Museum was AMAZING by all accounts (I did not go this year but will next summer--and John bought me a really cool Medusa flexible light-up snake headband from there).Numbers, Numbers, NumbersSales the first day were amazing--as I indicated in my last post. Days two and three, however, were disappointing and dismal, respectively. And I should have expected it. Why? Because it was a small show. Unlike big February Buyer's Markets, the show was small enough for buyers to walk it and place their orders in one day--and a lot of people came the first day. While I saw some familiar faces, there were a LOT of longtime/big exhibitors who weren't there. I heard a consistent level of grumbling from buyers that there weren't enough exhibitors to make the show worthwhile for them. Funny, the exhibitors felt the same way--I heard much muttering that there weren't enough buyers to make the show worthwhile for them. Mutiny, mutiny, mutiny.As always, the declining positive impact of shows on both buyers and exhibitors is a worthwhile topic, but it's not one I can follow in my muzzy state today. At the end of the show for me, my sales were up from last summer's Buyer's Market and up from the ACRE show in June. I plan to give shows in general, and the two Rosen shows in particular, another year. Now it's time to nap."},

What a long summer! Got back to the studio Friday after 2-1/2 weeks in Montana and I leave for the summer Buyer's Market of American Craft in Baltimore on Friday with Todd, John and Dee. We're all driving up together in my minivan and then Dee and John are driving it home while I drive a Penske truck filled with old display, work, and Vegas (ACRE) display back to Atlanta with a stop on the way in Greenville to drop off Black Cat's stuff from storage. It will be an interesting show this time as Black Cat isn't going and I will have about seven crates dropped in front of my 10X20 booth. My neighbors are going to be thrilled. We also only have *one day* for set-up this time and I need things out of almost every crate. It will be... exciting. But after this show we'll finally be pared down in several ways--geographic area of shows, number of shows and amount of stuff stored at shows. I am currently only signed up to do two shows next year--the Buyer's Market of American Craft winter in Philly in February and summer in Baltimore in July.Blech. I'm almost too tired and out of practice to post, but I'll forge on.At the beginning of next month I am participating in an exhibition at MODA. I received my instructor certification from the Ichiyo School of Ikebana this year and I will be presenting an arrangement the week of September 7 with the other members of my chapter. Our headmaster is coming in from Japan to do a workshop and open the exhibit. I mention this news here as I am creating my own container for my arrangement... and I still have to design it. Procrastination 'R Us. I begin to wonder if I require the anxiety and adrenaline of an immediate deadline in order to get anything done.Other deadlines coming up Friday (or before) include a Tech Talk article for Profitable Glass on Jonathan Schmuck's roll-up workshop, pre-show orders for Baltimore, new work for Baltimore (including a half-lattice stand), the application for the Oakhurst Art Fair... I'm starting to have palpitations. My book is scheduled to be released in paperback this fall and I am in talks with the publisher about doing another one. Met a wonderful artist in Montana while I was there and he has been looking for someone to cast his work in glass--what a coincidence! I have been looking for work that isn't mine to cast in glass (my talents do not lie in drawing and sculpting at this time--I primarily want to dive into the techniques of casting).J starts school this week and I still need to get her cello, put all the new patches on her girl scout vest, take her for her swim team tryout, take her to the dentist, do the back-to-school shopping, get her checked for lice (a mandatory pre-school ritual here in the south), and attend the opening assembly on Thursday. No wonder I woke up with a long anxiety attack at 4:00 this morning!Better get working on the firing schedule and date night cd's (I have 15 slideshows to create and cd's to rip of the glassblowing date nights that happened while I was gone). It's going to be a long week (and I haven't even addressed the online changes coming up at the studio)."},

Dave was sitting right across from me and he assured me I wasn't snoring. I've been up since 6:00, mostly awake since 4:30 having anxiety attacks. First anxiety attacks in a long time, but completely normal as this morning Dave and I took my mother and J to the airport so they could leave on a jet plane to Montana. It's the first time J has spread her wings and traveled somewhere without me, and I turned out to be less ready for it than I thought I was. I'll be joining them in a week and a half, but...Now that I am awake, I need to work on the Date Night slide shows and cd's and the script and form for Judy to use to book them while I am gone.

Hmm, my firing schedule looks to be as complicated as my coffee!One last procedure/thing/process I need to ponder is my unadvertised Date Night addition of loaning participants a camera, having them take lots of pictures of each other blowing glass, taking the pictures and making a slideshow put to music with them, and burning both the slideshow and all the hi-res photos to cd for them. I have 11 Date Night sets of photos queued up right now from which to create slideshows and burn cds, and no matter how many nights after leaving the studio I devote to them I don't seem to be getting caught up..."},
{"title": "Live From Oswego! (Not Anymore I'm Not)", "date": "Monday, July 12, 2010", "text": "I started this post last week while we were visiting family outside of Chicago. Never got it published so today I throw it up and move on. One more session 0f Glass Craft Summer Camp to go next week. The last week in June we had both glass craft and glass blowing camp going simultaneously and the studio was a hopping place.Though we have more sessions scheduled for glass blowing (and kilnforming, and casting, and jewelry making, and bead making), we don't have takers for them. It was a bad year to start a summer camp program. but we are neither dismayed nor daunted. In retrospect, had all the camps filled (or even half of them) we would be dead by now (and we might have taken a lot of other people with us). So we'll call the light summer camp schedule a blessing in disguise. We had just enough sessions to keep things hopping, and, well, can't discount the benefit of everyone (including the campers) still being alive.As you can tell from the adjacent pictures, it did get a little wild at the end. On Friday I had to leave Todd completely in charge for an hour, and I told him to \"use his best judgment\"  when deciding what to do with the campers. Maybe that was not such a  good idea (he found the stretch film dispenser)...The rest of the original post is below. I need to get back to work. (Really.)_________________________________________________________Mocha in a Panera go cup, some desultory piano cd playing quietly in the background. We are ostensibly on vacation in Illinois visiting family for the 4th of July celebration, but in reality Dave and I are both WORKING and leaving our child with the grandparents and Aunt Jan. Heh. It's a good deal. My Mom house and pet-sits for us, and Judy runs the studio so all bases are covered.I am exhausted this morning as yesterday's \"vacation\" consisted of a 3.5 mile walk with Dave at 6;30 am and then an intermediate pilates class with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law at 10:00. I had never even done beginner pilates before so I am beat up today. Nonetheless D and I started the day with another 3+ mile walk this morning. Now to work.Last week was another exciting summer camp session and we had both the 7-9 year-old Glass Craft campers all day and two older glass-blowing campers in the mornings. We did a completely different set of projects in Glass Craft as two of the campers were repeats from the previous session. We also changed up the outdoor activities a bit by adding water projectile devices, bubbles, and croquet.Ah well, no harm no foul. The glass-blowing camp was a much more serious affair--I saw neither bubble wands nor stretch film in evidence during their sessions. However, with Lee as a teacher, I am sure they didn't need them. That man could make tying your shoelaces fun and interesting and, give him something as exciting as glassblowing to teach... Well, we can safely say no one is *ever* bored."},

Oh the  exquisite weight watchers torture. I think I'll console myself with  another swig of Harp lager. My consolation music is \"Delirious\" by  Prince.Another day, another work week (at least the traditional Monday-Friday  part) is over. As usual, we had our ups and downs.Let's start with the biggest up--we have neon! Thanks to Brian  Renoud--our torch instructor and boro/neon artist extraordinaire--we have bright studio green address numerals lighting up the front corner of our building. The photo above shows what they look like in full daylight--you should see the glow at night.Adding to the up of the week, orders keep coming in and we have as much on the books right now in receivables due or orders scheduled for the next month as we did for August through December of last year. Whew. We may be rising from our slump!Date nights, too, just continue to build with an increasing number of people interested in kilnforming dates. This weekend alone we have three glassblowing date nights and one kilnforming date night scheduled. In the marketing department for Date Night I got our follow-up letters created which include coupons  for discounts on future lessons (or other date nights--glassblowing this time, kilnforming the next!). Now working on a database of attendees (and students from classes, and people who buy supplies) so we can make sure we completed all the steps for a successful date night from the initial booking notification to the follow-up email.Finally, even though I have been a slacker about getting newsletters out and classes scheduled, I am getting people in for open studio. The first open studio I offered for kilnforming was project-based, priced by the piece, and all materials and tools were provided. It was really aimed at introducing children to kilnforming and enabling them to make little projects for gifts. Though I still offer that one, last week (because of a request for it) I also added a variation based on Bullseye's model. It is so nice sometimes to leave the thinking to someone else! Why invent the wheel when someone hands you a perfectly round one that works. I also have a torchworker interested in beadmaking open studio for next week so we need to finish the small renovation of the torchwork classroom.The week also had its share of downs. Like many, I am struggling with UPS price increases--especially the $8.69 charge to schedule a pick-up. That is fine if I have several packages going out in a day, but if there is only one and the shipping charge on it is only $5.65, e.g., adding $8.69 is just too hefty a bite. So I experimented with the USPS free scheduled carrier pick-up. The first time--one package going out--was great. Yesterday--six packages going out (all small--all date night stuff so only 14 lbs total) the carrier was a no-show. Customer service at the USPS is really friendly, but incredibly ineffectual; (raise your hand if you would prefer surly and effective to friendly and useless). I put a note in the box to day to PLEASE pick-up the outgoing packages, but I am not holding my breath.Another minor irritation in my week is a client that put in three PO's with me in May, and right after I accepted them all, sent me an email saying they would not pay for any more shipments that didn't come with artist info cards--a LOT of artist info cards. They kindly sent me a template and instructions for how to create them (if I didn't have my own). Their template came with a requested kind of paper, their logo on the front cover, their website address on the back, a request not to change the front or back, and room on the inside for the artist bio and photo... You know, if they want their own branding all over the marketing materials that go out, then they should produce it and pay for it. The style they are asking for is not expensive, but they have already asked to provide them with photos and bio information for them to use in their marketing materials. Now they are asking us to take the information they already have and use it to make materials that have their branding all over it. I don't think so. If I am going to take my time to create marketing materials for anyone, it's going to be me!So I worked up the first version of the new artist cards for Siyeh Glass and Studio that feature just Todd and me (I will add Lee as soon as I have a good photo of him or great photos of all of our work to use instead of our mugs). I was just ready to pack them up and send them out when I realized I had made a typo. Be the first to identify it in a comment on this post, and I will send you a lovely little dish in \"Peacock\".Now I need to get ready to open the doors for the day (this post started Friday night and morphed into Saturday morning) and send out the summer camp reminder emails for camp next week."},

Well, Jasmine is playing with the beach ball (she pushes it around with her nose) and Ernie is regally ignoring her and eyeballing the squirrels in the front yard with feigned disinterest. My glass day begins now.Tomorrow one of my customers is pitching a custom glass and steel piece to one of their customers as a welcoming gift for a huge celebration they are having next year. It might seem like there's a lot of time until next year, but we are hoping they tell us really soon if we're chosen as they will need 800 of these pieces created and custom-wrapped.A few years ago the thought of doing even 100 identical pieces for an order would have given me anxiety attacks for days. Now I'm amazed to realize that I look forward to doing 800 with placid equanimity (I think Bill is much more stressed about having enough time to do the metal than I am about having time for the glass--of course he's also typically much busier at the end of the year than I am). We have a couple of current orders in the pipeline for 40 of these and 60 of those, and they are not registering on my radar one whit differently than the orders I have in the queue for one and two pieces. Wow.Last night the two couples we had in the hotshop for Date Night were fascinated with the entire studio (one of the couples had done a bit of kilnforming glass previously). While I took them on the tour, we got to talking about how long the studio's been open for teaching, selling supplies, date night., etc., and when I said the end of October last year, I think we were all surprised. They were very impressed at our set-up and had a hard time believing that we managed to get so much done is such a short time.----------------------An hour has passed since I wrote on this post. An hour that that was spent talking on the phone with Bill about the details of the 800-piece proposal we are sending in tomorrow. Hubris was indeed my Nemesis on this one. Sure I can do the work, and I also committed to packaging and shipping the work in custom packaging (the custom packaging would be purchased and shipped to me by the customer). And I have no problem doing the packaging and shipping, but Bill brought me a bit back to reality when he started doing the actual math on the space required to store 800 14X14X4 boxes, and how many of them would feasibly fit on a pallet for shipping... and by extension how many pallets would be required to be held for shipping and loaded onto a truck from the studio. Yes, it's still all doable, but I am MUCH less smug than I was when I started this post! Time to slink off and have some coffee."},

Even though it was Father's Day, Lee was game so I shopped (they had to bring their own wine as it was Sunday and you can't buy alcohol in stores here in the lovely south on Sunday) and we put together a nice date. Welcome to a true seven-day work week. I know, I know--I didn't have to answer the phone. But that's the problem with having the studio phone ring in the house too--the phone rings you (or at least I) answer it--regardless of the time, day or night. Might have to rethink that one.I mentioned in a post last week that I taught the little summer campers how to cut glass, but I didn't post any pictures as I lost my camera for a couple of days (sadly not an uncommon experience, the camera losing). But my Mom found it, and there were some great camp pics of the water slide and cutting glass that I'll share today.This week is all about production work and marketing. We still have a couple of spots in our Glass Craft Camp for next week, and we have more than a couple available for July 19th. We also need to fill one spot in the glass-blowing camp next week. Busy, busy, busy. The next three weeks actually all have orders scheduled to ship so I have got to get most everything fired this week. It would be too much to try to fuse orders and do camp.Okay, time to go cut the last pieces of opaline and Tekta for the last of the transparent opaline-a-palooza samples and GET THEM FIRED. Does it seem to anyone but me that this is a project that just won't die? This is definitely the last time that I agree to do 2\" X 1\" pieces of clear AND another color (opaline, in this case) for each 2\" sample square of glass. Either that, or I have the participants cut their own half squares! Heck, since I am responsible for the firing, the post-fire clean-up, and the labeling (even though the latter two are really done by Judy), maybe I should have workshop participants cut ALL the glass!"},

I should be at least a little disappointed about the lack of campers, but, frankly, I can't work up the energy. As usual there is no dearth of tasks clamoring to get done and I am hoping to get up a new website, do a class schedule for July, make the forms for a smoother date night, write about Groupons, and send a newsletter this week.The first session of summer camp was a rousing success. All the campers had a good time (we wore them out too!) and they made some beautiful pieces. I learned some unexpected lessons with this session. As a parent I suppose I should have known, but I didn't take into account that 7-9 year-olds need free time during the day to read, sketch, or just turn their brains off. Going from one project to the next all day for five days is just too much for them (not to mention for me). I am also bad in that I tend to give too many choices for everything. Instead of offering a limited color palette, I let them choose from every color Bullseye makes. Instead of saying we're going to use frit for this project, I let them use frit, confetti, stringer, and cut pieces of glass.However one thing that worked out way better than I thought it would was expanding the difficulty of their projects. They were way more interested in and excited by learning to cut glass than I thought they would be. They made a ton (really, a metric ton!) of kiln beads during the jewelry afternoon.For the next Glass Craft session (the week of 6/28) I am going to both limit their choices and expand their technical range. Two of my campers are returning for the next session so I also need to make sure that they are doing enough different that they won't be bored.Today I need to switch gears and get going on orders for my work. I took three new orders last week and I still have to get them entered into the POS system and the firing schedule. Okay, to work! To work!"},

As I lay away at 2:30 this morning I decided I might as well just get up and do some work. I have been fretting about not having enough hours in a day to get everything done, and being wide awake this morning while everyone else slumbered (Jessie in with me and Mom back in the guest bed) seemed too good an opportunity to pass up.This week has been a chaotic blur. We had a full house Tuesday and Wednesday nights as friends who moved to Bangkok today occupied the guest room and Jessie's room. Mom, J and I bunked together in my bed for those days. Ho boy, a whole new snore pattern to get used to (just kidding Mom). This morning as our friends were finishing the repack of all their boxes and suitcases, the cleaning people arrived (they *never* come before noon--this morning 8:50) and hot on their heels was the repairman for the washer and dryer. Pandemonium reigned. (Don't forget summer camp started at 9:00--thank heaven for Todd!). But everything worked out--as it is wont to do. How? I don't know. It's a mystery.Summer camp has been exhausting and exhilarating. The projects have been fantastic. My main worry is that I have been so focused on making it a really great, full glass experience that I have worn the kids out. Today they very much wanted free-draw and reading time so we had a pretty low-key day. They put together their picture frames, cleaned out their kiln beads, made hammered-copper bookmarks, and did a little free-form fusing. We did not have water slide time again today as at least one of them was so covered in mosquito bites from yesterday that another bite would probably have caused him to turn into a giant mosquito (ala Jeff Goldblum in \"The Fly\"). The campers also made invitations to an exhibit of their work which will take place tomorrow (scratch that--TODAY!) from 3:30-4:30. They are going to set up pedestals to display their work and we are going to have a gallery reception with lemonade, iced tea, and nibblies to show off their amazing portfolios.But summer camp is not all that has been happening in the studio this week. Date Night continues to be wildly popular--we have three scheduled for Friday and Saturday. I am doing the Farmer's Market this Saturday morning and handing off to Lee about 11:00 as Judy has the day off so I need to head into the studio to work there the rest of the day. We also have a very special Date Afternoon scheduled that day--more on it next week. Orders are trickling in from customers who aren't coming to the shows, and I got a request for a proposal to do 800 glass and steel pieces for a corporate gift by January... A job like that comes in and I won't be adding either Beckman's OR the One of a Kind Show this winter.The week has not been without its pitfalls. After doing the penultimate enormous load of opaline striker samples the other day I had an epiphany. I was pretty disappointed at how they turned out--they weren't at all as striking (oh what a witty 3:00 am punster poster I am!) as the ones I had seen at Bullseye last summer. And then it hit me: I was putting the opaline on top of the other colors and firing it and that's not at all how it's best used. Yes, over opal glasses it has to go on top or you wouldn't see it--and we were all a bit underwhelmed with how the opaline-on-opal samples turned out. But to get the most bang in combination with transparent glasses, the opaline needs to go on the bottom. Oh. Damn. I flipped a couple of the samples and re-fired them opaline-side down and (predictably) got bad devitrification from firing shelf-side up on the second firing with only a washing in between firings. But the color was much better.(I think I am finally tuned into it being Friday and not Thursday in terms of this post. I did go to bed last night and slept from 10:00-2:00--I haven't been up since Thursday morning. But it is confusing nonetheless.) Yesterday (meaning Thursday) I tried another firing with devit spray and I am hoping to refire all the transparent samples from the last load and to finish firing the rest of the opaline samples today (the majority of the transparents--and they'll be opaline-side down!).Now it is after 4:00 and I should probably toddle back to bed to get a little more sleep before the alarm starts shrieking. Groupons post still coming--and a quick question on them, gentle reader. Are they as popular in your area of the country as they are here? Or is this an Atlanta phenomenon?"},

What a day!! Two more orders from wholesale customers came in today, it was the second day of summer camp, and I had a second look at a relatively new on-line marketing tool. It was a full and... thought-provoking... day.Yesterday's summer camp project was the glass sketch for 7-9 year-olds.I put up photos of the pictures they drew on yesterday's post, here is a quick side-by-side of a couple of them in paint/pencil on one side and pre-fired glass in the other. I finish with the glass post-fuse. These kids are AMAZING!Today's summer camp project was chalk drawings in the morning with the the campers as the stars of their drawings, and fused glass picture frames in the afternoon in which to hold the photos of the drawings and their camper stars. It was a another scorcher in Atlanta, and the little campers sweltered in the pursuit of their art. Heh.The worst part was when the pictures were done and they had to lay down in them so I could take pictures of them. It wouldn't have been so bad, but the sun was directly overhead and their little grimaces of pain from the sunlight in their eyes somewhat spoiled the effect of the pictures.At the end of the day we got a summer storm and all the chalk was washed away. The drive looked a bit like the fairgrounds the day after the carnival pulls out--tawdry and sad.Between summer camp and date night cd's and phone calls and and and, I didn't even get started on my kiln loads till about 6:00 pm--bad as I was already a day late (I should've fired Monday, but the day ran too long, and I should've fired Sunday but, and I should've fired Saturday but but, and Friday and back to Wednesday--my first day home from Vegas).By 8:00 I had the penultimate load of opaline-a-palooza pieces in, shards for Todd for orders from Vegas, the picture frames--and the first ever sheet of glass I've had to make specifically for Todd. The premise of my work with him is that he repurposes shards of Morceaux de Verre pieces that have been smashed because they are imperfect in some way. I don't throw them (anything) out--and I have never liked selling \"seconds\"--so it has been a great combination of work to put his metal around my glass and make it into something new and great.Anyway, Todd has an order for about 60 of his trees for a catalog, each tree uses three pieces of glass in the base, and they want the trees as close to identical as possible (i.e., the same glass) so for the first time we didn't have enough of the right glass and I had to make it. I'm curious to see how it will turn out tomorrow, this 20\" x 35\" 1/4\" thick sheet of Earth glass. I'm also curious as to how well the colors work when it's smashed (and I can't wait to see Todd and Judy's reactions when I make them smash it--you wouldn't believe how many old pieces that would have made great shards were \"rescued\" because one or the other of them couldn't bear to break them up).Though summer camp and the kiln loads would each have made a full and interesting post, it has been such a day that I am just now getting to the most interesting happening of the day. Some time (months?) ago Lori approached me to ask me what I thought about Groupons...I am such a tease, but it can't be helped. I just looked at the clock and it's almost midnight. I will turn into worse than a pumpkin if I don't get TO BED NOW. Speaking of what I could turn into, I need to remember to take a picture of my birthday present from Todd so I can post it. It was too perfect. More on Groupons tomorrow."},

This morning they got their art baskets--their totes of camp goodies and supplies from pencils and sketchbooks to sidewalk chalk and paints--from Mr. Todd. Then the fun began...Today's project was to draw a fish bowl on paper in the morning, and then this afternoon to translate the picture to glass and make a plate that would be slumped. Danny started the slide sideways by asking if he could do a dinosaur instead of a fishbowl. Then the girls decided to draw their favorite Pokemon characters instead of a fishbowl. Then they all wanted to do square instead of round pieces...Clearly they had too much energy so after snack Todd filled water balloons for them and we herded them all out back by the picnic table. No, we didn't line them up and splatter them ourselves (tempted though we were). Instead we set up Steve (the big aluminum man) on some old glass crates and let them have at it. After much wet hilarity, we brought them back inside to finish up their drawings. It's now about time for lunch, and this afternoon I take over and it will be time for GLASS! More pics tomorrow..."},

Summer camp starts tomorrow and I have at least ten other directions to go in right now too--and that's just for Siyeh Glass and Studio. Add the things I would like to do in the house this summer to the mix--like paint my bedroom and bathroom (and you know painting for me is never just about rolling on a color and being done--there has to be glaze and faux techniques, and silver stars included), make lush, silk curtains for the bedroom, put in the pond/bog pond/vegetable-herb garden, build a bunny hutch with a ground-level run for Jasmine, fix up J's playhouse by putting in a new floor and carpeting the loft area--and maybe paint it too, and as a stretch goal ('cause everybody needs a stretch goal) paint J's room like a jungle (with the direction, artistry and help of Elaine Snell).But this is Glass Incarnate, not Stranded in the South, so let's get back to glass \"stuff\".

My poor internal clock!Enough whining, time for glass thought if not actual glass work. We had Date Night in the studio last night and we have another scheduled tonight and one tomorrow night. Our biggest source of daters right now is the $20 paid listing (I started with a free listing) I have on the Access Atlanta website--an online component of our daily paper The Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC). Giving credit where credit is due, what the AJC did well is choose the right technology partner. Too many businesses (maybe mine too) realize that they need to take advantage of the opportunities presented by this Internet Thing and so they whip up a website or other presence themselves thinking that's enough to compete in today's market. Too wrong.It isn't enough just to have a website or a blog or a Facebook page or twitter. Side note: I still don't get why people think social media sites are a good idea for business in general and a local business in particular--I find constant twits (I mean tweets) and advertisements (I mean business updates) annoying. No, in order to be successful on the web you need a GOOD web presence with a user interface designed by someone who actually understands usability. It is no longer 1995, people! A mediocre website is as useless as a bad one.The AJC made the smart choice of using ZVents as their technology partner for providing information about things to do in Atlanta. They put their own face on the site, but you search for events and how they are presented is all ZVents. This is what you get when you search with just the qualifier of \"tonight\" in Atlanta. There's our listing--right at the bottom of the page! Not bad for a tiny, intimate, urban studio!The lesson I learned from this experience is also extensible to the studio art side of my business. It's not enough anymore just to go out and do shows and hope the customers will come to you and place orders. Again, it's no longer 1995. It's also not enough for show organizers to throw up a website that shows the work of the exhibitors and maybe offers store and gallery owners another way acquire it. Face it--anyone can put a shopping cart up on a website today. I am completely underwhelmed by my experiences with both Wholesalecrafts and the BMAC web interfaces (from the perspective of uploading and maintaining information about my work). And I hate the necessity of having to go out on my own, one little person, to find a better solution!This post, unfortunately, only offers frustrations, not solutions. I don't have solutions yet. Now I'm off to the basement to do some yoga and maybe meditate a little to relieve my business frustration. But look at the bright side--at least I'm posting again!"},

Crumb’s Heroes of Blues, Jazz & Country and it's very 1920's/'30s and GREAT. Thank heaven for strong coffee as my body is beat to sugar from me dragging it back and forth across the country and three time zones twice in a month. But enough about my old and tiredness: Let's get on with it, let's do the annual ACRE (American Craft Retailer's Expo) review!I am not going to pull any punches in this post. There is a lot wrong with the wholesale show market right now, and I have my own theories on why and what I need to do about it for my business. But let's start with the positive...Set-up--in spite of me not shipping the clear acrylic stands to hold the work on the wall panels--was really short. We were done by 5:00 on Friday (and we had finished at 7:00 the night before) for a total of 14 hours--down from 23 last year. I had the box of extra stands and Todd wired me up a bunch more so we were able to get all the work up.The first day was slow and the orders were small. Most of my buyers were new customers for me, and the best-selling work was Todd's aluminum and glass (especially the people). The second day was pretty dead, and the third day I only took one order, but it was a really good re-order from an existing customer. The bad news on that order was that I had been playing phone tag with them for a month about the order and they would have placed it had I been at ACRE or not--which is the same information I got from a new buyer who said she'd started an order for me several times over the past month and never gotten around to finishing it. Now let's go into raw numbers.The first year of ACRE was 2007. My numbers were pretty dismal, but I didn't expect anything big: It was a first-year show, my location wasn't very good, and my booth layout was good, not great. ACRE 2008 was my blow-out year. My average sale was $1,041 and 83% of the sales were to new customers. It was my best wholesale show ever. Then came 2009. While the number of sales only dropped 6%, the average sale dropped to $559 (down 46%) and the gross sales were down 49%. The number of new customers dropped 53%. Whew. But we all knew the economy was shot to sugar in 2009, so we put on our big girl panties and forged into 2010 determined to survive and grow. But though the economy seems to be making little gains (my data is from my numbers at the February BMAC show and the cautious optimism I am hearing in the voices of the buyers placing orders with me outside of shows), ACRE was down in every way for me this year. I felt I had the largest body of work and one of my strongest booth layouts ever (debuted at the BMAC in February), but the sales did not match.Though new customer orders were up 15% over last year, the average sale dropped another 22%  to $433 (number of sales only dropped 6%) and the gross sales were down another  29%. I left the skew of the two big orders from existing customers in the mix, and even with that advantage, the numbers are not telling me a good story about my future at ACRE. There seemed to be far fewer buyers than ever before (I am waiting for the official attendance numbers to be published on the ACRE site to validate that feeling), and of the buyers who were there, I didn't feel that my work was a good match for the majority of them--for type or price-pointWhat I took away from the show is that the people who shopped at ACRE had small budgets and were looking for low-cost gifty things. I hate to say it, but when I walked the floor I felt that their expectations were met by the work represented there. While there were a few artists with incredible work (Lynne Meade, the potter in the booth next to me immediately jumps to mind), I did not see enough fine-craft artists. I felt there was a disproportionate amount of country, cutesy, or both. When I went looking for a gift to bring home for Dave I had a hard time finding anything that I couldn't live without. I do not take it as a good sign when one of the artists has an \"everything at under $30 retail\" sign in their booth.THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM OF ANY ARTIST'S WORK! There is value and beauty in *every* labor of love and they are all desired by different people at different times no matter what the price. What I am trying to point out is that a show needs both homogeneity of expectation and caliber AND diversity of work to be successful. Let me explain....It is important for everyone's success (vendors and buyers) to be well-matched at a venue. One of the big complaints that American craft artists have of other large wholesale shows (gift shows, I mean you) is that many of the vendors are there with inexpensive, mass-produced goods from overseas and because of the preponderance of them, the buyers who attend the show also favor them. Think about it: If you are a buyer, you are going to attend shows where there is a lot of what you're looking to buy. If you can't afford/don't sell high-end craft, you won't attend a show where that's mainly what you see. If you are looking for unique, high-end American craft, you don't want to go to a show where there are booths and booths of little gifty items made in East Somewhereovertheristan.When a new show comes out, it takes a few years to get the vendors matched to the buyers. When ACRE started, the organizers heavily courted (and still do) the fine-craft artisans who produce unique high-end work, and some of them came to the first shows. But (AGAIN--ALL MY OPINION HERE) the promoters also had to fill the floor space, and to plump up the show they took a lot of work that did not interest the fine-craft buyers, and annoyed the fine-craft artists who came. In 2008--the biggest year of the show so far for buyer attendance--I heard from over 15% of my buyers that they were disappointed in the quality of the work at the show. I still get repeat orders from those buyers, but they don't attend the show anymore. Likewise, I heard from several fine-craft artists (primarily in glass) that they were disappointed in the other work represented at the show AND the quality of the buyers (high quality = big budget, big piece buyers).Yes, people were born to complain. There is always someone who has something negative to say, and artists are more cantankerous than most people. However, cranky or not, I think there is some grain of truth to the criticism that each year ACRE has an increasing representation of cottage craft over fine craft. In the organizers' favor, there were several really promising emerging artists this year (I wish I could remember the name of the woman who had the fused glass bowls that were frit and chunk and layered and transparent and beautifully coldworked). But I was still left wanting at the end of the show. Wanting to buy something special for Dave, something that caught my eye and made me covet, and it just wasn't there.So where am I going with all this? \"It's the economy, stupid\" doesn't seem to be the answer to the questions why are many fine-craft artists making less and less at wholesale shows and why are fewer of them doing the shows. The BMAC has also suffered greatly in the wake of the economy. The attendance at their last two shows--both artist and buyer--has been down too (though that was partly the fault of the weather in February--see the bicycle at left). However they seem to have been able to maintain a higher proportion of fine-craft to cottage-craft artists for their shows and a higher number of fine-craft buyers. Don't get me wrong--I think they're limping along too, but they seem to be faring better than ACRE is. Is that surprising? No, they've been around longer, they have more reserves of buyer and artist credit to burn, and burn it they are.In a time when sales at shows are plummeting, both the BMAC organizers and the ACRE organizers are increasing the number of shows they put on--and pissing on each other's turfs (and by consequence on the artists) in the process. There's a new ACRE show in Orlando at the end of January--right before or maybe even at the same time as the February BMAC (if the timing of the BMAC show is changed to the end of January as rumors predict). There's NICHE the show (aka BMAC west), which was just held in Vegas concurrently with the ACRE show--ostensibly to piggy-back off of the JCK show. All this scrabbling for turf and buyers is doing is squeezing the artists. Our show expenses have not gone down. I was encouraged to do *both* ACRE and NICHE by show staff. Can you imagine? It costs me about $5,000 to do a show and I did not even make that amount in gross sales for ACRE!Conclusions? Unless I am given a really compelling reason (and I mean seriously compelling), I am not doing the ACRE show again next year. I am doing the BMAC in Baltimore this summer, and I have no expectations for it. The show staff for it has just spent all their time and effort since the February BMAC on NICHE the Show, and they are just now shifting to the summer BMAC which is less than three months away. It is being held in a new venue in a new city. One of my BMAC buyers placed an order two weeks ago and said \"See you in Philly in August\" at the end of the call. When I asked her didn't she mean Baltimore, she was dumbfounded. She didn't even know about the change of venue. Color me underwhelmed.I think I may have a better place for the $15,000 in marketing money (not to mention all the time and energy) I spend a year on the three wholesale shows I do. That's what it is, after all--marketing money. It's not like you get it back in wholesale. More on that in another post. I've been working on this one all day and I'm tired."},

Today we are closed and I am taking advantage of the lack of people in the studio to get a new website up. The week in Montana gave me the time to really figure out what I want and need going forward, and the time to do it too. I am definitely combining my two sites (Siyeh Studio and Siyeh Glass) into one, and I am featuring the blog and book prominently too.So enough posting, to the interweb and beyond!"},

My husband, for example, codes very successfully from the red chair in our home office or from whatever coffee shop we happen to be frequenting of a morning. Studio artist, however, requires a studio, and I am not in my studio. I am in Montana for a week on family business. Both the family business and the being away from the studio are forcing me to sloooooowww down and evaluate life--and this is a Good Thing. After last week's insane pace (and no posting) I need a little sleep and a little perspective. And to dream of vermiculture--but that's another topic for another blog.Now my only question is, do I work on the websites, or create the other half of the POS system for the retail/classes side of the studio, or do long-term financial and business planning, or catch-up on home finances and long-term budget planning... or should I just read and sleep? Maybe a combination of some of the above--but not a combination that makes me feel like I've been pulled in 20 different directions and am ineffectual at all of them. Right now I think I'll enjoy reading in the early evening sun on my parents' deck while looking out over Flathead Lake to the snow covered peaks in Glacier Park just to the north...

{"title": "What a Week!", "date": "Monday, May 10, 2010", "text": "A new week has begun! I luxuriate in a medium mocha at Chocolate (and the occasional nibble on Dave's bagel--my new dieting strategy: Never order my own food, just take one or two bites from the food of everyone around me). The post today is going to be long with even more photos than text. I'm way behind on studio happenings--and they have been quite post-worthy. Some of today's topics (like the drive-in and the Ren Faire) don't really have anything to do with glass, but right now the studio events and the rest of my time all blur into one big LIFE so I'm not going to bother to separate them out. And speaking of big life, that is me all cozied up to former President Jimmie Carter last Saturday--no photoshopping involved. Details forthcoming.Last week was intense, and it started at the end of the week before with the arrival of Johnathon Schmuck and two of the participants for the roll-up workshop. We hit the ground running on Saturday and flew by the seat of our pants through Thursday. We got through the capricious weather, schedule changes, piece failures and the breaking in of the new pick-up kiln with just a few bruises. Friday we caught our breath--just in time for the arrival of the latest glass delivery from Bullseye. I got a little planning in, and then had to jump right into the East Lake Farmer's Market on Saturday morning. (I'm glad I scheduled Opaline-A-Palooza for every other week and this was our week off).Week two of the East Lake Farmer's Market was pretty quiet until about 11:00. There were no collard greens cooking, no live music playing, no farmers selling organic produce (except for the people next to us who sell eggs and meat from free-range chickens). There was some organic produce available from the staff of the farmer's market, but apparently there are far more farmer's markets than there are organic farmers to sell at them so it's hard to get vendors. There were only six of us this week--the farmer's market booth, LefTeas, two bakeries (sorry, I didn't get names), Little Red Hen Farms with organic eggs, and us.Traffic was desultory. Then former President Jimmie Carter showed up with Mrs. Carter and their grandson Jason (who lives just down the road in Candler Park and who is running for State Senate from our district) and things picked up right quick. There were more secret service people than vendors, but the crowd sure filled in. I was lucky enough to get to shake President Carter's hand, exchange a few words and get my picture taken with him.For those who posted on facebook--No, he and Mrs. Carter aren't coming for date night in the hotshop (Jessie thinks they should come and do a kilnforming date night with me instead anyway), and no, they didn't buy anything (they didn't even get much past the entry gates and we were set-up at the other end), but they sure made my day!The tea vendor (LefTeas) knew he was coming in advance and brought her special organic white tea with peach and apricot essence and osmanthus flowers (Give Peach a Chance). It has his picture on the bag and they got a photo of him holding it. I bought a bag for myself and can't wait to try it (I love their Yellow Dog Democrat blend).Saturday afternoon I crashed. I meant to do some fusing, some planning, work on the website, but I just plain ran out of steam. I napped for several hours. Then we went to the drive-in for the opening weekend of Iron Man 2. The movie didn't start till 9:00 but we went at 7:30 (in the mini cooper with chairs and a cooler) and got the last good spot (second row center). The gates open at 7:00 and it's a big cook-out/picnic with kids running around throwing footballs, playing tag, making new friends, and adults grilling on their little (or as in the case of the people next to us not-so-little) Webers for two hours till showtime. It's amazing. The people next to us on one side had a big grill on wheels for their two cars full of people. The pick-up on the other side of us had a mattress in the bed and they had boxes of fried chicken and mashed potatoes. There were grills and beer everywhere. It was one big tailgate party.Yesterday, Mother's Day, was a complete and total day off for me--the first in I-don't-know-how-long, probably since spring break. It started with breakfast in bed made by Dave and the J (she scrambled the eggs). Then we went to the Renaissance Faire in costume (Dave is one sexy Musketeer), and when we got home I napped for a couple of hours. I did answer a couple of emails and review an article just before bed, but it was really and truly a Day Off. (Dave let me sleep in this morning till 8:30 AND we went to bed fairly early last night--I was seriously behind on sleep).Wow am I charged today! This week my goals are to get the new website up, get Keith's Christmas plates done BEFORE his birthday, and start the roll-ups for ACRE in Vegas in a couple of weeks. Yikes. ACRE, then summer camp! No rest for the wicked..."},

As much as I like Ernie, I think I'll put on James McMurtry singing \"For All I Know\". It's been a week. The most important event of the week was Todd's birthday on Wednesday. He turned 63, doesn't he look great? Actually we don't know how old he is. He acts nine, looks 32, grumbles like 70, and doesn't have a driver's license that we can snatch to check. However old he is, we love him and sing hippo birdie two ewes to him.Lori Schinelli's Glass Inspirations roll-up workshop with Johnathon Schmuck started Saturday at Siyeh Glass with a demo. The rest of Saturday and Sunday were supposed to be up at Lori's studio, but there was a mad moment on Sunday when they thought they might come down and play in the hotshop (it didn't work out), then we hosted everyone all day Monday and Tuesday (beginning Monday morning at 5:30 when I had to turn the pick-up kiln on). There was flirting with another \"play\" session on Wednesday but it was pushed off to Thursday, and today we don't expect anyone at all (from the workshop--Lee does have hotshop lessons scheduled). Whew. Good thing as the Bullseye Glass order comes today. Next week we have to begin our own roll-ups for ACRE in Vegas the beginning of June.Dave skedaddled off to Austin to work for the week Monday morning at 6:30, and I might have envied him except James McMurtry was playing here at the Five Spot on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Five Spot is tiny. And loud. I went Tuesday night with Keith, but I don't think I'll be going back. If I do I'll eat before I go and I'll take earplugs. But McMurtry was amazing on Tuesday (I think I'm in love. If it weren't for Dave I might become a McMurtry groupie and move back to Austin.)Tomorrow is the Farmer's Market again--I have a day off from Opaline-A-Palooza though.

Saturday was full, full, full. We started by setting up at 8:00 for the first day of the East Lake Farmer's Market. (Find it at elfmarket.org because if you go to elf.org--as I first did--you end up at the site for the entropy liberation front. I don't know about you, but I don't have any entropy lying around to liberate.)It was great fun to do the farmer's market. I hope Judy and Carol had fun too as they were there more than I was, and I am looking forward to doing it again every Saturday for the rest of the summer.... well, maybe not EVERY Saturday. Judy helped out this first time as I was seriously overbooked. She was our Market Girl (see her schmoozing with potential date nighters in her spiffy Bullseye t-shirt).Dee was a studio elf on Saturday too as it was Day 2 of Opaline-a-Palooza and she wrangled the class for me (including bringing a box of Starbucks coffee for everyone) and ran the studio while I went back and forth between there and the farmer's market.At 9:30 Lori brought Johnathon down to do a demo in the hot-shop for all the attendees of her Glass Inspirations roll-up class with him. Johnathon is so wonderful. He is such an excellent teacher, a consummate professional with his flexibility, relaxed demeanor and positive attitude. Google his name, people (Johnathon Schmuck). If he ever teaches a class anywhere near you (even not so near), run--don't walk--and take it. It doesn't even matter what it is. I cannot say enough good things about him (and his knowledge) (and his book). In fact, I'm not sure if there are still spots, but he is teaching a coldworking class at the end of this week at Lori's too. If you are available...Now about today! This morning the dogs got me up at 4:00 because of the lightning that presaged the Perfect Storm. I am not sure how many inches of rain we've had in the last seven and a half hours, but it was enough to bring down our rigged awning outside the hotshop by 5:30 am and to bend one of my aluminum pipe and drape pools at a not-so-nice right angle. The mulch is running in a river down the path and the drive, but Lee is cheerful, and I am resilient (if not totally cheerful). Lori, Johnathon and the first class participants arrived a little after 9:30 and everyone else trickled in after that. The tarp is somewhat back up, I put out donuts , muffins and coffee for breakfast and ordered pizza for lunch. If I can't keep them all dry, at least I can feed them."},

We're out of coffee so it's truly a dreary wait. Over the weekend I finished the summer camp brochure, fused and slumped three orders, and did three roll-ups (for the first time since January) with Lee. Today I stare down the barrel of three ad copy layouts--Profitable Glass for my writing for them, Creative Loafing print AND Creative Loafing on-line. I also have to get my order into Bullseye today as soon as Judy finishes the inventory, ship two orders and do three more roll-ups. It's gonna be a full one.Materials inventory. It is SUCH a pain to manage! I am determined to get the POS system finished for the supplies and classes part of the studio so I can slap barcode labels (not the expensive ones I bought for the department store, just internally generated ones) on everything and use a scanner to track inventory. Of course technology is only as good/useful as your persistence and dedication in using it, but I am highly motivated by the sheer volume of glass I now have. I used to have about a third of Bullseye's glass colors in sheet, 90% of the transparent frit in 5 lb jars and 5% in 1 lb jars, 90% of the opal frit in 1 lb jars and 5% in 5 lb jars. I also stocked 30-60 sheets of clear irid at any given time. Now I shoot for 100% of the sheet, 100% of the frit in 1 lb jars, 100% of the rods and stringer (I'm not there yet on the stringer and I forgot to put it on the inventory sheet for Judy to count *groan*), and the same quantities of 5 lb frit I had before.Lucky for me the POS program I got (Checkout) automatically creates barcode labels for all your products, lets you print as many of each label as you need, and hooks up easily to a variety of barcode scanners (we still have one floating around here somewhere from the delicious library project...). I just need another eight hours in a day. Heck, I'd settle for four. Two even!Those slabs ought to be cool enough now, back to the studio."},

I'm up because I need to get a load of roll-up pieces in the pick-up kiln to do this afternoon, Ernie's up because he sleeps in my spot on the couch and I had to shift him over to sit down and post. (When he's sleepy and you scratch under his chin, he closes his eyes and sticks out his tongue while he purrs.)If I have to get a roll-up load in, why am I sitting on the couch and posting? I am waiting for kilns and the glass in them to cool down. I made the slabs for rolling up yesterday and when I looked in on them this morning, they were still at 196 degrees. Likewise for the annealer in the hotshop (also serving as the current pick-up kiln till the new pick-up kiln is finished this week). Lee had a Date Night last night and the pieces from it were still at 194 degrees after I prepped the kiln shelves for the roll-ups and opened the kiln with the slabs.So I post and resist the lure of the bed upstairs. It was a long, intense week and I am pooped. Unfortunately, it's not over. Now that the studio (glass resource center) is open on Saturdays, my week ends on Saturday instead of Friday. Does that mean, you might ask, that I am going to take Mondays off? Sadly, no. While the retail part of the studio will be closed, I will use the time to catch up on finances, paperwork, webwork, and making the pieces for orders. I don't see a six-day schedule working indefinitely, but for now...Now back to the studio to see if glass is cool enough to unload so I can get the roll-ups in."},

Two-fold reason for the Richard Thompson choice: Tonight he is playing at the Variety Playhouse with Loudon Wainwright and I am going! That's the happy reason. The not-so-happy reason is that I am beginning prep for the ACRE show in Vegas so I read through the exhibitor services manual this morning and was brought to a screeching halt by the following section:CES, which stands for Champion Electrical Services (our Exhibition Services provider for the show) is driving the bus on these rules--they don't have anything to do with the Las Vegas Convention Center, or the union labor used by the convention center. The critical sections for me are the\"Requires labor to install and remove materials: Installation of lighting fixtures, track lights...\" (labor is $92 per hour). They do say that \"Exhibitors... are allowed to hang up to six (6) single light fixtures on track lights in their booth. This is meant for light fixtures that hang on the back or side wall where the electrical cord drops to the floor and plugs into the power supplied with your booth package.\" Well, we use 8-10 fixtures per track, and what about extension cords? Do they count as the electrical cord dropping to the floor and plugging into the power supplied? If the tracks are not on the back wall but out a foot from it and the cord goes back to the wall before it drops is that considered \"distribution\"? What IS distribution? I had better hear back from someone soon about this issue or I may be making other plans for (not) showing in Vegas.I asked the wholesalecrafts.com staff for clarification on what we would be able to do this year after the show last year when we had such a furor with the electricians (I really wanted to have information before paying for this year's booth if I wasn't going to be able to do the show because of increased electrical charges). I never got an answer, but I signed up and paid anyway. Then I asked again when I saw them at the BMAC in February, I was told someone would get back to me. Then I asked again when they called me about something else the end of February/beginning of March and was told absolutely someone would get back to me... So far there has been a deafeningly silent action in someone-getting-back-to-me.But let's end the post on a more positive note as I really don't want to think about driving out to Vegas so I can close up shop there and bring my work and display home. Yesterday was Noah's last private lesson in glass studio and I let him pick what he wanted to do. He chose vitrigraph and glass blowing. I need to experiment with the vitrigraph a bit more to get consistent results (flow rate and color), but we ran through 3 lbs of scrap in about an hour and a good time was had by both of us. Then he made a flower and a paperweight with Lee in the hotshop.This afternoon Jessie's girls scout troop will come back to clean up the front garden at the front of the studio and to plant flowers. We did an exchange back in February--I provided them with all the glass and tools to each make a Valentine's day plate and they are working in the garden to pay for it. I love barter.

Noah has been having a great time in his lessons and I gave him a choice of what he'd like to do for his last day. he picked vitrigraph so I had him load a pot with scrap last week before he left and I'll put it in this morning so it'll be ready when he gets here. Lee has also promised him a little hands-on time in the hotshop--maybe even using some of his fresh vitrigraph pieces. I also have a couple of kiln loads for orders to do so it will be a full day.This past Saturday was the first day of Opaline-Palooza and it went great. Pics are of the first set of opal glasses before and after firing. Four people have signed up for all four sessions, but schedules being what they are, almost all of them have one or more days they can't come to the workshop. No worries though as they were so into it on the first day that three of them went ahead and cut the pieces for one of the Saturdays they'll miss. Since everyone committed to all four sets of colors (104 in all) I have decided to throw in all the tints for no additional charge (about 24 more colors) so everyone will end up with a set of 130 sample tiles. Next up on Sample Saturdays--Strikers in sheet and frit. I also have a set and there is an extra set too as it was easier to divide up the glass that way.Other big changes on the horizon. This past year--especially the part in 2010--has shown me that it's just too difficult to effectively manage three different web presences--not to mention confusing for the intended audience. I have been struggling internally with the best way to handle it and I think going to one website for both the resource center and the studio with the blog as the anchor on the front page is the way to go. by putting the blog in I know I'll get updated content almost every day--with the latest photos--(and I won't feel guilty about posting instead of doing other computer work).Computer work lately included getting a business listing on our Google search page.--though it still isn't coming up close to the top (or at all) if you just search for Siyeh Glass. You have to search for Siyeh Glass Atlanta--and that's annoying! However when you do get there you get a map, hours and directions, a photo of the front of the building--even a link to the date night video at the beginning of this post! How cool is that? There is also a place for reviews so any kind-hearted folk out there who have a little time to write are encouraged to post a review.And speaking of new photos I finally have a great picture of Judy the Studio Assistant for the webpage. It's good to be able to put a face to a voice and she answers the phone most of them time... I also need a new pic of Lee and one of Shy Todd. Did get a new one of the front of the studio to help people identify it.Now off to polish some items off the to-do list before heading to the studio."},

{"title": "Okay Already, I'll Post!", "date": "Saturday, April 03, 2010", "text": "Sitting on the little balcony off the bedroom of our cabin at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park in Kentucky. Everyone else has gone for a walk, but I couldn't resist the lure of the Internet so here I post. I'll continue the story of the vacation on Stranded in the South (now more true than ever!), but it's more than time to post on studio happenings over the past couple of weeks.On Thursday 3/24 I took delivery of my biggest glass order ever--4500 lbs of very sharp stuff. And it wasn't enough that it had to be the biggest order, it was also the most fraught, the most damaged, and containing the most rare of fusible glass.When the driver first lifted the roll-up door on the truck and I saw the cases, I thought my heart would stop. The biggest one, the one with boards hanging off on the right contained the only full case of White Tekta on the planet and if anything had happened to it, it would have been irreplaceable.I'm not sure who was thinking what, but the two cases-one of 4' X 2' sheets and the other of 6' X 2' sheets--were banded together vertically with no attached pallet or other support. After they were banded they were used as ballast in a forklift race. Then they were slapped from truck to truck and showed up at my door drunkenly sagging and ripped completely apart. They were so badly damaged that they were tied to the wall of the truck to keep them from falling over.Someone was looking out for me though, because I only had about seven damaged sheets in the smaller case of clear Tekta and one in the larger case of white Tekta. Of the seven damaged, I was able to salvage most of the sheets in pieces large enough to resell and the rest will make nice filler for a sink class. The one damaged white sheet only had a corner chipped.So more about the legendary elusive Moby Dick of glass--my 66 sheets of 6' X 2' White Tekta. After we got it off the truck (and propped it up against the picnic table so it wouldn't fall over), we (Dee and Lori were AMAZING!) processed most of it into 4' X 2' sheets, 3' X 2' sheets, and 2' X 2' sheets. Really, this is the ONLY case of white Tekta currently in existence and yours truly has it all. It has never been sold anywhere else (outside of the BE factory), and unless someone orders 5000 sq feet of it, it won't be available anywhere else any time soon. Cuts like butter, get it while it's available.For those of you on the Siyeh Glass mailing list, you'll get details on pricing and availability in the next week or so (along with details on the upcoming Opaline-a-palooza . If you're not on the mailing list... why not?!?"},

It's been a month!), but I did get my article written and off to Glass Patterns Quarterly, I did get the first draft of the summer camp write-up done, and I am working on the class thing. Also accomplished were a big order from Bullseye including--are you ready for it?--a case of white Tekta. This is one of the holy grails of glass, and I have the only case in existence. It's going to be the April special for the studio and that's a big thing as no one anywhere has ever had it for sale before. Think of it--a fusible white class in a an even 24\"X72\" sheet that cuts like butter. I think I'm going to have to put together a strip-piece class for a transparent and white glass just to celebrate!Thanks to Fox News and Good Day Atlanta we have had date nights booked pretty solid for the past couple of weeks. Now it's time for the next marketing push: I had 1250 brochures printed up and bought a box of clear acrylic brochure stands for them and I'm going to take them around to local businesses I patronize and ask them if they will let me put them out, We'll see what kind of a response that gets. I've also been sending brochures home with the people who have done date nights to hand out to their friends. Between word of mouth and the brochures, I think we can continue our momentum.Now I just need to get momentum going on the classes... This weekend I have a windchime class at the studio through Oakhurst Community Gardens. I'm going to do this one a bit differently than I've done the previous classes. Instead of having them fuse the pieces for their windchimes, I'm going to have them assemble pre-fused pieces... I think. The trick is that I only have them for a couple of hours. If I had them for two sessions we could fuse in one and assemble in the other. Maybe the answer is to have them assemble everything up to adding the glass, then have them put together the glass bits for me to fuse. Then I would attach the glass bits when they came out of the kiln. No, I think I'll give them lots of pieces of fused chime bits with loops fused into them, and I'll let them design and assemble their own chimes and take them when they go.___________Now back from my ikebana chapter meeting, missed my glass delivery, trying to get it rescheduled... It's a day. AND a thunderstorm is rolling in. Maybe I better get back to the class schedule."},
{"title": "Summer Camp is Ready!", "date": "Tuesday, March 16, 2010", "text": "Hey, I could use some help with this summer camp doc. Any glaring inconsistencies, grammatical errors, bloopers? Any and all feedback welcome!General InformationThis summer Siyeh Studio is offering a few young people the opportunity to explore in depth a wide variety of hot glass techniques in our small, urban, production and teaching facility located in the heart of East Lake. This is not your typical 30-kids-to-a-group cattle-car summer camp staffed by high school students. Each of our sessions is limited to no more than six attendees—four for glass blowing. The instructors are our core group of instructors who teach all of our regular classes throughout the year.All tools and materials are provided, and no previous experience is necessary. All we require is that all participants come enthused and ready to focus and learn a lot about GLASS. Healthy snacks are provided in both morning and afternoon sessions—please let us know in advance of any dietary restrictions. Everyone should be bring a full water-bottle everyday. Participants in the all day sessions are required to bring their own lunches.Please call 404-373-4729 or email brenda@siyehglass.com to reserve your spot—space is EXTREMELY limited.Half Day SessionsGlass BlowingAges: 12 - 18Dates: June 14-18, June 21-25, June 28-July 2, July 12-16, July 19-23, July 26-30Time: 9:00 am – 12:00 pmCost: $400Enrollment: Min 2, Max 4Come learn glass blowing (traditional furnace working techniques) in an intense summer session. Each day students will learn and practice a variety of techniques and make their own artworks including flowers, paperweights, tumblers, bowls, mugs, and more!Glass CastingAges: 10 - 18Dates: July 12-16, July 19-23Time: 1:00 pm – 4:00 pmCost: $325Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Participants in this session will make glass castings in pre-made molds, sand and plaster. Their designs will incorporate natural objects such as shells and also sculpted or modeled clay and wax. Each person will make several projects during the course of the week in the process of exploring every aspect of casting from the beginning design to the end finishing work.Kilnforming Glass Ages: 10 - 18Dates: June 21-25, July 12-16, July 26-30Time: 9:00 am – 12:00 pmCost: $250Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Kilnformed glass is glass that has been melted and shaped by the heat of the kiln. Unlike glass blowing and bead making where the glass is handled hot, in kilnforming the glass is designed and assembled cold and then put into the kiln to melt into an entirely new piece of glass. In this session participants will learn the basic techniques of glass cutting, fusing (melting together), slumping and draping (shaping by heating over or into a mold). Then they will rapidly move on to design considerations and additional techniques such as stenciling, texturing, wire inclusions, and much more. Each person will make several projects throughout the week.Glass BeadmakingGrades 8 – 12Dates: June 14-18, June 28-July 2, July 12-16, July 19-23, July 26-30Time: 1:00 pm – 4:00 pmCost: $250Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Each participant in this session will learn to make his or her own glass beads with a minor torch in this intense one-week session. Each day is packed with new techniques to learn from basic round beads to dots, raking, decorating with metals and frit, and more! Each class will start with a demonstration of a new beadmaking technique and then participants will have plenty of time to practice on their own beads. Each person has a torch and a full set of tools to work with. All beads are annealed and available to take home the following day.Glass Jewelry MakingAges: 10 - 18Dates: June 21-25, July 26-30Time: 1:00 pm – 4:00 pmCost: $250Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6This comprehensive hands-on glass jewelry making class starts with design considerations and then goes right into the techniques used to create brilliant dichroic glass jewelry and cast glass cabochon pieces.  We will cover channel and grinding techniques, decorative options including micas, stenciling, and etching, and finishing choices such as adhesive and bail options. Students will make several pieces in the course of the week.Full Day SessionsGlass CraftAges: 7 - 9Dates: June 14-18, June 28-July 2, July 19-23Time: 9:00 am – 4:00 pmCost: $325Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Glass Craft begins with a modified kiln forming class in the morning. Participants will design and make their own fused and slumped glass artworks including tiles, sun catchers, plates or bowls and more. The afternoons will be spent designing pieces for the next day as well as making found-object art in other media—chalk, wire, wood, crystals, shells, etc.Kilnforming Glass & Glass Jewelry MakingAges: 10 - 18Dates: June 21-25, July 26-30Time: 9:00 am – 4:00 pmCost: $375Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Kiln forming glass in the morning and glass jewelry making in the afternoon (both described above).Kilnforming Glass & Glass CastingAges: 10 - 18Dates: July 12-16Time: 9:00 am – 4:00 pmCost: $375Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Kiln forming glass in the morning and glass casting in the afternoon (both described above).Kilnforming Glass & Glass BeadmakingAges: 12 - 18Dates: July 12-16Time: 9:00 am – 4:00 pmCost: $375Enrollment: Min 3, Max 6Kilnforming glass in the morning and glass beadmaking in the afternoon (both described above).For those of you who wonder why I haven't been posting, it's because I have been FORBIDDEN.

The Point of Sale program I have been evaluating (and using in the process to create all of my orders from the BMAC) came to the end of it's trial period unexpectedly this week and locked me out of my data. By buying a physical copy of it online and having it shipped instead of just buying a license key and downloading it I saved $270  (over 50%). But since then I have been waiting for the software (with the license key--which is all I really need) to arrive. It should have been her yesterday. I hate waiting.I am scattered and swamped today so it's a perfect time to post. Posting will clarify (what can really be accomplished in what's left of the day) and organize (those tasks I am meant to accomplish) for me. But first a recap of the week since I last posted.Wednesday Todd and I helped Dee clean and organize a tiny corner of her studio. Oh. My. Goodness. Let's just leave it at that (and we'll be going back next Wednesday for a repeat--I'll wear a hazmat suit this time). Wednesday night's survey class was great and I have several new ideas for more classes. I forgot my camera (again), but one of the people in the class took photos and sent them to me (thank you Melinda).Today--without Judy who is on vacation till St. Pat's day--I ship the first monumental load of orders from the Buyer's Market. I also finalize my current order for Bullseye and get it to Geraldine. While I am in an ordering mood I need more shipping supplies, though that may fall off the plate till Monday because I have my ad for Creative Loafing to design and submit today and that's going to take some time. Finally, I am a week behind on getting my taxes to Helen (the accountant) as I had four pages of expenses from the personal accounts to enter along with a year's worth of mileage. I got the mileage done right away and even finished up the personal expenses, but now I am wading through the P&L statement and Balance sheet to make sure everything is categorized appropriately and doesn't say \"confirm\" on it and I still have to adjust the materials inventory and cost of goods sold numbers for the year.That sounds like more than enough to take up my day, and I'm sure there'll be more things that come up on the fly. Darn flies.I'll be in the studio both days this weekend working on orders on Saturday and teaching a garden stake class through Oakhurst Community Gardens on Sunday."},

Auuuuuuuugh!) and gotten lost in art/poetry on the wall here at Kavarna, and, oh yes, that little Monty Python side trip...Back to business. Last night's class was wonderful. It is going to take me a bit to back into the teaching rhythm--I have had a production hat on for so long that I've forgotten a bit about the timing and social necessities of teaching. I went into last night's class determined to be uber efficient in communicating everything I could to the class participants about the techniques and theory being presented--without overwhelming them--and I completely missed taking into account that classes for many people are also social interaction occasions. Some of the participants of this class had taken other classes together and needed some time to chat and catch up, and all of them needed a little time to learn about the rest of the group and to bond so I had to manage the delicate balance between letting them ramble and reining them in to keep them on track (and on time). After all, the purpose of the class is to HAVE FUN. Yes, they will (hopefully) learn things too, but when they leave the class it is most important that they think back on what a great time they had and how energized and motivated they feel after it (and how they want to do another one).We finished work at 9:30, finished chatting and headed out the door at 10:00. I didn't have them clean up their stations yesterday (bad me), but I will henceforth. I got them all to sign photo releases, but I was so busy during the class that I didn't take any pics. Oh well, next week. One of my students is taking a quick trip to Murano this weekend so I will definitely plan time for chat into next week's class.For now I'll pick up where I left off on the monstrous list from yesterday... after I call Todd.*Thank you Wordpower for the clarification on the use of the subjunctive vs the indicative to express conditions (but what the heck is the .ws top level domain on the URL?)!Either the Indicative Mood or the Subjunctive Mood can be used to express a condition.In the case of a condition which is considered true or probable, the Indicative Mood is used.e.g. If she is here now, we will ask her opinion.In this example, the verb is is in the Simple Present Indicative. The use of the Simple Present Indicative indicates that the condition if she is here now is considered to be probable.In the case of a condition which is considered false or improbable, the Subjunctive Mood is used.e.g. If she were here now, we would ask her opinion.In this example, the verb were is in the Simple Past Subjunctive.

Of course I've spent the past 24 hours tweaking the content of the class to the point that I've added a second project and another hands-on technique learned--it's going to be a full night every night. Whee! (Now I said it.) Tonight's class will be about the many varieties of sheet glass for kilnforming from straight transparent or opal colors to streakies, chopstix, irids, confetti, streamer, and how to combine and layer them for different effects. But that's not enough so we're also going to make our own art glass from streamers, frit, confetti and powders on a clear base. I think I'll bring drinks and snacks as I plan on working this class hard.This Friday I also host my first kilnforming date night. We've had several glassblowing date nights, but this couple want to learn about kilnforming glass. One week back from the Buyer's Market, starting on orders from the show, and teaching too! It's never boring.The elements on the glass furnace gave up the ghost while I was in Philly and yesterday we got a new set ordered from the man who made the furnace over 10 years ago, Sonny Cresswell. He and Lee had a long technical chat and he gave Lee several pointers about rebuilding the furnace. The new elements should arrive the end of this week and we'll be back up for classes by the middle of next week (Lee is amazing).For the past couple of years Don Drum and I have been flirting with the idea of doing some collaborative glass and cast pewter pieces and castings of his sculptures in glass. Both he and his work are incredible and I am very excited about this opportunity. Yesterday he sent me out some molds to play around with and I'm looking forward to creating both fused and cast work with him this year. Might even have something for production to take to the summer BMAC.

Got to make some peacock and ocean glass for Todd before then--oh yes and a lot of large shards for him to use in the wire people for orders next week. At least I got the key rings ordered for him yesterday. (Paperwork, supply management, finances--oh the glamorous life of an artist!)Finally, got to finish clay slumping molds this week for a sconce commission, and get the rest of the Siyeh Studio orders in the new POS storefront (point of sale, not the other, more common usage for POS). And then there's creating the Siyeh Glass POS storefront so I can use it to generate orders and receipts for supplies, classes, etc. Oh My. What day is it again? Am I dreaming or awake yet?

{"title": "Snore, Ernie, Snore", "date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "text": "Egyptian Licorice tea in the Denver skyline mug, robust feline snores emanating from Ernie next to me on the couch for music. Time to get back in the saddle after weeks and weeks of schedulelessness. I got an email from another glass artist/show circuit friend this morning asking me about the tone (for want of a better word) of my last post on doing shows. She wanted to know if I was just tired from the drive or if I was really contemplating quitting the show circuit. What can I say? I am a woman of extremes. Last year I thought the answer would be to add more wholesale shows. By the end of the year (and continuing on into 2010) I was thinking no shows at all--and the recent Buyer's Market did nothing to change my mind.Yes, attendance by both exhibitors and buyers was drastically down due to the double whammy of the economy and the weather (I got an order in email from a west coast client after the show who had canceled her hotel reservations when her flight was canceled). But even without the weather and the struggling economy, I do not see a sustainable future in doing shows. The costs of doing them increase yearly--and I'm not talking about booth fees though those don't lessen either. The other costs--freight, drayage, hotel, parking, and exhibition services can eat you alive. Sure you can economize on food, but my parking and cab fares cost me more than my hotel did this time at the BMAC! And for what? Not one new buyer for my work. If I want repeat orders, I can get them with nice mailings, targeted ads, glossy brochures, catalogs, color samples, and personal calls--all of which cost a lot less in both money and energy than shows do.Show producers are are also contributing to my disillusion with their dilution of the few American-handmade-only shows we have. What is really going to be the outcome of two simultaneous handcrafted shows in Vegas this spring? Are we going to get buyers (most of the buyers, all of the buyers, not SOME of the buyers) at both shows? Really? So why are we being encouraged to do both shows? Why on earth would I want double the set-up and breakdown, double the exhibition fees, double the freight (shipping double the work for two shows) and double the booth fees so that I'm sure to see every buyer? All a second show is doing for me is potentially reducing the number of buyers I see. Do I really think people who don't currently come to Vegas for ACRE are going to be lured there by NICHE? Sure I do. But do I see the numbers doubling to justify the double expense and work required to do both shows? No. Simple math, it's a lose-lose situation for artists.Now some might disagree with me and say that the winter BMAC was such a great show in years past because of the timing of the Baltimore ACC show right after it, and I know many artists who participated in the insanity of doing both (I heard nothing but horror stories and am glad I was spared). Now we're being presented with a new show in Orlando and it seems like it will stretch the buyers even thinner. When I mentioned the argument that we should see a lot of crossover buyers from the Orlando Gift Show to one of my Florida gallery owners at the BMAC, she laughed so hard I thought she'd have a heart attack. Her analysis of the Orlando gift show was that it was cheap beach towels, souvenir trinkets and suntan lotion. Are their buyers going to want to add handcrafted American work? Takes me back to my experience doing the Dallas show last year in the temps when I was down the aisle from the people selling Poo-Pourri and little cloisonne balls holding lip gloss that were made in China--I still feel soiled.Which is not to say that Dallas was a totally bad show. My experience last year was that it was more about no one great show than about poor shows vs. great shows. Something good came out of every show I did last year, and total revenue from the shows would indicate that doing all of them is the way to go. But when total expenses were balanced against total revenue, there just wasn't enough \"good\" to continue carrying the horrendous costs.So I have my fingers crossed for Vegas. The show date was changed so that I'll be spending my birthday there this year. Maybe 49 is a good year to celebrate in Vegas with friends."},

My hope at the end of day 2 turned out to be unfounded and I took two orders a day both Sunday and Monday. So the show turned out to be a little better than last year (which was dismal), but the return in no way justified the effort and expense of doing it. I did not get one new customer for my kilnformed glass--everyone who ordered from me has been a strong customer in the past. Todd picked up a few new customers for our collaborative work, and one of Sara's old paperweight customers came in and ordered from us. I think Bill and Elaine did well, but I didn't talk to anyone who had a great show. We were pretty much all glad to get ANY orders.The new booth layout went very well and we were up and down if not in record time, at least very quickly. Come to think of it, it may have been record time for us. And the breakdown was complicated by packing two crates of work and the new display panels to go to Vegas for the ACRE show, two crates of lights, carpet, pedestals, and miscellaneous to go into storage here for the summer show, and two carloads (Bill and Elaine's and mine) of old work to come home. With all that we were still done before 10:00 pm.The future of shows is grim. The costs of doing them just keep rising--booth fees, exhibition services fees, shipping fees for work and display, lodging, parking if you drive and more. And isn't this a kick in the pants--parking the minivan here and cabbing back and forth to the hotel cost me more per day than my room did. I am still on the fence as to whether this is my last year of shows, but the outlook is not good.Now time to hit the road. Bill and Elaine are already on their way and said the spitting snow we are getting here in Philly stops below Baltimore. I hope so. I am ready to see my family tonight and to just rest for a few days. Thanks to John for the snowy bicycle pics."},
{"title": "Day 2 of the BMAC", "date": "Saturday, February 13, 2010", "text": "A white Russian made with coffee creamer in a water glass (thanks John :-), the hum of the heating system for my background music. Dee, Todd and John have all gone out for a drink without me. I stayed tucked virtuously up in bed to crunch sales numbers and to post.Like the front of the new business card shown at right? I designed it during a spare minute in the booth today. The picture (also taken in the booth today) is a detail shot of the new large steel and glass collaborative piece I have with Black Cat ArtWorks. The stand depicts two peacock feathers and it cradles a 20\" round glass panel. The glass is the new peacock colorway I created especially for this stand. I think it might be my best colorway yet. The back of the business card has all the contact info in a font large enough to read without reading glasses... Yeah, I'm getting old.So about the show. In a nutshell, it's a Chinese curse personified: We all find ourselves, indeed, living in interesting times--both short-term and long-term.The weather has played havoc with exhibitors and buyers alike to the extent that if you're here, you really worked hard to Make It So. A not unexpected outcome of that reality is that there are far fewer buyers than I have ever seen at a February show--you could practically bowl in the aisles. That said, the buyers who are here are writing orders--the aisles are empty because the buyers are not window shopping, they're in the booths buying. In direct contrast to last winter when the glass artists languished uncourted, today when I walked from glass back to inspired interiors, the aisle was empty, but for four booths straight on each side of the aisle there were artists taking orders. I'd trade empty aisles for serious writers any day.I am also seeing a more traditional customer base in my buyers than I did for either of the BMAC shows last year. By the end of the summer show, I was really concerned that the Buyer's Market was devolving into a regional show from a strong national one. This winter the buyers are lean, mean, and national. They are the survivors and they know it. While I am seeing a few fresh faces filled with the shiny, dewy optimism of new gallery owners, I am seeing far more lined, gaunt, experienced, but determinedly forward-looking visages. They are decisive and strong--and they are good business people. I am confident that they will be reordering because they know their demographic and if they're ordering it's because they are confident of selling--this is not a let-me-try-one-of-these-to-see-if-it-goes market.The orders I'm getting are also radically different than those of last winter. This show my average order size (admittedly with only two days of data) has doubled from last year bringing it back in line with the 2008 winter figures. The new display is also netting me positive results: sales of my glass (as opposed to joint work--steel, aluminum and blown glass--with Bill and Elaine, Todd and Lee) are up 10% overall--in spite of adding the new joint work with Lee (roll-ups and paperweights). For overall sales totals, I am already within $1,000 of my total sales for winter 2009--and there are still two days of the show left.I'm interested to see (and hopeful) how the next two days will pan out. Sometimes it's not over till it's over and the 2:55 pm order on Monday saves the show, sometimes it's over after the first flash with Sunday and Monday being empty yawners, and sometimes, just sometimes, it starts as it means to go on and stays steady and true for the duration. Here's hoping for the last option.In spite of being a show fraught with interesting times--or maybe because of it--it has also been an incredibly fun show. I have schmoozed, eaten and drunk with more artists and buyers than usual and the conversation has been intense, positive, driven--and alive. Is it the triumph over nature and getting here despite the snow, or is it the adrenaline engendered by the proximity of the recent apocalypse in Haiti, or is it maybe just still standing after (during) the on-going economic turmoil  that has filled us with a vibrant, electric energy and a surging awareness of being alive. I don't know. Maybe for me it's just that I've had coffee for the past two days and my body has gone into energy overdrive. I don't think so. For me, I think it's a bit of all of the above. As I was packing up and getting on the road on Tuesday, Lee (who has only worked with me since this past summer) looked at me and marveled aloud that I am one of the most resilient people he knows. That's what we all are, those of us who are here.Let me close by telling you again about the nature of the craft business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. So what do we do? Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery."},

{"title": "What's Wrong With This Picture?", "date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2010", "text": "It works better if you turn the kiln ON, that's what. At first glance this is a perfectly normal shot of a kiln load. But this is the AFTER shot (or should have been) not the BEFORE shot, and I was more than a little dismayed when I opened Bertha yesterday and saw my slump load from the night before still unslumped. That was the first major disaster of the day. I looked into slumping the pieces yesterday and having Judy ship them 2-day to Philly for me so they would be here by Friday... $179.00. I don't think so. So I fell back to using pieces that I already have in Philly to fill in the gaps--which is great, but I don't know what pieces I have there after all this time. So without knowing the pieces I have to work with, we couldn't drill the holes in all the panels. We also can't use any power tools (corded, cordless or battery-operated) at the show so I called Hargrove to see how much they would charge to have union labor drill the holes for me. Once the panels are marked, drilling the 1/4\" plywood (with a power drill) is nothing--Dave did one in under 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the minimum time is one hour, and the charge is $120. I don't think so. I stopped by Ace hardware on my way out of town and got a small manual hand drill. It won't be fun (for John--Todd's partner John is here to help with set-up and breakdown too so we at least have three sets of hands in the booth and his are the strongest hands), but I have my principles.With two strikes behind me, Dave and I loaded up the minivan in the rain and I hit the road... at 1:15. The weather was not good for the entire afternoon, evening, night and early morning. It was either raining, spitting sleet or snowing the entire way. When I left Atlanta I had the germ of an idea to go straight through to Philly and arrive at 1:00 am. The germ steadily took hold and I was pretty committed by 9:00. Then about midnight I hit the REAL weather. There were cars on top of the guard rails, cars upside down, a jack-knifed semi, cars facing backwards on the freeway--most of them with their lights on and people still in them slowly getting covered by the snow. But I reasoned that it was better to make the drive with very (very) few other cars on the road than it would be to make it during the day with a lot of other cars--and yet more snow, and maybe wind too. And I arrived safe and sound by 3:00 am.Now it's after 10:00, Bill and Elaine were first in line to unload this morning and were all done and having breakfast by 9:30. I am... awake, semi-alert, still decaffeinated and ready to have a hot shower and get to my own unloading. The hotel is... interesting. It's a little boutique hotel for weekend romantic travelers and so has no fridge, no microwave, a little bitty flat-screen tv, no dresser, no bathtub (shower only)... and single beds unless you get a room with a queen and a cot. But the beds are comfy, the room is quiet, and it was only $69 a night through Hotwire (and it's close to the convention center).The phone has been ringing non-stop since 9:00, guess I better get to it.A life of shows on the road is never boring."},

Thankfully the three-second rule does not apply to tasks dropped on the floor (only to food), so I still *might* be able to pick them up again--depending on how the drive and set-up go. Most of them have to do with sending out email to my galleries about the new work (come to the show! come to the show!), getting postcards and other info sheets printed, and other administrivia.Okay, that's enough post for this morning.

I was supposed to head up to Bill and Elaine's tonight and we'd all hit the road tomorrow morning in the way dark to get to Philly by tomorrow night. That way we'd have a nice restful night there, a calm morning, and begin set-up at noon. But I'm not done firing yet. I was in the studio till 11:30 last night and still have three slump loads, and a firepolish load to do in the studio and three roll-ups to do in the hot shop. Lee also has paperweights to do in the hotshop (after the rollups) that I need for the show. Sara and David of Creekmore Durham Glass have passed the punty, so to speak, on the paperweight technique to us and we are taking them to market with our new roll-ups.So where am I in the prep cycle? Well, we are trying something new this year for our display (surprise, surprise!) designed to help us get the booth up faster. We are hanging 2' X 6' fabric-covered wooden panels on the walls which will have been (but aren't yet) pre-drilled (can't use power tools at the show) for bolts to hold plate stands. It probably sounds more confusing and complicated than it is because I am so kerfluffled this morning. The big downside to this display is that it's a permanent arrangement of pieces--no futzing around and changing our minds as we set-up--extremely daunting. Too late to worry about that now, we're committed to the course. Better get on my panel layout and drilling--it's going to be a long day."},

I was so tired I slept right through my anxiety attack at 4:00 this morning. Well, I woke for a couple of minutes, but my subconscious just couldn't get my neurons awake enough to fire false adrenalin through my system and I fell right back to sleep.I did manage to get stands ordered today--two sets of them, both will be here Friday. *sigh* I don't need two sets and can't afford two sets, and it's a long story that I won't go into now, but I found myself succumbing again--but this time not to sleep (or the blandishments of a fast-talking man... well, he was a fast-talking man, but he didn't talk to me about the things fast-talking men usually talk to me about... come to think of it, it's been a long time since any fast-talking man talked to me about those things...

Those claws are SHARP!)Three more roll-ups done today. We are working on a new roll-up technique that is significantly different enough from the Australian roll-up to merit its own name--I give you (drum roll please), the Montana roll-up! Yes, we're in Atlanta Georgia, but we're a studio named for a place in Montana--besides, the Atlanta roll-up makes me think of a fleabag rent-by-the-hour motel. The Montana roll-up sounds more... romantic and dashing. Pics soonish.Things turns out to be a pretty amazing piece of software. It's not on the level of the Kindle or the iPhone for life-changingness, but it's pretty great. (Ernie has decided that if I won't put my hands on him, he'll put his head on the side of the laptop and snooze for awhile.) I was so inspired by it (and disheartened by the amount of effort that it takes to use the automated ordering spreadsheet that I laboriously created to manage my Bullseye glass and equipment sales) that I started the search for another piece of software--an affordable, feature-rich point-of-sale (POS) application for the Mac. You'd think I'd asked for a sliver from the true cross. Intuit wants $1,900 for the software and hardware periperals, and their app doesn't even run on a Mac!

It's been three days since I last posted and I am all kerfluffled (kerfluffled, adj., from transitive verb kerfluffle; to discombobulate or throw out of whack). A quick side note: I would love to know where that word originated. I have long used it and finally got around to googling it tonight to find out how others use/spell it. Apparently January is the month to be kerfluffled or kerfuffered as it already showed up in two other blogs earlier this month. There are also several political articles/comments/blogs that use the word--including an AP story quoting W... now doesn't that reference just pee in my bean curds? But I digress... (what can I say? I'm kerfluffled!) (And a last digression--doesn't google make it easy to lose yourself down a rat hole and become kerfluffled?

If you've ever seen Bullseye's price catalog and the maze of tables that you have to go through to order and figure out pricing, you can guess how daunting this task would be. They don't even offer a blank paper table like it to use as their order form--too complicated. But I love a challenge, creating spreadsheets always lifts my spirits, and it so quiet here today that I need something (anything) to make the time go faster.Let's try to make a long story short as I'm sure none of you have the time on your hands that I do right now, and you probably have things to do other than read about my geekgasms. So here it is. I have long struggled with a way to easily turn a table so that the columns become the rows and vice versa. You know, flip the axes without having to retype in all the data. Well today Google saved me! I searched for \"flip columns and rows in Excel\" and got the answer--and it's a simple Copy, Paste Special-Transpose! OMG. Life will never be the same. This is as big for me as the Kindle or the iPhone. Really.Now I have to get back to playing with it. (Was it good for you?)"},
{"title": "The Dallas That Won't End", "date": "Saturday, January 16, 2010", "text": "What the heck am I doing posting on a Saturday night? I am bored and restless out of my mind, that's what. Were I not a professional, I would already have packed up and been gone from Dallas but for the dust. But I am a professional, I can't leave the showroom with an empty front window in the middle of the show, so I spend my days getting in touch with my inner spreadsheeter and chafing to go home. Real home. Home to Atlanta, not home to the Radisson from where I am posting and watching Miss Congeniality 2... and listening to a car alarm going off in the parking lot... repeatedly. (Just called the front desk and they are sending a security guard out to check on it before I go mad and drop a brick on it from the 7th floor.)I never thought I would overload on spreadsheeting, but the last two days have taxed even me. 9-6 with breaks only for lunch and bathroom--and the occasional chat with someone who thinks my work is beautiful but it's too expensive or, or, or. Whatever. Tonight was the last Saturday night I had to fight my way through Dallas market parking lot traffic. Yea me.It's 10:00 pm and I'm scrolling through the program guide and it's amazing--the same programs that were on at 8:00 pm (and 7:00 pm) are now on again at 10:00 and it looks like many of them were also on at 9:00. Television has changed since I last watched it. It used to be that every hour had a different show. Now it seems like many channels have the same shows repeating over and over. Oh maybe they aren't the same episodes of Law and Order or CSI: Miami, but those are the only shows on those channels for the entire night. Other channels have a couple of movies and they run one, then the other, then the first one again--or maybe the same one back to back (I could be watching Miss Congeniality 2 again, instead I'm catching the tail end of Ocean's 13. I saw the last half of it last night on the same channel, and the first 10 minutes of it earlier tonight before I switched to Miss Congeniality 2. Looks like it'll be on again tomorrow. Lucky me.What does this have to do with glass? It shows the glamor of  life on the road for the production artist. Lean Cuisine frozen dinners stashed in the hotel fridge, Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc too. Mom already snoring gently in the other bed, worn out from sitting around all day.Tomorrow I need to move on from spreadsheets to newsletter, class descriptions and schedule, updating the mailing list, and pushing all that info out into the world (yes, Dee, that means going over the dicro jewelry class materials and hammering that out... finally ;-)After a half hour sucked into Jim Carrey's movie \"Yes Man\" I have sunk as low as I can go and must turn off the evil box and go to sleep.

{"title": "Boring...", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2010", "text": "I wrote too soon about the great connectivity at the Dallas Market yesterday. Today is the first day of the temp shows and the network is again saturated. Guess my window for Internet work was yesterday. Today it takes everything forever to load--thank heaven posting just means getting the window up once and then typing away. Looks like a good day to write-up class descriptions and finish price lists with built-in formulae. That latter project is a doozy.I started this post by typing in all the details of why creating price lists is so difficult, but then after two mind-numbing, eye-glazing paragraphs I realized all I was doing was stroking my inner spreadsheet geek ego and losing readers. So 'nuff said. It's VERY complicated. I did (mostly) create all of the pricelists before I opened my studio for retail supplies, but I gave up about 3/4 of the way through because I got overwhelmed (four spreadsheets with 10 worksheets each, three look-up spreadsheets with 3- 9 worksheets each, all of it linked and cross-linked so I can update them easily... Yeah, good luck with that!--and here I need to shut-down that inner geek again).Also need to get in my Bullseye order today and pay them for the last order--I am ordering thick and fast these days. Wish I were selling thick and fast too, but the Buyer's Market is coming and I pin my hopes there.Okay, enough procrastinating--time to work. I feel very uninteresting in this, the beginning of 2010. Maybe it's because January is a grey month so I feel grey--all my warmth and vitality hoarded inside to keep from losing it to winter's chill. Or maybe I'm getting into a rut and need to shake up my business and thereby shake up my posts (I felt my spouse's heart attack clear from Atlanta and heard the reverberating thunder of his shouted NO!). Okay, no shaking. Calm, still, reflective, catch-up. Man that's hard (and boring!)."},
{"title": "I Have Connectivity!", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2010", "text": "Good afternoon from Dallas! Internet connectivity has picked up and I have a steady strong signal today. Whoo hoo! However it's still not enough of an incentive to get me to stay in the showroom for another year, nor is the order I took today (surprise, surprise!). It was from a gallery (jewelry store) in Tombstone Arizona and when they asked me if I did ACRE and I said yes, they were dumbfounded that they didn't see my work there last year... Glad the booth that required the most set-up time EVER was so memorable. It's very good that we're moving to a new, clean layout this year.Traffic has been pretty good today, but I don't feel I'm seeing anyone I would court that I won't also see in Philly or Las Vegas. The few people I have talked to have been either decorators (and I'm not looking to move into that market after all) or little localish store owners (nurseries, eg.) and the business I get from them doesn't warrant the cost of the show.Now if I were in lighting, this would be the place to be--and maybe of my neighbors in the showroom carry lighting. This is, by all accounts, THE show for lighting. Maybe if I move more into the sconce arena (not an immediate goal--though I have tossed the idea around before).So my goal is to work on my websites for the next *five* days I have to be at this show. I have class lists, class descriptions and schedules to create for siyehglass.com,  and gallery lists, articles about upcoming shows and new work to write up for siyehstudio.com. I also have my Kindle and an Internet connection (and my Mom). What more could I ask for?"},

After an intense planning session in Commerce, headed back to Coldlanta and met Mike for a confab about the Siyeh Glass website. Much goodness was decided upon there, too, and when I left to pick up the Mom-in-law and the small child from their mani-pedis, I was feeling quite satisfied with the progress of the day.Next was a whirlwind packing job at the studio to get a big order out, a review of Lori's glass order for her grand opening at Glass Inspirations later this month, and lists and forms for Judy to manage whilst I am gone. Finished the day with a consult with Lee over the state of the glass furnace (it failed last week and we feared the worst--a broken crucible and glass fused all over the elements and the bottom). We were *very* lucky and it was just a blown element which was rapidly replaced with an old one and which we will update with a new one as soon as I get back.Now, exhausted and toasty from a couple of glasses of wine, I make my way upstairs for bed with a seriously diminished to do list and a happy heart.

Today I got the winter newsletter from Kashi Atlanta and I'm in a movie! I remember being interviewed last year at the beginning and the end of the detox, but when I didn't see anything done with it I forgot about it. Now, hey, there I am and all enthusiastic and everything. Is it a coincidence that the winter detox falls smack in the middle of time I will be home from Dallas and not gone to Philly yet and can therefore do it? Will my husband divorce me if I do? I was just talking to a friend last night about getting together once a week for yoga at Kashi and she was all about it. I also extolled the virtues of ghee for breakfast (lots and lots and LOTS of ghee!) and though my audience all looked slightly ill, I was reminded of just how energizing and satisfying nothing but melted clarified butter for breakfast can be. The universe aligns.The only other alignment of the universe yesterday was that the oxygen tanks came in time for the beadmaking class last night. The glass order from Bullseye didn't come--it was held up in Salt Lake City for weather and will be delivered today. I used up the last of my glass on orders yesterday and am looking forward to being able to do new work today in time for my buyer visits on Sunday. The glass furnace is also on the fritz--Lee thinks one of the elements might be out--and he started cooling it down yesterday to take it apart today. I don't envy him--it's still only 29 degrees out there (and, no, Bill, not Celsius!)."},

I'm wearing a heavy cotton mid-length-sleeved shirt, two sweaters and fleece slippers (I have pants on too, but they're nothing out of the ordinary).

{"title": "Goals--The Posting Triofecta!", "date": "Monday, January 04, 2010", "text": "This post, too, I began over a week ago, and though I've already posted twice this morning, I'm going to make it a trifecta today and be back caught up for tomorrow. The final big topic for the turning of the year is goals. What are worthy goals for the upcoming year? Let's start with analyzing the major activities and components of the studio--shows, showrooms, representation, partnerships, production work, retailing supplies, marketing, hosting events, and teaching--and go from there.Shows: I like doing shows well enough, but I am beginning to question their value. Clearly the state of the economy last year had a negative impact on show revenue, but long-time show artists have noted a steady decline in the return on investment (ROI) for shows since their heyday in the early 90's. My comparative data (for wholesale shows) doesn't go that far back, but I do feel that big the buyers I used to see a few years ago have either cut back on the show attendance or eliminated some shows altogether. (One of my best buyers from the northeast that I met at the Buyer's Market several years ago asked me recently if I was doing the Atlanta show this year because she won't see me in Philly--the hop-skip-and-jump airfare is too high.) If I want to promote my new work to her and to others I won't see at my shows, I am going to need to do some other marketing be it advertising in magazines, or putting together a print or digital catalog/mailer, and totally revamping my website (has it been two years already?). But I don't really have the time, money, or energy to do both shows and heavy marketing.So what to do? Well, for starters I will do only three shows this year. I am not doing either Dallas or Atlanta again (well I will be doing Dallas as I have the showroom there and I am required to be in it during major markets). I am not adding either the One Of a Kind wholesale show in New York, or the New York Gift Show, or the George Little show in Chicago. I will carefully evaluate the shows I am still doing (the Buyer's Market in February and August and ACRE in June), and I will consider not doing any of them next year.Shows cost me about $5,000 each to do--that's almost $15,000 a year between booth fees, storage, drayage of materials to and from shows, exhibition fees, hotel, meals, airfare, etc. And I don't even count the physical and mental toll, or the lost production time in the studio. If the revenue I see from a show is $10,000 or under, then I am spending 100% of my marketing/business growth budget for less than 30% of my annual income--bad ROI. (Sit ROI, stay ROI.) I can't help but feel a little judicious, targeted, less taxing traveling to galleries combined with magazine advertising, print and digital media and mailings would cost a heck of a lot less for the same revenue receivedPermanent showroom: I will end my presence in the showroom at the Dallas World Trade Center--it was a failed experiment and not just because of the environment. My business model is not geared towards working with the decorator/designer market directly and that's not where I wish to put my energy.Representation: I am not interested in any of the opportunities that I was presented in the past year for wholesale representation of my work. While at first pass it looks attractive to have someone repping your work to stores, galleries and decorators, I would rather both make the first impression and set the expectations for the relationship myself (Control Freaks R Us). As for representation to the decorator market, again, not my target demographic. Too high-maintenance, too much effort for wholesale work. Designers essentially take the same time and effort as clients for regular commissions, but they pay between wholesale and retail as they charge their clients retail and are paid themselves with the difference. Not worth my time.Partnerships: I love producing collaborative work with other artists and want to maintain this component of the business. I am both stimulated by their work to create new work of my own, and I'm also able to produce a lot more quality work because I am not responsible for 100% of it.Last year brought me four new partnerships--two in my own studio, the third with another studio-owner, and the fourth with my local Community Gardens. First I have Lee Ritchie running the hotshop, teaching all the glassblowing classes, and producing all my roll-up work. I also have Brian Renoud maintaining the torchwork classroom and teaching the beadmaking classes. Both of these have been rewarding beyond my wildest expectations. I love the stimulation of other people in the studio doing their own thing--great energy, and I also appreciate being able to offer more learning opportunities and more studio work than I would be able to do on my own. Lee and Brian are both completely reliable and responsible and dedicated to growing their individual components of our teaching facility.The third partnership with Lori Schinelli for the Bullseye kilnglass resource center (KGRC) is just really getting going now. Though I opened Siyeh Glass Resource Center in October, Lori's portion of our KGRC opens the 23rd of this month.  I look forward to seeing a revenue jump from her classes (more on that under retailing supplies below).Lastly, as part of my new Resource Center initiative I partnered with the Oakhurst Community Gardens to teach classes through them in November and December. All but one of the classes were offered in my studio/resource center, but the OCG did all the advertising on their website, collected the fees, etc., and just paid me based on the number of participants. There were a few kinks to work through, but I think we've got it down now and I look forward to teaching more for them in the spring.Production work: Even though I love working with other artists, it's time this year to get back to expanding my own individual work not just in terms of new colorways and piece styles, but in new production series (coming this year: the mosaic series and production roll-ups!). This past year I noticed I have a skewed vision of my income because it included all the collaborative income. While I don't have to make 100% of the work in my collaborative work I also don't make 100% of the income. Once V is caught up on last year's books it will be interesting for me to see if my sales are increasing , stable or decreasing when I factor out the income from the portion of the collaborative work that isn't mine.For collaborative work, I am also dependent on the production schedules of my partners. If they're booked for production and I'm not, I have to turn down or push back work (and, therefore, revenue)--not something I can afford to do right now. So if I spend all my energy (as I have done in the past couple of years) developing and showing new collaborative work, I am effectively maximizing sales of that work and minimizing sales of work that's 100% my own.Retailing Supplies: Now that I have a permanent part-time employee, I like having a studio with regularly-scheduled open hours. And it makes me feel less guilty about having an employee to work on the mindless parts of my production work (and to make me consider taking on new series work that has a higher proportion of mindless work than my other series). Though the retail aspect of the business has yet to bring in any noticeable revenue I expect that situation to change when we are teaching more and when Lori is up and running and churning out those beginner classes.Marketing: This year I am still working on marketing in the cheap. I can't afford to invest a lot (much at all) when I still have three shows to pay for and a bad year to recover from. But I will get the websites for both the studio and the resource center running smoothly and being updated frequently.Hosting events: Last year I ended the year with two artist open houses in December and the beginning of Date Night in the hotshop. I was really pleased with both endeavors and look forward t expanding both concepts this year. It was good to have people in to the studio to shop, schmooze and nosh for the Sleigh Rides (artist open houses) and I would like to see us do another one before Mother's Day/Graduation/the summer art fair season. Date Night has been wildly popular with participants and I have expanded it to include not only wine, cheese and chocolate but also a slideshow on cd-rom memento of the evening and an after-date treat at the Chocolate Bar (through another partnership I am currently working on). Now we need to get Date Brunch in the Hotshop and Date Nights in both kilnforming and torchworking available.Teaching: I knew I was going to love teaching glass. The positive feelings I had from writing the book, working with the Waldorf 7th graders, hosting open studio in 2008 and 2009, and teaching one-on-one were only reinforced  by the workshops I did through OCG and I very much look forward to teaching more regularly next year. Speaking of which, someone called from Delphi about teaching a woprkshop or two there this year... better get on that.A mocha in a to-go cup from Kavarna to drink, the ticking of the cloak and the snoring of Ernie the Monstrocat, asleep on the couch next to me, for music. Is the juxtaposition of these two sounds paradoxically philosophical, or philosophically paradoxical or do I just like the sound of those words together and have no idea what the hell I'm talking about? The ticking of the clock goads me to think of all the tasks I have waiting for me when I finish posting (now that the holidays are over and it's back to studio as usual). Ernie's snoring makes me think of the goals I have been working on for the new year--a major one of which is to take it easier and slow down a bit.The last 2-3 weeks have been time out of time for me. The week before Christmas I pretty much gave up on worrying about the things I didn't have done, planning of any kind, and juggling finances (that phrase can be understood to mean gave up on worrying about all three of them or gave up on worrying about the first one and doing the next two--both interpretations are valid). I stopped blogging (and boy did I hear about THAT!). I slept late and played Dragon Age on XBox till the wee small hours. I blew glass in the hotshop for the sheer joy of doing it (and for Christmas presents). I had a massage and a pedicure, went to a couple of movies, had dinner with friends, played lots of Race for the Galaxy with Dave and took naps. I didn't read as much as I would have liked, but that's maybe my only treasured activity in which I didn't indulge.Throughout all, the house was full of family and pets, and chaos reigned. Yet I slept all night every night--no 4:00 am wakefulness--and I didn't dread the next day... ever. Yesterday, in contrast, I dreaded the looming week, slept poorly (partially from the knowledge that I had to be up at 6:00 to take Dave to the airport), and felt weighed down by the world. I was initially puzzled this morning on my way back from the airport by my stress level. I mean, I could understand my reaction if I had a job I hated and was having to go back to it after vacation. But I have ostensibly got myself into a position where I love what I do, do only what I love, and do it at my own pace. What could be so stressful about that?Then I had a revelation. Nothing had changed in my situation but my internal, unconscious response to it. Over the past year I have became so accustomed to fighting through every day that the need to gird my loins against anticipated stress and demand has become second nature. Without any conscious effort on my part at all my preparation for a normal day includes fretting and anxiety about... everything. If I go on like this, I am setting myself up to be unhappy and to fail this year.Life has not changed with the end of vacation. Yes, we all have to get up for school and work again (no more Dragon Age on weeknights till 2:00 am), but I like and look forward to the things I do in a day as much now as I did during the break. There is no reason for dread. Dread is a knee-jerk reaction learned from the overscheduling and overcommitments of last year. That was then, this is now, and I AM going to slow down this year. I bit off way too much last year and some things need to be scaled back (ya think?).Clearly my body is trying to tell me something, and I'm going to listen to it as I plan my goals for 2010. Really."},

I have five orders/projects left for this year that I will finish this week and count as done in '09. Then I start 2010 with a clean slate.What shall I write on this pristine slate? Goals, plans to achieve those goals, a means to avoid seat-of-my-pants business management. In fact, let's not just write them on the slate, let's write them here in the blog. To ease myself back into blogging (organizing myself), I think I'll take the next few days to do the year-in-review and the year to come. It will be interesting to see if I can plan my studio growth and goals out here, and review and evaluate my success (let's avoid failure if we can--it's just another \"f\" word) as the year goes along.(NOTE: Since I wrote this Tuesday and it's now Wednesday I'm going to go ahead and post it for Tuesday and get on with the meat now on Wednesday!)"},

I have been discombobulated and running the Red Queen's Race (even more so than usual) for the past month. \"How could this be?\" you might ask. Well, it's complicated. I mean, it's not like I've been swamped with orders. No, it's more a juggling of a little bit of many, many jobs. Right now I wear a lot of hats.We had a *great* Siyeh Sleigh Ride the Sequel over the weekend--people really came to shop. Last time people came to nosh and schmooze, this time they came with wallets at the ready and many angels got their wings as we cha-chinged the cash register (at least metaphorically) all weekend. Tomorrow morning (because I am just too tired tonight) I have to reconcile all the sales for everyone, make up the spreadsheet detailing everything from our sales to our credit card fees (paid to Dee as we used her wireless swiper for instant transactions) and sales taxes. Then I have to write up checks for each of our shares. It's a tight time of year and we are all waiting for our little shot in the arm from this show.Today I had two open studio people in--one a seven year-old doing his second small plate (for a gift) and the other another Waldorf parent making a clock for his father for his 80th birthday. Both will come back tomorrow or later this week to make another project. For my part I hope to make it to the hotshop for another lesson or two this week, and I have Christmas fusing to do (and another last-gasp holiday order to get out).Now it's after 10:00 pm, Bruce just finished belting out \"Further On (Up the Road)\", and I need to get to bed to collapse into my eyelids. Goodnight, and God bless us every one. Pics tomorrow from the weekend... Maybe."},

Lee had also put up clear plastic panels on two side walls of the hotshop so it was a bit warmer inside than outside.

Todd made wreaths as his new work for this year, and they are STUNNING! Dee is right, I promised pics, and as the camera is still on walk-about (since mid October now) I had to take them with my iPhone. The quality of the photos is lacking, not the quality of the work.As you can see from the roll-up pic, the Pop Art work is enjoying a come-back. We did two more in the hotshop last evening and they went even better than this one. The only thing that didn't go as I had hoped was that the shape of the last one was not an urn (big at the top and small at the bottom). There is a special tool blowers use to get that shape and it allows them to blow the piece after it has been moved off the blow pipe onto the punty and is called a soffietta or puffer. We don't have one, we need one, it's not free. *sigh*Okay Lee is here to polish a few last paperweights and to label everything. Got to go!"},

This effort may be doomed to failure--Johnathon and Tadashi both spent a LOT of time torching the seams on the roll-ups.

So far I have finished three scarves and am warp speeding through a fourth (oh so pun intended). I have also been taking private glassblowing lessons from Lee in the hotshop a few hours in the afternoons, and, though I may never make anything professionally, I am having a GREAT time working up gifts for my Christmas list.Orders have been sparse for the past few weeks. I took one at the end of the week last week for one platter to be dropshipped to a customer, and I took another today for several pieces to ship to a gallery in Scottsdale asap. I had to scrounge for stands for that last order as Black Cat is slammed with orders through the end of the year. Add those two orders to the custom sconces I am working on and a few remakes from the summer's big awards order and you have my current paid kilnforming. I am, of course, making pieces for the Taylor Kinzel glass trunk show this weekend and Siyeh Sleigh Ride the Sequel next weekend, but work I do for both of them is on spec and I am having difficulty working up ambition for spec work right now. End-of-the-year brain drain.For the first year in memory I actually have time in December for fusing Christmas gifts.

For the first year in about 10 Dave is not deep-frying the turkey. Instead, our friend Colin is smoking one (but how do you keep it lit?) (I couldn't resist) at his house and bringing it over. Colin and Chris have lots to cook, we have lots to cook, and our house here (unlike the one we had in Austin) does not have two ovens and an extra-large cooktop so we are cooking in our respective houses for the first part of the day. Dave is almost obscenely excited at the prospect of almost cooking in the kiln. I can't imagine what he'd be like if I'd actually let him cook with it. (Before we moved here he had a steak at a restaurant in Alpharetta that cooked their steaks in a kiln and he said it was one of the best steaks he'd ever had.)A large Dancing Goats coffee with a shot of chocolate and some half 'n half in a Batdorf Bronson mug, laconic jazz on the sound system.

Sure, I can list a million things that got done, but I hardly remember doing *any* of them. Now I wake up and I have a hotshop, seven mega-minor torches and the accompanying great big whanging tanks (plural) of oxygen and propane, a glass resource center, a new permanent official part-time employee, and three new business associates/partners in my ventures. Wow!The orders--but for one that came in yesterday--are done for the year (or at least the time being), now it's time to play and plan. This afternoon--and every working afternoon for the next few weeks--I will be taking a couple of hours to blow glass. I have had three lessons from Lee, and I am up to small blown vessels. I am going to practice this form for the next few weeks till I, if not master it, at least become relatively proficient at it.Planning is for the new booth at the BMAC in February. Bill and I had planned to plan some months ago and it just never happened. First I was busy, now he is. We also didn't go to Philly to get our booth and work that's up there now to bring it home. Should've done it in September when we had the chance (though I don't remember much of September either...).Siyeh Sleigh Ride the Sequel in 2-1/2 weeks, the Taylor Kinzel annual glass show the week before that.

Dave gets home from Austin tonight (whoo hoo!), J has a sleepover at a friend's, (whoo hoo!), and the house is CLEAN.But this blog is supposed to be about GLASS so let's get back to there. The new postcard is on the presses as I type and should be shipped out this afternoon. A hint for all you artists who do postcards through one of the online places: Begin the order process, get as far as the \"upload your images\" step, and then put the project on hold and wait. Very likely your phone will ring within an hour and it'll be someone from the printing company who wants to know if you need any help. When you tell them that you're under the gun and need your postcards quickly, and in order to get them quickly the shipping will cost more than the printing so you're trying to decide whether to do them at all, they'll likely offer you all kinds of perks like one day turn-around at no charge and personally moving your proofs through the process as quickly as possible so you can use ground shipping instead of UPS' outrageously expensive one or two day service. Just my (frequent) experience. If you're one of those people who plans their printing weeks or months in advance, ignore it as we have NOTHING in common!Today in the studio sees the completion of all those pesky little tasks (like pay the IRS last year's taxes... oops) that have been accumulating since, well, since June when life accelerated to warp speedier than usual. My inbox will be--if not empty--seriously depleted, papers will be appropriately sorted and filed, and I will begin the end of the year fresh. I can't believe December comes in a week and a half. Not only are the days in December some of the shortest of the year, it's also the shortest month because of all that we try to cram into it. Well not me folks! Not this year! Sure, my parents are coming from Montana to visit over Christmas with their bird and their dog, and my sis-in-law is coming the weekend before to make a gingerbread house with the J, and we have Siyeh Sleigh Ride, the Sequel the weekend before that, and Taylor Kinzel's annual Glass Trunk show the weekend before that, and Thanksgiving the weekend before that, and that's NEXT weekend... Heck, I guess I better enjoy the quiet of this weekend, hadn't I?Seriously, it feels good not to have ANY work scheduled for the rest of the year. My orders are done, and I get to play and make gifts and fun things for the rest of the year (blown glass tumblers anyone?). Maybe the most exciting thing on the end-of-the-year horizon is that MY BOOKS WILL BE DONE AND UP TO DATE thanks to V the bookkeeper extraordinaire. For once I won't have to spend the weeks after Christmas sorting through little bitty slips of paper and trying to remember what all I spent money on (and what money all came in) during the past year. Whoo hoo!The last pic in this post is from Lori and is me being crowned Queen of the Sleigh Ride at the first Siyeh Sleigh Ride. Around my neck is one of Todd's new, gorgeous wreaths (the blue \"ice\" wreath), and he is crowning me with a, um, wire tree... More fun and frivolity sure to occur at the next Sleigh Ride too so I expect to see More Of You There!"},

Nor was I planning on being in the studio till almost 9:00 pm again (especially and not get everything done). Add them to a list of things I wasn't going to do/that weren't going to happen today, and you'll have my day.I woke with a spring in my step and (finally) the ambition to clean the kitchen (a bomb went off in it Sunday and left the dregs of Thai take-out for six and wine bottles strewn everywhere), slay the laundry monster (the hulking skulking pile of clean in the laundry room from the weekend), and get caught up on major bills and finances. Oh yes, I was also going to go to Commerce to meet Elaine to get metal pieces for orders that need to ship, and I was going to put in a couple of simple kiln loads (a firepolish and a slump). Easy peasy, I thought to myself.I breezed through getting the Sprout up, dressed, fed, kitted out with lunch and snacks for her brownie troop, and safely deposited at school. I sailed through the Commerce run--and picked up a big order from Black Cat with an asap ship date. I figured I'd be able to squeeze it in today and ship Thursday (it's a two-fire order). Hah. The gods despise hubris and trounce all over it at every opportunity.The afternoon--back from Commerce--started well. I got a call from Stephanie at the Oakhurst Community Garden that my holiday dish class for tonight only had one person signed up so it was going to be cancelled. I say \"started well\" not because I wasn't looking forward to teaching the class but because I was looking forward to an evening relaxing with the J at home, rewarding her for being so patient last night, and relaxing a bit. Then things started to speed up.Brian arrived and I really needed to talk glass bead classroom set-up, tools and class details with him (and to help him incorporate his business online). Then Lee showed up (expectedly) and I needed to talk hotshop tools and equipment, classes, etc. with him. I also had to settle up with both of them from the past two shows and their equipment expenses to date. Then the phone rang and it was a woman who had just called the garden about tonight's class and had two--maybe four--kids who wanted to take it. So I called the other person who had been signed up and told her the class was on if she was interested. Then I realized it was 3:30 and I still had pieces to get out of the kiln, a couple of orders to ship, and my easy kiln loads and the new order from Black Cat to get in before 5:00, the J to pick up at 5:00 AND a class at 6:00 to set-up and prepare for!Some things had to be put off. I'll talk to Lee tomorrow. I'll ship tomorrow. I'll talk to Brian Thursday. Black Cat's order will go in tomorrow. The class turned out to have seven people in it (two adults, five children), it was great and everyone left enthused to come back and do more open studio projects before Christmas--and maybe to take some classes too. The priorly-scheduled kiln loads got in, the J was acquired from school... and we made it home late again. At least tonight I fed her before heading to the studio.Tomorrow Dee comes down to settle up from the shows and get her stuff back (she did a show with Brian yesterday--he took her work). We'll also start the planning for Siyeh Sleigh Ride the Sequel on December 12th and 13th. Bill was right: If there were no pictures, it didn't really happen. Since it didn't happen, it needs to! And before anyone roundly chastises me for overdoing it again, know that this was not my idea; it was Mike's. As it was Mike's, it can be counted upon to be a good, sound, sane idea--not me taking on too much (again).I sip my Syrah, and life is good."},

Then I whisked her off to the pet store to get dog food, to the Wendy's drive-through for dinner (she was so patient while I worked that I gave her the choice of dinner and she picked Wendy's hoping to get a new audiobook), and finally a stop at Kroger to get the snack for her brownie troop tomorrow (turns out it is my turn and I just found out today).

This week life is settling back to normal and it's busy, busy, busier for the studio. This weekend is the Siyeh Sleigh Ride and Dee is coming down to plan and to help me (finally) get the invitations designed and out. Late much?The Waldorf Holiday Festival was this past Saturday and, as always, it was a lot of fun. This year the Siyeh Studio booth had work by Lee (blown glass paperweights and glass flowers), Brian (torchworked heart and goddess pendants and icicles), Dee (fused glass jewelry), and Todd (plant stakes, ornaments, people and jewelry--much of it with my glass incorporated). I had a last minute 8 year-old, after-school birthday party/sleepover Friday to whip up for the J--both before and after the 2-hour long adult preview for the holiday festival--and then a memorial service to attend the first half of Saturday so I didn't have any of my own work at the festival.Yesterday I was was originally scheduled to have a Make a Holiday Dish class at the studio through Oakhurst Community Gardens but when the week went to hell in a handbasket and there was only one person signed up for it, I asked the director of the gardens if she would mind rescheduling. I'm not sure what happened, but it was a very lucky set of circumstances for Skippy when he and his mother showed up at the studio yesterday at 1:00 for the class (it's amazing they got there at all--Memorial Drive was closed Friday night through this morning just on the block in front of the studio for street repair) and I happened to be there. They had gone through so much trouble that I didn't have the heart to tell them the class had been rescheduled so I did an impromptu holiday dish class for Skippy and then he and his mother got to watch a little glass blowing in the hotshop. It was a good save--and renewed me more than I would have thought possible.Now I need to get back to updating both websites, seeing if I can fill the last couple of spots in the 5-week glass bead making class that starts Wednesday night, and running a glass resource center.

Building a retail business is a series of waves. First you get it open, then you promote it to get people in to it. When the people come, you make sure you have everything in place for them to have a positive experience that makes them want to come back. Then you need more people so you expand your promotion mechanisms. A resource center offering supplies and classes is a vastly different beast than a production studio. If what you're selling is your work, there are retail and wholesale shows, ready-made on-line venues (like WholesaleCrafts.com and Etsy), and there are trade magazines in which to advertise for the wholesale market. If what you're selling is classes and supplies, how do you build that business? Retail of this sort is completely new to me.The resource center is open, we've had our grand opening weekend that Bullseye kindly promoted through their vast mailing list, and we've begun a modest mailing list of our own. Now what? We have a great class line-up, how do we get the word out more? It's a whole new set of things to think about and I have got to get comfortable with the idea that I don't need to do them all *today*. It will be enough for this week to get the class descriptions up on our website in their own page, to have postcards made of our class offerings and drop them around coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. in the little neighborhoods surrounding East Lake, and to get a form created for people to sign up for them on the web.This is why I blog. I sat down this morning in a vast funk of what to do, what to do, and worked through the broad brushstrokes of it here before. Now I'm ready to get dressed and on with the day!"},

I finally have to face 2-3 months worth of papers piled hither and yon, there are several orders that came in over the weekend that have to scheduled, some redos on the awards project from the summer to finish up, and I have both the Waldorf Holiday Fair and a holiday dish class through Oakhurst Community Garden this weekend. Oh yes, and it's our annual Ichiyo ikebana retreat this week Tuesday through Thursday and J's birthday is Wednesday. Dee is coming down this morning to plan for the artist holiday open house next weekend at the studio (Mike has dubbed it the Siyeh Sleigh Ride).Every year right about this time I start letting things drop off the plate. Last year it was the holiday artist open house. Let's see if this year I can keep morale and energy and power on through. Even though it is my favorite time of the year (right after daylight savings time has ended), it won't be easy."},

Time to bust out of the apathetic, lackadaisical state I've been in and Get It Moving! Today I'm gearing up to... take tomorrow off. Not the way I took yesterday off which was unplanned and unexpected (brain and body got together and both decided to shut down forcing the Me that was left to follow), but a planned day of doing things Other Than Work. Sure, there might be some of the reading and sleeping that there was yesterday, but there'll also be a PEDICURE (I think--thanks to the broken ankle--the first one this year).If I could squeeze in a massage and a facial (I have gift certificates languishing for both) I would, but the spouse is getting home at noon! I'm going to pick him up at the airport, take him to lunch, and maybe go for a drive with the top down on the Mini Cooper (wink, wink).But before I stray to far into the future, let's revisit the pre-comatose past. Tuesday I had the Waldorf School of Atlanta 7th grade class in for a morning field trip. True to field-trip-in-the-studio-weather form, it was pouring rain as they trooped from studio to hot shop and back again.However the rain couldn't dampen spirits and everyone made a small fall leaf window panel, got to see and maybe take part in a glass blowing demo or two (Lee made several projects with them), and saw a bead making demo and maybe got to make a bead with Brian. Oh yes, and they also learned about the history of glass blowing, kilnforming glass and glass bead making. Yesterday after school I dropped their projects off and I was a bit late as they were still a bit warm at 2:30 so I didn't get to see their reactions to them. I hope many of them will be back for open studio time this fall--I love when they bring their parents back all excited about what they know and make pieces with them.Having the 7th grade in during fall quarter is always a good kick-off for pre-holiday open studio--and I need to get that schedule set-up on the web asap. Also need to get a web guest book and a sign-up for email updates/newsletter created. Hope Mike has time for me this week. Thanks to Dee for both the pics of the field trip and for incredible help during it (she managed one of the two leaf panel project tables and did lots of set-up). After the field trip we cleaned up, I trained Judy (the new assistant) on shipping and close-up procedures, and got three shipments out before picking up the Sprout from Brownies. Thus ended the pre-comatose part of the past. Then came the next part...I almost posted yesterday. The Post would have been titled, \"Discombobulated, Or, If It's Not On the Calendar, Don't Do It!\". I knew I had a dentist appointment yesterday morning but I couldn't remember whether it was at 10:00 or 10:30 and I couldn't find it on the calendar so I decided to just go as if it were for 10:00 and maybe get to read in the waiting room for a half hour (no problem there!). On the way I turned down the wrong street and had to go around the block. In the building I got off the elevator on the wrong floor and had to get back in and go down a couple more. Once in the office I signed in, and settled in for an illicit read (stolen time and all). The receptionist called me up about five minute later and asked me why I was there. I told her for a cleaning and an exam and she told me my appointment was on 11/10 at 10:30. She then kindly validated my parking and I toddled off home.Once home I started working on the backlog of paperwork I have, and sometime around 1:00, I fell asleep. When I woke up at 2:15 I had to scurry to get the field trip projects unloaded, cleaned and off to them. When I got to school I found out I had three little girls (one of them my own) for a playdate, and at that point I just decided to let the rest of the afternoon--the sunny, gorgeous, perfect fall afternoon--take care of itself.Today I am enthused and renewed again--just in time for V to come and work on my books. If there's anything that can harsh my mellow, that'll be it. *sigh*__________________________________Right as I finished writing, before I could add the photos, V came and hijacked my laptop for Quickbooks. So I got my kiln loads in for the day, cleaned up a little, trained Judy a little, and had my first formal glass blowing lesson in the hotshop! (How many people do you know who have a hotshop and don't know how to blow glass?) I made a flower and a paperweight, and learned the first techniques for feeling the glass from a glassblower's perspective. Then I finished the post. Pics are from the open house (the pretty, staged ones) and the field trip (kids with heads in hands, hands in pockets, etc.)."},

It was a GREAT opening weekend for Siyeh Glass Resource Center, but I think I finally tried to get too much done at once. Tomorrow at 8:30 am is the Waldorf 7th Grade field trip in the studio so we have another intense four hours ahead of us. Becky is off to a full-time job and her beadmaking classroom duties have been taken over for the time being by Brian Renoud--another good friend and great torchworker (he usually works in borosilicate but is doing all Bullseye work for me). I also have a new assistant, Judy, who started today and looks like she'll whip me into organizational shape in no time. Lee has the hotshop off to an incredible start--we had our first private lessons in it yesterday after the open house was over (two customers from Saturday).For the fieldtrip in the morning, Brian is demoing glass bead making, Lee is demoing glassblowing, and Dee is helping me do a two-part fall leaf fused project. She came this afternoon to help me prep. I had asked her for a couple of hours and she was still there helping till 7:00--with a dead early start panned for the morning. Dee, you have been the greatest over the past week, thank you.Now if I can just make it till Friday...More pics in the next couple of days (hope I can find my camera)."},

Day One of the Siyeh Glass Resource Center Grand Opening is over, now is l'aube of Day Two (literally--and I don't mean the cassock). Day One went perfectly save for one hitch, and even that one was minor enough we didn't break a sweat over it.The studio day started for me when the phone rang at 7:10 as I was in the shower (of course I got out, hair dripping wet, and answered it). It was Lee and he had the news that something happened with the program in the glass furnace and it had shut off and was back down to 745 degrees. I finished up, dried off and hustled over only to not be able to figure out why the temp wouldn't go higher in the ramp/hold program. FInally I broke down, switched the controller over from automatic to manual (sometimes a real person just needs to take the controls), and fired that puppy up. If I have time today (I hope not), I'll putter with it. But, really, the best thing to do is just leave it going on manual and futz with it next week.I didn't get to stay at the studio then, I had to rush back home, make Jessie's lunch and breakfast, and get her off to school. THEN the studio day really began, and it began with a vengeance. With the best will in the world, I had not been able to get all the pricing sheets and other papers done the night before. I collapsed at 11:00 so tired I was almost hallucinating. Come to think of it, that's how I was last night too! I sense an unfortunate pattern that must end. We also didn't have the last of the straightening, any of the sweeping, or a host of other things done so Becky, Lori, and Todd set to with a vengeance. Then Christie came and took Todd grocery shopping for all the munchables and he made a BEAUTIFUL spread.And we swept, and cleaned, and carted boxes of stuff to the shed and the shipping room, and printed out price lists and cleaned off the desk and the counter, and by the time the first visitors arrived, we were ready! And the traffic was slow and steady all day. I had enough time to interact with everyone, give tours, talk about glass, write up sales and graze the lovely buffet. It rained, but who cares?Today should be a gorgeous, cool, fall day. Dee is coming to help (in fact she's calling right now from Starbuck's where she is acquiring the box of coffee) and Todd is still here. Brian Renoud will be doing beadmaking demos today, life is good.Now I had better get dressed and get over there to prepare for another big day!"},

Tomorrow at 10:00 I will have a physical space all set-up, sparkling clean and welcoming. Yea. Let's revel in that accomplishment for a minute. Four days from production studio to Glass Resource Center including basic classroom setup (six of the seven mega-minor torches are hooked up, still waiting on the teacher torch--#7) and an entire retail area *built* and stocked with almost 5,000 lbs of new glass, frit, rods, confetti and supplies. Yes. I feel good about that. (All the glass will be cut this morning).Of course being me, I am still fretting about all the infrastructure bits that I have not had time to get to like the open studio schedule and pricing for kilnforming, torch work and blowing, creating the order write-up slips, finishing the retail pricelist, making all the pricing boards for the glass (everything is stickered with a price code instead of a price so the customers can know the cost of each thing up front and we can still change the prices as we need to (sales, etc.), etc., etc., etc.Then there's all the food to decide, purchase and arrange. I think I'll put Todd in charge of catering. V the bookkeeper is bringing some of her deviled eggs (the best you've ever had, literally--she makes some with salmon, some with caviar, some with creme fraiche... *sigh* yum.)Mike Z is on the gift certificate and last web site details but I need to come up with what we're going to give away, the demo schedule, and when we're going to give things away. And mustn't forget the mailing list! Got to collect names for classes and events. I know there are a bezillion good ideas that people have dropped like pearls in my ears over the past week and (to mangle as many metaphors as I can) it was in one ear and out the other. Time to start carrying the little moleskin notebook again to capture them. Now off to the studio to crank the tunes and start cutting glass."},

Diane from Southern Flames came at 10:00 and helped Becky set-up the torches and equipment in the beadmaking classroom. Lori, Dee and Diane left right before Lee the glassblower came (about 2:00). Dan left, Lee left, Ray the HVAC guy, Brian the electrician, and Brian the torchworking friend who is going to demo for me on Saturday all arrived about 5:00, and all but Brian the electrician left the same time as Becky (about 6:30). Brian the electrician is still there putting up the new lights in the beadmaking classroom, moving the phone and data jacks and making sure I have enough power in the retail room outlet to run all the behind-the-desk stuff (can't be blowing a fuse every time I want to make a cappuccino!).Took Dave to the airport at 6:30 this morning--he's going to miss all the opening weekend ups and downs, triumphs and tragedies, and last minute panic attacks. But Todd will be here--he's coming to stay with me and take care of Jessie through Monday. Whew. Speaking of panic/anxiety attacks; last night was the first night in memory I woke up three separate times with panic attacks. I'll be glad when the weekend is behind me.

No ikebana today, no leg wax tomorrow. Oh the sacrifices I have to make!PS--There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode from season six called \"Once More With Feeling\". It's the musical episode and one of Jessie's favorites. It's also the episode where a guy dances so fast he spontaneously combusts (which Jessie REALLY likes). Today I might be that guy. Becky kept saying last week that there were boxes of 5-lb jars of frit in the big order we just got from Bullseye and I kept saying no there weren't--I didn't order any 5-lb jars of frit. Hah. I was dancing so fast that I managed to order 5-lb jars of every single frit color in coarse instead of 1-lb jars. No wonder my order cost so much.

We haven't turned on the heat yet and I'd be surprised if it's even 60 degrees in here (yep, it's only 57). Can't wait to get to the studio where it will be even colder as it is much more poorly insulated. At least the sky is blue and the sun is beginning to peek out for a change--it was rainy, soggy, and muddy all week during our move of STUFF from studio to shed in anticipation of the great glass migration of 2009.Today I teach a class at Oakhurst Community Gardens on making fall window panels. We'll paint leaves with glass powders and fuse them between two layers of clear glass. I think I'll also take some frit for additional color if anyone wants more pop. I was inspired for this project by the leaves, crayon shavings and wax paper window projects my Mom and I did with Jessie last year (the year before?) and that I also did as a kid. You know, you arrange leaves on a sheet of wax paper, grate crayon shavings of different colors over them, place another piece of wax paper on top and iron it all flat (putting a towel between the iron and the wax paper, of course). Then you put them on your windows for temporary little fall stained glass windows with leaves. If the weather stays nice and it warms up, it'll be a fantastic class.Yesterday Dave-as-Igor accompanied me to Target, Sam's Club and IKEA and I got shelving, lighting, chairs, under desk storage, and a host of other almost-last-minute items for the studio cum resource center. Becky gave up her Saturday afternoon to help me assemble the shelving and move more things from studio to shed and vice versa in the cold, damp drizzle. I hope she enjoys a warm and sunny day off today, she deserves it!This morning I finally make my countdown lists of everything that remains to be done in each area of the studio to get ready for Friday. Tasks are diverse and include things like shoveling 3-4\" of silt sludge into 10-gallon buckets and carrying it out of the crawl space/basement before digging out the sump pump well and filling the whole basement up with 14 tons of gravel. Once that's all done, Ray the HVAC guy can get in an pull the old furnace and replace it--in case it's cold and rainy next weekend I need to make sure we'll have heat from a source other than the kilns. Moving indoors, there's finishing (i.e., putting more coats of finish on) the glass storage furniture and my desk/countertop, and arranging all the scrap glass and tools on the new worktable shelving in the workroom. I won't even try to list everything here (that's what the list is for, after all) because it would take far too many lines and I'd just have to do it over again in Excel.Oh yes, I am using Excel for the list because a single column list won't work--I need a column for each area with tasks under it and writing it this way I *might* be able to get it all on, oh, 3-4 pages.Done posting, off to list!"},

Do I have even a *list* of what needs to be done? No. I have a glass of some white wine--I didn't even read the label on the bottle before I poured it, but I think it's a chardonnay--and a scribbled list of things people have been telling me all day I still need to do.I have a gravel delivery tomorrow morning (that would be *Saturday morning*) at 8:00--14 tons, a full dumptruck load--to shovel (have shoveled) into the crawlspace/basement after we get the sump pump squared around. Dan finished my worktable and the beadmaking classroom table today and he also brought another worker, Kenneth, with him who put the first coats of polyurethane on the salesroom furniture.Mike (my webmaster) called midday today to tell me about some anomalies on the studio calendar--seems that somehow when I set the time-zone on the calendar page it also changed the times on the open house from 10-6 to 6am-2pm... whoopsie daisies!I feel like I've been running in place like a headless chicken (and with as much effect) all day. There was no organization, no master plan, not even any progress that I could tell. I chatted with Craig at Arrow Springs for almost an hour this afternoon about ventilation systems and ended up completely redesigning the ventilation system for the beadmaking classroom--and losing a day of construction on it in the process. I have got to get a grip (and a plan) soon. Sunday is my first day teaching and I still have the prototype pieces to make and all the materials to assemble. At least I'm not trying to teach in my studio!But for all the the crazy weirdness of the day the highlight happened when I wasn't even there. I ran out to make a bank deposit and get everyone Subway sandwiches for lunch, and when I came back there were two people in the hotshop with Dan and Lee that I did not know. Their names were John and Colleen, and they had received Bullseye's email about the open house and came down for it... today. They came from Greenville SC and didn't discover the mix-up on the dates till they were already to Atlanta and then they thought they'd go ahead and come by to see if I happened to be open already.Wow were they surprised by the mess that is my studio. But we had a lovely visit, I gave them a little tour of the chaos, and when they saw how truly overwhelmed I was, they offered--several times--to stay and help. I thanked them for the offer, but with all the crap I have all over the floors from the moving around, there was barely room for all of us who were already there working without adding two more bodies (Becky arrived not long after they did). So they'll come back next weekend for the real grand opening (and I expect lots of oohs and ahhs when they see the studio in its finished state!).In the meantime, there are shipments to unpack, stuff to pack up and move out to one of the (nearly overflowing) sheds, a grip to get. You know, real life! Oh yeah, and lots, and lots of lists to make and last minute stuff to buy. That'll be fun--let's smoke the Visa card some more."},

This is not a replacement site for the Siyeh Studio site, it's an additional site for the new Glass Resource Center and will contain all the info about our classes, supplies, my book, etc., etc. Let me know what you think.Yesterday saw much accomplished in the studio and the arrival of five pallets of glass and misc from Bullseye--in the drizzling rain. I hope it dries out SOON. Today is overcast, but it's not actively raining at this time. Good thing, too, as I have got to get the crawlspace/basement pumped out so I can redo the sump pump set-up, fill the whole floor in with 5-6 inches of gravel, and get the furnace and the hot water heater replaced. Ungh.Dan the carpenter is in the studio today to set-up the beadmaking table, build a new worktable--even if it's just a 4X89 sheet of plywood on a couple of sawhorses as I have order due and can't be without a table. The old work table is being reborn as the beadmaking table--it's perfect for it. Now that the units to hold the cut sheets of glass from Bullseye are in, it's time to get everything sealed. I'll be finishing off the day with the Minwax polyurethane.Dee lent a hand all day yesterday and we got the sandblast cabinet stripped down and ready to move (we took out the long bar that's for supporting doors and large pieces of glass as they pass through the cabinet--I neither have room for it, nor have I used it in the past five years). We also moved one shelving unit and all the stuff on it, and more than half sorted another one (so THAT'S where those extra dinner plates and salad bowls from the house ended up. Dave will be so thrilled to get them back!). I am debating the wisdom of a quick run to Home Depot for another shelving unit and a day laborer to move the rest. there *is* a lot of frit that needs to go out there, and I half put my back out yesterday...

Shelving units--and everything on them--get moved from the first shed to the second, shelving in the studio filled with five lb jars of frit (a little over half a ton of frit... no kidding) gets moved to the first shed, and everything that has been haphazardly stored under the work table for the past 2+ years gets moved to wherever it will fit. Oy. The big wetbelt sander finally gets placed, and then it's off to buy more lighting for it and the lap grinder and more shelving for, well, more stuff!The big  engineering task of the day is the design of the ventilation system for the glass beadmaking classroom. I found a great site by Mike Aurelius and it is just chock full of math and physics. Now I just need some slow and quiet time (and a Grainger catalog) to decipher it. This paragraph from the example that seems closest in size to mine also brings up concerns:\"This particular example also presents us with a problem. When the system is running at full capacity, it will be exhausting 3000 plus cubic feet per minute of air. This is a huge amount of air, and it will have a very definite effect on the temperature of the air inside the studio, especially during the winter and summer months. Because, not only are we exhausting 3000 cubic feet per minute of air, but we are also bring in 3000 cubic feet per minute of fresh outside air. Let’s say the room is 20 feet by 20 feet with 10 foot high ceilings. This is a total space of 4000 cubic feet. We will be completely changing the air in the room every 1.33 minutes. If the temperature outside is -10 degrees, you can imagine that the room temperature is going to fall very quickly.\"Oh boy, like I don't have enough problems already keeping the temperature bearable in the studio! At least it doesn't get to -10 degrees here in Hotlanta--but keeping it cool in the summer will be something else.Okay, no more time to dawdle. The day has begun!"},
{"title": "Franchises and Transitioning", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2009", "text": "Another Bad Ass Coffee morning, this one in the comfy blue chair at Lori's beach house with a mocha in a go-cup. Bad Ass Coffee is just down at the end of the block, and it was a nice walk for Dave to go get it for me (and a chance for him to get on-line too). Our long weekend out of time is coming to an end, we drive home today. I am already making the mental shift back to the real world--as is Dave (as evidenced by the fact that we were both ensconced with our laptops at 7:30 this morning).Speaking of Dave, we had an interesting conversation on the beach yesterday (yes, I will just have to keep writing the \"B\" word to keep it fresh and alive in my mind) about having a small business in America today and how many more hats you have to wear and balls you have to juggle--and how much faster you have to move--if you want to succeed. The easiest way to start a new business is to buy a franchise. With a franchise you are given a manual of exactly how to do every part of the business and you're handed a ready-made supply chain for most if not all of your products. All decisions from how to display and package your product to how much to charge for it are handed to you in a binder. That's not to say it's easy to start a new business if it's a franchise, it just means you have to make fewer decisions yourself and you are likely to have a greater chance of success because you are following a tried and true methodology instead of making it all up as you go along.What I am creating now in my studio is a hybrid between a franchise and a from-scratch business. On the one hand I have received a lot of help from Bullseye in the form of information and assistance on how to set-up and price classes, what to include in a stocking products order, essential technological components for a successful Glass Resource Center, suggestions on pricing product, and more. On the other, I'm building my own facility with my own vision of what it should offer and how it should run (and it's own unique decor). I hope (as I'm sure Bullseye does too) that by following a bit of the franchise model I'll also capitalize on it's success rate. Fingers are crossed.There are an amazing number of details to wade through in the next *eight* days before we open our doors to the world, and my head begins to whirl with them again. I say whirl again because it was unexpectedly easy to slip into vacation mode last Thursday and let all thoughts of lists and orders and have to's and shoulds and who is working on's fly completely away. I have been so immersed in getting this new adventure going that I have literally been eating, sleeping, drinking and dreaming it. There have been very few moments when I wasn't cataloguing and planning. And yet, on the drive down to Florida for an unexpected very long weekend, the thoughts started to go away. By Friday, the only time I thought of what was going on in the studio was when someone called me or wrote me an email asking me a particular question about it. As soon I answered or solved the issue, I forgot all about it again and went back to my trash vampire novels on the beach.I almost (I said \"almost\") feel guilty at how much I didn't do over the past four (five) days. I didn't plan, I didn't didn't scheme, I didn't dream. I just read, and slept, and drank pina coladas in a beach chair under an umbrella watching the surf and my child play. How odd! I was sure I'd never relax, but I guess my brain and body had other ideas. Today, though I am still in my jammies cozily typing from the beach house, I am already transitioning back. My head is not full, but the ideas and lists and thoughts are seeping back in and jostling for prominence in anticipation of tomorrow's all-out effort, D-Day, marines on the beach.Tomorrow is also Dave's and my 14th wedding anniversary, and this past weekend (honestly, it felt like we were in Jurassic Park we were so far removed from our real world) was the best present we could have given each other.

Dan the carpenter has built and installed the counter/desk/1lb frit storage AND the rod storage cabinet in the new front retail room. Next week he tackles the beadmaking classroom worktable and vent hood and the new worktables in my production workroom--soon to be for both kilnforming classes and my production work too. We'll see how that goes. I have a feeling we're going to concentrate on beadmaking, glass blowing, and multi-technique (kilnforming/beadmaking/vitrigraph/blowing in one project) classes to start with and save the straight kiln-forming classes for later.And that's enough for now. More on the new Siyeh Glass website, the rest of the build-out, and The Grand Opening next week! I'll be off-line Monday and Tuesday, back full-speed on Wednesday."},
{"title": "A Very Early  Bonus Post", "date": "Monday, October 05, 2009", "text": "Gran Marnier in a little handblown glass, the sound of Ernie snoring on the back of the couch for music. It's early to post, and the main thing I wanted to post about I would normally put on Stranded in the South, but Ernie seems to have hijacked that blog. Drat him. I'm going to have to put a lock on my laptop! I can't even get a shower without him sneaking onto it. And he thinks I don't notice. Hah. I am a mother. Need I say more? Though he did pull one on me tonight when he slipped outside on the heels of the dogs. Nearly gave me heart failure when I discovered he was gone. Even wearing the collar with all my info on it and being micro-chipped, I really didn't want him to spend a wet night outdoors.Anyway, at one minute to midnight tonight as I was winding down from a looong day in the studio, I had an epiphany. The kind of books that I like to read depend entirely upon the circumstances of the reading! Okay, it's an obscure statement and a weird epiphany for midnight, but I was in the studio till 11:00 pm getting four full kiln loads in after a completely packed day, and my brain was/is zinging.In the past year I have changed my reading habits. The change was facilitated by the Kindle, but it also came about because I have less and less time to read so I squeeze it in whenever--and wherever--I can. The wherever can be tricky. Often I have five minutes to read, but I don't have time to hunt up my current book and take it into the downstairs powder room. The solution? Keep a dedicated book in the powder room. Then there's the book for the master bathroom. Then there's the chapter book I read to Jessie every night. What's so different about this style of reading? I have *always* read only one book at a time. For better or worse, I have slogged through duds and rushed through favs One Book At A Time.Until not too long ago I didn't even know there were people who read more than one book at a time. Then Ren wrote about all the books she was in the middle of. Then Bill of Black Cat mentioned reading multiple books at a time (I think it was Bill) and I was amazed. What a concept! So I started tried it out. Now, several months on, I had my epiphany. I have always tended towards books with lean description, fast action and faster dialog. These books are best read non-stop. They lose something if the pace of the reading is too different from the pace of the action. When I try to read one of these books in the five-minute powder room intervals, I don't enjoy it as much--and, more tellingly, I don't think it is as good of a book as I would have if I had read it all in an evening or two.Then there are the kinds of books that I have always had to be dragged to; literary books. Books where what's happening is far less important than the words the author uses to describe it. Such a book is my current powder room selection, The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery (translated from French). What's happening in the book isn't nearly as interesting as the life observations of the characters and their monologues/dialogs/diatribes. Five - ten minutes is just enough to refresh me, pick my brain up, and send me back to work. But I couldn't read a book like that (or The Secret Life of Bees, or The Red Tent, or The Poisonwood Bible, or on and on) in an intense evening. When I sit and read for hours, I skim. The words are less important than the vibrant, fast-moving images I see in my mind. I want to get There. The leaner the prose, the tighter the action, the better. Those other books are too complicated for that kind of reading. If you read them fast for the action and  you race all the way through, you end up scratching your head going, was that all?A last note on this subject and then I think I'm tired enough to sleep. Maybe the difference in readers and their taste in books is not a difference in sophistication and literariness, but a difference in the speed at which they live their lives--and read their books. Later this morning (like, after I've gone to bed and slept) pics of the new counter/frit storage for the retail space at Siyeh Glass Retail Center!The day begins with rain, coffee in the Alaska skyline mug, and the alternating sounds of Ernie snoring and Ernie washing. Right now he's eyeing my chocolate donut as if trying to decide if it's worth the effort to get up, saunter over and demand some. He has already been working his magic on the occupants and guests of the house, I can't wait to see what he does to the customers in the Glass Resource Center. Just with a look he'll get them to sign up for five classes and buy $1,200 in glass and supplies.Last night I finally gave Dave his birthday present--a checkerboard and checkers. Lest ye think it was some little project, let me assure you that this was a checker set worthy of my effort! The board is five sheets thick with squares (transparent and opaque) on the top and bottom and it has a clear edge strip all the way around. To make it perfectly flat on both sides I hand lapped it for a couple of hours and then sandblasted it. The checkers were cast from powder in my copper tubes and then sliced with the tile saw and ground on the lap grinder.The board is opaque white and true blue, and the checkers are clear powder (which, of course, comes out white because of the grain size) and a mix of 10% cobalt blue (transparent) and 90% clear. By casting them instead of fusing them from sheet, they have a silky mat feel that is augmented by the fine coating of oil J put on them (and the board). Dave loved the set and is looking forward to playing checkers with J on it. I'll post pics of it when I remember to bring the camera back from the studio.Now off to get the Bullseye order in (finally!), fax the revisions of the loan application in to Chase for the ARC loan, send the photos of the studio and me to Bullseye for the press release, send a high-res photo of the cover of the book to Delynn at Glass Craftsman mag (they are reviewing my book in the December/January issue), and write-up final class descriptions and prices with Lee for the glassblowing classes. Oh yes, and pump the water out of the basement/crawlspace AGAIN (the sump pump leaves about five inches), and fire two kiln loads, and redo the firing schedule (I slacked this weekend), and ship 5-6 orders when Becky gets in.It's Siyeh Studio. It's ALWAYS busy!"},
{"title": "The Studio Monstrocat", "date": "Friday, October 02, 2009", "text": "Another day, another Dancing Goats mocha, accompanied by \"Danger Zone\" by Kenny Loggins (on the Dancing Goats coffee house sound system!). Gotta love the slippery slide into fall/winter and caffeine. Maybe that's the way to go: every spring I detox from coffee and wine, and every fall I cuddle up with wine, snuggle in with coffee, and get all warm and cozy. But enough about me. I know the world is waiting to hear about Ernie.Ernie got in early last night--though I'm sure not soon enough for him. When we got to the Delta cargo counter his carrier was snugged up against the desk agent's leg--not in the back room with the rest of the cargo. Jessie, with my driver's license (proof we were legitimately there to claim him) clutched tightly in her hand, marched up to the counter, waved the license in the direction of the desk agent (the counter was taller than she was) and announced that she was there to Get Ernie. Did the agent ask for a confirmation number? Was there any question who Ernie was? Of course not! Ernie the Monstrocat in all his rotund glory had captured another heart.We were allowed around corner of the counter so Jessie could get to the carrier, but when I went to pick it up, the agent hurriedly said, \"Let me get help\". I was mystified--it was a a large carrier to be sure (Baxter would lounge in it comfortably), but it just had a cat in it. But I politely waited for a big, burly Delta cargo mover to come and pick it up to carry it to the car for me. He grunted when he picked it (gently) up. \"What you got in here, a dog?\" Uh, no. A cat. \"Wow!\"We paraded out the door, me, then the cargo guy guy with Ernie, Jessie dancing anxiously around all of us chanting \"Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.\" Parked next to us at the dock was a nice young man with a white cargo van waiting for a forklift so he could finish his load. He had been leaning against his van waiting when we arrived and hadn't even acknowledged Jessie and me as we went into the building, but as soon as we came out he was immediately and inevitably pulled over by Ernie Magnetism. \"What have got, a puppy?\" More amazement that no, that great grey shape did not belong to a canine, but a feline. The cargo guy tried to break off the cable ties securing the door shut for us and the van guy ran off to get a knife to cut them with. I just sat back and bemusedly watched. Jessie alternately chanted Ernie, Ernie, Ernie and cooed nonsense at him as she tried to thrust her fingers through the bars in the carrier. Ernie took all of the attention as his due and let us know *exactly* how trying the day had been and much he was Done with the carrier. Cynthia was right, he really is a talker.When we got home, Baxter and Seraph were waiting eagerly to greet him. Unfortunately they did it in time-honored dog fashion by sniffing first his nose and then proceeding right to the butt. Ernie was NOT amused and hissed loudly at both of them. Neither dog was disturbed by the hiss--Seraph was raised in a house with an alpha cat and is well-trained in cat subservience and Baxter is subservient to Seraph so if she says the cat rules, the cat rules. It will probably take Ernie a couple of days to realize his power over the dogs, but I have no doubt he'll get there.This morning he cuddled with Jessie and hung out with me a bit before taking himself away upstairs to avoid the noise and chaos of the cleaning people. This afternoon I'll introduce him to the studio and the studio backyard squirrels. More pics and video later, and thank you Cynthia for gracing us with such a marvelous fellow! (Dave just announced that the song we're hearing is \"C'mon Every Beatbox\" by Big Audio Dynamite, in case I was posting... he knows me so well :-)"},

Both the mug and the song are to celebrate the imminent arrival of Ernie the Monstrocat! Thank you very much to the many people who made Ernie's voyage possible, I'll make sure once he gets here his saga will continue to be recorded and presented for his posterity. Too bad he doesn't eat kudzu. The other recent addition to the household (Jamine bunny) is very happy to help us avoid being overrun by the kudzu in the yard of the abandoned house next door. Even the caterpillar J brought me yesterday for identification has kudzu for a host plant!The beautiful fall weather continues here in Atlanta and we keep the studio doors flung wide (and the screen door latched--Baxter bit the FedEx deliveryman yesterday) to profit from it. In a perfect world, I would sit in the skychair on the porch with the bunny frolicking at my feet all day. Hmmm. Maybe it can be a perfect day. Add a couple of phones, a laptop, a mountain of papers and voila--outdoor office!Speaking of phones, if you left voicemail for me on my cell phone anytime between 9/13 and today and wondered why I never called you back, it's because  I did not get your message til last night late (sorry Patty, Mary, Dee, Cynthia, Patrrick, Todd, Becky, and everyone else). Apparently the visual voicemail on my iPhone is honked and I didn't even know it till I tried calling it myself and got a 'mailbox full' message. Two calls with AT&T down--and a third to go this morning--'cause it still doesn't work.Now I better go prepare for Ernie. Where did I put that kitty throne?In non-Ernie studio news, Glass Craftsman magazine is reviewing my book in their December-January issue. I had a long (disjointed on my part) call from one of their writers yesterday. She interviewed me about my experience, teaching, writing the book, etc. I hope I didn't come across as a total moron. Some days you can talk better than others. Yesterday was not that day for me. Today might not be either."},

It's a Dancing Goats morning! (NOTE: seven laptops in the coffe shop this morning and ALL are Macs... the tide has turned.) I edit press release, business agreement, and artist bio (for Lee), work on the underlying formulae used in my order form to Bullseye, and complete (to date) the order I am having shipped from Bullseye *Next Week*. Then lunch (maybe at Taqueria del Sol with the Spouse--who is also here with me at Dancing Goats). Then finishing said Spouse's birthday present (in time for tomorrow? maybe not...) and getting in the first load of the pieces that ship Thursday.As can be seen from the perky list above, I feel MUCH better than I did yesterday! Yesterday I went to Commerce and picked up the metal work from Black Cat, came home and collapsed into a somnolent napping daze for two hours, and then dragged myself to the studio to get orders shipped, go over hotshop biz with Lee, and have a long chat with Morganica about Ernie the Monstrocat and website design.Talking to Morganica about Ernie was very energizing--though I am become a bit daunted by the weight of the public scrutiny surrounding his move here. There have been some hitches and glitches in funding Ernie's travel from west coast to east so he is unlikely to arrive this week. As it looks now, it'll be about a week before the resource center grand opening before he graces us with his presence.Now to edits, infinity, and beyond!"},
{"title": "25 Days... and Counting", "date": "Monday, September 28, 2009", "text": "Lapsang Souchong tea in the New York skyline mug, the ticking of the clock (how appropriate!) for morning music. Siyeh Glass Resource Center opens in 25 days. We are still in mid-construction on the hotshop equipment and haven't started the beadmaking classroom or the retail space. Today I finish creating my order form for Bullseye (a spreadsheeting I will go, a spreadsheeting I will go, heigh ho the merry-o, a spreadsheeting I will go!) and finish filling it in to see what my damages are from my initial order. They will not, I am sure, be... small.Over the weekend I registered a new domain for the resource center website--siyehglass.com. I have decided to follow Bullseye's model and keep separate the websites for Siyeh Studio and Siyeh Glass. I had really wanted to have just one website, but I couldn't figure out how to meld all the news from the studio site (new galleries, new work, etc.) with all in the info from the resource center site (classes, items for sale, now items, book info, etc.) and get them to mind their elbows as they jostled for prominence on the front page. So I looked to others in the glass world who have the same dilemma to see their solutions. As I was afraid, the ones who are artists with a  thriving resource center business either have great resource center websites or great art studio websites. I didn't find a good example of both. Keeping everything up-to-date will clearly be an issue.Then I went back for another look at the Bullseye Glass and Bullseye Gallery sites, and it all just became clear in my mind. Each of my sites needs its own clean, crisp presence, but they also need to feel connected, linked, related--two parts of a whole instead of two different sites. Oh I don't plan to use the same layout template for both, but they should both have similar logos, similar background colors, font and layout. If you look at the Bullseye sites, they both have white backgrounds and grey text/image boxes, and they both convey the same clean, modern, complete yet minimalist impression. Both sites feel up-to-date and complete--understandable as they are maintained by someone whose job it is to maintain them--not, as in my case, to maintain them, run the store, teach classes and make the production work...Oh this cold is taking a toll on both my writing and concentration abilities! But I will try to persevere through the rest of this post. Apologies in advance if it is more disjointed and makes less sense than usual.As I surfed the templates at RocketTheme (they make great Joomla templates--I used a RocketTheme template for my Siyeh Studio site when I redid it a couple of years ago), I was initially seduced by Moxy--the template for September 2009. It's colorful, sexy, and sings to me in the same way the Dimensions template did when I got it. But this morning I came to my senses. Yes, it's beautiful and sophisticated, but it's not really the best match for a storefront site--even though it has the new QuickCart integration.  A much better option would seem to be Mynxx... and that's enough geeking out on website stuff for the morning. I am in full Shiny Rock Syndrome (if you open that link you'll have to scroll to the bottom to get to the salient bit) and am going to have to rein myself in hard to get through the next 25 days intact and on time.Now off to Commerce to get metal work!"},

The loan application is IN. I faxed all 102 pages of it in yesterday--and wasn't THAT fun! You know how sometimes the pages stick together going through the rollers? Well I caught all but one of the times it happened. Somewhere in part two of four there was a double up. I figure they'll call me and me to refax it when they get around to reading it. In my naivete I called the Chase business loan center to tell them about the problem to see if someone could look at the fax machine and tell me which page was missing. Of COURSE faxing doesn't work like that at a bank! All the faxes in the country come into one 800 line and are scanned as they come in. Then the scanned set is routed to the appropriate department. I put the same cover page on all four of my sections (including the fourth one that I had to send three times before it would all go through) so I hope they'll be able to put it all together. I haven't heard anything from them in any case. Let's hope this wasn't a big Waste Of Time.Today J's school celebrates Michaelmas as the festival of strong will in timing with the fall equinox (which was Tuesday, in case you missed it ;-). The morning was complicated a bit by my strong-willed child because she had to dress in \"warm colored clothing\"( to symbolize flame as she is being chased... by the dragon (in the form of the 8th graders)? I need to get the rest of the story today) and she did NOT like any of her clothing choices. \"Snow\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers on iTunes now. It's a good morning mix.I might have burned out the pump yesterday emptying the basement/crawlspace at the studio yesterday. I hope it just shut off because it was overheated. It looks like there's still about 4-5 inches of water down there that I need to get up before I can get the furnace repaired (please, please, please not replaced!). When I looked in yesterday I could see that one of the big ducts had pulled away from the furnace and it probably filled with muddy water. I'll call Ray--our heating and air guy extraordinaire (that's the only kind we have)--to see what he thinks over the phone and then see if I can coax him down to take a look at it. He doesn't really work in this area except as a favor to us so I am going to have to sound really pitiful. Come to think of it, sounding pitiful is not going to be a problem at all right now--this cold is beating the crap out of me. Today I sound like  one of Baxter's squeaky toys when I try to talk.This morning I get a kiln-load in, work on Dave's birthday present--which got pushed to a far back burner by the paperwork and flooding issues--and give a call to a web expert to get an opinion on how to structure my website to be both attractive and appropriate for my gallery customers and to serve the new Resource Center clients with class, materials, and technical info. Think about it--websites are powerful communication tools and they may set, if not the first then potentially one of the most important impressions someone has of you and your work. If you are a production artist, as I am, you want to project a professional image so that gallery owners can pull up your website to show prospective clients our work and information about you. They don't want to have to go in through a a retail/supplies website and raise the question in the client's mind \"Is this person an artist or a shopkeeper?\".Many people deal with the split identity issue by having two different websites, but I am resisting that solution. I have been Siyeh Studio for over 20 years, I don't want to have to be somebody else as I add this new Resource-Center/teaching aspect to my work. My studio name is also tied to my book through me, and I want to use the book to provide credibility to the Resource Center and my classes. So on the phone I go. Then I have just under a month to get it laid out and  implemented. ROFLOL! Oh I am funny this Friday morning!"},

{"title": "Rain, Rain Go Away, Come Again Another YEAR", "date": "Monday, September 21, 2009", "text": "A HUGE Kavarna mocha (with whipped cream) in the Chicago skyline mug (I stopped on the way home from dropping J off at school), \"Lay Me Down\" by Crosby & Nash on iTunes. There are so many possible titles for this post, but after long consideration I decided to go with the rain theme. Had I posted on Saturday as I almost did, the title would have been \"The Chaos Being Has Left the Building\" and though it might be a catchier title, today is mostly about the rain.Got Dave off to the airport for another week in Austin this morning, and then finished cleaning the kitchen, making J's breakfast, packing her lunch and getting her off to school. I was lucky and missed heavy rain (only seeing a drizzle) during both of the morning's drives. But it's a wet and wild world out there with all northbound lanes blocked on I-85 due to an accident (saw notice for this on the way to the airport) and a tree down at the Seminary across from J's school blocking the street--and the carpool/drop-off lane for the school--completely. Had to toss her out into the road and just keep driving (just kidding--I did stop).When I got home--and I'm not going out again till I have to pick her up from school--I decided to take advantage of the continuing break in the rain and get the portable pump set up in the crawlspace under the studio. I looked down there last week and it was flooded again (glad I didn't get around to replacing the hot water heater). I should've braved the deluges over the weekend though as when I looked in today there was over *five feet* of standing water--all the way to the top of the dugout part. Sadly this means that the furnace is now partly (mostly?) underwater. I shudder to think what THAT's going to cost. As I set up the pump, it started to rain again. I'll just leave it running today and see how far down it gets. It'll take at least two days to get all that water out. *sigh*.Enough about the rain, let's talk about chaos beings. I have come to the mid-life realization that I am such a one. Before I was married there was no one to notice, comment upon, stress about the pace that I (un)naturally kept. Once I had a partner, I started the litany of \"after I/we finish this project, things will slow down\", but they never did. There was always something new we had to do, someplace we had to go or move to, a new job to take, a child to have, SOMETHING. Up till this past weekend I figured it was just bad luck or timing--or my inability to say no when asked to do/give something. Saturday morning as I breakfasted with a spouse made very unhappy by Friday's post, I realized that it's all me: When things start to slow down and I have a less-than-totally-consuming task, I add to its complication and difficulty till I am appropriately consumed.Current point in case is the opening of Siyeh Studio as a Kiln-Glass Resource Center. When I initially decided to do it, I wasn't going to add much inventory, I wasn't going to have formal retail hours, and I wasn't going to offer any classes right away. By this past weekend I not only found myself with a full class schedule (thank heavens I am not teaching it all), an expanded retail selection (now taking up a full room in the studio), a dedicated beadmaking classroom with all its attendant paraphernalia, and a hotshop whose equipment I had doubled to be able to have two simultaneous gloryholes and benches for teaching. I was embroiled in storyboarding the safety and demo videos for the classes (for heaven's sake!), designing new classes, negotiating distributorships--in short, spending time and money as if they were water. And it's too bad they AREN'T water as with all the rain we have, I could goldplate all my tools and work 938 hours a day and still have some left over.What was I doing? And, more importantly, why? Why? Because I am a chaos being. I like the spontaneous, the unpredictable, the surprise and change. When I got stressed when I was younger and footloose, I'd take a roadtrip. Maybe I'd go from Phoenix to LA for the weekend--or the day. Drive all night to sleep on the beach during the day and drive home for work the next day. Or I'd move to Colorado on a whim for the winter--or Austin on a similar whim for the summer. If I had a problem, I didn't try to sit down and fix it, I'd leave it behind instead. Right here and now is the longest I have lived anywhere since I was 17 and kicked the dust of the same address for my whole life to date from my heels. It's not that I didn't like where I grew up--I moved back twice in the six years after I first moved and would probably be there again now had I not been snared by my spouse while in Chicago.The addiction to upheaval reached such a state that I didn't even realize what I was doing. But Saturday, I had an epiphany. I *don't* have to have everything I can think of for a perfect KGRC done by October 23. I don't even have to *try* to have it done. I can stage development. Dave told me the name for this process as we were talking Saturday morning--maybe it even was staged roll-out or development. Wow. I feel liberated. I immediately scaled back on the planning and (except for the one this morning about the sump pump in the studio crawlspace) have stopped having anxiety attacks again. Now let's see if I can keep up at slowing down...\"Hi. My name is Brenda, and I'm a slothful adrenaline junkie...\""},

Did I write about the Red Queen's race on Tuesday or Wednesday? Well, I may be virtually disorganized, but in the real world I have a cascading file tote and I'm not afraid to use it! There are sections for glass and supply sales, classes, orders, the hotshop and beadmaking classroom, Black Cat ArtWorks and Bentwell Metals collaborative info, technical data, and business info (loan docs, website stuff, email marketing info, etc.). Of course that little tote won't hold *all* the papers I have on any one of those topics--but it isn't meant to. No, the tote is there to hold all the papers that I need *right now* to keep them organized and at my fingertips.This is an unusual period for me. It is not uncommon that I have 2-3 projects going at a time, but right now I have upwards of ten and I think I have reached the limit (maybe even passed it a little) for what I can do all at once. Last night I was sure I heard the hamster in our room again about 2:00 AM. He got out a couple of weeks ago while J was having a sleepover at a friend's house and we heard him rustling around in a plastic bag in the corner of our room about 4:00 am. We both got up and managed to wrangle him back to his cage. Last night I was just too tired to get up to investigate so instead I dreamed about giant hamsters and glass studio projects the rest of the night. This morning the first thing I did upon rising was to check on Tuffy (said hamster) and he was tucked up safe in his cage. Either he went on walk-about and returned safely (and shut the cage up after himself), or I dreamed it all.This morning I go up to the Gwinett Center to set up my ikebana arrangement for JapanFest this weekend. Then I drop off a commissioned piece at Taylor Kinzel. Then I meet with Becky the bookkeeper. I begin to hate sentences that begin with 'then I'. Then Becky the assistant arrives and we ship an order or two (depending on if I hear back from the client for one with a ship-to address). THEN I have to find time to keep going through the mountain of material, tool and supply orders I have to find a way to finance simultaneously and immediately, AND to work on my class descriptions and prices, AND to create the resource center website from scratch, AND update my own website with the Greene & Greene exhibit info, AND finish creating order forms and price sheets for all of Bullseye's products, AND AND AND...Roll up the sleeves, gird the loins, put the big-girl panties on and get to it.

I cannot be held responsible for remembering anything right now.Put together a really great class with Becky and Todd yesterday right down to the hourly time break-down.

If you just walk, you stay in one place. But heaven help you if you want to stand still for a moment. Wait a minute! I know where I am...______________________\"Just at this moment, somehow or other, they began to run.  Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began:  all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her:  and still the Queen kept crying `Faster! Faster!' but Alice felt she could not go faster, thought she had not breath left to say so.  The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything.  `I wonder if all the things move along with us?' thought poor puzzled Alice.  And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, `Faster!  Don't try to talk!'  Not that Alice had any idea of doing that.  She felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath:  and still the Queen cried `Faster! Faster!' and dragged her along.  `Are we nearly there?'  Alice managed to pant out at last.  `Nearly there!' the Queen repeated.  `Why, we passed it ten minutes ago!  Faster!  And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in Alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.  `Now!  Now!' cried the Queen.  `Faster!  Faster!'  And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.  The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, `You may rest a little now.'  Alice looked round her in great surprise.  `Why, I do believe we've been under this tree the whole time!  Everything's just as it was!'  `Of course it is,' said the Queen, `what would you have it?'  `Well, in our country,' said Alice, still panting a little, `you'd generally get to somewhere else -- if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been doing.'  `A slow sort of country!' said the Queen.  `Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.  If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\"______________________from \"Through the Looking Glass\", by Lewis CarrollTomorrow I'll run twice as fast as this."},
{"title": "June Cleaver Has Left the Building", "date": "Monday, September 14, 2009", "text": "I am forgoing coffee this morning, the ticking of the clock is the music that spurs me on into the day. This morning I have another appointment with my surgeon to review the progress of my ankle on it's road to fully healed support. It looks like there is no infection anymore, it's just a big scabby, scarred mess. I'm going to ask him how soon I can get a tattoo over it just to see his reaction.Yesterday I got a call from this year's 7th grade teacher at Jessie's school about a fieldtrip for her class. Of course I am delighted to have 20 7th graders in to see demos and make projects at the studio! This year we'll have even more to demo to them with the hotshop and the beadmaking classroom.The rest of this past weekend was spent being June Cleaver for a varying number of seven year-old girls. We had a friend of Jessie's from Friday morning through Sunday evening while her mother was at a conference, and we also had another of her friends from midday Saturday through Sunday evening. I took the three of them to the Yellow Daisy Festival Saturday morning, but I didn't get to see any of my friends exhibiting there. I should never have started at one end thinking i could walk all the way through on my ankle. After weeks of diminished activity, my leg muscles (and ankle) were not up to walking through a 500-booth craft festival and I pooped out (as did the girls) before we made it halfway through. Later that afternoon Jessie had yet another friend over playing who also stayed for dinner. Actually, in this recitation of my Cleaverness, it would be more true to say Dave and I traded June duties as he was the one who cooked dinner on Saturday and had to deal with an ever-changing number of prospective diners ( and I just love the mental image of him in the pearls and the apron...).The grand opening of the studio as a Bullseye Resource Center hurtles ever nearer and I still have TONS of website work, supplies and equipment wrangling, and major marketing to do. This afternoon I am meeting with Todd and Becky about another class idea Becky had for a joint fused, slumped, torchworked beads, wire-wrapped wall/window hanging or platter project. See how complicated it sounds? That's why we need to meet in person to go over it.Now off to get ready for the doctor and on with the day."},

I realized as I typed the last four words in the first sentence of this post that though there was Internet on my and Dave's laptops, I still hadn't connected the rest of the hardlines--including the Apple TV which runs our music through the house speakers so I lumbered out of my chair (it's early, I'm sore) to finish hooking it up. Then I decided since I was up I would look at the status of the dishwasher to see if I could get it siphoned, and that led to wheedling Dave into making the coffee that I then adulterated as shown. It's all connected, doncha see.As I was downloading the photo of this morning's coffee and yesterday's ikebana off of my iPhone I discovered a series pf photos on it that Jessie took at our Delores Taylor workshop dinner at Sugo. At first I was just going to delete them, but she had such fun playing with the light that I had to hold onto them. I particularly like this pensive shot of Licha.Yesterday was firing, ikebana, schedule readjustment, and a long business meeting with Lori. Today is more firing, meetings with Lee and Becky, another class proposal to Oakhurst Community Gardens, and the beginnings of my casting project! Oh yes, and the last 12 pages of that pesky ARC loan paperwork and two distributor proposals to polish up. A couple of days ago a corporate gift client called to see if I could do a little project for them. Little in terms of size (and cost) of each piece--fused and slumped business card holders, but big in terms of scale--1600 of them in December. You bet! Why not? So I have to finish the slump today and shoot them off pictures of the prototype I am whumping up. Thanks, Lori, for the loan of your slump mold and showing me how you do them.The casting project is the last item on the list because even though I have all the materials I need and I just ordered the wallpaper steamer from Amazon, this is a for-fun project and everything else on the list is for business. While I was on Amazon I noticed that they have a new option for Prime members--Saturday delivery for $2 more than overnight delivery. I think it was $2 more ($6.99 per item) but I am having such a hard time reading the font on my laptop screen this morning that I might have been mistaken.It was good to be back in ikebana this week. It was in June that I was last able to go between show and order schedules, travel and broken leg. The picture from my iPhone is unfortunate and shows an incorrect perspective to my arrangement this week--the last arrangement before my exhibit arrangements next week that finish out the second level of my instructor training. I don't ever see myself teaching ikebana (I'm sure I'll eat those words some day), but I love the balance and insight that the activity gives my glass work and I have missed it this summer.The Yellow Daisy Festival out at Stone Mountain started yesterday and I hope to take Jessie and her friend Maxena (who is staying the weekend with us while her mother is at a conference ) to it tomorrow. I have several friends exhibiting--some of whom I haven't seen in years. It'll be good to attend a retail show for once, as opposed to exhibiting at it!"},

Thank heaven there are still people who don't secure their networks! Acquisition of a new modem/wireless router on the list for today. Why does everything break at once? Why can't life be compartmentalized into work and home? Why is responsibility responsibility and must-be-fixed-now must-be-fixed-now regardless of when they occur during the day? First the top on Dave's Mini, then the refrigerator water dispenser, then the dishwasher (and it still won't drain), now the home network. Don't all these things know I have a business to build?!? I need to be filling out loan forms, updating web pages, getting orders out, paying bills, putting the details on paper for my business agreement with Lori for the KGRC... I don't have TIME to keep googling how-to-fix-X so I can futz around repairing mechanical systems!Rant over. On with the post.Yesterday I picked up rubber and clay moldmaking supplies and tools from The Engineer guy and Daven's (and signed a couple of books for Daven's while I was there), and put together and scheduled the first Glass Bead Making For Beginner's class at the studio with Becky. Pretty ambitious as we don't even have torch set-ups yet! I am giving up my office at the studio to have a torchworking classroom. The big comfy green chair, the neutronium oak desk, the Mission file cabinet and TV stand, the mini fridge, the espresso machine, and the microwave are all going to have to be relocated--most of them not to another place in the studio as there is no more room. I am going to move to a sleek little white melamine table like I have in the home office that we'll put in the front room (the retail space). Makes sense to put retail and office together--and is also better planning to put the classroom space not in the path from the front door to the rest of the studio.One last addition to the studio on the books for this fall--we're going to rook over the little (10X10) back deck and set it up as a plaster mixing area. The wax melt-out area will be under the back-door overhang. It'll be good to keep both those activities outside (weather permitting--I can always set-up on the screened in front-porch if it's really raining).I have been very good lately (always?) at starting things. Now I need to get a bunch of them finished. My to-do list for today is very scary--and some things are going to have to go. I was hoping to go to Lori's this afternoon and let Jessie swim in the pool while Lori and I hammered out the final details of our business plan, but that is going to have to wait till next week. And now I have to wrap up this post--the up-and-downness of my pirate signal is driving me MAD!PS--The calendar in the post below is interactive: Click on the arrow to go to the months after September and you'll see a whole bunch of classes with more to come soon!PPS--Thank you to the Spouse for telling me about the above XKCD cartoon whose alt caption reads: We need a special holiday to honor the countless kind souls with unsecured networks named \"linksys\"."},

Sadly, I am too stubborn and too lazy to brew it. The stubborn caused me to balk at getting back on the coffee-go-round after so successfully ridding myself of my caffeine addiction (no headaches if I don't have any). The lazy meant that I didn't go make some after I passed through stubborn and got to the realization that I could brew decaf. Ah well, on with the day.Yesterday we poured concrete at the studio again. It wasn't much and we did it all with help from two day laborers. They also moved the mulch path that runs from the house to the studio (it was dead ending in the hotshop as it was put in before the hotshop was conceived), and installed a french drain along the back and down one side of the hotshop. Oh to heck with this--I'm going to make some decaf. BRB.______________________Decaf with heavy cream and a squirt of Hershey's chocolate syrup in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Bad Things\" by Jace Everett on iTunes. Had to use the heavy cream as it was all we had in the fridge besides 2%, and there's no way I'm going THERE. I made a whole pot so drop on by if you're in the neighborhood! The Jace Everett is in honor of my copyright violation warning on YouTube for the Glass Roll-Up video part 2. I noticed when I went there the other day that there was a link to buy the song from Amazon on the video.I thought how great! I put the links to buy the MP3 on my posts with the songs but didn't have a way to do it through YouTube. I was disappointed, however, that only one of the songs had a link. Today I discovered that apparently YouTube sees the \"ad\" from Amazon as some sort of penalty. They don't take your video down, they just enable the other content to be made available for purchase. How great is that! Now what I want to know is why they don't enable you to flag it that way on the front end.But enough coffee and music, back to the studio! (except for one more comment--I got a great version of Classical Gas live by Dave Edmunds from iTunes last night and it just came on iTunes. Wow.) Do you get the feeling it's going to be hard for me to focus today?Yesterday I met with both Lee and Becky again to hammer out their requirements for teaching glass blowing and beadmaking in the studio. Becky, besides being my assistant extraordinaire, is the co-president of Southern Flames. We decided to outfit the studio with minor bench burners from Nortel. Becky and I spent the majority of our time on a where-the-heck-do-we-put-this-teaching-area discussion (Looks like I'm going to lose or at least have to redesign and share my office). We'll get to a class schedule later after we have equipment and ventilation sorted out.Lee and I, however, put together the initial glassblowing class schedule through December. It's aggressive, it won't all fill, we don't care. We're going to offer very inexpensive intro workshops (ala John Phillips--thanks for the tip last week John!) and rely on our extensive experience, knowledge, material selection, and commitment to providing the best possible learning experience for our students to bring people back for more in-depth work. I made it public this morning, but you'll need to skip to next month to really see anything. I also put up the classes I'm teaching through Oakhurst Community Gardens through the end of the year (one at the gardens and two at the studio).The grand opening of Siyeh Studio as an official Bullseye Kilnformed Glass Resource Center is set for the weekend of October 23. There's not much on the calendar before that as we frantically prepare a fully-stocked retail and fully-outfitted teaching facility. Oh yes, and I have production work to do too. Yet somehow I manage to stay calm and not overwork. Okay, enough chit-chat. Off to the studio to get a couple of kiln loads in and follow-up on my ARC loan application.

Seems *everyone* should be able to recognize James Brown's music IMMEDIATELY (and know that his name is spelled without an \"e\" at the end). Oh well, I failed.I began the morning by taking the fabulous Delores Taylor to the airport so she could fly home to Seattle after filling our brain cavities with pate de verre. Now I post, and then I'm going to read and nap in my comfy chair at Dancing Goats for the rest of the morning. Everyone needs a day off to not think of glass or business or glass business *at all*, and today is my day! Tomorrow I'll pick up the reins of the finances, fire loads, plan the next projects and studio undertakings (retail, classes, show display tweaks, etc.), and I'll also start working on Dave's birthday present. Heh. He'll never guess, and reading about it on the blog will drive him mad.But back to the workshop. How was it, you ask? Mahvelous dahling. Absolutely Mahvelous. Yes, we learned lots and lots from someone who is truly a master (mistress? Mistress Delores... I like that!) at her craft. She has not only studied extensively with other masters, she has also applied herself diligently to honing both her art and her craft. The venue was also exceptional. Lori not only has a beautifully put together studio (The Glass Garage at Glass Inspirations), but she is also superb hostess and we drank and ate well (and often!).Now for the curriculum itself... Day 1 we learned about color wedges and Delores' formula for custom blending our own colors from Bullseye powder and -01 frit. We used clay to model wedge trays that we then cast in plaster and filled with seven sample mixtures s from 5% to 100% color saturation. It was a long, incredible day and I didn't get home till almost 8:00 pm. Someone in the class had the idea of using wedge-shaped make-up sponges as the pattern for the glass wedge mold, and I thought that was genius. I liked the samples we did, but I want them BIGGER. I also want to do some sort of a reservoir system so I can get them as full as possible.Day 2 had us taking both the mold-making and color-blending principles we had learned the day before and putting them to use in creating a bas relief tile. I used a couple of real leaves, a real allium flower, and a plastic dragonfly in a very simple arrangement--I saved complex for my vessel on day 3. Did you ever make coiled posts from clay as a kid? Well I coiled clay and curled it all around my hump mold in higgledy-piggledy swirls. All day on day 3 was spent designing, casting and cleaning out our vessel molds so we would be ready to pack them (with a paste of glass) on day 4. We did divest (break out of the mold) our tiles too an I am in love with my simple little one--the colors are so crisp, clean and saturated!Day 4 we packed and fired, day 5 we started late with lunch and chatting, and in the late afternoon we divested our vessels and coldworked both vessels and tiles. I got a lot of the plaster out of the swirls in my vessel, but I have a lot of cleaning left to do. I also got to see first-hand evidence of the importance of packing, packing, tamping, packing the glass paste. It may look like it's a solid, even thickness, but when it fires it can shrink in in the not-so-well-packed areas and end up thinner. Clearly pate de verre is all about practice.As I wrote in a previous post, this year is all about professional development for me--taking classes from the masters, and I have been really lucky in my choice of teachers. In many respects Delores and Linda Ethier are polar opposites (their approaches to mixing plaster, e.g.), but with both of them I could easily spend months studying with them and barely scratch the surface of their knowledge. So though my brain is full after five days, I can see great wanging holes in my knowledge that will only be filled with practice, practice, practice (and time).Now back to my book and my nap. Tomorrow is soon enough to plan class schedules, materials lists, studio carpentry for teaching, et al."},

It's been raining heavily for over two hours and everything outside is flooded... can't wait to see the studio crawl space.This morning I called the SBA and spoke to the same woman who initially gave me the information about the ARC program and sent me the preferred lender guide. I told her about Wells Fargo's policies and she said she knew and it's legal. Even though these loans are guaranteed by the SBA and so no risk to the bank they are still trying to get everything out of it they can. Some require ARC applicants to be their own existing customers, and some like Wells Fargo tack on their own requirements on top of the SBA's--and it isn't just for this loan program but for many government-sponsored programs. Bunch of opportunistic crooksBut onto happier thoughts. It's Friday! I have kiln loads to get to, and a photography session, and yet more never-ending paperwork to reconcile, and bills to pay, but then I have a five-day special treat as I will be in Delores Taylor's Pate de Verre workshop up at Lori's.

People of like minds form groups, communities, organizations and businesses, and the worst of them (let's just say Wells Fargo Bank and appropriately preface the rest of my rant) are always on the look out for way's to turn someone else's misfortune into their gain.The ARC loan program is a Small Business Administration-backed interest-free loan program to help small businesses which have been profitable in the past couple of years but are now struggling with the downturn in the economy. The SBA has a list of preferred lenders (they sent it to me back in March when I first started looking into the program) and Wells Fargo is one of them. I figured I would call them as they recently acquired my bank, Wachovia, so I have an existing professional relationship with them. The nice young man I spoke to this afternoon asked me some qualifying questions  to make sure I was a fit for the program, and said he would have the application emailed to me (and it could take a day as it had to be forwarded). Then after I filled out the application it would take 45 days to process. Wow. The wheels turn more slowly than I would have thought, but okay. I was pleasantly surprised to get the app tonight and I started reading it as I ate my dinner. It's a 25 page document. I didn't get further than the first page as I stopped as soon as I hit the following paragraph:In addition, Wells Fargo ARC loans cannot be used to pay-down non- Wells Fargo business lines of credit and business credit cards.  (formatting all theirs.)So here's the deal. Wells Fargo gets a loan guaranteed by the federal government. They get to collect interest on the loan for five years. It's a win-win for them, but they had to go and be greedy and not only get to make money off the government, but they had to keep all the money they get in-house to further secure their existing business debt. In essence the government is bailing out yet another large bank--this time under the auspices of helping out small businesses! It should be illegal for lenders to put this kind of restriction on a government-backed loan (and a preferred lender at that!). I wish I knew someone to call about this in the SBA or *anywhere* who would not only care but be able to do something about it. All I can do is vow never to deal with Wells Fargo again.Even though they are not a preferred lender for the program, I thought I would give Chase bank a try. I have my business and personal-used-for-business credit cards through them (the same ones I want to pay down with the ARC loan) so maybe they'd work with me. My experience (so far) has been vastly different and I am guardedly optimistic about the possibility of working with them. Their application process is done over the phone whenever I am ready, they don't have restrictions on who the debt is to (outside the basic restrictions of the ARC program--existing business debt only), and it was my impression that it would be handled pretty quickly. We'll see when I get all my paperwork together tomorrow and call them back to actually do it.Now a shower for me and the Sprout, another chapter of The Dark Hills Divide, and then a long, close look at the inside of my eyelids."},

I look back to my business five years ago and I marvel at all the new directions and projects I've undertaken that I couldn't even conceive of then. Today I talked with Bill at Black Cat ArtWorks and reviewed our open invoices to each other and our orders on Google Docs. Then I met with Lori Schinelli and we hammered some more on our partnership arrangement and pricing for the retail part of our KGRC. The afternoon continued with a hotshop session with Lee and Dominic where we did a couple of roll-ups for my Niche entries, and I finished the day in the studio reviewing orders to ship with Becky, preparing glass to take to Todd of Bentwell Metals tomorrow for our pieces that he needs to wrap, and firing a quick kiln load. Whew!Tomorrow I meet with V the bookkeeper, drop the glass off with Todd, continue his training on Google Docs (I am *very* jealous that Morganica has Google Voice! I want Google Voice!!), pick up one of my previous roll-up pieces from it's current owner so I can have it photographed along with the new pieces tomorrow at Bart's (Bart's Art Photography), file my taxes, and prepare to apply for one of the new SBA economic stimulus loans. Let's face it: I am pretty stimulated, but I need some economic.Now I better get a jump on the laundry and order the pizza--on-line. Do we live in a great century or what?

{"title": "The Organization of Collaboration", "date": "Tuesday, August 25, 2009", "text": "Coffee was in a Kavarna cup with some kind of Reagan-rock retro playing in the background at Kavarna, but I'm back in the studio now waiting for the kilns to cool. What a morning! (And what was I doing at Kavarna?) I was at Kavarna to get a different IP address from the address I have at home so Google would let me create a gmail account for Todd (and thus to enable me to drag him kicking and screaming into the century of the fruitbat). Google did not cooperate being under the illusion that I was trying to do something nefarious.It all began at 5:45 this morning when I woke bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and decided that the best thing I could do today to get organized was to organize Todd. I already had a full morning scheduled so I got up at 6:00 so I could get on the computer to create a gmail account for him and get him set-up with Google Docs (the \"why\" on this organizational step in a subsequent paragraph). Leaving the Sprout snoring gently sprawled on her back with her hands tucked behind her neck, elbows akimbo, I padded down to the kitchen table in my jammies, said good morning to the sleepy-eyed spaniel and the still-dozing deerhound, and commenced to internetting.I went to the gmail homepage and dutifully filled out all the little boxes necessary to create a gmail account. But when I tried to submit the form, I got: \"Google Error: We're sorry...  ...but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application.  To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.  We'll restore your access as quickly as possible, so try again soon.  In the meantime, if you suspect that your computer or network has been infected, you might want to run a virus checker or spyware remover to make sure that your systems are free of viruses and other spurious software.  We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope we'll see you again on Google.\" I Googled (oh the irony!) this error and tried all the proffered solutions (including going to Kavarna) and nothing worked. Google hates my laptop. I finally had to create the account on my iPhone--after struggling for over an hour with it.So why is it so necessary that Todd have gmail and Google docs and access to the on-line studio calendar? I have long maintained that collaboration is the way to effectively grow a fine crafts business, and streamlined communication and organization is the key to effective collaboration. Enter Google. Sure email (in this case gmail) is a good thing, but even better are shared calendars and shared google docs. For the past couple of months I have had a spreadsheet shared between me and Black Cat ArtWorks that details our orders (at least my orders for them--we're still working on a form for their orders for me) and soon we'll have one up with our interstudio invoices. Earlier this week I brought Becky on-board and shared the Siyeh Studio calendar, shipping calendar and class calendar with her, and also created a shared stands inventory sheet. Today was Todd's turn.The task of computerizing Todd is more difficult than you might imagine. There are certain things he is very resistant to-and contact with the Internet is high on that list. But as our business grows, I need to be able to get orders to him without having to resort to carrier pigeon, or calling him and reading off the orders to him, or scribbling them on the back of a piece of scrap paper and handing it to him right before getting on a plane... Thursday I gird my loins and go out to his house to \"train\" him. For today I just read him the list of orders over the phone that are in Google Docs all bright and shiny and newly minted. *sigh* Baby steps. The account exists. He may be a camel, but he WILL drink."},
{"title": "Senior Moment Monday", "date": "Monday, August 24, 2009", "text": "No beverage, \"Last Kiss\" by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers on iTunes. Just got back from an artwork exchange with Black Cat ArtWorks in Commerce. Elaine and Katie met me today and we spent a lovely 45 minutes chatting and sipping coffee outside the Starbuck's. Adult conversation is good. Most of my time in the past week has been spent in the sole company of a seven year-old, and while she is interesting and articulate I need to talk about more than bunnies, playdates, and what she doesn't want to eat.Worked through the weekend to get the backlog of orders done that came in to Black Cat ArtWorks while we were at the Buyer's Market and I was on vacation. Started Saturday by breaking my 48\" X 36\" fiberboard kiln shelf into a lot of little pieces when I lifted it to turn it over. Most of it was just over 1/2\" thick--and it started out 1\" thick. That's what happens when you hand sand the surface smooth for a year. On the way home from Commerce this morning I stopped at Olympic Kilns in Flowery Branch and picked up a replacement shelf. Now I'm going to move the Dyson shelf from Bettina to Bertha (with a LOT of help) and put the new fiberboard shelf in Bettina. She's deeper and more insulated so I want to be able to use her for casting (she was designed as a casting kiln) and I can't with the thick baffled shelf taking up so much room. It'll be perfect in Bertha--and might help my cold corner problem a bit.This coming weekend starts the 5-day Pate de Verre workshop with Delores Taylor up at Lori's. There are still two spots left so if you have an interest, I have a spare room...This past weekend I got to experience a new kilnforming joy when I unexpectedly \"burned\" the irid right off the back of two Bullseye clear-irid-backed pieces. After I broke my kiln shelf I had to scramble to find suitable pieces of shelf material to support the load I had to go in. I found a piece of fiberboard about 24\" X 36\" X 1\" in the closet and used it. Apparently it was a different sort of fiberboard than I usually have (who knows where it came from) and it should have been pre-fired. About 2-3\" in from all sides there was a sooty blackness on the shelf and no irid left in the corresponding glass above it. Looks like some kind of outgassing from the shelf that chemically negated the irid on the glass. First time I've ever seen that one. Had to remake the pieces and that really slowed me down.Now it's time to get to work. There were two things I meant to post about today. One was the shelf, and I have no idea what the other was. Senior moment on Monday. Maybe I'll remember by tomorrow--and maybe I'll forget again."},

They want to stop delivering on Saturday, I say let's stop delivering altogether. If it can't be done electronically without killing any trees, it doesn't need to be done at all (I can barely lift the bag of junk catalogs and other waste mail to be recycled).It's the first day of school for the J and a short one at that, and we are still recovering from flying in from Montana late last night (highlights of our trip can be found on Stranded in the South so it's a short studio day too.

The show circuit is finished for the year--no more traveling for me till next January for the Dallas Finds Temp Show. Yay! But we're not slowing down. On October 23 Siyeh Studio will officially become a Bullseye Kiln-formed Glass Resource Center. That means we will stock and sell a full range of materials and supplies for kiln-forming, casting, torchworking and blowing with Bullseye (at fantastic prices, of course), and we will also have a regular class schedule here and at Glass Inspirations (owned by Lori Schinelli our partner in the resource center). Lots to do to get ready for that.And let's not forget the hot shop! We are scheduled to come on-line with it this month--the gas line for the glory hole was installed while I was gone and I'm heading over there after I pick up J from school to see how the kiln building has progressed. My current idea for my Niche piece requires it be done and the deadline for entry is August 31 so I have my fingers crossed.So I'm back, I'm well-rested, and I'm full of plans for the fall.

{"title": "BMAC in Review: Highlights and Low-Lifes", "date": "Monday, August 03, 2009", "text": "Nothing to drink (hate facing the restroom at the Philadelphia Convention Center on crutches), the sounds of the beeping forklifts and bustling artists packing their wares for music. So how was it? Interesting. For sheer number crunching, I have 34% the sales ($) I had last summer, but 255% the number of orders. Really. Not a typo: 255%. Of the orders, 79% are from new galleries, and only 18% of all of them are from locations outside the Philadelphia regional area. The final show of the year, and it turned out to be every bit as regional as the Atlanta and Dallas January market shows were.Other continuing trends: shrinking artist and buyer numbers, and tighter and pickier union rules and people enforcing them at the convention centers. I am glad I missed set-up at this show as I truly might have disemboweled someone. On the first day as Bill, Elaine, Todd, John and Daniel were starting to put up the booth, the union steward came by and said our booth was over 300 square feet so we weren't allowed to put it up ourselves (I'm using the royal \"we\" as I wasn't[obviously] there)--we had to have two union carpenters set it up for $185 an hour... Bill agreeably informed him that we have two separate booths, two separate contracts, two separate exhibitors, and we just help each other set-up and intermingle our work. The union steward said no, we were one booth, we had to pay for the union labor and we could do nothing ourselves except hang the work--they had to do the walls, the lights and the carpet.Well we couldn't afford the extra almost $3,000 bill so Bill said he was going t talk to the show management and if they insisted on charging us the fee, we'd have to pack up and go home. The Rosen Group and Hargrove Exhibition Services both upheld our two-contract status so Hargrove ended up paying the union vig. I wonder if it worked like a hospital billing an insurance company and they asked for one amount and took (the much smaller) what they could get. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about it.However that was the nail in the coffin of doing one big booth together for us. First the electricians in Vegas wanted to put up the track lighting (and said they will be enforcing that \"rule\" next year), now the carpenters at the BMAC had to go for the squeeze. The convention center workers must really be getting hit with a decrease in shows to look so hungrily to the poor artists...Other big news from the show: The Rosen Group will be launching a Las Vegas Show to run at the same time as the JCK and ACRE. Marvin Gaye told me that the Rosen show is targeted to be for glass and jewelry, exhibitors by invitation only, and located at the Sands (the same location as the JCK). For me, I'm doing ACRE again. Won't be the same booth layout--not even close (thank God--I don't have enough hours left in my life to spare any more for that hideous set-up), but we'll be there together again (Siyeh Studio, Black Cat ArtWorks and Bentwell Metals). We're finally shipping our whole display home from Philly and designing a whole new layout from scratch-which we'll then ship to Vegas.And now we're about finished with break-down (I spent all of it in a chair--the first part packing glass and metal into boxes, the second part working on this review). Dee has cold white wine waiting for me back in the room. Tomorrow sees a flight home, a flurry of of appointments (doctor, leg wax, etc.) and then packing for Montana.

I repose at the gate in the Portland airport waiting to board the first leg of my flight to Philadelphia. It has been a very interesting time dealing with Delta on seating for all the flights I have right now. Out of Atlanta they had changed my seats (and the type of plane) so that I couldn't have a seat with a place to put my cast in front of me--all of the traditional bulkhead seats were also in emergency rows so I don't qualify to sit there. The best they could do was put me in a seat on the aisle and have me hang my leg out into the aisle (in cart and passengers' way).Given how badly that flight went, I was more than  a bit nervous about today's. And, of course Delta/Northwest screwed up my seats again and put me in a window seat at the back of the plane with my cast on the very inside. Apparently they had an \"equipment change\" so \"their computer\" moved everyone to new seats on the new plane... with no regard to handicapped bookings. When I checked in on-line last night and found out my seats had been changed I called... Northwest (even though I booked on Delta it's a Northwest flight). After failing to get through the phone robot once and being disconnected once, I was a bit less than patient when I finally got a representative on the phone. As soon as I said I booked through Delta she said \"I'll connect you with a Delta representative\" and didn't give me a chance to protest. *Of course* the Delta rep couldn't help me because it's a Northwest-operated flight. My only option was to wait to ask the gate attendant to fix it today. That's the same gate attendant who doesn't even arrive at the gate till an hour before the flight when everyone is already checked in and all the seats have been claimed... *sigh*Back to happier thoughts and times.My week at Bullseye was long, exhausting, packed to the gunwales, and *wonderful*. I am officially becoming a KGRC (Kiln Glass Resource Center) at the end of this year. I will carry a full line of Bullseye glass in the studio for retail and wholesale purchase, and will also offer classes along with Lori Schinelli of Glass Inspirations (she hosted Johnathon Schmuck's roll-up workshop earlier this year and has Delores Taylor coming in the end of the this month to do a five-day pâte de verre workshop (a couple of spots are still available--contact me if you are interested!). Lori will have a whole range of classes in her gorgeous studio, and I will have some in mine too._____________________The flights are over, they went pretty well--at least I got a bulkhead seat on both of them so I didn't have to put my leg out into the aisle. Bill picked me up at the airport, I got checked into my room with Dee, I had some wine, Dee bought me new steri-strips and put them on for me, and I went out to dinner with Bill, Elaine, their kids Katie and Daniel., Bill's cousin Nancy, and Todd and John. And a great time was had by all--Whoo hoo. Tomorrow is the first day of the show for me, we'll see how it goes (and I will be reporting).G'night all, from the east coast again!"},

We are hurtling through a sampling of Bullseye's teaching curriculum this week with an aim towards learning their pedagogy and improving our own methodologies. I am so energized by it all that I am hardly sleeping. Of course part of the reason I am sleepless in Portland is because my body is so confused with all this jet-setting back forth from the east coast to the west that it doesn't know WHAT time zone it's in! But wherever it is, the body is eating well. Shown at right is the causa morada appetizer at Andina, an incredible Peruvian restaurant where Bullseye wined and dined us all last night. Tomorrow night is Thai food at Dan and Lani's house. Good thing I have pants with expandable waists.But we are doing more than eating well. So far we have sampled boxcasting (our pieces shown in the kiln at left), platemaking basics, and painting with light (our instructor Eric Whittemore shown below sifting powder). We've made sample tiles to take back to our own studios that will form the basis for the sample sets we'll use to teach our own classes. I've also played with several techniques that I can't wait to experiment more with including the aforementioned boxcasting and painting with light and playing with vitrigraph stringer and candle-bent stringer.This morning we heard about marketing for the teaching studio from Mary Kay Nitchie, and this afternoon we are running through the glass cutting class. Tonight I hope to meet up with Cynthia Morgan--assuming we all live through he 105 degree temps today!Tomorrow we get to plan our own sample pieces to make and take home. Do we want to make tiles that show how different colors behave at different temperatures? Do we want to have tiles that illustrate the relationship between the viscosity and the thickness of the glass at fusing temp? Do we want a sample set of all the reactive colors? How about a fusing differential across temps (tack to full fuse) for various glasses? There are many, many options open to us, and I need to take a bit of time tonight to figure out which ones are the most attractive to me so I can add them to the voting pool for the group tomorrow."},

As it is Saturday, I had no assistants scheduled, and when I determined at the last minute that I would need help today, neither of my regular assistants were available. So Dave stepped in and unloaded three kilns for me and helped me load three back up. Then he and J helped label and stack all the padded envelopes with the health company awards in them for Kay to deliver to Bill in Commerce tomorrow.

They didn't, as it turned out, have a bulkhead seat for me--or indeed any seat with no seat in front of it. Too bad, so sad. They ddi have me in an aisle seat, but on the side where the booted leg was on the inside, not the aisle-side... Before I sat down (I didn't even try to fit me, my bag and my big boot in THAT seat) they switched me to the aisle seat on the other side of the aisle, and I spent the flight dodging drink and snack carts and passengers heading for the forward lavatory (which was out of service in any case). I did arrive unscathed (though the same flight attendant would like to have nailed my leg any number of times).I am now ensconced into my truly lovely big room at the Inn at Northrup Station (my bathroom is hot pink with a floor to ceiling mirror--I could have done without that particular view--and a walk-in shower). The rest of the room--actually, I don't think it's a \"room\". I think I have the Signature Suite!-- is in shades of green orange and purple (it all works) with a couch and sitting area, a desk, a kitchen and *two* flat-screen tvs! Best of all, it has free wireless so I type tucked up in bed, getting ready to drop to sleep like a stone.

Get it yourself!\", the answer would be, \"Well yes, I do!\". And I just got the hospital bill for the surgery last week on said broken leg. I read all the line items and just kept saying to Dave, this can't be right! His reply was that yes, it is right. I am being billed for me, for all the uninsured and for all the under-insured on Medicare.I still think $290 for each screw in my leg is a bit extreme--even if they do have to be reviewed by the FDA! And why do I have to pay (at almost $600 a pop) for the three drill bits they used? Can't they reuse them? Don't they pro-rate? And, finally, please, $1,275 for the standard recovery room fee and then $474 per half hour thereafter (for an additional hour and a half) just to lie in a bed in a room with a bunch of other people (in their own beds) and a few nurses cycling between us?!

I am fortunate to have a spouse who works for a slightly larger company with many more employees so that we only have to pay about $600 a month to be insured, i.e., to be able to break our legs and have them properly fixed as opposed to just hobbling around on crutches, letting them heal however they might, and dealing with the consequences--as many of my neighbors would have had to do.

(Two assistants and a gaffer/carpenter will be busy little little mice)--and then there's the whole property-next-door thing...Have a great weekend allPS--Pics are of Gaffers Lee and Dominick running a test of the roll-up process with my glass. We're definitely onto something here."},

It is the home stretch of summer in the studio for me. When I return from all my voyaging, it will be the end of August, the beginning of school for the J, and so the beginning of fall (albeit still hot and humid) for me. I always find the end of summer bittersweet. I think of the times I didn't go swimming, we didn't go to the drive-in, we didn't eat out on the deck and watch the fireflies, all the various Didn'ts. I am not so much prey to the Mustn'ts, I am too often taken down by the Didn'ts.But back to the home stretch of the week--the homestretch of the summer can take care of itself. Yesterday in my post I neglected to mention the heroic efforts of my spouse as Igor in the studio for me after all the other assistants had left. Becky had an appointment and absolutely, positively had to leave at 6:10. But I still had eight pieces to get in the kiln at 6:10, and I wasn't willing to risk my ankle by walking on it so I could carry them in myself. Just as I was about to despair and give up all hope of getting those pieces loaded, Dave walked in the back door and saved me. It's an allegory of my life. :-) He patiently and carefully carried all the pieces one at a time back to the kiln room and loaded them into Bertha.Today is my last shot at getting the colors the way the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston wants them for the iris piece to accompany the Greene & Greene exhibit. Keep your fingers crossed! As soon as the latest batch is cool enough to come out of Bertha, I need to photograph them and send the photos to the buyer. Also down to the wire is the awards project. There are eight pieces left to etch--one of which needs to be fired one more time to fix a scratch before it's etched. *Sigh*. Nothing like getting the last one done on the day they must be done.All the participants attending the Bullseye Instructor workshop have been asked to prepare a 5-7 slide, approx. 10 minute presentation about themselves, their studios, work and classes. I am looking around the studio this morning and it's a mess. Looks like there won't be any new photos taken before putting it together! Got to get with Lee today and get him to get the hotshop at least photographically presentable for tomorrow.Now off to slay the wily kiln load!"},

Yesterday turned out to be such a busy day (but good!) that I never got a chance to post more than to slap up a quick status update and photo on Facebook. For all who missed it, here is the leg post-surgery (my first view of it) in all its stapled glory. The 15 staples were removed with the coolest little tool (when used to grab the staples on the top, it made them ping open and release my flesh) and now all I have between my leg and my boot is a little support sock and some steri-strips holding the six-inch incision closed. Prognosis is excellent--I have another week of no weight, then I go back to partial weight-bearingToday we are back running full speed--and getting sidetracked by so many non-essential things!!_________________________And (several hours after commencing this post) the day is over. Wild Blues were consumed with dinner (at least by me--Dave turns up his nose at such perversions), and the Sprout has been read a chapter of The Mousehunter and is now abed.The day started normally enough, and then I was presented with an opportunity to acquire the property next door to the studio at a fire sale price... I was completely derailed for the rest of the day. It is as yet undetermined if we are going to pursue this opportunity. If we do, we have a rental property--or a lovely retail/office/guest teacher space. More as it develops.I had a lovely studio visit from Gale Towns of the artglasspics group (of which I am another member) this afternoon. I should have offered him tea, coffee, water, whathaveyou, but my hospitality was a bit frayed by the extreme pace of the day. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful chat (he loves my book and was on his second copy before I gifted him with a third today :-) and I'm just sorry I wasn't less pressed and more relaxed for his visit.I am now down to two work days before heading to Portland. In that time I need to do all the new pieces I am taking to the Buyer's Market--heck, I have to finish making a list of them prior to doing them still! I also need to finish the medical awards project (eight to etch tomorrow and then the labels for the packaging and the final invoice). Finally I have a large commission to wrap up and (finally, I hope) the rest of the pieces to create that are to accompany the Greene & Greene exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. My buyer there has asked for one more set of color revisions and the pieces for them will come out of the kiln tomorrow. She will review photos of them online, and if she approves, I need to complete all of that order by Friday... I'm making myself tired.Okay, that;'s enough for tonight.

It was my longest day in the studio post-surgery yet--and it was entirely pain and discomfort free. I am becoming accustomed to being handicapped and have developed a smooth set of work-arounds for daily actions and motions so as to avoid The Leg.This is the count-down week to everything that precedes the Bullseye Instructor Workshop, the summer Buyer's Market Show, and a two-week vacation in the ancestral cabin on the shores of Flathead Lake in Montana. It's a race now, and to the fleet go the spoils. I, the gimp on crutches, am not so fleet, but I have big determination--and a whole village to support me.Kay and Lee both participated in etching the first half of the awards for that project today. Licha called and offered some fine transparent red frit and though I said no, after I looked at what I have left in my 5-lb jar I may need to call back and beg for some. Tood gave an order to Christie to deliver for him and she brought me some *lovely* brie and fuji apples from the farmer's amrket when she dropped it off. Becky worked through an inventory of the metal and glass pieces I need to fill all my orders through the mid-end of August just to make sure I hadn't missed anything--I am in great shape--now I just need to fire all my pieces for the show! Finally,  I checked in with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and we still need to work through some color issues on the companion pieces we are doing for their Greene & Greene exhibit. Got to overnight another set of samples tomorrow and hope that I can get all the pieces fired (again) before I go.On the plus side of all this work, I am looking at having over $20K in receivables that have shipped in the past month and a half.  Yes, we are in a recession. No, some people don't seem to know that. As a gallery owner I work with in Florida reiterated to me today--the haves still have and aren't afraid to shop with it. The gap between the haves and the have nots is widening, and the have nots aren't even going to be able to manage the new small pieces for awhile.The receivables mean (if everyone pays--knock wood), $20K coming in in the next month to cover my glass and metal bills, my assistants' salaries, and some new coldworking and hotworking equipment. Christmas is saved! Shoes for everyone! Or at least a bit whittled off the Visa bill.Tomorrow sees more of the same in the studio--following my post-surgery doctor's appointment where I hope to see my incision for the first time and get back into my old (beloved) black boot.

The leg has occupied far too many of my glass posts lately and it's time to get back on track. We're hurtling towards Friday--my official last day in the studio till the end of August--and there's still a lot to get done. I know, last week I crowed that I had all my orders completed through the end of August, but I kept mum on the fact that I haven't done any of my work yet for the Buyer's Market show... in two weeks.So it's Sunday, and I have a very light day of work planned. First, the firing schedule. Bill and Elaine from Black Cat were here Friday night through last night and we laid out our (yet another) new display for the summer Buyer's Market. We have even more wall space than ever for this one, and for the first time all of my functional glassware and our small stand pieces will be hung on the walls. In order to minimize the effort necessary to hang all of it (especially since I won't even be there for set-up) we're going to try white plastic pegboard hanging panels over our foamcore with plate stands and shelves that hang on the pegboard. To get away from a garage look, we've minimized the amount of pegboard to just what's required to hold the plate stands and shelves.We also left room in the booth for me to have either a chair and place to put up my leg, or a wheelchair. I'll have to see what they do to my dressing and leg brace system on Tuesday when I go back to the doctor. If they put me back int eh boot, I'll be fine with anything. If they leave me in this bandage-covered plastic splint thing 9that has no room for expansion when my leg swells) I may have to hunt down a wheelchair for the duration. just to have a built-in leg rest up high enough.Most importantly, I, the control freak, have formally, officially, and (now) publicly  promised to be happy with (or at least to live ungrumblingly with) however the display ends up, with whatever changes were deemed necessary on-site as I won't be there till the dust has settled and the first day of the show is over. I'm already loading up on the Xanax... (just kidding).This morning Lee is scheduled to come over so we can etch the first of the awards. Friday late afternoon Becky and I put in the first of the color-adjustment loads (the red on most of the  awards just wasn't saturated enough so have to add more color) and when I opened the kiln yesterday, two of the pieces had thermal-shocked in half on the way up so I have to make two more. this is bad news as Becky let me in on the news that there is only about 1/2 lb of 02 red frit and slightly more of the 01--not enough to do all the color adjustments, much less to make two new pieces. This is one of those times that I really, really, really wished I lived in Portland! Tomorrow I'd saunter down to the Bullseye Resource Center and buy a couple of 5-lb jars of red frit and get back to work. Instead, I'm going to have to use the as-yet-unnamed glass-crusher machine I got from Sarah and David in New Mexico. It's a small behemoth  of a thing (really, I know what both those words mean and only by juxtaposing them can I convey the sense of hulk and even a bit of menace it has in its relatively small footprint). It reminds me a bit of something from Stephen King's \"Night Shift\". Let's try to avoid more blood, shall we? Finally, got another nice order yesterday from a gallery that carries my work in Hawaii. They're  opening a new location in a Grand Hyatt and are looking to place my work there too. I think I actually have everything they ordered in stock so I should be able to just send it out this week. Profit ahoy! Add to that two more commissions that are finally coming together, and it looks like I have a full week of firing--in my limited physical capacity."},

I am pain free this morning! I was pain-free last night too. And contrary to popular belief, I AM taking it very easy. I worked a total of two hours in the studio yesterday over noon (with an assistant), and then I came home, was served lunch (on the couch) and took a nap (a long nap, also on the couch). The biggest problem I have had is swelling--the leg is tightly splinted and dressed and there isn't much room for it to expand, as the left leg especially is wont to do. Just have to keep it up on the couch or on the bed._______________Several hours have passed, the day is almost over, and I finally took a pain pill. Kay drove me to Grainger today to pick up the sandblast abrasive so Lee can etch the awards this weekend. I received the stencils for etching the awards from Rayzist this morning (they sent them overnight), and the last awards are coming out of their fusing cycle this afternoon. Unfortunately, because I work with clear irid morceuax and colored frit, there are a lot of areas where the irid came to the surface of the blood-red glass and those pieces have to be fired again with a layer of fine frit over the the irid bits. Good thing I have allowed extra time in this process, but looks like we won't be etching this weekend. Wonder if Becky will come in again for an hour? Or maybe I can get Elaine or Bill to help me load the kilns... Or maybe Dave! Of course! My own Igor! His price isn't too steep."},

The pain is pretty much gone, but so is my leg, and, oh look, I think my head is missing too. This must be the \"Do Not Operate Heavy Machinery\" part of the morning--and here it's time to head to the studio!Today is a studio and computer day--more computer than studio. I have the last load of the healthcare company awards to fuse, a random piece to slump, and four or five orders to ship. Well, I won't actually be doing anything much other than laying out the glass for the fuse load and entering the shipments into the UPS online system. The assistants will be carrying all the glass to the kilns, packing and putting out the boxes to ship, and generally performing all toting of barges and lifting of bales. Then I shall nap.Thank you to Mom and Dad Griffith and to Keith and Mike for the lovely flowers. My parents are off kayaking and I haven't even been able to let them know I've had surgery yet."},

Becky worked in the studio from 8:30 to 12:45, I was there till 1:45, Kay was there from about 10:00 on (she headed to Commerce and met Bill to exchange work first at 6:30 am), V the bookkeeper stopped by get bills to mail and the deposit, and Lee brought the second load of refractory material he will need to build the kilns and the gloryhole. It was a busy, productive morning.When Dave came to the studio to pick me up and take me in for surgery, I felt like I was headed off to vacation! Several hours later when I woke from surgery I was panting and crying from pain, and they were pumping as much dilaudid into my IV as fast as they could. Getting into bed once we got home was managed in stages. First there was getting up the front porch steps (backwards on my tush). Then I scooted backwards into the house and took a left into the office where I sprawled on my back on the big round rug (the site of the original injury) for another 15-20 minutes. Finally I had enough together to scoot myself backwards down the hall, across the livingroom and up onto the couch for a couple more comatose hours. Finally about 10:30 I had enough equilibrium to crutch my way upstairs and to bed.And there I remain. D just brought me lunch, and now it's time for a nap. More tomorrow!"},

Also met with Lee (the gaffer) and purchased the materials for him to build the annealing kilns, the pick-up kiln and the glory hole. The hotshop will continue to become a reality even as I recuperate. Finally, I put together the last details for the health company awards I need to fuse and etch this week (mostly fuse tomorrow, and Lee will do the actual etching at the blast cabinet for me this weekend). Before I lay me down to sleep I need to touch bases with Morganica about staying with her in Portland the week after next, and I need to get the rest of my BMAC display materials ordered and sent off to Black Cat so Bill can put together our preliminary set-up (again while I recuperate).I am not looking forward to the surgery, but in a perverse way I actually AM looking forward to staying in bed on Wednesday and reading, sleeping, playing a board game or two, watching a movie, just relaxing. I can't think of the last time I stayed in bed all day... Oh wait, yes I can. It was right after Thanksgiving when J and I got that horrible virus and were sick as dogs.

I finished the last of my pinot noir before beginning this post. It was a hard day for me--the hardest in mid-recent memory. I'm almost tempted to run through the blog archives to see what days have been worse, but I'll forbear.Yesterday afternoon I became concerned that my ankle was moving around too much in the boot thingy (mostly at night while I slept), and I called the orthopedist's office where I was treated last week so I could speak to the PA (Physician's Assistant)--the person who actually treated me for my injury to ask him some questions. I was told he no longer works there... Full of a lack of confidence for this particular physician's practice, I spent over an hour this morning trying to get an appointment with an orthopedist in Atlanta. I would have liked to see someone who specialized in treatment of fractures, ankles, sports injuries even, but I was not picky. Was I able to get an appointment with even one doctor out of the many practices I called? Not likely. The earliest I could be seen would be late Friday--and most of them were closer to the 17th of July. Well if I am already concerned that I am irreparably damaging my ankle with the thing-a-ma-jiggie I have on it and the course of action prescribed by the PA, Friday is probably going to be a little too late to do anything to avoid surgery.Fortunately I have my friend Dr. Bill--whom I trust more than any other medical professional I know anyway--who calmed me down this morning, and supported completely my treatment so far. No, I shouldn't be in a cast because my foot and ankle swell a lot and I could develop compartment syndrome. Yes, the foot sloshes around in the boot. It is normal and I am healing. Healing is going to take time--maybe three months. It's going to hurt, sometimes a lot. I may need surgery at the end of it. Put on my big girl panties and deal with it. I felt MUCH better after chatting with him.Then there were sandblast etching travails (why did I commit to doing these awards again?), fusing issues from yesterday's loads, and a host of other petty things that just made my exhausted body Want to curl up and cry. Come to think of it, I did do that a bit this morning before I slapped myself out of it. Everything takes at least twice as long as it should, and even after cutting my commitments and schedule in half, I am still pressed, rushed, behind and tired beyond belief at the end of each day (well, all two of them so far).The evening ended well as Stacy (the friend and former wunder assistant) brought us dinner, served it, opened the wine, listened to my whine--and then cleaned up the kitchen for me! I have SUCH good friends! Christie dropped off a load of garden stakes from Todd this afternoon so I can have Becky pack them up to ship them tomorrow, and on the way over to the studio she grocery shopped for me so I didn't have to get OJ and grape jelly for the J. Dee even made a trek back down today from her studio with more stencils because the ones from yesterday didn't stick right. At this rate, it doesn't take a village, it takes a country!Now I'm going to hie myself off to bed (by 9:30), take a pain pill, read a chapter of The Mousehunter to my daughter, and fall asleep with her as we listen to another of the Magic Treehouse books on her iPod.

Really", "date": "Monday, July 06, 2009", "text": "Nothing to drink--though I was tempted by a glass of wine, the sound of crickets and few stray leftover neighborhood fireworks for music. It was a day. I tried very hard to Be Good and Kind To My Ankle. Last night I made up my firing schedule for the week, and today I cut it in half--and it was still a very tough day.But I am truly blessed with wonderful friends (it takes a village). Becky the Wunder assistant and Dee both came and helped me get the kiln loads in late this afternoon and Dee stayed to help set up the sandblasting equipment in the early evening. It was too hot and humid outside to test it out tonight (and far too late after far too long a day)--and besides that I have to run to Home Depot in the morning for a hose adapter to connect Dee's compressor (kindly on permanent loan to the studio) to the blasting pot. Tomorrow is another day.Mel took J after camp for a playdate and dinner with her daughter Kyla. When she brought J home, she also brought me a dinner of spaghetti and fresh-baked bread. Tomorrow Stacy is making us dinner. At this rate I won't even have to call Zifty (thanks for the tip, Mindy!).Tonight, after a big glass of water and a pain pill, I relax and remember the wondrous week I spent in Linda Ethier's studio in Portland being initiated into the mysteries of lost wax, mold-making and kilncasting of glass. Ahh, those were the good old days. The pre-broken-leg days...There were six of us in the class all with diverse backgrounds, interests and tastes. We spent an intense five days bonding over Liberty wax and plaster silica--oh, and glass too. And let's not forget Cuban lunches at Pambiche across the street from the studio, or the rich exotic chocolates at Alma around the corner and down a couple of blocks... It was a week of dorm living, bus riding, perfect weather, and a slice-out-of-time.Taking a workshop like this is, at its best, a peek into the mind of a master. I could spend months with Linda Ethier and--as open and sharing as she is--I would still only be able to learn a fraction of what she knows about glass casting, mold-making and lost wax. And even with as much as I still don't know and have to learn, at the end of my week I have a piece of which I am already incredibly proud. In addition, I have the beginnings of the knowledge I need to continue my exploration of the technique, and I have my map and compass from my week with Linda to guide me in.Too often you can end up in a class where the instructor is very enthused and energetic about the subject material, but his or her knowledge of it is not much deeper than your own. In those instances the experience is still enjoyable, but it feels almost more like an adventure together to see what lies around the next bend, rather than a journey with a master who knows every rock, creek, and wily raven along the way.I didn't take this workshop with the goal of incorporating a new technique into my production work. I love and respect Linda's work, and Ellen Abbott's, and Delores Taylor's, and Leslie Rowe-Israelson and Melanie Rowe's (Twin Vision Glass), but this is not something I think I could feed my family on. No, I am eagerly looking forward to making more cast pieces (I am particularly interested in casting objects from nature--flowers, shells, bones, what-have-you), and these pieces will be for me. They will be all about the journey--not the destination--and it won't matter if I spend an hour fussing with a leave to get the curl just right. There won't be anyone to care how long it takes but me.Soon I hope to get all the pictures I took from the week up on the web, but for now I present my partners in crime, and snippets of our week. I am trying to lure Linda out to Atlanta to teach a workshop in the spring. Keep your fingers crossed.Pull one sheet of glass out of the crate. Reach as far towards the cutting table as you can and set the sheet of glass against the wall there. Pick up another sheet and repeat the action until you have sufficient glass in the stack (about 5 sheets). Crutch towards the table past the stack of glass until you can just reach the stack of glass behind you. Pick up one sheet of glass and move it as far towards the table as you can reach and set it against the wall there. Repeat all actions until you have moved the entire stack of glass four or five times and it's next to the cutting table...I need a nap. Lucky for me Becky got here before I had to do the whole thing over again!"},
{"title": "Hello From the Apple Store!", "date": "Saturday, July 04, 2009", "text": "Nothing to drink, the chatter of Apple buyers for music. I am so glad it's Saturday, I cannot tell you! It is (by my reckoning) the last day of the week, and, thus, with a new week I have an expectation of New Luck. Tomorrow (the beginning of a happy new week) I shall post a happy post (finally) about my incredibly lovely experience in Linda Ethier's Lost Wax class--complete with photos. But today, today I shall indulge myself in one last ranting bout of piteous whine. Topics? Department stores (and other corporately mired clients), and breakage (yes, the Apple Store at the Mall of Georgia ties into the breakage part of the story...).I was very excited after doing the Dallas Finds show in January that I picked up a department store for a customer. It was a bit daunting (well, more than a bit) to go through their vendor requirement hoops, but I did with an eye to a bright and profitable joint future. The first thing I had to do was to research, acquire, and incorporate into my packing and shipping procedures real UPC codes (not just any barcodes, but real registered individually purchased codes--one for each piece of a different style or color). It was time-consuming, but not too expensive, and I stepped up to the plate. Another \"requirement\" for doing business with this customer was that I use an electronic document interface (EDI) system to receive PO's, send advance shipping notifications, send invoices, and receive electronic deposits for payments. The EDI system is a technological dinosaur. It is large, slow, has very big teeth, and is expensive to feed. I balked, and I was lucky: Because they were used to dealing with other dinosaurs (sloooow moving) I was given 90 days to implement the EDI system so I had a little time to evaluate them as a client and to see if the volume of work they were going to order would merit the volume of work they were going to require. The initial order was nice, but not handstand worthy. A subsequent order (really, the addition of another store to stock the same basic pieces as the other three stores) was nice, but I still wasn't overwhelmed. Part of my reticence in dealing with them came about because it was the Vice President of Home Furnishings and the Director of the Tabletop division who were so excited about carrying my work, but the sales rep assigned to take the order from me, interact with me, and send me ongoing orders was less-than-enthusiastic about it. Call me spoiled, but I like working with people who like my work and see the value in it. He eyed it dubiously and yawned. I bristled.(Please forgive the length and ramble of the post, I have a lot built up and also took a painkiller for my leg so I'm a bit woozy.) Okay, I ship the first order out. It is comprised of 33 pieces split up between two PO's for three stores--one PO for one store through one distribution center and the other PO for two stores through another distribution center. Each of the three stores got 11 pieces in identical sets of three boxes each--same size, same weight, etc. Each store was sent two 12\" bowls, two long rectangular platters, two 10\" square plates, and two 8\" square plates. So far so good, right? Oh heck no!Payment came for the invoice on the PO for the two stores. They claimed that the shipment was short one bowl, one long rectangular platter, one 10\" square plate, and one 8\" square plate and, thus, their payment in commensurately short. I look into it and discover that I had inadvertently not put one of the tracking numbers for the shipment on the invoice. I apologized, and sent the correct documentation. I also point out that the two bowls, two rectangular platters, and four square plates were all shipped in the same box for each store so it was physically impossible for an odd number of pieces to be missing--they were either short 0 or 2--they couldn't be short one of each. A month later I get a form letter telling me they looked into my dispute of the chargeback and, they're sorry, I'm still wrong, the shipment was short, they're not going to pay me. I call. I explain verbally. I fax my documentation again and provide further backup for my assertion that each store got the exact same pieces by showing them the documented weights of each of the three boxes for each of the three stores (nine boxes total in sets of three with identical sizes and weights ERGO identical contents!). It was NOT POSSIBLE for them to be short 50% of the contents of one box and have the box come out weighing the same as the other two boxes in the shipment with identical contents.Another two weeks pass and today I got another form letter telling me they're sorry, I'm still wrong, they're still not paying. I'm done. I will not be implementing the EDI system. I will not be accepting anymore PO's from them. I WILL be writing to the VP, the Director AND my buyer and letting me know how disappointing my experience with them was.Now about the Apple Store. On this blog recently there has been much expression of the sentiment that I need to Slow Down. Maybe the universe enforcing that edict through the sleeping deerhound whom I tripped over and broke my leg earlier in the week. If that is the case, the universe is still talking to the deerhound because today when she was heading outside for her morning ablutions she caught her leg in my laptop's power cord and pulled the laptop off the coffee table onto the floor with a thud. It died with a whimper--the battery was dead and the power cord connection (that I had replaced a couple of months ago) broke (again) so the laptop wouldn't boot up anymore (again). Something in the display was also broken and the screen is very dim. Clearly the universe thought I just wasn't working to capacity with my current laptop.So now I sit at the Apple Store in the Mall of Georgia cloning my old laptop onto new laptop with the help of a borrowed battery. There are three minutes (approx) left in the exchange process (of an hour and a half) and their battery is showing almost dead (redlining). My fingers are crossed that I get everything across!!"},

The toes have been fine all day today--no real numbness or tingling--and I have had no sharp pains or tightness which might indicate a blood clot. I am having pain in my other leg, but that seems to be from muscle fatigue from the right leg having to carry all the weight. In any case, I am being vigilant and pretty much staying off the leg...Thanks for all the Facebook and Blogger concern and wishes everyone!Nothing to drink, nothing to listen to. I must have died. No, wait, I only feel like I'm in purgatory because I have a BROKEN LEG! The first night in the boot was not pleasant. The leg didn't hurt, but the middle toes kept waking me up with their absence and I would have to dangle my foot off the bed for awhile to get the blood flowing again--at least that was my groggy painkiller-filled, half-awake analysis of the situation.I am already in the studio this morning--more to get out of the house (cleaning people) and to turn on the air conditioning for the day than to do any substantive work. All the orders I can push back, I have. I do have two hard deadlines that I will meet (the custom tabletop pieces created to go with the Green and Green exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the award pieces for a health organization's yearly recognition program). I am firing the initial pieces today with help from Becky. I can perch on a stool and cut and layout the pieces then she'll carry them to the kiln. That's the theory anyway,A few days ago I promised pictures of the shaved spaniel. While I was in Portland, Dave took both dogs to the groomer's (a place they had not seen in MONTHS). Baxter the spaniel was so matted that all they could do was shave him. Seraph fared somewhat better, but she would rather I didn't post her picture here. So without further ado I give you Baxter The Wunder Spaniel! Then I'm off to putter some more in my woozy. I have never had painkillers for breakfast before. they're... odd.A last testy note: I am fully aware that the most important thing I have to do over the next ten days is avoid surgery. If I don't stay off my leg, I run the serious risk of having to have a plate and screws put into my ankle--ruining my carefree passage through airport security checkpoints forever and being a major pain in the a--nkle. I will be good!"},

I had big plans for today, but as soon as J brings me my toothpaste from upstairs and a cup of water, I am going to finish my ablutions and head to Urgent Care. Why? Well you might ask! Last night at 11:00 I finally got around to uploading credit cards charges over the phone. In the middle of the entry process I got the low battery beep. I was trying to keep entering numbers while walking down the dark hall to the dark empty office to switch phones. I thought the office floor was clear so I boldly strode across it in the dark, and promptly tripped over the deerhound. She was disgruntled, but I think  unhurt (she didn't yelp anyway).The phone was also ok and so was my call, but my ankle was painful and swelling so I called my spouse in Austin. Between the two of us, we figured it was just wrenched. He thought I should call his mother (a nurse), or my mother (a pharmacist), or Bill (a doctor) as the family's health care professionals. I pooh-poohed the notion, iced it, took a pain reliever left over from my oral surgery four years ago (or was it five?) and went to bed. This morning walking was painful--it took a half hour just to get the garbage and recycling to the curb for the house and the studio)--so I looked up the closest Urgent Care on Google, and off I go!_____________________Back from Urgent Care, I do indeed have a high pain threshold. I broke the fibula cleanly (as you can see from the x-ray. I also broke it in another spot (visible from the top on the other x-ray). Joy. Two kiln loads to get in today.

At least it's a short week--he has Friday off for the fourth of July and so will be home Thursday night.The trip to Portland was fantastic. The conference was stimulating and very informative, and the workshop on lost wax casting has me itching to sculpt some wax and make some molds today--that's if I can wake up. I think I'm still a bit jet-lagged from being on the west coast. It's always harder for me to adjust to the time difference going east. Last night Dave was gently snoring and I was still trying to get to sleep at midnight, and this morning all I want to do is crawl under the covers for another hour or so of sleep. And why not? There are enough people who will surely call me this morning and wake me up in time to go to ikebana, and J is not going to camp this week. Maybe just a little more sleep.

I need a sock.It was an incredible week in Linda Ethier's Lost Wax class following a fabulous conference, but I am ready to be home. Thanks to my hamster dream of the night before last, I decided to bite the bullet and try for standby on last night's red-eye flight to Atlanta instead of waiting till this morning. I called Delta and they said I might be able to get on \"at the discretion of the airport\" as they don't dot do standby anymore. Okay, worth a try, not like I had anything else to do for the evening. Hah.It's $150 fee to change departure dates and the difference in fare from the time you bought the ticket--for me it would have been $575. I turned around and went back to the dorm. Luckily I had decided to try Portland's great public trans and took the trolley and then the train from the dorm to the airport for only $2.30. I got a nice hour-long ride around Portland--I did take a taxi back. Valery (pronounced Wall-air-ee), my lovely taxi driver picked me up again this morning at 4:00 and here I sit.I was disappointed by my failure to get home last night, but by checking my bag today (for which I had already paid) I was able to get in the knives I bought here and carry all the wax I bought from Linda. I also didn't have to futz with a quart-sized bag for all my toiletries (which I ripped when trying to seal its zipper closure last night).Okay, out of battery.

{"title": "It's All About the Journey", "date": "Friday, June 26, 2009", "text": "Tap water in a plastic bottle to drink, \"Harmony\" by Elton John (at long last) on iTunes. I woke up this morning from a horrible dream about a dead, desicated hamster coming back to life. It doesn't take a dream interpreter to tell me it's time to get home to Dave, Jessie, Seraph the deerhound, Baxter the Spaniel, and Tuffy the hamster. But when I do leave Portland, I'll take wonderful memories and both new and deeper old friendships. I hope. After the other night, two of my friends (one old, one new) either still like me or curse my name and spit to the side while making the sign to ward off the eveil eye. It was a good night, and I promised I would take full responsibility for what happened so here we go...Kris from Atlanta and Cindi from Prescott and I all decided to meet for dinner after class on Tuesday. We're all staying the PSU Broadway dorm so when I got off the bus coming from my class at Linda Ethier's studio I headed up to Kris' room for a quick glass of wine and off we hiked to dinner at McCormick & Schmick by the waterfront for a big night out as they each had to catch planes home the next. I say \"hiked\" though the entire distance we were heading downhill. But I'm a worrier. I'm not kidding that it was *all* downhill. First we went one way downhill, then we went another way downhill. So I started fretting about relaxing over dinner with a bit more wine, good food--and the commensurate loss of energy and muscle ambition--and then having to really hike home up hill all the way. It could even snow and we'd lose our shoes! My fretting was compounded by the U shape our journey took. The shortest distance from Point A to Point B is a straight line--not a U.So, dinner. Dinner was sublime. Instead of high-end seafood, I had a burger. And a couple of Negronis. (I can hear people who know me in Atlanta groaning \"Not the Negronis!\"). As it approached the time to leave, I began fretting again. I was, indeed, quite relaxed--some might even say lazy--and I had no interest in a true U-shaped hike. If we were to walk, there must be a more direct, faster, less-effortful path. Kris said no, no. She had walked around a lot down there and there wasn't a better way. It was late, it was dark, and she just wanted to go back the way we had come. Cindi was easy and would go with whatever we decided.The server brought us a map, pointed us in the \"right\" direction, and with much grumbling (that I blithely ignored) from Kris, we headed off into the night. The night got darker. The streets got emptier of both cars and people. I confidently pointed to where we were on the map even though the lettering on it was so small and hidden under the markings for the trolley lines that I couldn't read the street names. Businesses gave way to chain-link-bordered parking lots and dark, weed-covered vacant lots under the looming freeway overpasses. Sidewalks became iffier--first existing only on one side of the street and then only on the other.I don't know when it happened, but somehow we morphed into the characters from the Wizard of Oz. Cindi with her bright strawberry blond hair was walking down the street with her arms pointed straight out to the sides and loosely flapping (Scarecrow or what?), Kris was growling under her breath that this did NOT feel like the right direction (in a voice just like the Cowardly Lion's), so I became the stalwart tin man. We lacked Dorothy--and therefore direction--but we were ultimately saved by a lone trolley driver (dare I say Glinda the Good?) who picked up and informed us that we were down in a deserted waterfront area (no duh) devoid of taxis or any possibility of getting one. He went on to say that after he took a 15-minute break--we were at the end of the line... really--we could ride the trolley back towards PSU and the center of town to within three blocks of our dorm (still uphill, but only three blocks). Or we could call a cab and wait even longer for it to come. We had started at Point C, eaten at Point B, and then I had dragged us to a very nice trolley driver and Point A. Oh dear.Kris took the news well as evidenced by the fact that I am here to write the tale. The surety of my continued existence was close for a moment, but Cindi convinced Kris that jail in Portland was not where she wanted to end up--and Cindi didn't want to have the hassle of bailing her out. I was very apologetic--truly chastened--as it had been entirely my fault that we were lost and would not be back to our rooms (where Cindi and Kris each needed to pack for their flights the next day) till at least 11:30. Kris grudgingly agreed to let me live as long as I posted the events here and took FULL responsibility for our adventure. I happily did so as after 15 minutes of us sitting alone in the empty trolley (the driver went off to take his break in the station) and chatting we were back to being friends. It ended up being all about the journey, and their packing and my work at 5:30 am were things that would happen later."},
{"title": "Awake and Chastised, Though Not Chastened", "date": "Thursday, June 25, 2009", "text": "After being slapped around a bit by Nancy Goodenough ( ;-), I went back to my email and found the aforementioned survey *sent June 19*. In my defense, that was the first full day of BE-Con and reading email from ACRE with a subject line \"ACRE Las Vegas Artist Survey\" was something that I felt could be safely triaged till my return to Atlanta, i.e., I didn't read it then. Had the subject been \"Proposed date for ACRE 2010, your input requested\" or some such, you can be sure I would have read it. I *did* read Nancy V.'s email \"A message from Nancy Vince, President, Wholesalecrafts.com\" that came on 6/8 announcing that the survey would come out later in the month and they wanted our input--no hint of a date change there either. As to reading the boards, I don't, unless Dee gives me a heads up that I need to as she knows what a turtle I am.Final thought, even with the back story and the survey, worrying about what Wendy Rosen is going to do in Vegas is a futile endeavor--it's like an artist obsessing about having their work copied in China.

{"title": "A Change of Plans", "date": "Wednesday, June 24, 2009", "text": "\"Bat Out of Hell\" by Meat Loaf on iTunes, and I may yet open that bottle of sauvignon blanc in my dorm fridge to accompany it. Tonight's post was supposed to be titled \"The Yellow Brick Road Or, It's All About the Journey\". The song was supposed to be \"Harmony\" from Elton John's album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Unfortunately I got two emails from wholesalecrafts.com tonight when I returned from my lost wax casting workshop in Portland that have have completely driven all cosy, happy remembrances of last night's dinner adventure with other out-of-town artists down by Portland's riverside from my mind. I'll have to post about that lovely adventure tomorrow morning (to start my day with happy thoughts). For now I am all wound up and cranky with no way to let it out but here--and I have to do that if I want to sleep and not stew all night.So what were these heinous emails? The first email announced a date change for ACRE 2010 from April 25-27 to June 5-7. The second email requested that I go to their website *by this Friday* and tell them if I'm still planning to do the show. They move the show back a month and a half and want me to notify them within two days if I still would like to do it. Why me? Well, I am one of the artists who already signed up at this year's ACRE show (and paid my deposit) to do next year's show--in large part based on the dates. I did not like this year's show being in June, and I don't feel like the timing helped sales at all--*no one* ordered from me for July. Almost everyone wanted ASAP and in *June*. That's not gonna happen next year.I was all primed and excited about the April dates. Right at the exit to the show in a big banner overhead was a sign that said \"See you for ACRE 2010, April 25-27\". The show management heavily lobbied at the show to get artists to commit and pay in advance for those dates. Then, apparently, they read the post-show surveys and decide June would be a more popular date so a few weeks after the show is over and everyone is back home, they change the dates without even polling the people who paid to see how they felt about it. How does that reward our commitment and loyalty? We put our money up front (again), and, personally, I feel jerked around.Yes, I understand that the date may have been an important topic in the surveys, but the time to address it is for the following year--or at least before getting people to commit and pay based on an announced date. It may seem responsive to react so quickly to the show feedback, but it feels unprofessional when you are on the receiving end of it. Much like feral cats though we may seem, artists have other commitments and real life too. At the very least, the artists who have already paid their deposits and made arrangements to do the show should have been asked how we felt about a proposed change. In comparison, the Rosen Group explored changing the date for their winter show next year to the end of January. They ended up deciding not to, but this would have been a great time for them to make that change as they aren't asking people to get in their contracts for next year till August.But back to ACRE. Yes, if I cancel by Friday, I get my deposit back with no penalty. Would that doing a show like this were that simple! However unintentional it was, I was baited and switched by the change of time. Had I known the real date when I was asked to commit, I would have been better prepared to decide if I wanted to store everything in Vegas again to do the show next year, or if I just wanted to ship it all home and give next year a pass. Now because I have already pre-paid $1000 to store my booth AND I paid the show deposit, I feel very limited in my options.There was a similar waffling around last year resulting in a change in the planned dates and the venue (which hall in the convention center). This year there was also a last minute (or at least after the floor plan and space assignments were announced) mucking about with the floor plan that was very unexpected and disadvantageous to my layout. I chalked it all up to a new show finding its feet and settling down. But then to pull a switch again now...No, I'm not a happy camper."},

I walked in to find Leslie Rowe-Israelson sitting at the bar, and not too long after I sat down with her we were joined by Kris Korn and Cindi Shaffer who wandered in after their class. We had a lively group dinner of $1.50 a plate Japanese delicacies right off the conveyor belt (and some of the best sushi I've had in recent memory). Now I'm back in my dorm room listening to the bass beat from next door (it's a step up from some of the things that wake me up emanating from that room at 3:00 am) and I'm ready to finish up the BECon posts.As Lani said, Morganica has already covered the high points, the low points, and everything in between from BECon  (I was honored to be listed as a high point :-), and that frees me up to expound on an observation I made that led to a theory about the similarity between the professional evolution of someone who works in glass and the taxonomy of the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone. Really. Or I would, but every time I have tried to talk to someone about this (I thought brilliant) conclusion over the past two days, they have looked at me funny and gone off (as quickly as possible) to find something to drink. Huh. So if you want to hear my truly marvelous conclusions, you'll just have to ask me nicely. Or be around me and a glass of wine for more than 10 minutes.So BECon ended with a bang (the ribs out of the lehr were the best I have EVER had--and I've had me some serious BBQ having lived in Austin for six years). I had my day of rest, and today I began my lost wax class with Linda Ethier. Bliss. Just bliss. I did get up at 5:30 this morning to get in three hours of work before class, and I'll likely do the same tomorrow--no rest for the witless. But it's no hardship to rise that early as it is so very light here long before 5:30. I'd forgotten the lovely languid days of the northern summer. More bliss (and cooler than Atlanta right now by a long shot).I made my first lost wax sculpture in 35 years today. It will be... interesting in glass. I console myself with the reminder that the goal in this workshop is not to make High Art. The goal is to work on technique and learn it well enough to create High Art later. Tomorrow we cover our wax with plaster to make a mold and we melt the wax out (hence Lost Wax). Then we'll fill the molds created by burning out the wax with glass and cast them.

Is there something in glass that stunts peoples growth? I am putting lots of names to faces (and bodies) here at BECon, and my almost universal reaction can be summed up in reverse by the first words Alicia Lomne said to me when we met, \"Wow, you're taller than I expected!\". She was definitely MUCH tinier than I expected. And then there was Cynthia Morgan, Morganica, I pictured her as Boadicea--tall, long flowing dark hair like, well, Morgan le Fey. But she's little too! Almost everyone here is way shorter than I expected.Going to get this out of the way right up front--more info on the \"why\" tomorrow: Bullseye is lowering their recommended anneal soak temp from 960 degrees F to 900 degrees F. What a way to get all of our attention and to keep us from dozing off!Today was day 3 of the conference. Many topics have been covered by presenters with very diverse ages, experiences,  backgrounds, levels of happiness, and current life situations. Though I have been fascinated and enthralled by the information on technique, body of work, and artistic process conferred so far, what has struck me most is the universal fit of the presenters into the maiden, mother, and crone taxonomy... Come again? ... And I'm going to wait to finish that thought and topic in tomorrow's post.Today was the last day of the conference and I have a day off tomorrow before my post-conference workshop with Linda Ethier begins. It will be a perfect day to reflect upon and analyze the myriad impressions and monumental data flow that rolled over me during the conference. I'll also have the time to elaborate why I think Howard Ben Tré is the crone personified while Chick Butcher is the perfect representation of the mother.So if I'm not going to post about the conference today, what am I going to post about? Why, about the farmer's market, of course! As I trotted off this morning to the first session--late and harried as usual, I had to pass through an extraordinary and completely unexpected farmer's market. As I had no time to stop on the way, I bolted out the door at our first break and loaded up on pheasant paté, smoked salmon, chevre and other artisanal cheeses, fresh-baked sourdough bread, local (Oregon) raspberries, cherries and tiny strawberries, and fresh butter and cream cheese.Of course then I had the dilemma of how was I going to slice the bread, on what was I going to serve the food, and what beverage would accompany this all-day Sunday feast. The answer to all those questions was found in Safeway where I walked on my lunch break and purchased wine, paper and plastic goods, and a couple of sharp knives (of course I already have a wine opener in my travel case). Tomorrow shapes up to be a very nice day indeed and I have already invited some people over to share my feast!Tonight--as a fitting over-the-top wrap-up party for a conference filled with over-the-top presenters--there is the Bullseye Lehr-B-Q which my spouse will be very sad he is missing. A few years ago he came to me all excited because a company that was head-hunting him (not in the shrunken-head sense of the word) took him to dinner at a restaurant that cooked their steaks in a kiln. Well, Bullseye--as they style themselves \"The company that makes glass at the cutting edge of 17th century technology\"--tonight will serve up chicken and ribs cooked on their 100-foot-long continuous annealer. Look for pics tomorrow--and I'll try not to lose my camera tonight.Normally I would wait to post until I have the entire post done, but this is just too good to wait:Bullseye just announced that they are lowering the recommended anneal soak temp of their glass from 960 degrees to 900 degrees.

I have just under an hour to fully wake up, answer the east coast emails, and get dressed and off to meet friends for breakfast before BECon Day 2. I meant to post first thing this morning, but I got sidetracked by the loss of my camera (left at the Bullseye Gallery last night during the opening reception after three lovely mango, pomegranate mojitos). The camera has been found and will be back in my possession in time to put a pic from the reception up in this post. In the meantime, Haunt Rama (shown at left) has very kindly lent me his Nikon digital SLR to keep up my photographic essay of BECon 2009. Unfortunately he has also inadvertently shown me in graphic detail just how much I have forgotten about SLR cameras in the past 30 years--every one of the pictures I shot with it this morning came out a bit out of focus.The conference so far (the morning sessions of the first full day are over), confirms my initial intuition that whoever put the presenter schedule together is a master of Machiavellian manipulation with a keen understanding of human attention thresholds. Either that or (s)he is the beneficiary of serendipitous karma as the roster so far has been great. In the interest of a manageable post, I am just going to cover yesterday here--today will be covered in tomorrow morning's post.Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm Lani McGregor opened the conference with a calm and moderate presentation of the Bullseye staff, warm welcomes to the attendees and presenters, and no indication of the provocative personalities and viewpoints to follow. After the BECon intros, there were only two presentations before the opening reception at the gallery. But quantity is not everything as the size of the presenter's personalities would have rendered any additional presentations ineffectual--there's only so much free-spirited drama one can absorb in a sitting.The first presentation--educator, kilncaster and artist Richard Whitely of the Canberra School of Art interviewing artist, kilncaster, and educator Clifford Rainey (currently of the California College of the Arts), was a fascinating glimpse into the life and work of an artist who came of age in the 60's, and who has freely created, partied and lived ever since. Neither his appearance nor his persona indicate that he is in his sixties. But his no-prisoners approach in communicating his views on art, contemporary art, his art and his life leave no doubt that he is a man who has done it all--what he wanted, when he wanted, damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead. The presentation was a perfect, voyeuristic slice into the life of an artist--warts and all. It sucked us all (especially the women in the audience) in with the photo of the young, bare-chested artist and his friends on holiday in Greece shown right up on the big screen, equal in importance and weight with the photos of his oeuvre. I just wish I had a copy of the photo from Greece to include here...After Clifford and Richard, with barely enough time to pause for technical changeover in the presentation, we were treated to Janet Koplos and the keynote address for the conference. She propounded great, idiosyncratic views on the evolution of modern art glass and it's shortcomings. She lamented the intense focus on \"art\" rather than on decorative art or studio craft that she believes obsesses the majority of the people working in glass. And she finished with a long, forceful discourse covering examples of current glass work that she finds artistically good or that she believes rely too much on the intrinsic characteristics of glass as a medium to create interest and attraction in the audience. The entire presentation was unabashedly refreshing and rich. She ended up with a resounding comment that she would NOT be taking questions. I thought she was wonderful.Much as I loved it, her presentation was a valuable reminder to me that we can all hear the same thing, but we  hear what we want to hear. While other people I spoke to at the reception later that evening took exception to her valuation of some work paired with her casual dismissal of other work, I was completely focused on the the first quarter of her presentation. When it came right down to it, I really didn't care if she presented a potential contradiction with her critical evaluation of one artist's work as \"heavy\" and her warm approbation of another, purportedly similar, artist's work. Not knowing much of anything about any of the work presented and critiqued, I really couldn't work up the enthusiasm to decide if  she was consistent or logical in her tastes. What mattered to me was that she put craft and the craftsperson on a par with art and the artist. As a studio artist/craftsperson dedicated to creating a high volume of aesthetic, balanced, visually  appealing and tactile work accessible to the masses in terms of both price and volume (and devoid of \"meaning\"), I was *thrilled* to hear an educated member of the art community espousing the virtues of the contemporary \"craft\" scene. And I made sure to tell her so.After the great opening day, we all went to the Bullseye gallery for the opening reception. Yummy food, incredible conversation, the \"Bam\" game, and little to-go boxes replete with salmon, noodles and vegetables and complete with chopsticks--what more could one want? A pic from the reception shown above.Tomorrow: Day 2, cricket on the tennis court, and the maiden, the mother and the crone--the unintentional and yet powerful artistic message from this year's BECon. I am sure there are typos, grammatical inconsistencies, and faux pas in this post, but right now I just want to get it up and am too tired to care anymore about mistakes. Tomorrow will be soon enough to fix them."},
{"title": "I Have Kiln Envy... Not!", "date": "Thursday, June 18, 2009", "text": "Bottled water and the muted sounds of 5:00 am Portland traffic start my first morning of BECon. Yesterday after my flight I caught a cab to Portland State U, picked up my registration materials, dropped my luggage off in my dorm room, and took the Bullseye Studio and Home tour. The evening ended in a happy, solitary dinner of bun (pronouned \"boon\") and Tsing Dao, and bed by 8:30 pm.I miss my own bed and pillow and dreamed restlessly all night. The dream that stuck with me when I woke was that I had just started retailing glass and frit out of my studio and Bullseye changed their frit packaging from plastic tubs to brown paper bags. Yes, I am back in the west where recycling and the environment rule. Who knew that the first topic for the first post of BECon would be toilets? But both at the Portland airport and in my dorm room I encountered a new kind of water conservation toilet that I had neither seen nor even heard of before. They have either two flush buttons or a lever (in the case of the airport) that release different amounts of water depending on which one you push or which direction you move the lever (up or down). There is no picture of the toilets as even I have limits, but they are interesting nonetheless. Juxtapose the toilets of the future with the difficulty in finding public wireless internet access--even for pay, and you encapsulate my first exposure to Portland in over 18 years.But enough of non-glass. The big topic of the day--novel toilets aside--was definitely the Bullseye Home and Studio Tour. And wonderful though the studios we visited and the Bullseye Research and Education facility were, the high point of the tour had to be Lani McGregor and Dan Schwoerer's (Ma and Pa Bullseye to you) home--a monument to glass  you can make in a kiln and incorporate into daily space (referred to by them as a laboratory for living with glass). There are glass stair treads, a glass deck (shown from above and below), glass sinks (who knew you can't fill them with really hot water and then empty them all at once without risking them cracking?), and more glass art than you can shake a stick at. In fact, if I shook a stick in that beautiful house I would most assuredly break something. Not surprising that they don't have a deerhound...The wall piece shown in the photo at the top right is a Klaus Moje comprised of kiln-formed tiles. Next to it is a little Chihuly (I believe the term used was \"made from the runts of the run\") floor piece. See what I mean about not shaking sticks (or deerhound tails)? The Moje could probably take it but the Chihuly would be history.Linda Ethier (no pics of her or her studio as I will be there all next week and have LOTS of photo ops), Deborah Horrell (shown in the photo below or at left depending on your browser window), Lani and Dan, and Ted Sawyer (every wild-eyed, wild-haired inch of him) were all gracious and informative tour guides happy to share both artistic vision and technical knowledge with all eight rounds of visitors throughout the day-long tour. What a way to ramp up for the conference!The big kiln dwarfing Ted Sawyer is one of the Bullseye Research and Education kilns. I initially had a raging case of kiln envy, but then I realized that if I had a kiln that big and fired the really big slabs that they fire in it I wouldn't be able to get them out--the piece in that kiln right now is only three inches thick but it weighs *900 lbs* (and it's one of several--six?, nine? in a series. Oh my aching back!).As the topic of the conference is kilncasting it was only appropriate that Ted share some of the casting techniques they have explored at Bullseye with us. I really like the mold-creation model shown below that has a regular (fairly fragile) plaster mold encased in a refractory cement mold before casting. That's some serious mold.The conference really begins today at noon. Until then I will hang out online and catch up on my own work. V will be very happy to get an updated spreadsheet with all the current outstanding invoices and recent deposits. I got an inquiry last night for 58 glass and steel pieces for a corporate award that I need to follow up on. And if I get bored, I can always harry the hapless Wunder Assistant Becky who is managing extended firing and shipping duties during my absence with aplomb. At least it looks like aplomb from this distance.Post-Post Script: It doesn't mean anything that the only photos I posted of Lani and Dan show the backs of their heads. These are people who move so fast that that might be your only view of them. Faces later..."},

I'm at the Atlanta airport waiting to board my flight to Portland OR and BECon. This will be only my third conference in the past ten years, and I have taken only one other week-long class in 25 years. Can you say excited? While I wait, I will compose the last emails I need to send. I may break down and pay the $8 for connectivity from the airport just so I can get them out today. I land about 10:30 am and then have two hours to collect my baggage, get to Portland State U (I am staying in the dorm housing for the duration of the conference and the post conference workshop), get checked in and drop off my luggage, and trundle to the shuttle stop to catch the bus for the Portland Studio and Home Tour. I don't think I had better count on having time to figure out the vagaries of the network I assume I'll have at PU before the tour. I have been too busy to look up any further schedule info so I have no idea what I'll be doing after the tour ends at 5:30. Uh oh, we're beginning to board and I haven't even started on the emails...

Becky the Wunder Assistant is going to have her hands full.And speaking of the Wunder Assistant, I have worn her out. My needs for help in the studio have grown tremendously in the two years since Stacy started as the first Wunder Assistant and I am now at the point where I need a regularly scheduled person in the studio at least four hours a day. I started posting on this topic first thing yesterday morning and then got carried away by the day. Got to finish up before today takes me over. Whoops, looked at the clock and have a meeting in 15 minutes and I still have to talk to Bill about our upcoming orders and the Dallas June Market that he is kindly attending in my place as I will be in Portland. Then the carpenters arrive, then, then, then--and the day will be lost again. I'm going to cut my losses, put up the post as is and come back to the topic later. Here are yesterday's musings tacked on for good measure:__________________Lefteas Yellow Dog Democrat tropical rooibos in the Washington DC mug, \"All For You\" by Sister Hazel on iTunes. No post Friday 'cause I was just too swamped. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel (don't go to the light!) and I just might come up for air into the light to mangle metaphors yet! Dave just ran J to Circus Camp for another fun-filled week, and I'm off on Wednesday to BECon.Today's big topic: The move to regular employees. I have had wunder assistants for the past couple of years, and Becky (the current incarnation of the WA) has picked up as much as she can, but working for me isn't her life's goal or even a stepping stone on the way to her life's goal--or even a temporary fun thing. I am now at the point where I need a regular half-time glass business groupie. Glass blowing studios get groupies all the time. They have no shortage of people who hang around and are willing to work at anything just for the privilege of hanging out and maybe blowing. Kiln-forming needs more groupies, but we're just not sexy enough.I need someone in the studio at least half-time to answer the phone, prep the kilns, empty the kilns, ship orders (including entering the shipments into UPS), manage inventories... (and I was swallowed by the day)."},

{"title": "The Hot Shop Cometh", "date": "Thursday, June 11, 2009", "text": "I sit and sip the ubiquitous Egyptian licorice tea from the Atlanta mug and listen to George Winston's \"Walking In the Air\" on iTunes. The night has followed the day and the Sprout is newly tucked into my bed listening to the Magic Treehouse audiobook \"Monday With a Mad Genius\" on her new iPod through my iHome clock/radio/iPod dock. I decompress, having just finished getting the last kiln load in at 9:15 pm. It was a full, rich day--many papers were slain.The building inspection for the new hot shop in the back of the studio passed this morning with flying colors. The inspector especially liked the use of the sides from the Bullseye crates (also ubiquitous around here after 20+ years of squirreling them away--you can only use so many to hold your sheet glass!) for the gables. The picnic table has been nice to sit at and plan, dream, and scheme, but I fear it must be relegated to back under the water oak tomorrow when we unload the truck full of goodies from New Mexico. By next week when I leave for BECon I expect it all to be rug bug snug in there (or at least sided sufficiently to keep out the water).I am in raptures over the design of the building itself. I love the proportions and the height of the roofs (wouldn't you expect that plural to be rooves like hooves? But no...). Even though it is basically just a metal-roofed pole barn or carport, it has an open, soaring, rustic woods architectural feel that makes me happy every time I see it. I love the screened openings in the top that will maximize ventilation and the escape of the hot air while minimizing the entry of rain, leaves and debris.For the sides, we are planning metal along the back and the two short sides off of it, and a half-height wall (again from recycled Bullseye crate material) continuing along the long sides topped off by chain link up to the gables. The side closest to the studio will have a six-foot chain link gate in it to facilitate passage back and forth to the studio. Finally, the front will have some sort of full chain link gates that can be completely opened to double the already spacious 280 sq foot of open-floor work space (the entire footprint is 400 sq ft with the back raised concrete area allocated to the electric glass furnace, the pick-up kiln, the glory hole, the pipe warmer and the two planned annealing kilns). This way, on nice days we can put a bench outside and work there, or have more room for demos and classes.Now I best hie myself off to bed. Big day tomorrow--not only do we unload the truck of hot glass equipment but I also get a big delivery of glass from Bullseye!"},
{"title": "To New Mexico and Freedom!", "date": "Wednesday, June 10, 2009", "text": "Had some lovely Egyptian licorice tea earlier this morning, listening to \"Long Time Comin' \" by Bruce Springsteen on iTunes now. Some things have been a long time coming, some still are a long time coming with no resolution in sight--and this includes a purported shortage on one of the orders I sent to my new department store. They are refusing to pay for four pieces from my first order because they say they weren't in the box... As each piece \"missing\" was one of a pair, and all four pairs were packed in the same box, and that box had the same contents, size and weight of two other boxes in the shipment that weren't short... it doesn't take a math genius to see they made a mistake. But math genius or no, in every corporate setting you deal with the lowest common denominator, i.e., not the sharpest crayon in the box.But enough kvetching. I harken back this morning to my lovely sojourn on David and Sara's 100 acre New Mexico ranch outside of Magdalena. As previously reported, ACRE sucked every spark of life from my soul and my marrow. I arrived in NM a veritable husk of a woman. Sadly I only got to spend one night there, but I was sufficiently rejuvenated by that night to be able to forge on home the following day in a 16 ft rental truck loaded with hot glass equipment (and glass).Sara and David feted and feasted me--and David's green chili and cheese apple crisp after Sara's dilled salmon on rice were feasting indeed. I stocked for the road with David's homemade bread in the form of nut butter (peanut in one, almond in the other, yum), banana and honey sandwiches and fresh, cool well water.Being from the west myself, I envy them their locale, their isolation, their population paucity, and their climate. I love the can-do spirit of the westerner, completely lacking in the notion of entitlement. And then there's the natural beauty. Maybe my mother is right and we should move to Albuquerque (she's convinced Dave and I only move to places that begin with 'A'--Aurora, Austin, Atlanta...). Then again, that would have been a better decision BEFORE moving all the hot shop equipment out here.Sara and David's home is a 100 year-old ranch house nestled between a couple of mountains (one of them shown above), and it was built by Mark Twain's cousin in 1910. It is a beautiful, single-story, small, rambling, stone house that I nonetheless managed to get lost in twice during my stay--and that was after they kindly provided me with a flashlight to help me find my way to the bathroom in the middle of the night!In addition to the main house, there are several outbuildings made from wood or adobe that contain the contents of every packrat's dream. David and I are much alike--as witnessed by the fact that one of the things I brought back in the truck is an old home-made lapidary saw that looks like a gas barbecue and  was full of old rat nestings. It was a treasure to David at one time, now it's a treasure to me--though I have no idea what I'm going to use it for. But it's a cool tool. I must need it (and have a place for it).The load-up was assisted by several of their friends--including one man with a \"cherry picker\" winch lift thingie that was used to get the heaviest pieces (the glass furnace, one of the cases of glass, and the big wet-belt sander) up and into the truck. The rest was loaded in by hand--thankfully most of it not by me as I have all the unloading left to do this Friday--and took no time at all. I took pictures of the crew and some of the loading, I wish I could remember everyone's names, but I was just too exhausted to process.Before (and even after) my trip, several people asked me why I just didn't have everything shipped out from NM instead of driving it. But half the fun of the process was going through Sara and David's years of accumulated tools and materials and admiring that which they wanted to keep and squirreling into the truck that which they could give up.After I left Sara and David's place a little after noon on Thursday, I drove to Socorro (between Magadalena and Albuquerque) and stopped at the local WalMArt for some fresh fruit, an iPod adapter for the the truck (so I could listen to my audiobook on the way home) and a small Garmin GPS. What a great purchase that was! Instead of continuing on up to Albuquerque, the GPS sent me south and then off east on a two-lane highway through the stark New Mexico countryside and on to Brownsville and Abilene Texas. The route saved me several hours and a few hundred miles and ensured that getting home Friday was possible.I took a couple of pictures from the moving truck, this one of the road shows the heavy rush-hour traffic I had to navigate on Thursday afternoon. The road looked the same behind me as it did in front. Wow.I also got to go through Roswell, but sadly, I had no time to stop and hunt for stored aliens. I did, however, see this sign as I was going through town. Maybe next time I take a trip to NM I'll go with D and the J and we can stop in to do some research.Now back to glass. Tomorrow: The hot shop!"},
{"title": "Back in the Saddle Again (Almost)", "date": "Tuesday, June 09, 2009", "text": "Chai Rooibos tea with milk in the San Francisco mug, \"Across 110th Street\" by Bobby Womack on iTunes. I struggle to insert myself back into my work routine and flow after almost two weeks of show and on the road. The easiest way to do it is probably just to jump in and review ACRE.Set-up, as I indicated previously, was the most brutal set-up I've ever done, and I am pretty sure it was also Elaine, Bill and Todd's worst. We thought the plan would make everything better and faster, and it didn't. We had to adapt the plan because what looked good on paper didn't look good on the floor in terms of wall length and walk space, and then we had to adapt it again because the shorter walls either meant less work shown or more crowded work. We opted for more crowded--though that is hardly a fair description of it as it turned out not to be crowded at all.I was so concerned with going for a high-end gallery look that I think we actually ended up with too little work in the booth--and we certainly had too little glass. I thought one representative piece of each size and one representative piece of each color would be enough and it really wasn't't. For the most part, if they don't see it, they don't buy (order) it. So back to the drawing board for the August Rosen show booth layout and piece count. If I'm lucky, the drawing board will be at Bill and Elaine's beach house for a weekend. That would be sweet.Now to the show itself. As usual, the Wholesalecrafts.com staff was friendly, helpful, energetic and accommodating. As decidedly NOT per usual the Champion staff (their contracted union employees really) was difficult, argumentative and territorial (at least about electricity). In retrospect I can see that the union workers at the convention center are having a tough time (like the rest of us). Shows there are down so there is less work for them and unfortunately, as a result they are passing the squeeze on downstream to people who can afford it no more (and quite possibly less) than they can.To cut through the obscurity of the last paragraph, I had a very pissy encounter with a union electrician who told me in so many words that I was using too much power and in not so many words that I clearly couldn't know what I was doing or how to calculate electrical load for the cords, surge protectors and breaker boxes. Had Bill not peeled me off of him, he would have made a nice midday snack comprised of teeny tiny bites. In point of fact Champion had shorted us (our two booths) 2000 watts of service and shorted the other people on our electrical panel another 500 watts. When we finally got a reasonable person to work with we got that message across and Champion quickly fixed the problem.Had the problem been resolved and nothing more came out of it, I might not even have mentioned it here. The temperature was hot, tempers were hot, nerves were frayed, words were said. Put on your big girl panties and move on. But the electrical saga did not end there. The first electrician I dealt with came up to me as we were breaking down and very cordially informed me that next year the electrical rules were going to be enforced and I needed to read the fine print in my contract which says we can only put up three spot lights and installation of the rest of the lighting--including all track lights and additional spots--must be done by a union electrician. He said the rules had been ignored for the past couple of years, but now they were going to be enforced.I hope the electrician was wrong because the several hundred dollars union electricians' labor would add to my booth fee would be the straw that broke the camel's back. My sales this year were down almost 75% from last year already. It was, at best, a break-even show for me in terms of orders at the show and I cannot afford to be squeezed by an electrical union that sees their pie shrinking from fewer, smaller shows. When I am more rested and a little time has passed so I can recount calmly and with less ire, I will bring the above conversation to the attention of Nancy Vince of Wholesale Crafts to see what her take on it is.And that was ACRE. The aisles were pretty empty for much of the show. Tuesday was a complete waste. It was a continuation of the downward slide begun (for me) at last summer's Buyer's Market show. Am I doing it again next year? Yes. I have signed up and committed. I still see value in a good west coast show--and this show is as good as any and better than most.The bigger question is, what is the role of large wholesale shows in today's market? This question has been pertinent for some time now, but it is really coming to prominence with the concomitant decline in the economy. This year I tried expanding into new shows and potentially new markets with the Atlanta and Dallas shows, and I considered adding the New York Gift Show and the Beckman's show in Chicago (now run by the great staff at the Merchandise Mart who also run the One of a kind Show) for next year. Halfway through the calendar year and 80% of the way through the current show schedule I have decided that shows are not the way for me. I will keep ACRE and the BMAC, but I am not going to add any more and I probably won't do either Atlanta or Dallas either. Next year I will attend the Dallas show just because I have the showroom contract that goes through January, but I won't take a booth again.So what will replace shows? For me, initially, it will be advertising, better online and on cd catalogs, and a better viewing and ordering system for my wholesale buyers on my website. The Wholesalecrafts.com interface is still just too difficult to modify and keep current for me to use it as my primary sales interface.Now I had better get to work. Orders to enter, fire and fill. The roof goes on the hotshop today and the concrete curb and a bit of slab fill-in work gets done. Tomorrow, New Mexico in review (with photos!)."},

I finally got some sleep last night (fell asleep right after room service penne alfredo with chicken in the middle of watching Sahara on tv). The show doesn't start till 10:00 this morning and we're done setting up so we don't have to be there early, but I've still been up since 6:30. Talked to Dan the carpenter last night and he gave me the lumber list for the hot shop. I called it in to Home Depot this morning and it's set for delivery this afternoon. Becky the Wunder Assistant's boyfriend Kem is going to help with the building and he's going to be there this afternoon to take the delivery and get the materials stored. When I get home the end of the week, the posts and roof should be up!Now about ACRE. Can you say worst set-up ever? Bill and I got on each other's very last nerve (oh, let's be honest--I got on EVERYONE's last nerve, Todd and Elaine were just too polite to say anything... much). Note to self: after over a month with only one or two cups of coffee, a large dark roast with an extra shot of espresso is NOT a good thing. My legs were tingling by noon from all the caffeine and I was, well, the only word for it is bossy. And set-up took over 24 hours. Day one we were allowed to start at 2:00 pm, but because of car issues we didn't get there and going till 3:00 pm. By mutual agreement we quit at 8:00 pm, and were back on the floor by about 8:00 am (a little earlier). We didn't leave till almost 1:00 am. I got up at 5:30 am to work on my price lists and other show materials (I had to update everything with all the new work). Then we got to the show at 8:00 am and continued setting up for another two hours. Then the people came and I didn't get all the work labeled with pricing till 3:30 pm. Oy.Orders were good today--a customer from last year who bought a lot of our work and took it with him after the show placed the same kind of order today for this year. The new Cloudstone work is being very well-received, though I haven't sold any of it yet."},

It's the first full day of set-up--yesterday we started at 3:00 pm and quit at 8:00 pm with the gridwalls and foamcore up and the foamcore seams taped. Today we follow our carefully wrought (or is that \"fraught\"?) plan for putting up all the artwork. We already hit two snags to the plan yesterday. First we didn't have as many gridwall sections stored here as we thought. Oops. We were four panels (or eight linear feet) short. We came up with a work-around for the shortage (1/4\" plywood panels that we use to pack the foamcore in the shipping crate) but then we decided that the walking flow was too restricted if we put them all up. In the end we cut four linear feet (32 square feet) from our display. There was spirited discussion on whether we also needed to cut the amount of work displayed so it wouldn't look jammed in, and the final decision was to try the current amount of work and see.Dinner was at Benihana's in the hotel. We ordered at 9:00 pm (sorry Dee, I really did think I'd be asleep by then). I happily slurped gin slings from my little porcelain Hotei, and realized that I had finally become Spanish without going back to Spain: It may have been 9:00 in Las Vegas, but my body was still on Atlanta time, and it was midnight there and I had been up since 5:00 am! Didn't mar my enjoyment of the evening, though I was a zombie by the time we stumbled up to our rooms at 10:00.Now it's time to get ready to head out for another day of excitement. I managed to sleep till 5:30 am (8:30 at home), but then I had to get up and forge into the day. I think I'll rub my little Budai's belly for luck and prosperity and head off to the show!"},

As I have already been utzed, it's Wednesday (late Wednesday) and there has been no post. Pity me. I spent the day at the office of building permits to get a permit for the new studio hotshop. Line outs, and try agains, and barely getting through, Oh My! On the plus side, after seven straight hours, I got the permit approved. On the minus side, I have to go back tomorrow morning because the approval came too late in the day for it to be typed into the system and paid for, i.e., permitted.Yesterday saw the first big melt firing in Bettina--screens and pots and combos, a glorious profusion of flowing glass. The kiln was just now cool enough for me to open it and take out the pieces--and most of the pieces stuck to the shelf and cracked. I have always used Hot Line Hi-Fire Primer whenever I have used kiln wash but the latest batch I have has bubbled and flaked badly as it dried--even before I fired it. So I was leery about using it for this load and used Thinfire instead. Mistake. I had the feeling that Thinfire wasn't made to withstand 1650 degrees F for 90 minutes AND flowing glass, and I was right. I'm glad I wasn't using a vermiculite shelf or it would have been ruined. The Dyson shelf looks like I'll need to rub the surface down a bit, but I think it will be fine.Tonight I'm doing a flow out (and back together) fuse of all the pieces I can salvage from the load in Bertha. Tomorrow I'll see if a little coldworking pre-slump will fix them up enough to take to Vegas.Last news of the night: Both the storage unit in Vegas (where I had all the breakage reported last week) and UPS (for the two big panels I shipped to Omaha that were smashed in transit) are going to pay for all damages. Whew! That was almost $2,000 of work lost that I really can't afford to shrug and walk away from.So the day had ups and downs. I got the Sprout to bed, and now I'm off to clean the kitchen, put away dinner (Melton's buffalo chicken with chipotle blue cheese dressing and fries), take a shower and crash. Tomorrow is set to be an even bigger, busier day, and then off to Vegas!"},

Poor Jessie, she has a revolving door for parents right now!The glass order is in to Bullseye, the last work for ACRE goes in the kiln today (I'm carrying the rest on the plane), and I hope to get the hot shop permitted tomorrow before picking up all the equipment in Albuquerque. If all goes right, the construction will commence next week while I'm in Vegas. Not too long after Vegas and Albuquerque I go to Portland Oregon for BECon (kilncasting) and a workshop on lost wax casting from Linda Ethier. A week after I get back from BECon I have my summer camp, Faces of Culture: Masks In Glass. Right now I only have two participants signed up for it (it's the week after July 4th), and they are both winners of their spots from the Waldorf auction. Not surprising since I haven't even made flyers or announced it officially yet...From 2 am on today I have been having anxiety attacks about whether or not I can really afford all this expansion and do I have the time to pull everything off. Today would be a good day to meditate. Instead, I take a deep, calming breath and remind myself that the natural condition of a glass artisan is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. So what do we do? Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery.Now off to fire."},

Off to Commerce today to take a load of glass for little stands to Bill of Black Cat and to get a stand and a mold from him for a larger version of the new \"Primitive\" piece. Today marks a turning point in our working together. Up to now the flow of work has been almost entirely towards me: I get orders for glass and metal pieces from my customers, and I order the metal from Black Cat. Today is the first time Black Cat has had a significant number of orders from THEIR customers for glass and metal work so that the meeting to exchange work is more for me to give them glass (and get money, whoo hoo) than for them to give me metal (and get money from me). It is good. I think the surge in orders from their customers reflects the new sweet spot price point we hit with the small stand pieces at the Buyer's Market this spring. Can't wait to see what the reaction at ACRE is to the slightly larger pieces (retail points for the existing small and the two new sizes of tabletop sculptural pieces: $80, $120, and $160).Also new for ACRE this spring will be wall and tabletop bud vases from Bentwell Metals and Siyeh Studio. Todd has designed a series of wire and glass wrapped test-tube bud vases for the under $40 market that nicely complement the wire people, trees, ornaments, key chains, garden stakes and royal whimsy (crowns and sceptres) in our current offering.Yesterday's shipping of the pallet to Vegas went off without a hitch, but I was unable to find a doable price to freight replacement panels out to the gallery in Omaha for next week. The best offer I got was $250--down from $395--to carry the two of them in a small standing wooden crate. The original shipping charges with UPS were $62 for the two of them in separate boxes. Of course UPS also broke them and I can't WAIT till they deny my claim on them for insufficient packaging. There is just no way I can see coming out of this situation with them gracefully and apologetically handing over $1,000. But, as Todd's mother would say, I need to put that thought in the bucket of can't do-anything-about-it's and throw the bucket away. I'll call the gallery this morning and give them the bad news about the replacements, and I'll refund their money.So that's today. I still haven't fired the new technique load yet (I'll be hand-carrying the pieces to Vegas so I'm not in such a rush to get them done). It is taking a long time to get the kiln all set-up for this first time. I expect it'll be faster in the future. It better be or I won't be able to sell the pieces for what I need to charge for them!Have a good weekend all. Remember those who have left us and take comfort in those still here."},

I hope it's not a prophetic song for the day--I feel more ahead of the curve than iTunes choice of songs would imply.I'm in the studio already this morning getting the pallet of my work prepared to be picked up and shipped to Vegas for ACRE. So many things can go wrong from here. It could be lost, dropped, delayed, crushed--just to name a few. There is nothing new to this scenario--it's always like that when you ship to a show. But today I am feeling more pessimistic and caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand (the chosen hand, the rock) I can ship everything palletized together to minimize loss. On the other hand (the hard place), I can ship all boxes regular UPS and hope they don't get lost, delayed, or broken (or some awful combination of the above). Putting everything together both diminishes and maximizes damage potential (isn't physics funny that way?). It's one BIG package so the freight workers have to work harder to drop it (as opposed to UPS who would cheerfully throw each and every package whilst loading and potentially drop one in four or so--and that's being generous about their care and respect). But if it is dropped off of or rammed by a forkift by the freight company (UPS usually just damages by gravity) the potential for catastrophic large-scale damage to EVERYTHING is much greater. Which is safer? I guess I'll just stick with the freight company because they are scheduled and on their way.________________________________So Becky came this morning, we packed, palletized and conquered--and I even ran to the shipping supply place and got a poly strap tape kit so we could strap everything to the pallet before we shrink-wrapped it. In the midst of the packing the woman from the gallery in Omaha called and said that two of the three 24\" X 30\" glass panels I just shipped her arrived broken. One was completely smashed, and the other was broken in half.I should have known UPS would have their revenge on me for insisting the driver (NOT my usual driver) make the pick-up I had scheduled and not get away with saying he couldn't make it. Friday night at 8:30 he had to lug a million lbs of glass and tradeshow display materials boxes (Dee shipped from here Friday too) to the truck when he was only expecting two boxes of about 35 lbs total. What can I say? I had more time to get more stuff out for him when he was late.I got the insurance claim filed and now I have to figure out how to get the replacement panels out there without having them broken too (if the client's even willing to give me another chance). A crate would be safest, but the client didn't want the added expense. I thought they'd be fine in heavy-duty cardboard boxes--but those are really big panels. Even with 1-1/4\" of Styrofoam sheeting on each side and then 4\" of bubble wrap on all four sides and 6\" of bubblewrap on each end UPS *still* broke them. What a headache, and boy am I glad I didn't go to New Mexico this week! I can't imagine having to juggle the breakage from storage and now the UPS breakage while on the road. (And what numbers of breakage are these in this series? If things come in threes these are either one and two or two and three... I hope they're two and three!)Speaking of New Mexico, Nancy, I will talk to you at ACRE about the new pieces, their pricing and the gaffers. It's all still in process right now. I am being FLEXIBLE, letting it all flow together, and hoping it doesn't come back to bite me in the behind (especially the whole pricing thing--what I paid in total to create these pieces may put them at a higher price point than they can support).Time to go fire a New Technique load. Also need to call the Omaha gallery back and discuss where they want to go from here (the installation day for the pieces is supposed to be TOMORROW). If she does want me to remake them, it looks like I might have to do a little firing this weekend after all so they can be ready to ship by Monday (they are made with a frit that devitrifies badly so I'll need to do two firings on them--one to fuse and one to correct the surface with overspray)."},

Maybe I should have stuck to decaffeinated as the adrenaline and pain continue to shudder through my body and I know I'm going to be seriously stiff later.This morning before beginning my post I ran over to the studio to get the three new Cloudstone pieces  that I am debuting at ACRE to photograph and post. I ground the majority of the punties off on my flat lap (I'll do the rest on Licha's lathe later this morning) and decided to bring everything back to the house to photograph. Arms full of glass, juggling the camera, keys and coffee cup full of steaming goodness I head across the yards to home. I am daydreaming about names for these gorgeous new pieces as I start up the deck stairs... and trip, sprawling.The glass is, apparently, well-annealed and very sturdy. I have a lump under my chin where one piece hit me on the way down, my knee is swelling from a very hard knock on the stairs and I lost 6/7 of my coffee, but nothing broke. Whew. Dave has since requested that I carry no more than two glass pieces at a time. I shakily get enverything the rest of the way p the stairs (in two trips) and I photograph the pieces with wobbly hands.Today I try a super-secret new technique that I have never seen or heard of done before--simple though it is and vast though the world of kiln-formed glass experimenters is. Individual techniques have all been tried (there is nothing new under the sun) but combinatory techniques, ahh I think I may be trying something quite original. It's never too soon to work on a Niche piece!Okay, that's enough good and happy news (except for the fall--it wasn't good or happy as I'm not into pain). Back to the saga of the crate of my work that was dropped last year while in the custody of the storage facility in Las Vegas. The work that I need for the ACRE show at the end of next week...Yesterday I compared the pictures I took of my ACRE booth last year with the pictures the storage company  took of the pieces they unpacked from my crate this week to determine how much broke. A disturbing pattern emerged: there are NO rectangular platters in their photos. I called just to make sure they hadn't missed sending me a photo (they took the pictures as they unloaded each plastic tub of work so each picture shows groupings of like pieces). They hadn't. So there is an *entire box* of my work broken and missing, or at least missing.I tried to ask some gentle questions as to how something like this could have happened a year ago and I am only just now being notified, but the person of whom I need to ask these questions is not in the office this week (or is hiding under his desk follishly hoping I'll go away). If it was my employee who had a dropped a case of glass art I was storing for a customer and I was not in the office, I would make damn sure I was available by cell phone for a conversation with said customer who has every right to be really freaked out and vociferously unhappy at being informed at the eleventh hour that an unknown quantity of her work was destroyed *a year ago* and she is just now being told.I have been *very* calm, *very* nice, and *more than very* understanding with the two people at the facility with whom I have been able to speak about the Unfortunate Occurrence (the administrative assistant and the warehouse manager) because I do not believe them to have been at fault for any of this mess. But I am at the end of my patience with the facility manager who has not even called me to express his dismay and sincere desire to make things right for me in the wake of this Calamitous Disaster. A whole box of pieces gone! The \"goneness\" implies someone opened the crate and removed it *last year* when they dropped the crate! Outrageous! (I begin to froth...)The information I did get from the administrative assistant and the warehouse manager also implied that the facility manager was aware of both the dropping incident and the breakage. (I continue to get *very* worked up about the situation--hyperventilation might occur). There will be a reckoning. There will be a bill. Heaven help them if they don't make me VERY happy next week when the facility manager is back in the office."},

The pieces for the classic bowl were there, and some of the lattice pieces that should have been there weren't so that breakage was obvious. To see what else is missing I'll have to go through my piece list from last year and my sales list to see what was purchased and what is missing.I'm glad I didn't go to New Mexico today.

About a half hour after I changed all my trip plans and posted, I got the following email from my storage facility in Vegas:\"Hello Brenda: It has come to our attention as we were pulling your booth to prepare for outbound to the advance warehouse that last year one of our guys had dropped the brown & black plastic case and had disposed of some broken glass.  We were told that it was not much, but we just now learned of this.  Should we re-open the case and maybe you might know what is missing so we can make some kind of restitution?   So sorry for this inconvenience.\"The black and brown case is the plastic shipping crate that holds all of my work for storage. The other crates have the metal art, the pedestals and other display materials--basically then non-breakable stuff. How much more exciting can my week get?!?Mighty Leaf green tea tropical in a blue NJ & IBM (Perfect Together) mug, traditional southern blues with slide guitar for music. It's a Kavarna Day! Dave wanted to get out of the house to work this morning and I got my three kiln loads in late yesterday (the last one at 10 pm) so I accompanied him as I have plenty of time to get caught up on non-production glass business work while the kilns cool.Yesterday I started the day at Duckbill Studios again doing the last four of the new Cloudstone roll-up pieces for ACRE. It went great--Lee came to help too so we were able to get all four pieces done in four hours. The rest of the day didn't go so well. When I got home from Duckbill I looked up transit times for UPS to get my work to Vegas for ACRE. Memorial Day really throws a monkey wrench in the works and the shipping deadline for everything to arrive in Vegas in time for the show is this Thursday! Thursday I will be on the way back from New Mexico with a truck load of hot glass studio equipment... What to do? I hadn't even started firing yet--heck, I didn't even have the firing schedule done to start the firing. I frantically added up the number of pieces I had to do, the kiln room I had in which to do them, and the number of firings they needed... and it wasn't physically possible to do it all by Thursday AND go to New Mexico from Tuesday through Thursday. I would have to change the New Mexico trip.Note to fellow Delta Airline fliers: If you get a reasonably-priced ticket from them don't even THINK about changing it. They have a $150 fee to make any changes to a reservation including cancelling it and applying the price of your ticket to another flight. My ticket to NM only cost $145. I would have lost money ($5) if I tried to apply the money I paid for that ticket to another flight. I thought I could maybe switch my return flight from ACRE to put me in Albuquerque instead of Atlanta and apply the price of the current Albuquerque ticket to the changes... I was told it would cost me $260 AFTER they applied my credit. Nope. Couldn't do that.Tried a couple of other permutations--rent a car in Vegas and drive to Albuquerque after ACRE, rent the truck in Vegas after ACRE and drive to Albuquerque and then on to Atlanta, keep the Albuquerque trip but drive to Vegas in the minivan and carry the work instead of shipping it UPS, ship everything 3-Day Select with UPS next Tuesday (in a week)--but all of them were over $250 of additional cost in money and considerably more in terms of time and strain on me. Okay, had to to make it work as originally planned.The first thing I would need to do to make it all work with the original timeline was to work around the pieces I had to make. By changing the colors I had picked to colors of pieces already made (either in Vegas from last year or in the studio) I was able to cut the firings down to yesterday and today. That would still leave all the packing and shipping of them, and maybe some grinding and a correction firing for size. Hmmm. I don't have a clone, but...Enter (unbeknownst to her) Becky The Wunder Assistant! I rejiggered my calculations so that she would do all the shipping for me on Thursday and maybe the one correction firing  on Tuesday. She would also have to unload the kiln Tuesday and ship the pieces in it that are due in Seattle by the end of the week. After thinking long and hard about my level of confidence in her and the increased responsibilities I am proposing asking of her, I decided it's time to give her a raise. Problems solved. (Lucky for me she doesn't read my blog so I would get to surprise her today with all this news in person :-).So this morning I begin my post in Kavarna with all my problems adequately if not optimally solved, and every intention of chronicling the saga of my difficulties here and moving on. But then I decide to check just one more thing... I look at Delta for the cost of a one-way ticket from Vegas to Albuquerque on June 3, and it's $109. Oh boy, new dilemma. I asked Dave which absence he would prefer and he didn't care--they would be equally difficult. So I called Sara and David (in New Mexico) and asked them which would be better for them. Were they ready for tomorrow or could they use a couple more weeks to pull more stuff together? They didn't care either but thought it would be better for me to come in June. So I changed my plans! I got a new plane reservation, changed my truck rental date, and now can do everything myself that I was going to off-load on Becky (including picking up the roll-up pieces I did at Duckbill that won't be ready till tomorrow).But not going tomorrow I'll have time to grind the punties off the roll-ups and ship them to Vegas instead of carrying them on the plane. I'll also be able to do the remaining Cloudstone pieces tomorrow and ship them, AND I can do a load of small stand pieces for Black Cat Artworks and get it to them on Friday in time for their orders. Productivity ahoy!I'll still give Becky the raise though. :-)"},

I ran like a hamster in a wheel all day and finally got the kiln load in at 9:30 last night for the second day in a row. Poor Jessie. Her bedtime is 8:30 and I'm dragging her over to the studio right about then every night for another hour of work.Next week I am off to New Mexico to pick up a glass furnace, a glass crusher, a wetbelt sander, a major burner, and various punties, rods and other hot-working tools. I got a great cheap airline ticket, but renting the UHaul there to drive everything home was going to cost almost $1,000. Whoa. When I mentioned the cost to Bill the other day he said why not rent a truck from Penske instead. That's who he rented from to drive our last big load up to the Rosen show and he said the trucks are new, very comfortable, and much cheaper. Sure enough, I got a Penske business rental on a 12' truck for right at $400 for unlimited mileage and a week's rental. That helps.The plan for the hotshop is at the drafter's being drawn up so I can get the building permit. I would like to take it in to get it permitted on Monday before I leave for NM, but I'm not sure it'll be ready by then. Also not sure when Dan, Lee and the rest of the crew can work on it. The good news is that with a complete plan I don't need to be there during the building.Today I have several pieces to drop off at the Oakhurst Community gardens for their Martinis in the Garden and Auction event tomorrow night. We're not only donating, we're also attending, yum! I hope to be offering several classes through the gardens next year in my studio--birdbaths, windchimes, and garden stakes, just to name a few--so this will be a good networking social event.ACRE is in two weeks and I have to get my exposition services ordered today (it's just electric so it will be easy) and I also have to make my piece list and firing schedule based on the booth layout we did in Greenville earlier this week. It's going to be tight to get everything done with the trip to New Mexico taking up three days as it all has to be shipped out to Vegas which also takes time.Today I do the big Cloudstone load (which obviously did not go in yesterday) for functional pieces for ACRE, glass and metal pieces for ACRE and for roll-up pieces for this Sunday. Today is also a ship day for four orders. And speaking of orders, the three 24\" X 30\" panels need to have their hardware mounted and ship out today too. Good grief, could I have any more going on at once? Good thing I'm detoxed and stress-free!Juggle, juggle, juggle, hustle, hustle, hustle. Better get to it!"},
{"title": "Did You Miss Me?", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2009", "text": "Egyptian licorice tea in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Desperados Under the Eaves\" by Warren Zevon on iTunes. Wow is it late! This isn't the first-cup-of-the-morning tea (that was Mayan Cocoa Spice) this is the after-lunch tea. The morning was consumed with a variety of tasks--most of them not glass-related--but I don't feel too guilty as I finished firing in the studio last night at 9:30.I picked my latest pieces up from Duckbill Studios yesterday and it is apparent from them that the Morceaux de Verre transparent style is just not going to work. Both pieces show a very clear seam line which is not in itself bad, but at first glance it looks like a crack. The melt piece turned out *gorgeous* except for the punty spot on the bottom. For this one piece, instead of the punty leaving a bit of itself behind at break-off, it took out a chunk of the piece rendering it unfixable and unsaleable. I wasn't planning on selling it anyway, but getting it blown was expensive and I am disappointed that after all that (and the time hassle last weekend) it was ruined. Guess we were just too rushed and too tired at the end of a long blowing day.For this weekend I'll have four more pieces in Cloudstone (screen and pot melts) to blow and those four (fingers crossed) and the one shown here will be the core of the Cloudstone roll-up series I'll debut at ACRE. Roll-up pieces won't be all I have in Cloudstone for this show either. I launched the series a couple of years ago but never really went anywhere with it because the metal work with Black Cat ArtWorks was really taking off then and I choose to devote the time and energy to it.Tuesday I took a Cloudstone piece that I had made specifically to go in our new \"Primitive\" sculptural piece to Greenville with me to show Bill and Elaine and they really loved it. So now I have three forms for Cloudstone--rolled-up and blown vessels, glass and metal sculptural pieces, and straight kiln-formed functional pieces. Bettina (the second big Denver kiln) with her Dyson shelf also makes Cloudstone pieces possible in production as she was built for casting--higher temp, longer firings--and  the large flat shelf enables all kinds and combinations of drippy glass.The ACRE planning meetings over Tuesday and Wednesday with Bill and Elaine in Greenville were extremely productive. In a vastly efficient bit of overkill, Bill had a big screen monitor and a keyboard on the diningroom table so he could run the CAD software on his computer and generate scale drawings of our pieces, pedestals and wall display for us to debate and move around.As a result, when we get to Vegas this time we won't (hope, hope) be looking at another 23-hour set-up. The real benefit to the design-before-you-go model will be a smooth set-up at the summer Buyer's Market show the end of July for Bill, Elaine and Todd while I am off at the instructor workshop at Bullseye in Portland. The views shown are of the front wall and the top down.Bill and Elaine are the caregivers of four cats (two kids, a dog and two hamsters)and the largest of the cats, Mike, decided that he liked the warmth of my laptop and that it would be a good place for a snooze. Mike, not being your average-sized kitty makes my laptop look like a small toy.(\"What?!? I'm sleeping here!)"},

The hot shop process is snagging in the building permit process--which besides adding time also adds expense and aggravation. I am worrying about the investment which will take time to recoup. My roll-up time at Tadashi's did not go well yesterday as we were two hours late getting started so I did not get through the work I needed to prototype before next weekend's scheduled roll-up production time. The first four pieces of the day took six hours, leaving me only three hours for my four pieces. We did get three of them done in that three hours--two of them with only me there to assist. I need to work something better out going forward--can't afford that kind of slippage if I plan to have these pieces in my production line.Enough already, let's shake off the grumblies and find my happy place.

Need to get with Lori today to get the details on the Delores Taylor workshop for this fall so I can send them out. I'll post them here too. Dan is coming over to scope out the build-out for the hotshop this morning. Need to get in touch with V too to set-up a meeting for bookkeeping. Haven't seen Dee in awhile, want to get together with her too to talk about ACRE shipping etc.  Tomorrow I head to Greenville (sadly can't quite do Charleston) for two days of ACRE booth planning with Bill and Elaine--and to celebrate Bill's birthday which is tomorrow! The business/social life of an artist...An order came in yesterday and one the day before. It's not a flood, just a trickle, but the one yesterday was a second re-order since the initial order at the Buyer's Market in mid-February. Apparently my work is hot in Hawaii.Now I had better get webbing or I won't get anything updated. I'll scintillate tomorrow--or maybe Monday. Between now and Monday, two days of planning meetings and a day in the hotshop rolling up four pieces. No rest for the detoxing!"},

Egyptian licorice tea in the Austin skyline mug, \"Love of Our Lives\" by Indigo Girls on iTunes. It's a week, no doubt about it. I am the soon-to-be proud owner of a hotshop. Thanks to Sara Creekmore and her husband David who are downsizing, I am upsizing. New items to include: a small glass furnace, a large wet belt sander, a glass crusher, misc blowing tools, rods and punties, a rickety bench, a major burner, a small pick-up kiln, 250 lbs of Bullseye cullett, and whatever else I can fit in the UHaul I've rented that they want to get rid of. I am flying a bit by the seat of my pants, but the opportunity resonated with me, and I have learned to trust my gut in business decisions.Of course a hot shop without a glassblower and master builder/repairman for the equipment would soon be a big dusty waste. Lucky for me I have found both a shop master blower and a production blower who are available for a total of four days a week if I need them. They are just looking for up to a couple of days a week of pick-up work from me--not mortgage money. One of them is a friend of mine who has played around with some warm glass in my studio and who is very interested in helping me kit out a hotshop on a shoestring. Good thing as about all I'll have left after all this is my shoestrings.Then the questions arises (for anyone who has seen my studio) of where am I going to put this illustrious hot shop. After all, at a minimum I need room for a small furnace, a glory hole, a bench (or two), a pick-up oven, an annealing oven, a pipe warmer, a marvering table, a bench burner, and numerous other assorted tools. Putting a glassblowing operation inside a house-sized closed room is also not an attractive proposition (not to mention that all my floors are wood--not safe to drop molten glass on).What to do?Dan the carpenter steps up to the plate again. During the initial studio renovation he built me a small deck off the kiln room, and put a ramp on it so I could get the kilns up into the studio. But we rarely use the ramp. So far it's been for hauling loads out to the minivan for shows--not for palletized glass deliveries nor for getting kilns in. I can lose it. He's going to take the ramp out, double the size of the deck platform, put down a fire-proof floor, cover it all with a metal roof, and wall it with chainlink and drop down plastic sheeting for inclement weather. It's not the cool conservatory addition I was thinking of, or a cool garage with lots of big doors, but it's functional, affordable, and immediate. Add Cody the Plumber and Brian the electrician and I'm cooking with gas AND electric!Much of the equipment that I am not getting from Sara, my glassblower friend is going to build for me including the glory hole, the pick-up oven, and the annealing furnace. (I thought I'd just use my big Denver kilns for pick-up and annealing, but he said why bother? It's easy and inexpensive to make the ovens, and he likes building them.) I am going to look to Black Cat ArtWorks for metal components for the aforementioned equipment and maybe the steel for a marvering table (but not until after ACRE. WAY after ACRE :-)When is all this happening? Much of it in the next two to three weeks (yup, right before the ACRE show). I fly out to New Mexico on the 19th and the rest will be history--or a mystery, whichever comes first. No reason to let the grass grow under my feet.Have I changed my mind about becoming  a supplies retailer? Nope. Going full-steam ahead with that one and teaching too--the hotshop addition blends in nicely to the overall offerings.And I can't WAIT to see what BECon brings. At least kilncasting shouldn't require much more in terms of large equipement--already putting together the coldworking pieces for the hot work. Now off to fire!"},

This is the first of his work-from-Atlanta weeks with the new job.It's a light firing week for me, but a serious planning/prep week. This weekend I'm meeting with Bill and Elaine of Black Cat ArtWorks for two days to plan our ACRE display, and Sunday I am working on four roll-up pieces with Tadashi (I am sharing a full day with him at Duckbill with Licha and Lori). The goal of the hot-shop day is to make roll-up pieces to add to my current line for debut at ACRE at the end of the month. I still have reservations as to whether this is a feasible proposition, but I am going to give it a test. I had planned to expand the Morceaux de Verre work, but the feedback I have received on the first piece is that it's too much like blown glass--there isn't enough differentiation in the way the colors flow to show that this is something new, something you can't get with just blowing.Now time to trudge through the rain to the studio and get a kiln load in before Ikebana.

Airplane and hotel reservations for Vegas are done, new work for the show is planned. Next weekend Bill, Elaine and I will get together at their house in Charleston to plan the display--the exact pieces and placement for them. Maybe by extensive planning on the front end, we can avoid the 23-hour set-up we had last year...In keeping with the economic theme we started at the Buyer's Market in February, we are debuting several new pieces at ACRE in the $100-$200 bucket--glass and metal together. We had eight new pieces for the Buyer's Market that were under $100, now we're unveiling a slightly larger rectangular stand format with five new designs and four stand pieces with small rounds (our current smallest round stand piece uses 16\" glass, the new ones have 7-1/2\" glass).However we aren't neglecting the higher-end work either. We have a new abstract glass and steel sculpture called \"Primitive\" that looks (to me--I didn't design it) like a bone and obsidian ax head circa 2000 BC. I am seriously inspired to do a really cool glass for it; maybe something in \"stone\"... I will also have the fused and blown (roll-up) vessels. Finally I'm thinking that I didn't give the Cloudstone pieces enough exposure and it might be time to do a bit more of that glass (the purple was especially yummy). Heck, I have two weeks to get it all done--and only one order to get out in the meantime (at least for now).I end the post today with a response to all the \"Gee, you didn't do much in making the roll-up pieces\" comments from the previous posts. The roll-ups are COLLABORATIVE work. I didn't show the process of making the glass in the first place (my part) as that's just what I do--and let's face it, watching someone cut glass, piece it together and put it into the kiln isn't all that... sexy. Glass blowing is sexy. Watching Johnathon swing the pipe with a molten vessel on it around in the air and past his cute little bare legs... that's sexy! Would you rather watch someone clean house or throw a fabulous party in the clean house? Can't do one without the other. Which is not to say I wasn't doing anything during the glass-blowing part of the work. The original video was 45 minutes long after all. I cut it to 16. Most of what I cut was my boring behind moving back and forth, and me directing the shaping. I did cut repetitions of blowing movements and glory hole time too, but my philosophy was if I was the main action in the shot, it could be cut.I also didn't shoot the two days of coldworking on the finished blown piece that I gave it so it is satiny and lustrous and you just can't stop stroking it when you pick it up. The doing of that wasn't sexy either, but the (almost) finished piece? Oh my, drop-dead sexy."},

It took so long for Blogger to load this morning that I drank it all before getting here. \"No More Buffalo\" by James McMurtry for music. Not Blogger's fault about the lack of speed though--I'm uploading the new versions of the roll-up videos to YouTube right now. James McM is for Dave who is planning to drop by the Continental Club tonight at midnight to see him. *sigh* I am so envious. I'd stay up for James McM.I was very disappointed in the quality of the roll-up videos I initially put up--especially as the quality before uploading was very good. Last night I did a little technical research on the mahvelous interweb and discovered that you are supposed to upload the highest quality video you can to YouTube--you should not compress it yourself first--as they will compress and \"optimize\" it when you upload. So a little more time on the front end for me results in a much better video for you. Unfortunately, the article I read said the maximum size for uploading was 100 mg. I spent a couple of hours last night trying to get each of mine just smaller than 100mg each with no success. This morning when I went to YouTube to upload my compromise size (I finally ended up with iMovie's pre-defined cd-rom quality of 35 mg) I saw that YouTube now accepts up to 1 gig and 10 minutes of film per video. Re-exported to 250 mg each, and am sloooowly getting them up. Note to self: make sure to be connected to the DSL through a cable--not wireless--to upload 250 mg files...Who knew as a glass artist I'd have to learn about the nuances of video formats, compression, frame rate, aspect, bit rate, etc.? I just want to press a button and have the darn thing show up on that there Internet instantly looking great. I don't think that's too much to ask. But technological savvy is increasingly important for artists. Going back to the discussions several of us had at the Buyer's Market in February, the venues of the past for promoting our work aren't enough. I don't know anyone now who just does the annual retail festival circuit (Florida in the Winter, the deep south for the spring, then up to the Midwest or west to the Rockies for the summer). Likewise, I don't know anyone who is making it just doing the wholesale arts shows--certainly no one who started in the past five years.More income streams (i.e., production work, art work, teaching, writing, etc.) and more online marketing venues (not just a website but Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Plaxo--and I'm not taking on-line sales here, that's a whole different subject) are becoming the norm for the successful artist--and each of them requires new skill sets and time. It's only Wednesday and I'm ready for a nap (or to go become a pool cleaner).Enjoy the (New and Improved!) videos. Don't forget to put the sound on, and--as always--please support the musicians who inspired me both in my artistic endeavors and for the videos (Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, Jace Everett, John Carpenter and the Coupe de Villes, and Creedence Clearwater Revival (links are to buy the MP3's on Amazon--how great is that technology?)."},

I am wistfully missing everyone today and wishing we were getting together again so I thought I'd put it up.

Enjoy the video (and make sure your sound is ON).*****VIDEO REMOVED: Putting it up again with better quality on 4/29***************Coffee was in the Atlanta skyline mug--scarfed it down already, \"Waste a Lifetime\" by BoDeans for music. Today is less about wasting a lifetime and more about the crammed fullness of possibilities in one, and my wish for two simultaneous lifetimes (or to live on a planet with 36 hours in a day) to get to everything. The problem, if indeed there really is a problem, is that everything I'm working on is time-sensitive. The masks in glass summer camp is scheduled to start on July 6th whether I am ready or not, and the garden is bursting into summer with all the pent-up vigor of spring, again, whether I am ready for it or not. Glass on the left, gardening on the right, stuck in the middle with you blogging through my paralysis.It's going to be another hot day here in Atlanta. We had a cold, rainy spring that gave way in a day with no transition into full, glorious hot summer. Shrubs, trees and vines still need pruning and staking (and boy am I late on THAT task!). The weeds must be addressed before they take over everything (first kudzu sighting this morning). Fire ants must be wrangled (out of existence) and bedding and potted plants tucked in before it's just too hot... and none of the preceding have anything to do with glass.Because it's going to be another hot day here in Atlanta I need to get the kiln loads in this morning while it's cool. The beginning of last week I had nothing scheduled for this week, then starting Wednesday the orders began trickling in at a steady one a day through yesterday. Just that easily my firing schedule is full for the week.Then there's all the non-glass glass work to be done: website, sales tax (still. I am bad.), gallery check-ins, ACRE planning, info card design and ordering, and the pièce de résistance--summer camp curriculum. The reading alone I have accumulated is staggering (everything from Johnathon's oeuvre on coldworking to all the reference books on the significance of masks in various cultures I got to prepare for summer camp).So how do I get the gardening AND the glass done in the 24-hour days I have in this earthly lifetime? Is the solution really more hours in a day? I think not! I think I know the answer (pick me! pick me!). How about I get the kiln loads in right now in the cool morning before it gets too hot. Then, while it's still not scorching, I spend an extended lunchtime puttering in the garden. Finish with an afternoon in the skychair sipping lemonade and webbing/curriculuming/planning. Sounds like a good idea to me. Wash, rinse, reppeat tomorrow and Friday and I could find myself in front of the eight ball by the weekend. (Now why is in front of the eight ba;; better than behind the eight ball? Hmmm. Something more to think about.)A quick note and query as I close:The glass roll-up workshop was such an incredible, invigorating joy and success that it looks like there may be another workshop offered at the same studio the end of August/the beginning of September by a renowned pate de verre artist/teacher. I have been charged with scoping out interest in taking the workshop and specific techniques/information that people would like covered. Please comment or email me if you might like to participate and/or have suggestions for specific content. Happy Tuesday!"},

Oh yes, and enough time to finish Johnathon's most excellent book and put the finishing touches on my nefarious coldworking studio plan. Who knows, I might even get more workshop editing done. If I don't do it now, it's going to languish forever.Four months into permanent showroom leasing and I am not too excited about it. I had reservations about doing something so far from home where I wouldn't be able to check up on it at least monthly, and my trepidations are being realized. I have had one order for one piece from a designer equaling about 1/3 of one month's rent. Part of it is definitely the economy, but I think another part is that nothing sells itself. People have to see it through advertising and other marketing activities--and seeing it in person is the best of all but that means going to the showroom and shopping.... something I don't think many people are doing these days. It might have been better to start in Atlanta, but I wasn't impressed with the permanent showroom space I saw at the Mart when I did the Atlanta's Mart winter show.

If I had been just a bit faster, I could have gotten the license plate number of the silver camaro-like car loaded with hoodlums that idled in front of the studio this afternoon--music (or something that could possibly be called music in an alternate universe) blaring--while waiting for  the light at the corner to change. They were so impressed by my yard that they were compelled to add their own decoration to it in the form of a beer bottle in a paperbag tossed and smashed onto the driveway.

I'm tired to the bone (and I'm not the only one!), but totally exhilarated. I may suffer complete sensory overload and shut-down this year with all the mind-expanding (mind-blowing) professional dev I have scheduled.I know people who love to go from class to class and workshop to workshop, but I frankly couldn't do it. Four days of fusing to blow, blowing (or having blown as it were), and preparing for coldworking have given me so many new ideas for my own production work that I think if I took workshops more often my head would explode and I'd completely lose any shred of \"my\" in my work. But the past weekend was just right--I even hope to have a new roll-up line ready for ACRE at the end of May._________A few hours have passed since I started this post, and in the interim I have booked my plane travel to BECon, booked all of Dave's flights to and from Austin through the end of May--and booked three more days at Duckbill Studios working glass roll-ups with Tadashi, Licha and Lori in May. No reason to let the grass grow under my feet. I think this is a very under-served area of collaboration in the wholesale show niche (and speaking of Niche... don't be too surprised when September rolls around if there's a bit of a \"roll\" to my submission!).Tomorrow--in addition to all the regularly scheduled studio activity of firing, shipping, sending off invoices and quotes, preparing for shows, etc.--I will edit some of the footage I shot over the weekend at the workshop. I tried to video everyone's roll-up pieces from start to finish--eight people times two days times about 45 minutes per project... I have a lot to edit.I also have my own pieces from the workshop to coldwork--and a draft copy of Johnathon's new book, \"The Joy of Coldworking\" to read and review. The timing couldn't be better for me with the work I need to do on my pieces--thanks to Johnathon for letting me do the read. The book will be out in May and I'll post a link to the pre-order page as soon as I get it. Johnathon is a great teacher--his seriously comprehensive knowledge is combined with a quirky sense of humor into one relaxed, easy-going package. I can't wait to read this book!Now for a key to all the pictures: The top right is Johnathon using a shaving brush to wipe the schmutz off of the shelf-side (the outside) of my first piece after it was initially rolled up. Like the way the bristles flame from contact with the molten glass? The next two pics are my first piece before fusing and after fusing, midway through the roll-up. The shiny happy people are the glory-hole team for my roll-up--Johnathon on the pipe, Tadashi and I on doors. The last pic skips ahead (way ahead) till all the pieces for the day were rolled up, blown, safely tucked into the annealer for the night (and much of the next day), and then cooled off. The My piece is the one on the bottom right. More pics of it as I coldwork.Where have the days gone?! There will be a post this morning, it'll just be later as I need more sleep. Much more sleep.

I spent two hours on Monday morning bringing my accountant up to date on both the business and personal rats' nests (two hours!) and then I just walked away.As I wrote before I left for Spring Break, I got a big glass delivery in the pouring rain--the same continuously pouring rain that has flooded the basement/crawl space at the studio Pics are of the rainy delivery and the subsequent flooding (the flooding pic was taken a week later--after the initial soaking. It's all been under water since then). See how the hot water heater is under water? I have a pump in there now and hope to have it emptied out today. And I finally have the name of a good plumber who will come out and manually light the hot water heater once it's all dried out. This is what it's all about, this small art/craft business ownership, keeping afloat.It's a beautiful day in Atlanta and tomorrow I start a four-day workshop with Johnathon Schmuck on the roll-up technique hosted by Glass Inspirations and Duckbill Studios. I am so excited! Even though Dave will be home from Austin for the weekend and I won't see much of him (the class will run long), it's still going to be a great weekend. Jessie is looking forward to some one-on-one daddy time so it will all work out well.This is truly a year of professional development for me--first this workshop (the second one I've taken in about ten years--and the first one [for a variety of reasons] doesn't really count), then BECon followed by a post-conference workshop on lost wax casting, finishing up with a week long Bullseye Instructor workshop. Bliss. Just bliss."},

Okay, that's just spooky. Out of my entire library iTunes picked That song. The song our friend Andrea sang at Dave's and my wedding. Yep, the spouse is back in Austin. We miss him.It was a *wonderful* spring break. For the first vacation in memory I did almost no planning--even when I was trying to plan. I lived in the \"now\" and basked. Basked and played Diablo, and flew kites, and built sandcastles, and drowsed in the sun. A really wonderful vacation. I did ponder some techniques for experimentation (and possible book 2 inclusion--yep, haven't given up that idea yet), but I didn't do much more than that.Now back into the studio refreshed, rejuvenated and re-energized. Sorry for the lack of post yesterday--it was a transition day. A damp, chilly, grey transition day. I still have no gas (and so no heat or hot water) at the studio as the crawl space where the hot water heater and the furnace are located keeps filling with water so I'm not able to get a new sump pump in. Hope it gets sunny and hot this afternoon (and stops raining!) so I can take a look at it again.Today is for communing with art partners, organizing the firing schedule and starting on upcoming orders--of which there is a new series of big wall panels for a corporate space and another store (I think I might have already mentioned this one...) order from the department store to fold in (they are adding the collection to one more store).ACRE is coming up--time to get travel reservations and exposition services booked, and it's time for a big summer camp promotion push.

We're at Java Joe's... working. Today is the one and only day I plan to really work, but it is a real day as the taxes are not to the accountant yet (I know, I know!) and there are a couple more things that need to be mailed off before we get back home. Dave is working all week--his first proof of concept on working remotely with the new company.Almost got all the glass from my delivery last week put away and, in the process, lined up another highly qualified instructor to teach in the studio. That brings me to a firm count of four and a potential count of five primary instructors and two regular teaching assistants. As I have said before, I am not really interested in teaching basic fusing and slumping. Nor do I want to teach on the weekends (I get little enough time with my traveling spouse as it is) so having other instructors interested in filling in those spots in the curriculum and schedule is excellent!Now off to the taxes so I can get on to the FUN!

Ten minutes before my laptop battery is dead. Ted minutes before we have to leave to go to the Waldorf School for Grandparents and Loved Ones Day. D's Ps are here and J is basking in the extra family attention.Big studio news (BTW, there shouldn't be any big studio news the day before vacation starts....) is that I turned the gas off to the studio yesterday because we didn't have any hot water. We didn't have any hot water because it has been raining for 40 days and 40 nights and the crawlspace/basement under the studio has over a foot of standing water in it. The hot water heater and the furnace both live in the crawlspace/basement, and the hot water heater was partially submerged. Submerged enough that the pilot light was out. The safest thing to do was just shut off the gas, wait for the water to recede, and deal with it when we get back. Or build an ark. One thing's for sure, there is definitely a new sump pump in my future.My department store client ordered the collection for another store yesterday. They haven't sold any of the first pieces yet, but they like them so much they want to expand the number of stores carrying them.Okay, out of time, out of battery, off to school!"},
{"title": "Now Back To Your Regularly Scheduled Programming", "date": "Thursday, April 02, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Alaska skyline mug, \"Goodbye Earl\" by the Dixie Chicks on Apple TV. April Fool's Day is over and it's time to get back to work. I played several good tricks yesterday on my assistant, my bookkeeper, and--of course--on the web. The Spouse staunchly maintained that he was Not Fooled (in his words, my husband scaring tactics failed miserably).Glass from Bullseye arrives today (it's raining, of course) as do my in-laws. The cleaning people are coming this morning--and I'm disappointed because I actually wanted to show off how clean the house is already to the in-laws. \"See? I *can* muddle through without Dave to do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry!\" (That statement would carry more weight if I didn't have a big pile of clean sheets still to put away from Saturday when he was home and did laundry...)But back to glass. The last fuse loads for a few weeks were fired yesterday. Today is for slumping and firepolishing (two different loads) and tomorrow is the last shipping till mid-April. I would be concerned, but the dearth of orders coincides nicely with J's Spring Break, and Dave will be home from Austin for nine days starting tomorrow night so we can have a little family vacation together. I plan to spend the time... Planning. It's time to lay out the curriculum for the mask summer camp, read all the books I bought for resource materials, make a list (and maybe even a schedule) for other classes--including ikebana containers (both nageire and moribana), birdbaths, fountains, windchimes, table tops, plant stakes (time to be in the garden...), etc. And time to tweak the studio layout for a formal materials and supplies section.Even if it rains every day next week, I can't wait. Long, quiet walks on the beach with just the family and the gulls for company, new directions in glass to explore (and maybe a few website updates while I'm at it)--I couldn't ask for more."},
{"title": "Time For a Change...", "date": "Wednesday, April 01, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, \" 'Round Here Somewhere\" by the BoDeans on the apple TV. It's raining. Again. Yesterday saw yet more papers sorted and appropriately filed (i.e., mostly recycled), kilns fired, glass cut, pieces made, pieces shipped. Yawn. I yearn to be in the garden. I have been dissatisfied with the necessity of subverting my creativity to economic realities--something that happens to all production artists at some time in their careers--for awhile now. Finally last night I came to a momentous decision: I am done with professional glass--it's time to move on to the next step in my life.Before we moved to Atlanta we lived in Austin, and I went through the 10-week training and certification program (including 50 hours of public service work) to become a Master Gardener. I specialized in the incorporation of native plants in the urban landscape and ecological gardening--no pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers or regular watering. I loved it, though the only outlets I had were our home yard (and I had to fight the neighborhood association tooth and nail as they wanted me to plow all the native vegetation and buffalo grass under and put in Bermuda grass--something the people who bought our home when we moved have done. *sigh*) and some friends' yards.When we moved here, I had a blank slate again. The backyard was a sea of red mud, and the front was full of boring, inappropriate builder plants and some sod which died before I identified it. Now the front has a curving pavestone walk, a traveler redbud, a witch hazel, three quince, a small pond, a moss \"lawn\", jasmine, gardenias, camellias, a service berry, ferns, a flying dragon (tri-foliated native orange), and assorted other wildlife-friendly plants. The back has a weeping cherry, a ginko, a weeping elm, an ironwood, a small Japanese maple, a weeping deodora cedar, two Texas persimmons, an American smoketree, a fragrant tea olive, and a bamboo forest--and that's just for starters!I designed the entire backyard including adjusting slope and soil and accommodating drainage and existing light. I even put in the circular stone patio with a low wall surrounding it myself (with help from two contractors I hired to grade and spread the 15 dump truck loads of topsoil I purchased). And I did it all in two weeks from start to finish--playhouse and bamboo to soil, sod, a dry \"creek\" bed for drainage, the afore-mentioned patio, and all the trees and shrubs... then I had to get back to my regular job, and I have done nothing back there since other than the annual mulch and thrice-yearly major weedings.Now the bamboo is shooting, the grass is getting ready to sprout, the pond creatures are stirring, and I want to to get back to my yard and to help other people with theirs. I thoroughly enjoyed the general contracting and materials ordering and coordinating that came with the project, I was very good at it, and I love the smell of dirt.Practicalities: The College of Environment and Design at the University of Georgia offers two degrees that interest me--Master of Landscape Architecture and Master of Environmental Planning and Design. The existing studio building is a perfect place for a discreet professional office--and if we end up moving to Austin for Dave's job it will be easier to pick up and move a landscaping career. Plus it gives me a lot more time to sell off my existing materials and product inventory from the glass business because I start NOW.Oh I'm not saying I'm going to sell everything and never do glass again, but it's time for it to take a back seat and become the enjoyable hobby it was when I started over 20 years ago. I'm too tied down by all the \"stuff\" that goes along with being a production glass artist. It's time to Move On! Off to the studio to start tagging everything for sale (too bad I have that big Bullseye order coming this week--but at least I am on the downside of my production cycle). Final thought--that artist who was copying my work now has a clear field and I don't have to worry about it anymore!Happy April 1 everyone."},
{"title": "Too Little For Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans skyline mug, waiting for iTunes to reboot for music. Ah, there it is, \"Moondance\" by Van Morrison on the Apple TV. It's another dark Tuesday. Last week it felt like we lived in Seattle it rained so much, and this week is shaping up to be more of the same. April showers indeed. Grey weather makes me want to hibernate, not go forth and conquer the glass mountain.Speaking of glass, my latest order shipped from Bullseye last Friday so I should have it later this week. Good thing too, as I am completely out of clear irid--again! I still have enough frit to sink a battle cruiser, but I sure go through the clear irid quickly.Got a call yesterday from a gallery owner I met at the Dallas show and she would like to propose my work to a corporate client for a series of eight large wall panels--short-term timeline. The work would be interesting, and I'm getting to the end of the Buyer's Market orders so the additional income would be welcome--as would the opportunity to put off the inevitable  shift back into cerebral glass activities--like planning the teaching I would like to do and new directions for the studio that comes at the end of the heavy production cycle. Direction shifts--like all change--are very hard. My body in production motion prefers to stay in production motion. Or it prefers to curl up on the couch with a good book. Neither are viable options so I heave myself out of my chair and head to the studio."},
{"title": "Office and Official!", "date": "Monday, March 30, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" covered by Me First & The Gimme Gimmes on iTunes. Yes, it is a sad Monday. The Sprout and I took the Spouse to the airport this morning. But he'll only be gone for four nights. He'll be back to us Friday night (for the entire following week!--It's spring break, doncha know).Finally today I get to share pics of my main super-secret project of the past couple of weeks. I did it as a surprise for Dave but he said J and I dropped hints like anvils and he had pretty much guessed. But the visuals are still pretty impressive. Some might wonder why photos of the home-office re-do would show up in a glass business blog. The state of the home office for the past several years has had a serious impact on my ability to actually run a business. I thought businesses had to have files, file folders and file cabinets--as did well-run households. Turns out I was wrong.For people like me--people who don't even bother to take the time to put on make-up in the morning, much less regularly file all the scraps of paper that accumulate on our desks--the optimal solution to having all the paper I need, having it in a place where I can put my hands on it without too much troubles *and* maintaining the organization with minimal effort is to have paper-sized plastic boxes labeled with home or business and the year. Sure I need a couple more boxes than that (like ones for owner's manuals, J's medical stuff, J's school stuff, J's art, Christmas cards, and photos) but I don't need all the fussy little manila folders I used to have languishing almost empty in green hanging folders in a dust-and-paper-covered file cabinet.Both my bookkeeper and my accountant convinced me I need to keep all the old invoices and receipts from previous years, but I didn't need to sort them by vendor or month or anything other than year. If I get audited (knock on wood) I can deal with sorting the appropriate years. In the meantime, I can get on with Real Life.The craftsman oak furniture that used to fill the office is mostly now over at the studio (where I do have a lot more \"stuff\" I need to store--like trade publications, more office supplies, etc.). I need nifty surfaces over there to put stuff on, and there was exactly the right amount of room in the office for everything but the old desk. Never fear though, it found a good home as a donation to a non-profit.Now for the big news of the day! My partners Bill and Elaine Snell and Todd Briske have come through again (though Todd doesn't know it yet--he'll find out when he gets back in town on Wednesday). In June Bill and Elaine are going to Dallas to represent Siyeh Studio and Black Cat ArtWorks at the Dallas Market summer show. When you have a showroom there you have to be on-site for the two big markets of the year in January and June. Bill and Elaine are going instead of me because the market overlaps with BECon and I am attending it for the first time ever--and taking a really cool looking workshop on lost wax casting, \"MYSTERIES OF LOST WAX REVEALED with Linda Ethier\". But this is not the big news, this is old news (it's still big, it's just old and big).The big news is that I have been invited to participate in an instructor workshop at Bullseye this summer. Bill, Elaine and Todd are making my attendance possible by taking on the entire set-up for the summer BMAC themselves--the instructor workshop is only held the week before the BMAC. I wish I were attending BEFORE I teach two sessions of summer camp, but I will at least have the summer camp to talk about in my 10-minute presentation on my studio, teaching, experience, etc. (they would like a presentation with slides or visual aids of some sort and everything. Wow.)The instructor workshop will enable me to continue expanding the scope of my studio from solely production work and writing to teaching and even retailing and wholesaling glass. Yes, I think it's finally time to step up to the Big League and start selling materials and supplies and teaching regular classes. Gulp. Now off to get today's production kiln loads in and shipments out."},

I didn't have time to make coffee yesterday. No coffee, no post. Simple, little, equation. On the other hand, I had three kilns (including both Bertha and Bettina) loaded and firing and two shipments labeled and out for UPS (I can't take credit for packing them--Becky did that the previous afternoon) all by 10:45. 10:45 AM. Really.The rest of the morning/afternoon was spent on taxes and making a dent in sorting the boxes filled with five years worth of papers. Maybe the reason Dave and I moved so often in our first years together was so that I didn't have a chance to accumulate a truly staggering amount of (so my bookkeeper and accountant tell me) indispensable unsorted papers. I was forced to sort and purge regularly in order to move. I almost wish I were Jewish just so I'd have the ritual of the annual pre-Passover sort, clean and purge as an ingrained part of my life. Sure, it wouldn't be just chumetz that I'd be getting rid of but paper and all other \"things\" accumulated during the year and littering the house._______________________________That was as far as I got on my post Friday before the whale of the day swallowed me whole, and it took till now to fight my way from its belly back to Blogger. Of course I stopped on a tropical island (metaphorically) for a little paradise with my newly home spouse and that delayed me too. And then there has been the weekend-long marathon replaying the old computer game Diablo II on my Mac. I clearly have an addictive personality and need to avoid computer action and adventure games if I wish to get anything else done.So I post better late than never for Friday (a post which was already a catch-up post for Thursday), and I save my Big News to share tomorrow...."},

Too sad.)Tuesday was a trial, and it's over. Last night at 6:45 I was still loading the first of two kilns and had a tired, hungry, 7 year-old tugging on my shirt and asking when was dinner going to be ready. I finished the first load and had dinner on the table for her by 7:05. While she ate, I went back to the studio and started working on the second load. She came over when she had finished eating and hung out with me till just after 8:00 when the second kiln was loaded and firing. Then we went back to the house and had ice cream and talked to her dad. Ice cream was followed by a shower for her and putting laundry away for me and the evening finished with her tucked into her bed listening to Magic Treehouse and me updating my accounts receivable/reconciling invoices till bedtime at 11:00. Days beginning at 7:00 am and consisting of continuous work till after 10:00 at night have got to stop. I am not cut out for this kind of life.At least I found some money as I desnarled my paperwork. It turns out that not only do I have a lot of checks due to come in, but I also have several credit cards that I never got around to charging for shipments sent in March. And it's a good thing I found some cash as I am going to have to pay for my biggest Bullseye glass order ever in a couple of weeks. Let's hope the check from the department store comes in in the meantime too. I think I'm going to have to set V on wading through their e-biz registration forms, etc., because I don't think I'm ever going to have the time (or interest).Tired today. J came in to sleep with me about midnight and coughed and sniffed for the rest of the night. Poor little mite is completely stuffed up with a horrid cold, but she neither had a fever nor seemed particularly lethargic this morning so she went off to school. I am going to hit the Cold Eze hard today in an effort to head off getting sick myself. It's not a substitute for lots of rest, eating well and avoiding stress, but it's the closest I am going to come this week and I don't want to be sick when I see the spouse for the first time in three weeks (3,578 minutes from now).Now off to do the final number pulling from the finances for last year's taxes.

So I dropped J off at school and headed to a place where there are always enough beans. I figure I'll get he rest of my orders, invoices and scheduling done in a place with no distractions... except Facebook. Oy.So far having a bookkeeper seems to mean it's that much easier to ignore the taxes and financial paperwork. I'm no closer to getting them done (sorry Vero!), but I no longer have anxiety attacks about them either. My big accomplishment yesterday was organizing everything on the To Do list into days that I hope To Do them. I managed to get most of Monday's things done, though a few did ook over into today. Yes, the word is \"ook\", pronounced ooh-k. It was not a typo missing letter. There is a lot of ooking in my life right now and I just thought I'd share.Blessed quiet--the weird music has stopped and I can concentrate.

Put away the clean dishes, did the grocery shopping and put away the groceries, sorted the laundry and started the first load. Now it's almost 9:00 and I'm ready for work. I begin to see how my mother did all this every day--grim, focused determination. Hit the ground running and don't stop until you collapse in bed at night. There's a certain pioneer beauty to it--which is not to say I do not long for my spouse's return with every fiber of my being.In addition to working in the office and hosting a pajama party sleepover for the J this weekend I also fired full loads in both big kilns Saturday and Sunday. For once on Monday morning I can say I am caught up--with everything except paperwork (taxes, invoicing, accounts payable, etc.). But the kilns are going to need a few hours yet to cool--I didn't get them started till 8:00 last night as they were still cooling in the early evening from Saturday's firings--so I have time to work on the paper mess. \"Right Here Now\" by James McMurtry plays in the background.

Wonder if the spouse did see Tori Amos last night at La Zona Rosa or if he bailed. It's the first year he's worked in the mornings (new job ya know) and spent the afternoons, evenings and nights at the festival. Now me, I'm just workin'. Each day I get one or two more things crossed off the list. Some of those things have been there for *months*. If he stays in Austin long enough, I might actually get all caught up (not much else to do in the late evenings besides work and read).Today I take another load of glass to Todd, fire, ship, and get the glass order in to Bullseye (finally!). Breaking pieces with slight flaws into chunks and firepolishing those chunks into pieces for ornaments, keychains, base pieces for wire men, and garden stakes is a lot more difficult than I had thought it would be. Were we selling them retail, it would be simple. But wholesale adds a whole new level of complication--we have to be consistent in our sizing. And I gotta tell you, it's very difficult to get consistent results from smashing large pieces of glass into shards on a concrete driveway! This week we instituted a sizing chart and sorting bins and Becky went through everything we had fired and put it all into buckets for Todd. The pre-sorting before it goes to him serves a two-fold purpose: he doesn't spend an entire day going through glass, and I have a good idea how many pieces of what sizes I have made for him so I can make sure there are enough appropriate pieces to complete our orders.As I look at my list of things to do I find that I am most behind in money matters--and not just the reconciliation kind. I am also behind in paying and collecting. It would be nice to get a few of those done today too. And maybe I'll have some extra time for it as Jessie is being picked up from school by another mother for an afternoon/evening (dinner and a movie) playdate with one of her friends. I look forward to an evening by myself to watch a non-Sprout-friendly movie, have a nice salad for dinner and a couple of glasses of white wine--but only if I get caught up on sending and receiving (or at least rebilling for) all the money I have outstanding!"},

The box was crushed. On an overnight package! Oh boy. Yet one more piece to fire today.I am going to stop reading CNN. Not only did they have the bad sense to lay off my spouse, but they seem to have a vested interest in whipping the public into a frenzied panic about the economy.

Yesterday was a good firing day--two full big loads in Bertha and Bettina--but a lousy paperwork day. Becky the Wunder Assistant has another job mornings now so I get her in the afternoon and my whole schedule is upside down. It's not a bad upside down, mind you. In the same way pineapple upside down cake isn't bad, having Becky at the studio to bound and cement the afternoon work hours isn't bad. She arrives an hour or so before I pick the J up from school and stays an hour or two longer. Her being there helps keep the end of the school day from making my brain think it's the end of the work day too.So I filled the kilns yesterday full of little pieces, the self-same little pieces that are going to get me through this pesky economic downturn. Right now the way to keep an art/craft business afloat is to have a small-sized series of work that efficiently uses materials (keeps waste to zero), has a quick turnaround time (is not labor-intensive), and can be--because of the first two--priced lower than other styles of your work. Oh yes, this series also has to be of the same quality and made with the same care as the rest of your work so as to put the finishing touches on your customers perception that it is a very good bargain and will sell well to their customers.The time that you have freed up by doing less labor-intensive work can be put to use teaching, reselling supplies, or doing a host of other income-generating activities. The secret is flexibility and openness to change. Now I'm going to head off and polish up a class schedule for the studio. There are fountain classes, birdbath classes, ikebana container classes and who knows what else to create.(The playlist for today's post is everything in my music library that has the word \"waste\" in the song or album title, or in the artist's name.  It includes lots of good songs and the entire album \"Too Long In the Wasteland\" by James McMurtry--a fitting kickoff for the SXSW Music Festival Dave will attend today in Austin.

{"title": "964 Miles From Home", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Denver architect series mug, \"3,000 Miles\" by Tracy Chapman on iTunes. I'm off the melancholy playlist even though the spouse is still 964 miles away. But I made it through the first weekend alone, holding together home and hearth with adequacy if not grace and verve.As the spouse likes to say, every scrap of cloth in the house is clean (or in the washer), and the Sprout is off to school--only a teensy bit late this morning. Shouldn't have tried to empty the dishwasher, move around laundry, fold laundry, make her breakfast (though cutting a couple of slices of danish and pouring some juice isn't terribly time consuming), make her lunch and supervise her chores (oh yes, and get dressed and teeth brushed myself) all on a rainy Monday morning before school.Now it's 8:30 and thoughts turn to glass. A piece didn't turn out last week and I had to refire it over the weekend. Unfortunately the customer for it is driving down from Canada to one of my galleries up north to pick it up on Tuesday. I shipped the stand out Friday, but now I have to overnight the glass today and it's a big, heavy piece. I won't make anything on this sale other than the continued goodwill of the gallery and hope for more orders from them. Just the cost of doing business--and it wouldn't have happened at all if I weren't running the firing schedule right up to the wire.BRB--got to take a break to fill the bird feeders in between rain showers. The little birds are out there right now and looking quite put out that they made the trek and there's no food...Though I'm still behind from starting the year with three big shows and set-up of a permanent showroom (all before St. Patrick's Day!), today I finally feel rested and like I can see the tasks ahead of me in a coherent order. There are a daunting number of them from finances (invoice reconciliation, bills, taxes, sales taxes, oh my) to getting the Bullseye glass order in, to planning and promoting summer camp, but I can see them all now--no more too-swamped-to-see-ahead-past-next-week. Wow. It's a scary view! But there's coffee, quiet, peace and time--and only 16,571 minutes till Dave gets home."},

It's Friday so the work week ends. Wow. No work in the studio scheduled for the weekend. Of course that doesn't mean I won't be working--I have mileage and other data for taxes to do, a slideshow to figure out, wholesalecrafts.com to update, and a mountain (literally) of paperwork to sort and file.I am reminded of an incident with my advisor in graduate school. I kept waiting and waiting to get a paper back from her and finally I went to her office to inquire about it. It wasn't that she didn't pay attention to or read our work--just the opposite. She was so intense and meticulous in her evaluation of everything we turned in that it would take her forever to get through reviewing it. Her husband, as a way of dealing with the mountains of paper her style engendered, used to periodically go through their apartment and put everything in big green garbage bags for later sorting--all the papers on this chair in one, all the papers on that table in another. I don't think they ever got sorted, and I never did get that paper back (I got a decent grade though).I truly have four years worth of personal and business papers stacked in drunken piles on the desk, file cabinet and floor of the home office and squatting on every available flat surface in the house and studio office. Even the cleaning people don't go near them for fear of being ingested by the paper monsters and disappearing forever. Four years of now-dusty papers. Blech.On the plus side, technology is my friend today--whatever gremlins had the reins at Blogger yesterday are sleeping it off today and I was able to upload my time lapse slide show of the Hemisphere Design Gallery showroom set-up. You enjoy the banjo music, I'm off with a trusty stick (and maybe a box of matches) to attack the paper monsters. And if you see my spouse this weekend, give him a hug for me. I miss him."},

{"title": "Siyeh Does Dallas", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, the silence of the morning for music. J is off to school--I survived my first morning of single parenthood. Dave is in Austin for the next two months with weekends home starting in three weeks (I will be counting the minutes as soon as I can figure out how many there are). I am back from setting up the showroom in Dallas and exhausted. But the day--and the week--marches on. There are taxes to file, orders to prepare and ship, schedules to update, finances to wrangle--in short, all the little things that make up a business. Oh yes, and now there's dinner to figure out, school transportation to wedge in, and a child to raiseYesterday morning at 7:30 in Dallas I started the following post:\"I sit on the Hemisphere showroom and enter my post into a text edit window as I have not had Internet access in *36 hours*. The reason I am sitting and typing instead of drinking coffee and driving back to Atlanta is that I am waiting for my image slideshow to finish burning to dvd. Last night technology and exhaustion (and frustration at the lack of Internet due to hotel equipment problems) kept me from finishing it. Now I chomp at the bit to get On The Road!!! (Elaine is just as anxious as I am to get home, but she's far too polite to chomp.)Set-up of the permanent showroom in the Hemisphere Design Gallery went extremely well. Thanks to Todd's and Elaine's creativity and general artsy-farstsiness, the space is filled with delightful, accessible eye-candy. There are cans of spilled paint (glass) scattered on the white table cloths (which pose as drop cloths), little wire men waving frit-covered paintbrushes and frolicking around the pieces, and bright clean white lines and light throughout. Oh yes, and there are beautiful glass and metal pieces in just the right number.\"I never did get the dvd to work before we left--I'll work on it this week and mail it. The drive back, accompanied by the audiobook of Stephen King's \"The Gunslinger\", was uneventful and Elaine and I were safely in Atlanta by 9:00 pm.Tomorrow I'll post photos of the renovation--we took 15-minute-interval time lapse photos all day--and maybe a video of the final state. Today I need to concentrate on Organizing My Life and Work to meet the demands of our family's new separation state."},
{"title": "How Much Internet is Too Much Internet?", "date": "Friday, March 06, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the San Francisco skyline mug, the sound of little girls giggling as they get ready for school for my music. A friend whose daughter is in J's class dropped her off this morning because she has an early meeting up north. Dave will take both girls and Becky the Wunder Assistant to school (Becky needs to see the drop-off routine so she can do it next week).Substitute \"Blogger\" for \"LiveJournal\" in the XKCD cartoon to the right, and this has become my life (click on the cartoon to make it larger so you can read it). Dave's vacation chant used to be \"Live, don't commemorate!\" as I snapped picture after picture, absorbing the experience through a lens. Now it's all fodder for the blogs. The day I come up with a way of dictating on the fly, the world as we know it will truly have ended.And what does blogging have to do with glass art or business? Everything--or, rather, the Internet has everything to do with them (and I'm not talking about an on-line store).At this winter's Buyer's Market show in Philly I had dinner with a group of fellow artists--many of them long-time show participants--and we commiserated with each other about the Decline of the Show. I have heard lamentation after lamentation that this show used to fill an artist's order schedule for most if not all of the year. Those days were over by the time I started doing it and paying my dues. This year I got enough orders for a few weeks, maybe a month--and I did well. Since I started doing wholesale shows my first automatic reaction to slow sales was to consider adding more shows. But no matter how you slice it, it is very difficult for wholesale shows today to be profitable. I keep trying to convince myself that they are, I keep wanting them to be, but for me, they aren't. The best thing they do is introduce me to new potential buyers, and they have a pretty high cost in terms of time, money and energy for that low return.It used to be that the only way a gallery owner could see an artist's latest work--and could discover new artists whose work would be a good fit for their galleries--was to go to a show or two. But now with the proliferation of the Internet and the abundance of good, cheap digital image technologies, it's easy for gallery owners to discover new treasures from the comfort of their chairs with a laptop warming their legs. I want to get a piece of that action and have them discover me and my work.The trend of shopping from the comfort of your own home existed before the economic winds of woe blew in, but it has been seriously exacerbated and accelerated by them. My big spring orders are not coming from the show this year. They're coming from people who currently carry my work who did not attend the shows. They would probably have been better orders had I been able to talk to the buyers ace to face and personally to show them the new work and colorways, but I can work on making them better next time--without having to count on an in-person interaction. I need a better web presence.The work I do daily here on Blogger and the work I did setting up a Siyeh Studio page on Facebook this week was easy. The people who created the interfaces for them made them quick to create and update and I was up and running in no time. This is not to say that's what I want for a website. I want my website to be unique--not an obvious template--and still easy to update and navigate... and I'm not there yet. Joomla is good, but it's still cumbersome and restrictive.I also want an easy-to-update on-line catalogue with fully-featured image manipulation. I have a catalog at WholesaleCrafts.com, but the interface for updating it is so bad that I am never up to date. I just don't have the days necessary to make changes on it when I have a new colorway to add or items to edit. Joomla's VirtueMart plug-in doesn't seem to be much better so I keep searching.Right now I spend a minimum of a full, exhausting week and $5,000 to do a show. I can't help but think that if I took that money and that time I could come up with something more lasting and with a higher return on investment (the all-important ROI). The Internet is a good research tool too. I could spend some of that time identifying good gallery fits for my work. I could write targeted letters to those gallery owners and send them digital portfolios. I could make my work more accessible to them on the web, and I would have the time to follow up on the relationships I have already made that have languished since the other people in them have stopped coming to the shows. I would have more time with my family and I wouldn't be so tired. I just need to be disciplined about using the week that would have be given to show wisely.The post this morning has been rambling and not at all as tight and coherent as I would have liked. But I wanted to get the beginnings of my process re-work out onto page before it just slips away. The studio is uber busy right now, but soon (really, soon!) I'll have time to come back to the ideas I let go here, and maybe others of you out there will have ideas of your own to add... And we can have a revolution when I get back!"},

It's cold again this morning (will winter never end?) we have a cocker spaniel shivering on the back deck and J's snow angel still decorating in the back yard (J doesn't make snow angels the way other kids do--she's forming the wings on the angel's back in the picture at right). It's supposed to be 76 degrees Saturday. Everything is topsy turvy now from the economy to the weather and it's really shaking up our lives.And speaking of shaken up, the day was so upside down that at 5:15 I am just now finishing this post. *sigh*I wrote a few days ago that it takes a village to run Siyeh Studio, and if anything shows the veracity of that statement--and provides concrete evidence that Atlanta is where I should be right now--it's what I have organized for next week. Dave starts his new job--in Austin--on Monday. I have the Hemispheres showroom to set up in Dallas also on Monday. And the Village steps in. Elaine is driving down from Greenville on Saturday to come with me to Dallas on Sunday. Todd is also coming in on Saturday because he will be taking care of Jessie till I get back on Tuesday.Dave and I have the Waldorf auction to attend on Saturday night and Elaine and Todd are jointly babysitting for it. Though Todd is taking care of Jessie while we're gone, he doesn't drive. So Becky offered (and I ecstatically* accepted) to drive J to and from school every day. Yes, it sounds more like a circus than a village, but I am so grateful for the friends I have made here! They have just stepped in since Dave was laid off and enabled us to keep everything together without sacrificing the child to the tentacled jaguar god and without me disemboweling the spouse (or anyone else) from undiluted stress. And they did it because we are a community, friends, and that's just what friends do. Wow.So it's now 5:30, and I got a lot accomplished today. The Waldorf auction project for the 7th graders proceeds apace (I am fusing it all together today). Orders continue to come in post Buyer's Market (the buyers I did not see but have been meaning to call have been calling me, how great is that?). Dave has taken a hand-off of all the database description and use case data for the ERP system--another thing off my plate. (Is that the first time you've heard the phrase \"use case\"? It's certainly the first time I've used it, but now that I'm working with a high-class software developer, I have to learn the lingo.) Tonight I finish entering and scheduling orders. Tomorrow I put the final touches on the props for the Hemispheres showroom and start making the dvd slideshow of all my work that I am going to leave playing there on continuous loop. Oh yes, and I will make V happy by getting to the *final* bookkeeping items that she has assigned me. Happy Thursday all. It's Manhattan time.*Dave provided the word 'ecstatically' as I needed a substitute for 'gratefully'--too much grateful in too short a space. Then he buffed his nails on his t-shirt and said, \"That's Mr. Thesaurus Boy to you.\""},

Had a little panic attack at 3:00 am (oh no, not them again! Second night in a row) that I had used the wrong firing schedule for the second firing on the mullite shelves. Fingers crossed they came out. (See? Even after 20+ years at this I still worry that kiln loads won't turn out!) New technique for me--making multiple organic pieces from one fused slab. I usually make all my work one piece at a time. But economic necessity has forced some changes this year to stay competitive. It won't be very economic though if I've blown the whole load.Okay, getting ready to head out the door.

Are the songs this morning just tuned perfectly to my life right now or what? There is dry path between piles of ice so I can get to the studio. The sun shines brightly on a freezing cold world. Life goes on.All of Siyeh Studio right now is compartmentalized into before Dallas (setting up the Hemispheres showroom next Monday) and after Dallas. Before Dallas includes such diverse things as getting the books to the accountant (probably won't happen), finishing the auction projects (both my mask example and the wall piece for the 7th grade), organizing and scheduling all the orders (Dave has accepted the ERP assignment again--we have ping-ponging it back and forth and it's his turn to ditz about it) and finding out my spouse's travel schedule for his new employment. It is thought he will need to be onsite, out of state for at least the first two months and then a week at a time every month after that.After Dallas I have Frantic Firing. Becky has asked me to stagger the completion of the orders due to ship on 3/15 so she can pack them in a more leisurely, less physically exhausting way. I can always try. (snort) After Dallas I also have single parenthood, and let me tell you that's not going to be an easy one. I have an amazing partnership with an incredible spouse. I am not a woman who does almost all the child care and feeding and runs her own business too. I am a woman who does about half of the care and none of the feeding (I don't even feed me--Dave has taken to making me lunch every day since he's been home on the dole). I am truly daunted by the prospect of taking on everything, keeping my business growing, and neither warping nor killing Jessie in the process. You think I'm kidding... (Well, I am--at least about the killing part. The warping is entirely possible.)But that's all After Dallas. Nothing exists After Dallas--it's all about the Here and Now.

It's a random choice as Dave controls the music this morning, but it is so incredibly appropriate I can scarce believe it. I posted first this morning on Stranded in the South because this fine Snow Day (J's school and pretty much the rest of Atlanta is shut down this morning due to the snow that fell yesterday) so far is more about family than studio.But studio looms as the snow and ice begin to melt. Yesterday I cut and prepped all the glass cylinders that the Waldorf 7th graders made and they are going to combine them into a really nice wall collage or mirror. As there was no school today, they will have to do it all tomorrow and it might be a bit rushed (I may even need to go and help), but there's no way the end result won't be spectacular.The kilns will warm the studio as I fill and fire them all, and today and tomorrow I will ship the last two orders I have going out between now and mid-March when the BMAC orders start. I do have some pieces to get to Black Cat ArtWorks by Wednesday (hence some of today's kiln loads), but most of my work for the rest of the week will consist of a mask (as an example for the glass summer camp sessions I have donated to the Waldorf Auction--if you're at all interested, the online one is way cheap...), fusing the 7th grade project, and a final few pieces for the Dallas Hemispheres showroom.

It's Sunday, Elaine, Bill, Katie, and Daniel have piled into their car and headed off into the storm towards Greenville and home (it's snowing! Big Fat Flakes!) and the Griffiths repose for a tiny bit before I head to the studio to cut all the solid glass cylinders made by the Waldorf 7th graders into 1/4\" think round slices. It is my optimistic hope that these 2\" wide circles will be laid out by the class into a beautiful wall collage/mirror frame and then fused solid by me... in time for the auction next Saturday. Nothing like leaving things till the last minute!This weekend the Snells came down form Greenville so Elaine could help plan the display for the permanent showroom in Dallas. This project has been very exciting as it is a completely new marketing departure for me. When it was first proposed I thought of it as an extension to my show schedule, but it's really not--it's a completely different market. Now I think of it more as a retail opportunity to work with designers and less as a stocking-buyer market. Given the redefined focus, a display with a bit more art, a bit more flair seemed in order.Todd's original idea for the layout was to have fabric draped on the displays and swirling around the floor to soften the starkness of the plain pedestals and the brown carpet. He and Elaine have extended that idea and now we're covering all the display elements in heavy white cloth to look like the room is being painted (we ended up using table cloths for the purpose as the paint cloths I found are a dingy brown and other fabric from the fabric store is either too thin, too expensive, or both).We have empty, bright silver paint cans to scatter around the space that have chunky frit glued to them like paint drips and Todd's little wire men hanging, sitting, standing and waving long, thin paint brushes with glue-and-frit-dipped tips. Elaine even made two long \"paint spills\" out of pieces of blue and yellow cathedral glass sprinkled with various sizes of frit. I tack fused them yesterday and they look great!I posted last week about the IKEA red chair, and sadly it is too big for the space. It's not a big chair, but it's a really small space (10' X 10' goes fast). Luckily, I have an old, rusty iron stool in the studio that I will clean up and paint black this week that is the perfect size. The 19\" tv is just the right size for the space and the dvd player will give me a an opportunity to hone my mad slideshow skills. The pedestals are out--the contemporary gallery look they provide is not conducive to the art-filled-home-in-the-midst-of-being-painted look we are emphasizing now (and they're too tall for the walls), but the dollar store flat pack furniture is perfect and will be augmented by a couple of cloth-draper cinder blocks.I am taking down my pipes and track lights and replacing them with six floor spots--one of which might even be placed in a paint can (if it has enough clearance around it for the light to cool--don't want to start any fires...). They are 50 watt halogen narrow-beam floods and the lights are only $15 each from Lamps Plus (good online lighting source-cheap, fast, great customer service).The vinyl lettering for the wall sign came and it looks great--I don't know why more people don't use this kind of signage at the BMAC and ACRE shows. It is relatively inexpensive, looks easy to put up, and has a serious dramatic impact! The final thumbs up/thumbs down will come after we finish the real showroom install.Now I'm off to trudge through the snow (Snow! Really! On the ground in Atlanta on March 1!) to the studio so I can finish up work and still have a little family time today."},
{"title": "It Takes More Than a Village (Or The Longest Post EVER)", "date": "Thursday, February 26, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Denver architect series mug, the sound of the spouse washing dishes for background music. It may take a village to raise a child, but it takes more than a village to support me in my Siyeh Studio adventure. Maybe it's the recent Academy Awards ceremony that has me in such a reflective, appreciative mood, but, whatever the cause, today I thank all the  people who are making it possible for me to get through the extreme growth in new directions that I have experienced since last fall. Many people have marveled to me about everything I manage to accomplish in a day, and my standard response is a modest self-deprecation and a list of all the things I don't do that allow me time to do everything else. But the time last week when Dave was off in Austin on a job interview--the two days that felt like two weeks--really opened my eyes to how much other people do on a daily basis to keep Siyeh Studio (and me) running--either for no or for very little pay (or just for love).Thanks go out to Todd for so many things since last year--from helping with the initial field trip for the Waldorf School 7th graders last year to hitting the road with me for three, exhausting wholesale shows to kick off the year. Yesterday we went display shopping and found all the little tables and other display pieces for setting up the Hemispheres showroom in Dallas. We hit Home Depot for bright silver paint cans and drop cloths (important visual elements), a thrift store for tables that they didn't have (what they DID have was a million people shopping--it was 50% off day and the store was packed with check-out lines 10 deep), and finally the dollar store where we found tables, bookcases and a computer desk--that will all be covered with drop cloth and used to hold pieces on stands in the showroom.Becky, the Wunder Assistant, has kept the morceaux flowing, the studio clean(ish), the work shipped, and my brain from spurting out my ears from stress when I just had too much scheduled for even an alien to accomplish. She provided technical expertise and another pair of hands for the 7th grade field trip, kept the garden watered all through the long, hot summer, and faithfully manages all the studio recycling and trash. This week she went Above and Beyond by following Dave to FedEx with the department store shipment (because FedEx wouldn't do a sameday ground pick-up at the studio) and labeling all the boxes there (Dave was the muscle needed to GET the 200 lbs of glass and metal to FedEx) as the clerk scanned them for shipment.Bill Snell is not only a great creative business partner, but he really stepped up to the plate for me at the beginning of this year by building me a wood and steel back-wall display for two shows that he didn't even do. He also came down for a few days to help Todd and me do the set-up for the Atlanta's Mart show. It was his idea that we put together a line of small glass pieces in metal stands to better fit buyers' needs at this year's shows, and he is the one who organized a long working weekend away at their family beach house in Charleston for our two families. That weekend was the single most restful, energizing and motivating business occurrence of the last year for me.I thank Elaine for the incredible sketches and doodles she did while Bill and I talked \"business\" during the weekend away. It is thanks to her proliferation that we ended up with *eight* new stand styles instead of just the one or two Bill and I had thought of. Tomorrow she is coming down (with their whole family) to do a run-through showroom set-up in my studio with Todd and me. Then next weekend she is coming down again to go to Dallas with me to set-up the showroom for real. It was also Elaine who designed and had printed the new Black Cat ArtWorks/Siyeh Studio duplicate order forms that we are using at our shows this year. She is the calm in the eye of our booth set-up storm, and the voice of reason in all our chaos.Dee, Nancy and Sara make up the core of an artist network extraordinaire. Nancy and Sara mentored me through my first Buyer's Market show years ago, and they have provided advice, resources, support, and great dinners at the spring Buyer's Market ever since. Dee helped with the 7th grade field trip and is rolling up her sleeves to help with summer camp too. She also spent many days since the acquisition of the new studio coming down to help move things, set up and organize, fill frit, make morceaux--whatever needed to be done to keep the orders flowing out the door.V is an old friend and my new bookkeeper with whom I am meeting again this morning to put the final touches on my studio books before sending them off to the accountant. For the first year *ever* I did not do three weeks of hair-tearing data entry punctuated by what-the-heck-was-this-for's. I don't know what the state of her hair is, but V did almost all of the entry for a year's worth of studio expenses for me over the past few weeks. She is a fully trained, certified CPA in England, but here in the US (in firm possession of her little green card) she provides very affordable bookkeeping services and unflappable calm to non-profits and flighty, disorganized artists. I am sooo lucky she took me in hand!Dan the carpenter has put a roof over my head and propped up the floor beneath my feet--quite literally--since I got the new studio. This week--after finishing his initial recovery from double hernia surgery--he is going to climb up on the studio roof to affix the chimney caps he made for me while he was convalescing. A few months ago he came on a Saturday afternoon and put in the sidelights for me when I was working under yet another insane deadline so I could get the photos in for the Glass Patterns Quarterly article. He moved glass (not a normal carpenter job), hauled rubbish and did a hundred other things for me just because he is my friend and I was in need.Mike has been perhaps my  supporter longer than anyone else as he and Keith have been patrons of my work since the late 80's--providing much needed income during some pretty lean times. Over the years he has also donated his considerable expertise to my self-promotional efforts in ways that range from writing my artist bio for me to, setting up websites, and creating logos to gifting me with printing services. He started by TAing my Phonetics class and editing my Master's thesis all those years ago at the University of Chicago, and he still cleans up and corrects my grammar (when he can catch me) and keeps me on the marketing track.Finally, there is Dave, the spouse of my days and the love of my heart. I have almost 14 years worth of things for which to thank him both personally and professionally, but here and now I am going to focus on the past couple of weeks. They have been rough for him. He was not prepared to be laid off, and the transition time between jobs--looking for something that will suit him and trying to keep motivated and positive while being at home (he is not good at not working)--have been mind-blowingly stressful. And, yet, during that time, instead of devolving into his navel and having a morose little poor, poor pitiful me party, he has taken on increasingly more of my home duties and he has also become another pair of hands with a car for the studio. He has run studio errands, moved display furniture, is putting together all the furniture I bought yesterday, and makes me lunch every day. He massages muscles tight from stress and exertion, and remains calm and cheerful throughout. I am lucky beyond words to be married to him.There are assuredly people I have Forgotten To Mention, but this post is getting long. When I do think of them, I will jot a note here to remind myself how blessed I am by their presence in my life too."},

Occasionally--but not as often as I would have thought based on the price and apparent ease of installation--at the shows I do some people have cool vinyl signage affixed to the walls of their boothes. Maybe it's the company name or logo in individual letters, maybe it's cute decorative graphics. Whatever it is, it always adds a really nice, professional touch to the display.So in my balls-to-the-wall work mode yesterday I researched various companies offering easy-to-mount vinyl lettering and finally settled on Do It Yourself Letting.com. I ordered \"Siyeh Studio\" in six-inch high letters (Tiger Rag font) and \"Hot Art in Warm Glass\" in three-inch high letters to put on one of my white walls in the Hemispheres showroom. There were other source options that looked good (one company has reusable lettering that costs about 50% more but it can be reused several times--good for shows), but DIYL.com looked like a good starting point.Another display option that I have been contemplating for a few months and finally bit the bullet on yesterday is a monitor for showing a slide show of my complete catalog. I make just too many pieces to take examples of all of them all shows, and, yet, it is my experience that people primarily buy what they see. In the showroom where much of my clientel is likely to be designers looking for custom pieces, it it even more important to have images of my consignment work--kitchen backsplashes, livingroom over-the-mantle installations, large custom windows, etc.I looked at many technology options for a system--from digital picture frames to an old iPod plugged into a monitor--and I finally decided upon a 19\" flat screen lcd TV on a stand with a built in dvd player. It's sleek, it's compact, and--best of all--it's easily updatable technology that a chimp could operate.Digital picture frames are nice, but there is a learning curve to using using them, they have a high size:cost ratio, and updating the images requires swapping out memory cards or sticks. The prices for the latter two have come down drastically in recent years, but they're still more than a writable dvd.  Using the old iPod was great idea in terms of cost and repurposing hardware lying around the house  (I'd ahve to buy a new pc lcd monitor, but it is the cheapest option in price by far), but the usability was problematic and I never did figure out how to get it all connected to work.Given the primary initial use of the system--a permanent installation in a showroom and operated by the showroom manager without my help--a dvd player made the most sense. I haven't read the detailed specs yet, but I think I have sacrificed a little in picture resolution (I think the dvd output is only 720X480 or something like that). However when the system gets shut off and needs to be restarted--as you know it will more than once over the next few months--the showroom manager will have no trouble turning it on and pressing \"Play\". Another advantage to this system is that I can update my slideshow just by sending the showroom a new dvd and asking them to swap it out. Low(ish) cost, low tech, high output. And what would a picture show be without a chair? The pic at right is the IKEA piece Dave picked up for me earlier in the week to put in the showroom too.Time to get to the studio. An order to ship, two loads to fire, and a shopping trip with Todd to get more supplies for the showroom ahead of me in the day."},

I blog from the iMac this morning as Dave has taken my laptop into the Apple store to have the IO board replaced... Oh I'm in withdrawal. I actually used graph paper to plan something out this morning instead of Excel (Microsoft Excel is my all-purpose drafting application... go figure).The Waldorf School  of Atlanta (J's school) has begun their on-line auction as of yesterday. One of the items I donated--a week of summer camp studying masks in various cultures and creating masks in glass based on them is up on the site. Thanks *very* much to Licha Ochoa Nicholson for permission to use the image of her Prairie Falcon Kachina Mask as the picture for the auction item. As usual I am waaaay behind and didn't have a suitable glass mask image  to use for the online auction. (The photo is from the 2007 Taylor Kinzel glass show--Licha is on the left.)It's Tuesday and I am succumbing to yet *another* cold. Actually I think this might be the same cold I had before, it's just a version that incubated and mutated in Dave while I was in Philadelphia and is now nestling back into me. *sigh* No, I'm not going to the doctor. It's a virus, there's nothing she can do but suggest lots of rest (hah!), lots of fluids (and wine doesn't count--in fact it counts against), and waiting it out.Though I am sickening, there is no rest for the wicked or the glass-impaired. I have orders to ship today, the 7th grad auction project to continue, shopping for the permanent showroom with Todd, metal orders to get to Bill from the BMAC, and my own firing schedule for the show to complete. Thank heaven I have a currently unemployed spouse! Yesterday he schlepped 200 (literally 200) lbs of work to FedEx as they wouldn't do a same-day ground pick-up for me and the first department store order *had* to ship yesterday. Today he is mailing my showroom contract for Dallas and taking my laptop in for repair. I am going to owe him big by the end of the week."},
{"title": "When Your Work Is Admired...", "date": "Monday, February 23, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, the sound of the Music of the Spheres wind chimes out on the deck and the chirping and chattering of birds at the feeders for music. I'm not actually sitting on the back deck as it's not warm enough for me to be out there this morning--the pond is iced over again--but the sounds from there carry clearly into the quiet house.I didn't post over the weekend. I promised a post, and I didn't deliver. In part I didn't post because it was a tough, packed, long weekend. But mostly I didn't post because I promised a difficult post that I am reluctant to write. Why? Because a blog is a *very* public forum, and this is a delicate issue. On the other hand it's also a very real, professional issue that many artists have to confront, and what I write could help both them and me as I reconcile my feelings about the situation and attempt to move on.But can I write from a perspective that would even close to approximate fair and even? What I write is always what happened in a given situation from *my* point of view. Any time two people disagree there are always two points of view. I could try to present both here, but ultimately all I have is my point of view and my *understanding* of the other person's point of view and motivation. I spent the weekend seesawing back and forth as to if that would be enough. Would it be fair to put out into the world an issue that I believe to have been caused by an honest misinterpretation and no deliberate ill intent and which I also believe to be resolved? My final answer is, Yes. Another friend--whose father is a lawyer--told me during the show that a contract is not created as a starting point for litigation. A contract is created at the beginning of a relationship to communicate expectations, roles, responsibilities and recourse in the relationship. It is meant to avoid confusion, confrontation and legal action.So I write this post to lay out the important details of what happened, and to record where I believe we go from here. It both celebrates the positive, amicable outcome reached by respectful communication and honest good will, and serves as a reminder to me later on of my expectations in our continued relationship.A friend and colleague with whom I established a collaboratory relationship a couple of years ago and for whose metal work I have made several panels of glass in my Morceaux de Verre style has had a hard year. It has been both personally and professionally tough due to death and the economy. As we sentient beings do in stressful times, he looked for something  he could do to improve his situation both emotionally and economically. Through a series of circumstances including the almost accidental acquisition of a second-hand kiln, he hit upon making his own glass panels for his metal sculptures. So far so good.A couple of other friends who are also kilnformers showed him the basics of fusing glass, and he started with what he knew he liked and wanted for his work--panels of blended, transparent bands of frit in bright, primary colors. In short, he started with my pieces. He did not set out to copy them--in fact he made some conscious changes in the way he laid out the glass so that it wouldn't be copying. He looked at the pieces I made for his sculptures, took what he liked best about them and used that as a jumping off point for the pieces he made to put in his new sculptures and to bring to the show. Unfortunately, those pieces that he brought to the Buyer's Market were still too close in style to my work. When I looked at them from a distance I had a hard time telling which were his and which were mine cut down. The situation was further complicated and aggravated by the presence of some of my work in other sculptures in his booth.So what did I do? For once, I did exactly what I should have done. I talked to him about my issues with his new work as calmly and supportively as I could. He is my friend and a fellow artist. I fully support his need to expand his work in new creative directions and media. I appreciate that he likes the look of blended waves of transparent-colored frit on a clear base with a particular hue and color saturation--and I recognize that Bullseye frit comes in a narrow set of colors and both the thickness of the finished piece and the use of a clear base dictate to some extent the final color saturation.However the bottom line is that not only is his work derivative of mine (it is undeniable that he started with the pieces I made for him), it is still close enough in style that the creator is not clear to my customers--who in at least one case that I know of are also his customers. He needs to continue to develop his own style so that by our next show together (the end of May) our work is obviously and at a glance made by different artists.I think (I hope) I communicated everything in this post to him in the way a friend and fellow artist would, and I have every expectation that both he and I will be happy with his new direction in May. He has indicated that he would still like me to create large pieces for him--the ones he is making are just for his new, smaller line--and I am completely open to continuing this arrangement. Now let's hope it all just works out."},
{"title": "Crunching the Numbers for the Spring Buyer's Market", "date": "Friday, February 20, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans skyline mug, \"Gone Daddy Gone\" (Violent Femmes cover) by Gnarls Barkley (from Ren's Happy, Happy mix) streaming from the iMac in the office to the Apple TV and the main home AV receiver. Technology: I came, I saw, I opened a big can of whup booty and I am the Mistress of My Domain again. At some point I'll post on Stranded in the South about the technology shifts we are making in our continuing efforts to downsize the monthly subscription budget (the economy starts at home, after all), but today is for a recap of the Buyer's Market of American Craft.First off, why is it taking longer and longer to recover from shows? It used to be that I was in the studio the day after I got home and operating at almost full power (or is that the golden glow of hindsight?). This year it took one full day off followed by one marginal day before I got back to full strength (today). But enough whining, o to the numbers.Before the show opened there were already rumblings that attendance was going to be way down--both from artists and from buyers. But as the Rosen Group repeatedly said, the people who came came to buy not to browse. Anyone who put out the money for the trip did so not for a tax write-off but because they needed product. And far be it from me to toe the party line, but it does seem like the exhibitors who did well at the show were the ones who took to heart all the tips and advice the Rosen Group passed out before the show. These exhibitors did targeted, personal marketing--handwritten notes or phone calls to their galleries, etc., put out new lines of lower-priced work, and offered incentives for writing orders at the show like free shipping or a 10% show discount.Personally, my show was not very good--but I only followed one of the above recommendations (new lines of lower-priced work). Had I not had all the new work with Todd (retail $12-$70) and the new stand pieces from Black Cat ArtWorks (retail $80), I would have died in the water. I only had *one* order for my traditional functional fused work--even though I have several older pieces retailing for under $100, and only a couple of orders for larger (more expensive) stand pieces--certainly not enough to cover meals for the trip, much less booth fee.Crunching the numbers, I had 38 orders, 61% of which were from new customers. Of that 61%, only 18% were also new to Black Cat (the rest were their existing customers). I know that presentation of the figures looks a bit sloppy, but I can't reach my spouse to ask him what percentage of my new customers were piggy-backed from Black Cat--which is the point I am trying to make. For the first time we completely integrated our work in our slightly-larger-than 20 X 20 booth. As a result, many of their current customers took a closer look at our combined work and gave it a try. It's true they only ordered the new small stands, but I'm guessing these galleries are not ones that carry a lot of glass art anyway.Galleries heavily weighted to glass work were scarce on the ground. I am now exhibiting in the Inspired Interiors section of the show--not the Glass section anymore--so I didn't see the glass traffic personally, but I did check in with many friends exhibiting in glass and the stories were not good. I only spoke to one person who had a really good show (congrats Dee!), and she has lower-priced glass jewelry (lower priced than, say, large blown-glass sculpture). From others I heard of no orders written by Monday afternoon. On Tuesday morning in the elevator at the hotel on the way to the airport I met a couple who have exhibited in glass for the past 23 years and they said it was their last show. I didn't think it was an appropriate time to ask what they had done to prepare for the show in the face of a very difficult economy.Having 61% new orders seems like a really good thing--and it is, but it was off-set by significantly smaller sales numbers. My average sale at the February show was $450. By August it was $760. This February it was $191 and my total sales were 64% of what they were last February and 60% of what they were for last year's summer show. What do all these numbers mean? They mean if I want to get back up to where I was last year, I'm going to have to hit the phones and the mail.Since I got back from the show I have heard from a couple of other longtime glass exhibitors and they are looking at their gallery lists and calling everyone they didn't see. In an admittedly small sample, one of my friends called 10 of her customers in one day and of them 30% are out of business, 30% ordered from the phone call, 20% recently ordered and are fine, and 20% said the pieces they previously ordered aren't moving. I wonder what I am going to find out when I start calling my customers. Better get to it.I close with pics of the new small stand pieces. Tomorrow's post: When is it natural extension, when is it admiration, and when is it just copying? Welcome to the working Saturday..."},

Frankly, I really do not have time to futz around with system administration, but like it or not that appears to be my fate today. When the Apple store gets the new IO board in for my laptop, I will have to take it back in for another couple of days. In the meantime, I got yet another external back-up drive (this one firewire and USB instead of just USB) and I am backing up everything I have not yet lost--all business and personal data files and applications--to it. I also got a copy of R-Studio for Mac and am attempting to recover all the images and music files lost from the iMac. It has been A DAY.Add to the day completing the paperwork for the permanent showroom in Dallas (and upping my general liability insurance for the studio to $1,000,000 as part of the process), chasing down the PO for the department store (and filing their eBiz payment paperwork) so I can get that order shipped, and... ack! ack! ack!Need to take a break from the chaos and talk about one of the Hot Topics at the BMAC: The Eco Arts and Fair Trade Market slated to debut at this year's summer Buyer's Market and planned to co-run with it every February and August. I unfortunately missed the beginning of the wrap-up meeting for the artists on Monday morning, but from what I gathered during the last half of the meeting the idea of having an international arts and crafts market--socially conscious or not--in conjunction with an all-American/Canadian show was not well-received by the Buyer's market Exhibitors and--at least the \"Fair Trade\" portion--was cancelled for this summer. It will be interesting to see how this project, endorsed by the Rosen Group, proceeds.The stacks of papers have not gone away and it's already dinner time. Got to order a pizza for me and the Sprout (what, you think I'm cooking? Remember last time? Breakfast AND dinner...). I'll fire tomorrow--at least the computers on the kilns work!

I refuse to be troubled by the petty whims of the the technology at whose mercy I exist!I am back from Philadelphia and feeling a bit... broken, myself. It's not the it was a particularly brutal show--in point of fact I think it was the least brutal Phillie show I've had. But the cumulative efforts of the past few months from Dave's work on the election, the annual Christmas craziness, adding Atlanta and Dallas to the show schedule, driving to Dallas, and setting up the permanent showroom, topped off by the emotional and mental stress of this year's Buyer's Market were just too much for me.I woke up yesterday with no awareness of myself or my surroundings. I had shut down all mental and emotional faculties and moved like a zombie through the day. It was so bad that I managed to lose the power cord for my laptop and left my iPhone and my silver yucca necklace at the security checkpoint at the airport. I had had breakfast and was halfway down the breezeway to the plane by the time I realized I didn't have the necklace or the phone. With a panicked \"I can't leave without them, you take my carry on bags\" to Todd, I ran (literally) through the terminal back to security. My belongings were there waiting for me and I made it back to the plane just as the last passengers were boarding. I slept through the flight--in spite of having three very large people in our row on the plane. The rest of the afternoon at home was very low-key (I think, I don't remember it too well) and I slept 12 hours last night.Today I *should* do things too numerous to enumerate, but I had a leisurely breakfast with Dave and the J, and now we're going to Fernbank Museum of Natural History to see the dinosaur exhibit. This afternoon I will have to address the issues with my laptop as Dave is heading to Austin tomorrow for a job interview and will therefore not be available to swap batteries with me so I can move all my data to the desktop and work on it if the laptop has to go in for repair. I will do my show review (including info from the wrap-up meeting), an update on the copying work issue, and a report on the Fair Trade show soon. Really.

It's the last day of the Buyer's Market of American Craft (BMAC) and I am waaaay behind in posting. Not surprisingly, I am behind because I have been out networking and socializing every night and the stop and start activity on the show floor are not conducive to thoughtful posting. And if a show ever deserved thoughtful posting, it's this one.So I put up a micro-post quickly this morning to introduce the topics to come in the next three posts, and then I rush off to the annual artists' wrap-up meeting with Wendy Rosen and her staff (the Rosen Group puts on the BMAC). I don't usually go to the wrap-up meetings, but this year I am very curious to hear how they are going to spin the launch of the Fair Trade market spearheaded by Wendy's daughter that is going to be held down the hall from the summer BMAC. (Hot Show Topic #1) While I support the empowerment of women in disadvantaged countries, I can't see any way that having a market with lower-cost foreign-made goods placed cheek to jowl with a market specifically aimed at promoting the work of American and Canadian craft artists cannot be both a conflict of interest and detrimental to the American and Canadian artists who have struggled to build a clientele from the summer show. Piggy-backing is only really good for the pig on the back...Good thing today is typically a slow show day as later on after the wrap-up meeting I need to continue a conversation I am having with another artist who liked my work so much that for the past two years he has had me design glass pieces for him to incorporate into his work. This year--due mostly to the downturn in the economy--he purchased a kiln and is making his own glass pieces for his metal sculpture (perfectly fine) that bear an uncanny resemblance to the pieces I created for him--and thus my entire production line--(not at all fine, and Hot Show Topic #2).Hot Show Topic #3--and the least surprising, most expected, fortunately planned for topic--is the effect of the economy on my the sales figures for the show. I have been crunching numbers since yesterday afternoon and will have that post ready to go up when the doors close and the last order is in at the end of the day.A final note: I think I broke Todd again--this time with my snoring. I found him sleeping in a nest of all his bedclothes and pillows on the bathroom floor this morning with the door closed and his little white noise fan in with him. I asked him why he didn't wake me up if I was snoring so loudly, and he said he tried several times and failed. Oh dear. I think I'll leave him sleeping this morning for a few extra hours. Breakdown tonight is going to be brutal enough."},
{"title": "The Neverending Day", "date": "Friday, February 13, 2009", "text": "So many days ago it feels like a lifetime, coffee was a Starbuck's iced mocha with an extra shot of espresso at the gate in Hartsfield airport. My music a few hourslater was an exhibitor services electrician talking about how bad the car show here in the Philadelphia Convention Center was. In between the coffee and the electrician was the flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia with its thought-provoking visual vignettes. In hindsight I wish I had captured them with my camera as I doubt my prose will trigger even half the reaction I had to seeing them.The image that has most stayed with me was a view from the plane as we were leaving Atlanta. We flew over a relatively new, tidily planned, subdivision with identically sized lots and very similar boxy houses all in beige (or maybe that's just what it looked like from a distance). It had the little winding streets all subdivisions seem to have now, and a balancing number of cul-de-sacs--normal Americana. What looked to be right across the street but was probably a couple of blocks away was a junkyard. From the distance and up in the air, the junkyard with its little winding truck paths between the towering piles of trash looked just like the subdivision. Same footprint, same little cul-de-sac dead ends, same quaint charm (or lack thereof). Sadly, more normal Americana. I slept the rest of the flight, and by 11:45 am we had our luggage, were checked in at our hotel, and were at the Buyer's Market of American Craft (BMAC).The electrical layout of our booth was screwed up (hence the afore-mentioned conversation with the electrician), but it was quickly fixed. Then we had to wait another hour and a half for exhibition services to find two of our crates that they managed to lose between their storage unit and our booth. Too bad it was the crates with the foamcore and gridwalls that went on walkabout as we couldn't do anything but wait for them--and have lunch.The first day ended relatively early (6:30 pm) with the gridwalls and foamcore up and ebullient spirits in all as we looked forward to a pretty easy second day putting up lights and artwork. As usual, we were deluded--lucky for us we all got what wanted out of the rest of the evening so we were prepared for the next day. Bill went back to their hotel and crashed, and Elaine and Todd and I went for fondue and martinis at the Melting Pot (a fondue restaurant). I have always been amazed how people will pay more for dinner out if they have to cook it themselves--but it sure was fun thanks to Billy and Alexis (our servers).Yesterday we followed the program (it was a set-up day) and at 8:00 am we threw ourselves enthusiastically into putting the work up in Our Best Booth Ever. By the time we finished last night at 11:00 pm, I was too pooped to post. We stopped for a bite in the Marriott hotel cafe as we had to walk by it to get to our hotels and it was still open, and then we went our seperate ways to crash.This morning the show begins--I still have to do pricing (what else is new?), and Todd has to figure out a way to display garden stakes, but we're ready to go.

Today I ship my new work, the Walker system, Todd's work, post cards and any other odds and sods I can think of for the show to my hotel in Philly. The drayage charges from Hargrove exhibition services are just too high to have them shipped to the show (and I'm probably too late, in any case).

Tomorrow Bill and Elaine (Black Cat ArtWorks) are going to drop some metal pieces off in the studio on their way to the Atlanta airport where they fly out for Philly.

Dave was very upset that I had canceled the trip, and after a weekend of fidgeting the finances--business and personal--I found a way to squeeze it in. Dave's right--the professional development I will get out of the conference and the post-conference workshop will more than offset the up-front cost, and I really can't compare the expense for BECon with the expense of doing the Atlanta and Dallas shows. They're truly apples and oranges.Final news of the day/weekend, I got an email from someone I know because of my book, and he was wondering when I was going to write another one. I said after the first one, \"Never again!\", but now I'm not so sure. I can think of three books that would be fun to do and topical too.

There will be three or four loads fired today as I attempt to fill all the Atlanta, Dallas and asap orders that need to ship before the BMAC. The loading of the kilns will fit in around dances with bookkeepers as V is coming over this afternoon to produce the order she has created from my chaos.Though it seems really odd to--myself--put barcoded, professionally printed, retail price tags on signed, handcrafted work, the hangtags and stickers are all ordered and should arrive next week. Whew! I have reached a new level in merchandising. (I type this to the background music of my husband verbally inputting his to-do list into Jott on his new phone--need to get him a hands-free thingie for it, borg him up.)And that's the day laid out. I have yet to figure out how I'm going to get the glass for the new mermaid piece to Philly (it's 14\" X 28\" and oddly shaped)--in addition to the glass for the nine new pieces we designed last weekend and the double lattice. But I'll think of something."},

How scary is that? A lot of people are finding out the answer to that question right now. I wish I could take comfort in the solidarity of numbers. After the incredible job he did on CNN's election project during the past three years and the video project before that, his reward was to have his position eliminated and to find himself out of a job. Times are tough everywhere, and it's no different for Fortune 500 companies.Last night we had two ways to go, and we chose to celebrate. We shared a good bottle of champagne left over from New Year's Eve and toasted the opportunities and the pathways life opens up to us. It is the best of times, it is the worst of times--and change is always scary. Though we celebrated we are also making cautious cuts and the first things to go were Jessie's trip to Philadelphia and my attendance of BECon this summer. I was really looking forward to the Lost Wax post-conference workshop and the kilncasting sessions, but I already blew my theoretical financial wad slated for professional growth and business expansion on doing the January gift shows in Atlanta and Dallas. I just can't justify another big expense that doesn't have an immediate benefit (other than joy) attached to it. Celebrate opportunity or not, it seems an... inappropriate... time for joy alone.Yesterday I had thought of a Kavarna day today, little did I know how likely it was! So we sit with our laptops at Kavarna sipping mochas and listening to perky new millennium pop. D polishes the resume--nibbles are already coming in (he is a genius, after all), and I polish up the ERP specs to hand over to him--this being an opportunity to get him to code it for me that I can't pass up.

About ready to open it up to the world and put it on the website--along with the summer camp. I need a Kavarna day badly. Maybe D can swing one tomorrow...I bought ten UPC codes and managed to get them for under $7 each. These are real GS1 codes that came with a certificate of authenticity, not just barcodes that I whipped up with barcode generating software--and more's the pity as the images are BIG and the vendor recommends not scaling them down more than 10%. Adventures in retailing... This morning I'll assign them to the products for the new dept store client and play around with printing them. Need to get the correct Avery Dennison label number from my sales rep...Orders continue to come in, some from the Atlanta show and some from buyers who won't be at the BMAC. I can't wait to get the new stands from Black Cat so I can announce those pieces--I think they are going to be great sellers this spring/summer as we all hunker down to wait out this recession. Between the firing hiatus for Philly and the orders that are in, the firing schedule is looking pretty full till the end of the month.

J is off to school, D is off to work, and the aquarium, coffee maker, and grinder are freshly cleaned (not together). It's 8:00 am. I should go on business retreats more often. No post Friday as I was on Sullivan's Island with my family and the Snells. It was ostensibly a booth-design weekend, but--as usually happens when we get together--we got not only a solid booth plan for the BMAC but also a new product line (hanging window panels) and a series of tabletop pieces (to add to our existing line) at a spectacular price point that we will be debuting at the BMAC. So we went from no completely new work for the Buyer's Market (we did have some pieces and colorways haven't been shown there yet, but we had them in Atlanta and Dallas) to 4-9 completely new pieces. Of that potential nine, eight glass pieces in steel stands will retail for around $80... Yes, you can say it was a great weekend.I am a convert to the several-day business planning meetings away from home and work. I could have gone to Greenville for a day, or Bill and Elaine could have come to my studio as we've done before, but having two and a half days with everyone away from their \"offices\" to brainstorm, go away and think and then come back together again for more idea exchange was incalculably valuable. My batteries are recharged, and my zest and enthusiasm for what I do are renewed--after the Atlanta and Dallas shows they were all dangerously depleted. Yes, there is a pretty high cost for dropping everything else for three days, but, no matter how busy I am for the rest of this week, I still come out ahead. Now off to fill out forms, return phone calls and emails, and get this party started!"},

Yep, J's going to Philadelphia again. This should make the trip MUCH better for Todd. And airline fares just keep dropping--her ticket on Delta non-stop was $127 + tax. However I don't have to pay anything for one checked bag and she has to pay $15. I'm still almost tempted to buy myself another ticket and pay the change fee on the one I have and use it to go somewhere else. Mine cost over twice as much as hers and she's sitting right next to me!Today I ship two orders and meet with V about the sorry state of my bookkeeping. *sigh* I know she won't be judgmental or laugh at me (at least out loud) but it is in a really sorry, sad state. Then this afternoon we head to Charleston to plan for the Buyer's Market with Bill and Elaine. There's work to figure out (and to make and ship on my return to Atlanta), and a booth to design. I'm already tired. I would love to go back to bed for a couple of hours as I have just been unable to shake this sapping cold virus. But I'm off to be perky! And fire!And speaking of firing... I called Olympic kilns yesterday and they walked me through unlocking the cone firing schedules on the kiln controller for Little Boy (the small kiln). Turns out that he's rated to fire to 2400 degrees F so I can fire ceramics in him. Yesterday I bisque-fired a little terracotta play house that Jessie made for her littlest pets. The built-in firing schedules are very basic (cone #, speed: fast, medium or slow, and hold time) and I have no idea how long the \"slow\" fire I picked should take. For all I know, it's still firing. I'm looking forward to being able to make and fire my own molds now--and making their own clay slumping/casting molds will be a great project for the summer camp participants.Now off to shower, dress, and brush my teeth before V arrives.

Maybe the Counting Crows believe that this year will be better than the last, but I am not so optimistic. Last year was a great year for business growth for me in terms of sales. Maybe the goal this year should be to focus on growth areas for a slow economy, e.g., more open studio sessions, summer camp, and other opportunities for growth at home rather than national growth on the road in sales. This is not to say that I will stop doing shows and advertising--I think it's a great time to drive forward and get in front of as many potential buyers as possible. But my expectation on returns is much lower and if I want to continue to grow--or even to hold to last year's revenue--I am going to have to be more creative.This is also a good year to hone my skills, and to that end I have registered for BECon. I was stuck on which post-conference workshop I wanted to take more--Linda Ethier on Lost Wax or Richard Whitely on Kiln-Casting. Fortunately for my poor overworked brain, the Whitely workshop is wait-listed already so I am going for lost wax. Yea! Now I jut need to work out my airfare. Hope I can scramble together enough miles/reward points for it as Portland looks EXPENSIVE from Atlanta. Maybe I'll just wait till the last minute again like I did with Todd's Philadelphia ticket and hope for the best. (As my Travel Rewards redemption page appears to be BROKEN waiting might be my only option!).Yesterday I began the process of setting up a summer camp program. Initially I am going to offer two week-long sessions in July. The curriculum for each week includes presentations on the use of ceremonial masks in various cultures in the morning, and instruction in glass as an artistic medium in the afternoon. Each camp participant will create and bring home one or more (time permitting) glass masks in the style of one of the cultures presented during the week. Resources I am using for teaching materials include: The Maya :Life, Myth and Art, Masks: Faces of Culture, Carnival Masks of Venice: A Photographic Essay, Masks of the World, Inventing Masks, and (I hope) Giinaquq--Like a Face. The last one won't be published until May. Camp will run 10-4 Mon-Fri and will be open to rising fifth graders and older. Cost is $350 including all tools and materials, and camp size is limited to 8 participants per week. Early drop-off and late pick-up will be available at no charge as studio time for the participants to work on their projects.I expect to teach several basic casting and mold-making techniques that I am already familiar with, and I hope to add new ideas and techniques gleaned from my time at BECon. If there is enough demand, I hope to expand to more sessions and to add sessions during the school-year breaks. I love teaching and I finally feel like there is an area to which I can contribute meaningfully. I am just not cut out to teach vanilla basic kiln-forming. but kiln-forming with a direction, with an anthropoloical/sociological context... ah, now that's right up my alley."},
{"title": "Too Early Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, January 27, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the Denver skyline mug, \"Cloudy This Morning\" on iTunes (again). It *is* cloudy this morning, and misty, and foggy, and rainy, and a perfect day for melancholy Winston. The firing schedule is done. I could complete all my orders for Atlanta and Dallas by the middle of next week but won't as some of them aren't due 'til May. Yesterday I ordered my first special run of Bullseye glass--the 0313 dense white that they no longer make. It isn't for me, it's for a friend, but it feels quite cool nonetheless to special order a half case of glass that requires it's own production run.The EDI (electronic data interchange--a communications interface required by my new department store client) mountain is both surmountable and put-offable. I have 90 days to comply so we can all get through this first order cycle and see where the relationship is going before I make a further investment into it--and if I end up having to make the investment, I found a solution at a reasonable cost. Getting UPC barcodes for my pieces, however, is another matter. Barcodes turn out to be very pricey.There is one central US organization that handles assignment of barcodes. If I went through them directly it would cost me $1,575 to set up and an annual subscription fee of $500 to maintain... Right. The idea of putting a universal product code on something handmade is already ludicrous, and paying that much to do it? I think not... My casino client also inquired if I UPC coded my products and they were fine with the answer \"No\". Let's hope the department store will be as reasonable. The least expensive official codes seem to be about $25-$35 each and I would need 10 to start. I really don't want to have to go that route.Today I ship the first Siyeh Studio/Bentwell Metals order. I thought to get it out yesterday, but, alas, I was on the phone ALL DAY LONG! Not today. (Honest to Pete, all I want to do right now is sleep. I may have to give in for an hour and come back to the computer [hopefully] refreshed. A coffee with an extra shot of espresso in it isn't even helping.) At least it's a credit card on ship order so I'll get paid today too (I already paid Todd his share when I picked up the work).I chug along to prepare for the BMAC in Philly, and I hope it's a better show than the two so far have been (it almost can't help but be). Just over a full week of production work out of two major shows is ludicrous--not to mention bankrupting."},

The costs of just the EDI may put this account out of my reach (set-up from one EDI vendor is $1,900 with another $100/month fee). I am waiting to hear back from the second (the client only works with these two EDI providers) to see if they have a more cost-effective solution for the smaller-than-small business. I am also waiting to hear back from my buyer about the true necessity of UPC coding. If I have to regretfully decline this order because I cannot comply with the terms, it will mean Dallas was an absolute bust with nothing more to redeem it than its status as a tax deduction.Today we ship the first Siyeh Studio/Bentwell Metals pieces ordered at the shows. I also head back to ikebana after a long hiatus, and I hope to work with V to get back on track for my finances.

I have settled the in-laws in with their daily Sudoku, Baxter is enthusiastically shaking his stuffed squirrel while casting occasional longing glances out to the back deck at the real squirrels. Ah the springtime, er, late winter in Atlanta.Today is a day of deadlines and dues. Hargrove exhibitor services forms are due for the BMAC. Last night I got Todd a ticket to Philly for $156 roundtrip--for those of you out there who have been waiting for fares to the BMAC to drop, now's the time. He is on the exact same flights as I am, and I paid $305 for my ticket. :-( The buyer for my new department store is chomping at the bit for images and stacks and stacks of forms from me. I should have made it more clear that I am not back in the studio till Monday.  But a sick day is a good day to shuffle paper and pretend there is some money in the finances I have to do. Advertising deadlines for Wholesalecrafts and New Retailer magazine are now, NICHE and American Style are either just past or just looming. As much as I spent on the Atlanta's Mart, The Dallas Finds Temp show, the lease on a permanent showroom (Nancy, I will do a post next week on the details of leasing a showroom), and now the rest of my booth and services fees for the BMAC... I don't think I can afford any advertising--even on credit. Gulp. Scary times.Being gone for two weeks I didn't get caught up on my Quickbooks and so missed getting my annual sales tax filed and paid for Georgia by the 20th. Got to get to that today--and must, must, MUST get the desktop machine set-up for V the new bookkeeper so I don't miss sending out my 1099's by their deadline (next week, I think).Now that I am partnering with two other companies I have doubled the work I have to do managing orders to them and shipping all of our joint products. I am going to have to evaluate ways to streamline both processes so they don't suck all my time out of my ears. And I have to compile and send out the orders from Atlanta and Dallas to both of them so they can get busy with their parts.I'm too muzzy-headed from cold meds to post more--or more coherently--this morning, so I'll be off now to shuffle the papers and chase the elusive dollar through the finances."},

I put my foot down and \"frickin'\" is out. \"Freakin'\" is ok. Am I out of line?Dallas is over, I am home, and I have a horrid cold. Sometimes life is just not fair. Tomorrow the in-laws arrive for a long weekend, the dogs have an appointment at the groomer's, the cleaning people come, and it's Jessie's turn to bring snack for Girl Scouts. I found out/was reminded about all of those events in various emails this morning. I knew the in-laws were coming, I just mis-wrote their arrival date. The others I either knew nothing about or had totally forgotten. By the afternoon everyone will have come or gone and I will nap. Bliss.But let's go back to Dallas and start with breakdown. It would have been better if we could have used the freight elevator to move the display and work pieces from our booth on the 13th floor down to my new permanent showroom in Hemispheres Design Center on the 9th floor, but they were just too full. So every piece, every pedestal, each light bar, tool and step stool were hand-carried one at a time down four floors of escalator. Boy did that get old fast! Todd and I then set-up my little 10 X 10 space with one huge window and two 7-foot high sidewalls.When we were done in the showroom, (about 9:00 pm) we went back to our booth and began breakdown in earnest. Truth be told, Todd continued breakdown in earnest (he had already been working on it at the end while I was in the showroom) while I ran around trying to get someone in exhibitor services to take my POV (personally owned vehicle) form so they could come and load us up. I got a scary tour of the freight elevators and docks one and two before I was able to find anyone but a security guard. Turned out that even though they had told me at 7:00 that they would be loading until midnight and I would be fine as long as I got my form in by 10:00, the reality was that they were pretty much done by 8:00 and let all the loading people go at 9:00...Hoo boy. A supervisor and one hastily commandeered worker loaded the booth contents onto a couple of dollies, brought them down the freight elevator and crammed it into the car. They were mostly empty boxes that I probably should have broken down, but I was just too sick and tired. Literally. Not too long after 10:00 saw us in the drive-through at a 24-hour Burger King on the way to our hotel (ah, the glamorous life of an artist on the road!). Then all that was left in Dallas for us was a hotel for which I paid (non refundably) one night too many (through Wednesday morning), and a sleepless night from over exhaustion and the horrible cold. Todd told me I coughed and snored like a sailor all night. I knew I was loud as I woke myself with my own snores several times. At one point he said I cried out, \"No! No, no no, no! No! No!\" and he couldn't decide if I was talking to him or having a nightmare.The next day there was the drive home. Todd does not drive--doesn't even have a driver's license--so I was on steering wheel duty all day. I didn't have a book to listen to (for which Todd was profoundly grateful) but the iPod didn't let us down and we listened to 118 songs before I stopped counting. A book would have been better at keeping me awake, but Todd's occasional just-for-the-heck-of-it scream worked too.Notable quotes for the day included the following three:When we were ready to leave the hotel, Todd came out of the bathroom wearing a t-shirt with \"Mr. Happy\" written on it under the cartoon of a donkey's head, commenting, \"I need a t-shirt that says 'Art Kills' \". (Dave thinks he needs one that says \"I suffer for my art, now it's your turn!\").Mid-morning Todd dozed off, and I decided to go ahead and switch the clock and the GPS to eastern time as that's when we would arrive. I didn't do it to be mean or anything. Really. A few minutes later he woke up and groggily commented, \"Wow, it felt like I was only asleep about 10 minutes and over an hour has passed!\". When I told him what I had done he leaned forward and started banging his fists on the dashboard sobbing, \"I just want to be home!\".Mid-afternoon we pulled into a gas station for a potty and snack break and Todd couldn't get his door open. I thought maybe he had his seat belt stuck in it so I asked, \"What's caught in it?\". To which he replied, \"My last nerve\". But we made it home.Pics are of the new showroom space--including a map with the showroom location in the design center and the design center's location on the floor.

After my shower and other morning ablutions I emerged to see a little bit of a tousled head and one foot peeking from under the covers of Todd's bed. A plaintive little voice said, \"Can I stay in the room today?\". What could I say? Ten straight days on the road at gift shows in a devastatingly grim economy as an introduction to the wholesale world would suck the soul out of anyone. I left him to sleep and went to hold down the fort, I mean booth, on my own--not a difficult task I fear.Last night ended with an order from a new client right at 6:00--and they took us to dinner after we met up with my friends Mike and Jeanne. Margaritas, queso, chips and empanadas at Primo's followed by sake and a volcanic platter at Deep Sushi... no wonder Todd stayed in today!Favorite conversation of the day so far, three women walking past the booth:Woman #1: These are beautiful.Woman #2: But.Woman #3: Yeah, *but*.Our work is overwhelmingly appreciated, and universally perceived as too expensive. It's weird to have one of the highest price points in the show.----------------------------------------The day unfolded in unexpected, but hoped for, ways. I took another small order this morning for Todd's work... and then I signed a lease for a permanent space in one of the Market Center-owned design showrooms. Wow. But I couldn't resist. It's a great 10 X 10 space in the front window off the atrium on the 9th floor. I got back to the room tonight and handed the design process to Todd whose response was, \"Anything you would like, Mistress Brenda.\" Todd did the display windows for a local Atlanta gallery for over 20 years, he is incredibly talented at it, and I am lucky to have been given this opportunity while he is here with me. Now off to my shower, room service, and a glass of wine (or three). Pics are of the booth including one from across the atrium.

You can't help looking, and you're really glad it's not you.I think I'll start the post today with notable quotes from the show: A woman on a scooter chair came into the booth and talked to Todd while I was at lunch and said, \"I'm here to give you a pep talk. I like to go into booths with beautiful artwork where the artist is sitting there and not selling anything, and I like to give 'em a pep talk.\" Are we that obvious? I need to goose Todd up a bit... Then there was the woman who came in and asked, \"Can I have one of your postcards?\" Todd replied, \"Sure! I can even give you one with a price sheet if you would like.\" She answered, \"No, that's alright. I just need to fan myself, I'm having a hot flash.\" To define the majority of the buyers we have seen, I heard the following from two women passing the booth, \"I just want to find some leopard print sheer material for my bathroom.\" C'mon Texas, I love you. Don't stereotype yourself!Yesterday's classics were the woman on the cell phone who stopped next to the booth and said, \"I'm by, like, all this glass stuff\". And my favorite so far, the man and the woman who walked through the booth, looked at the pieces and he said to her, \"What is it?\" to which she replied, \"I dunno. I guess you put cheese on it or somepn'.\"But it has not been all gloom and doom I started the day by meeting my major goal for expanding into the gift shows--I picked up a major department store as a client. They are starting me in three locations, and we might be expanding into several more. The VP of the Home division and the buyer for tabletop love both my functional glass work and the glass and steel table top pieces with Black Cat ArtWorks. Whoo hoo!Other than that order, though... I took the order the day before the show opened for the Washington state Indian reservation resort casino, and yesterday I took an order for a video rental store with a small adjacent gift shop. They placed a large order for large pieces, and though several of them were targeted for personal use, some were definitely for their shop. I'm not quite sure what I'm going to put on the locations page on my website for them... And that's it. Three orders, and a lot of people interested in buying \"samples\" at the end of the show. Got to make that gas money somehow.Tonight I get to meet up with an old friend from grade school/high school after the show for drinks.

Not much call for glass art this morning, but I still have my happy face on! I do not have any connectivity on my laptop at this show, but things are slow enough that I have time to type this post on my iPhone... One letter at a time.The streets around the Trade Center were thronged with traffic this morning, and the floor--while not packed--has a good number of people on it. Todd is off walking the floor of the Design section (where we are) to see just how many exhibitors are vending t-shirts, purses, costume jewelry, etc. Apparently the hottest seller is beaded wire crosses, and the major category of exhibited \"work\" is clothing and accessories. Too bad I don't vend lipgloss. We'll see what the afternoon brings."},
{"title": "We're Set Up", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "text": "A bit from last night's bottle of Redwood Creek chardonnay in a hotel wine glass, \"Hallelujah\" performed by Jeff Buckley on iTunes. Hallelujah, we're set up. And what a day it was...Got up this morning to find that the ice bucket in which room service had delivered our wine last night had leaked... all over my wallet, my iPhone holster, and my iPod. The iPod was unharmed, the rest was soaked. There were three checks totaling over $1,500 in the wallet (they came in right before I left for Dallas) that were ruined from the wallet stain. The money (all $38 I had) was also stained, but I got the front desk of the hotel to exchange it, and I spent the day drying the wallet and the phone holster. Cleaning up and exchanging the money took a bit of time so we were late to get on the road--and no coffee to tide us over.We finally got on our way, and it was the wrong road. I blithely headed out thinking I knew where the heck I was going. Bad idea. So I pulled over and found an address to input into the GPS instead of having Todd try to sort out marginally written directions from the show staff. After much incredibly hellish traffic (Dallas feels a lot like L.A. in this respect), we arrived at the World Trade Center (Dallas style)... and there were no signs telling us where to go. We drove around. A lot. We asked several people where we were supposed to go. We *finally* found the right entrance and got in the right line, and made it to the front of said line ready to be unloaded... and ran out of gas. I kid you not. (Todd wants you to know that it was not figuratively, but literally *out of gas*). But it's Dallas. Dallas is in Texas. There are no bigger-hearted people in the world than there are in Texas. The woman in charge of the dock grabbed one of her guys (a retired brick layer now dock worker for GES) and told him to take me to the gas station to get gas--even though it was only a couple of blocks away--because it was cold and I would have had to cross the freeway (under it on the access road). He would've taken me anyway once he knew the situation.I got back with gas, we got unloaded. We set up. Even with all the delays, we finished setting up by 6:30 pm. Unbelievable. But the day, the surreal day we woke up to, was not over.As we finished setting up, two women (buyers) came by, oohed and ahhed, and asked if I'd take an order today (!). I said sure, and took a mid three-figure order before the show even opened. Then it was time to go home...As we took the elevator down to the lobby, and then the shuttle to the parking lot, I worried that we were not going to have enough gas to make it back to the gas station. After all, we had just got a little under a gallon, and then I hadn't been able to get it all out of the little gas can I bought. Todd and I held our breath all the way from the parking garage to the gas station, but we made it!Then the evening's fun began. I thought I could use the little map handed out by the hotel to find the WalMart in \"zone 2\" by us so we could buy paper and beer. Hah. We drove around for about an hour up and down the access roads paralleling the two freeways by our hotel. It was... a trip. Finally, after having no luck at all finding the WalMart--or any other box-like store--we stopped at a Shell gas station to get beer for Todd (we had decided to throw ourselves on the mercy of the hotel staff for paper for tomorrow). The gas station proprietor--a very nice Indian man running a gas station/Taqueria in a Korean neighborhood--told us he didn't sell beer because it was dry there, but if we went down two stop lights in one direction we would find a 7-11 and liquor stores and everything. He further informed us that two lights in the other direction and a quick right turn would get us to an Office Depot for paper. We had hit the mother load! In retrospect, I think they were jsut surprised we were alive in the neighborhood. I thought back and the Indian man at the first gas station had had to unlock a door to let us in the store/gas station. What kind of neighborhood calls for all the doors to be locked at 8:30 on a Thursday?When we left the gas station, we drove first to the liquor store. It was a Latino establishment with an eclectic mix of sakes and three alphabetized shelves of wine (Korean neighborhood, Latino establishment...). I have to say, I have never been in a store that alphabetizes wine with no regard to color or varietal before. It was... disconcerting. Todd got vodka and juices (he is expecting a rough show, I think) and I grabbed a couple of bottles of the only sauvignon blanc I could find. We went to check out and the older man behind the counter instructed the younger man on how to ring it up, how to bag it, etc., and all the while they kept casting wow-what-are-you-doing-in-here looks at us. As we were leaving they gave me a little gift--a Chum-Churum Soju apron in green and black. Like I said, surreal.The rest of the evening was uneventful: We found Office Depot, we ordered pizza from room service,  and we bickered over the remote control. Now it is time to print out several price sheets. Tomorrow morning I'll do the price stickers for the pieces. Ta ta!"},

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... wait, it was just the worst of times. No, that's too harsh. Like all shows there have been good and bad things and it's just a show. In comparison to my last two wholesale shows (ACRE last spring and the BMAC last summer), average orders are down 50% and number of orders is down about 55%. I would be dead in the water without the new collaborative work with Todd of Bentwell Metals. The buyers I'm getting here--with the exception of one the first day--are all about the garden stake, the ornament, and the wire men.-------------I have a more complete review to post (and two more orders to report), but breakdown was hell.

I have network this morning--an unexpected plus. Yesterday was grim, grim, grim without connectivity. Today is already starting off exciting--the security officer from the Mart came to take a report about the theft of my camera, a police officer will be up next to file a report. I have decided to consider the loss of the camera as an opportunity. I wasn't happy with the quality of the Cool Pix images (low-end digital cameras all seem to be optimized to take pictures of people and people just don't need the same white balance and color correction my glass does). But I never would have spent the money now on a new camera if I hadn't been forced too. Opportunity knocked, Canon answered.--------------A few hours have passed and I spoke too soon--I had connectivity for a brief shining moment at the beginning of the day and that seems to be it for the day. I'll have to post this tonight when I get home. Okay, it's 2:00 pm on day 4, the penultimate day of the Atlanta's Mart. I haven't written an order since Saturday afternoon about 2:00. Good thing I have a positive attitude (!). One of the exhibitors down the aisle from me actually asked for a refund of their booth fee. Their request was denied (of course), but the request is representative of the show. My soul is slowly being sucked from my body--somewhat like when I slump wine bottles, but this soul drain is on its fourth straight day.For the remainder of the afternoon I am going to carefully plan every step of the breakdown in order to be able to get the heck out of Dodge ASAP when the doors close tomorrow. Instead of taking all the lights off the tracks and putting them in a plastic tub (as I usually do) and then breaking apart the track sections, I am going to keep all the lights on the tracks and wrap them up in blankets that I'll cable-tie together. The wall pieces with glass in them will be packed still assembled into boxes. The back wall unit is going to be the piece that takes the longest to disassemble , but since there'll be 4-5 of us for breakdown I can't imagine it's going to take us any longer than an hour (maybe two) to do it all.Today Becky is here, Dee is here, Mindy stopped by to say hi, and I am cheered. Becky and Todd went to lunch, and now Becky and I are going over to High Design so I can see if it's anywhere I want to be. Got to find a happy place. Got to find a happy place. Got to find a happy place.----------------------------The penultimate day is over. We took no orders, but have a nibble on wire people and other of Todd's pieces from a buyer who promises to come back tomorrow to order. Tonight I go home and hope my order from Walker Displays has arrived (along with a few checks to help defray the cost of this debacle). I have seen a couple of other glass exhibitors who also do the BMAC and one is doing this show in Handmade for the first and last time, the other is in high design (after several years in handmade first) and is still doing less than half the sales he had last year. Even longtime exhibitors in the better section of handmade (not stuck on the hallway to nowhere) are saying their sales are way down. Not to harp on the negative, but this comment from Todd must be shared \"There are more cleaning people in the aisles than buyers\". Once he said that, I had to count. He was wrong. For the last half of hour of the show today I counted 16 exhibitors I didn't recognize (no one whose booth is right here), 4 cleaning, security or other Mart staff, and 18 buyers--none of whom even paused as they hustled past my booth. I only counted people who walked in front of my booth, I only counted one leg of round trips (to and from the bathroom counted once). Time to go home."},

I have given up trying to get on-line today—I have been unable to get my usual pirate signal from the Days Inn across the street. So I blog in Word and will upload when I get home. Exhaustion peers through every pore compounded by the boring lack of activity in the hall. I was planning to work on my website today if it was slow, but was unable without the pirate signal. An exhibitor down the aisle told me about the network service she has for her Mac that costs $60 a month but enables her to have connectivity wherever she is—even driving down the highway (more accurately, being driven down the highway). I envied. Tomorrow I think I'll take my book—just in case. There are only so many games of spider solitaire one can play without going stark staring bonkers (and Todd does the front-line customer greeting and interaction).There is less than an hour left in the show today and I have not taken a single order. I am not unusual in that respect. But that is not the bad news of the day. The bad news of the day is that I accidentally left my camera in the back of my booth on top of one of my pedestals last night and someone stole it. *sigh* Sorry, Ren, there will be no pictures of me—or of anyone else—in the crown with the scepter for this show. Got to get a new camera ordered from Amazon. Damn. My eye-fi card was in the camera too so I lost more than just the camera.We'll see how tomorrow and Tuesday pan out, but so far this is either my worst or my second worst show (for sales) ever. My sales rep Grace came by today with the application for summer and I said if I do this show again I need to be in High Design. I'm not sorry I did it here (in Handmade--even if it was the desert of handmade) this year, and I am not deterred from trying it again next year. I just need to do some shifting to make sure I'm placed for maximum exposure and fit. (Yawn.) I sent Todd off with friends an hour or so ago. I feel badly that he wasted most of the day here—I'm not sure I need to be here, much less both of us.I'd love to have a happier, perkier post, but I'm just not feeling it.  Tomorrow is another day.

{"title": "Day 2 and Yawning...", "date": "Saturday, January 10, 2009", "text": "Coffee was a Dancing Goats blend from Kavarna with an extra shot of Espresso, the desultory chatter of buyers and vendors for music. It's just shy of 1:00 pm on Day 2 of the Atlanta's Mart, and it's not over till it's over. That said, it feels over. Down the aisle from me are a lovely couple who do handcarved wooden picture frames, and they haven't yet written an order. Next to them is a jeweler who creates exquisite high-end torchworked glass jewelry, again, zip. Almost zilch and nada are right around the corner from them by me. The jeweler next door is closed today for Sabbath, the potters across the aisle have written an order, and I have plenty of time to blog--no orders so far today. But it isn't over till it's over.Doing a show it's sometimes very hard to keep the bigger picture in sight. We focus so much on immediate goals for the show--this many line sheeets distributed, this many orders written--that we can fall into despair if the reality doesn't meet our expectations. But it's not just about one show--and it's not all about the sales at the show. As a business person, I have to evaluate success on so much more than sales. Did I introduce a lot of prospective buyers to my work? Did I build interest in and future sales momentum for it by doing the show? Most important, can I afford to consider the entire show cost an advertising expense instead of a revenue-generating activity? Now wrap your head around that concept.If you are relying on sales from a show to make the rent, the inevitable desperation oozing from your pores on day 2 with no sales cannot help but drive buyers away from your booth. Sure, the determined buyer will most likely place an order from you no matter what, but there are too few of them. The orders I have written from this show have been evenly distributed between people who are drawn in by the laughing and banter who end up seeing the one thing I have that fits their shops, and people who see the work form a distance and come in expressly to buy. That trend may be because it's the expensive work that's most visible and the affordable work that you practically have to be on top of to see. Whatever, it's the attitude that counts.That's probably enough for today. Time to work on order entry, the website, all the other things I can do while pleasantly smiling at passersby. The mermaid and fish at the top is one of my favorite new pieces Todd did yesterday, and I am about ready to put on the crown above and march up and down the aisles with a sceptre anointing people as buyers for Siyeh Studio...

I am... okay with how things have been so far. I didn't advertise, I didn't self-promote with postcards, I don't think I'm listed in the mailed out directory, and I'm in the back desert with the rest of the newbies. In spite of those limitations, by the middle of the first day I have taken three good orders--all new customers. If I were counting on $40K in orders from this show I would probably be leaking quiet desperation too, but I am going to be okay with whatever comes.From 10:00 to about 12:30 it was very busy--I was glad Todd was here to help me, but since then it's been really sloooow. One of my regular customers from the Buyer's Market of American Craft saw me here and was shocked. It was his opinion that I should be in High Design or a permanent showroom--not in the Handcrafted area. About two hours later another BMAC customer came by and placed a good order--and from their conversation I was left with the impression that I would have missed an order from them had I not been here as they are not planning to go to Philly this year. Finally, I had another client from Arizona come in and tell me she still has all the work she bought from me at the BMAC last year and she hasn't been able to sell any of it--people love it until she tells them how much it costs.I need one more happy report to end the day or I might have to follow the example of my next booth neighbors and not come back tomorrow. The booth next to me is closed until Sunday. I have to scratch my head at paying for a booth in a show that runs Friday through Tuesday if you can't be there from the middle of the afternoon Friday through all day Saturday for religious reasons. Yes, here I sit between bible verses and oilcloth purses, with painted doormats to my other side. Interesting show. Time to start a production schedule for Todd.

I did not post yesterday even though we were done setting up by 10:30 am. Yes, you read that right, AM not PM. Spent the rest of the morning going over pricing, schedules and details for the Dallas set-up with Bill and Todd. The afternoon saw the purchase of a Walker Display system to debut in Dallas, contractor appointments made for today (the studio gate blew off in the wind the night before last and needs to be re-hung), and a nap followed by a rest and an early night... This cold is kicking my behind to the extent that I can't even remember if I already wrote that I came down with it on Tuesday.Set-up for the Atlanta's Mart was unlike any set-up I have ever done before. For one thing, it started on Monday, not Tuesday like I thought. Oops. So we were a day late arriving--and we were still almost the only ones in our area setting up--no sign of anyone else, neither crates and goods nor people. The floor was like a ghost town all day Tuesday. Yesterday morning it was starting to liven up with bustling vendors, and I bet today is a madhouse (everyone is supposed to be set-up by 2:00 pm). I won't know as I am not going in today. I am going to make price sheets, info packets, a production schedule and phone calls. The phone calls are to clients who still have invoices outstanding from last year--and there are several thousand dollars of invoices still out.Like ACRE in Vegas, the Mart show makes use of a marshaling yard where vehicles wait until there is room at the dock for them. unlike Vegas where the marshaling yard is a couple of blocks from the convention center, the marshaling yard for this show is down past the airport. My scheduled move-in was 7:00 am so we had to drive down to the airport, get our paperwork and then turn around and drive back downtown to the Mart--all in rush hour traffic. Oy. It was NOT fun. Pulling away from the curb and heading out, I had a momentary panic that I had forgotten something and said so to Todd. His response was to tell me it would be all be fine, and then he stopped himself, looked at me, and asked in all seriousness, \"What would you like from me here? Do you want me to panic with you [Oh no! What are we going to do?!?], or do you want me to reassure you and calm you down?\" I had to bust out laughing, and the panic attack passed.After a dry-run set-up Monday, and with valet unloading at the Mart, three people setting up the booth, and the foamcore walls and carpet already in place, set-up went really fast. By 10:30 am the back wall display and all the pedestals were up, and we were ready to put up the light poles--that's when we discovered the missing box. I made a roundtrip home in under a half hour--and the parking attendant even let me back into the same parking lot without paying again. Then the troubles started.I had planned to use my own pipe and drape poles and supports as the support structure for my lights. But no matter where I put the vertical uprights to hold the crossbars, they were very visually obtrusive. Finally Bill came up with the idea of putting horizontal extensions off the top bars adjacent to my booth and hooking my horizontal support bars to them. It worked great, and I never would have thought of it on my own--thank heaven Bill was there! I am going to have to architect the set-up for the new configuration in Dallas very carefully in order for Todd and I to be able to get it all up in a day without Bill.Tomorrow, good booth pictures (I forgot my camera yesterday) and maybe even a post live from the Mart (my booth is close enough to the Days Inn that I picked up the Internet service on Tuesday, heh)."},

{"title": "Statistical Monday", "date": "Monday, January 05, 2009", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans skyline mug, \"Painting By Numbers\" by James McMurtry on iTunes. The numbers for Siyeh Studio have been staggering so far this year--and it's only January 5th. Since last Thursday, the first of January, I have cut and entirely consumed (mostly in the kilns) 28 sheets of Bullseye clear irid (about 224 lbs of glass) and 23 5-lb jars of frit (another 115 lbs of glass). My waste is about 2 oz, and I have repurposed about 2 lbs of frit (created from clear irid sheet or mixed colored) for open studio, ornaments and casting. From these raw materials have come about $12,500 of kilnformed glass, some of which will go in $3,000 worth of metal stands from Black Cat ArtWorks--all for the Atlanta's Gift and Home Furnishings Market and the Dallas FINDS Show. Whew! No wonder I'm tired this morning.The last few days, as I have been in the studio loading kilns till 8:30 or 9:30 every night, have taught me something very important: If I need to fuse fire both Bertha and Bettina every day I *must* get Bettina loaded and powered up on the first day by 10:00 am at the latest and I'll only get about five days of firing her before I'll either have to give her a day off or switch to the night shift.Bettina was constructed for longer, higher-temp firings so she has significantly more sidewall insulation than Bertha does (she's also younger and her lid is tighter so she leaks heat less). In addition, she has the big Ditore shelf in her which holds significantly more heat for a significantly longer time. All these significant factors add up to a minimum closed-lid kiln time of 24 hours--and that's pushing it a bit. Bertha can be opened and unloaded in about 18-20 hours so I can follow them same loading/firing schedule every day with her--I don't get pushed back a couple of hours a day. My normal rule of thumb is not to unload the kilns unless I can do it with bare hands. Last night at 7:30 I had to use gloves to get the pieces out of Bettina.Today Dee, Becky, Todd and Bill descend upon the studio to construct the new booth display. The only space large enough for it that's inside (it's raining *again* today) is the garage at the house so it'll be a cold damp day for us. I'll make lots of coffee.

Yes it's Saturday, but I'm working so why not blog too? Four kilns fired yesterday, four will fire today. Becky painted the new back wall display. Patrick from Taylor Kinzel dropped off the pedestals I lent them for the glass show. I ordered the foamcore to cover the front (unpainted) of the backwall display and ULine will deliver it Monday. In short, everything is getting done unless it's done on a computer (except blogging--somehow I keep up on that).The website languishes with articles unwritten and an online ordering system for galleries as yet undone. The ERP system has stalled again. V is on vacation for a week and I need to get the iMac set-up for her in any case. (I no longer have two Beckys, I have  a Becky and a Veronique--or V. As Becky H's real name is Veronique T and she uses it professionally, I am getting used to calling her V--her preferred nickname.) More importantly I have not done the annual review of my pricing in preparation for the start of the show season.Out of curiosity I looked over my wholesale price sheets since 2005 and compared them to Bullseye's price sheets for the same time period. Given that I use entirely Bullseye glass in my production work, it seems only logical that my pricing should be at least loosely tied to theirs. Freight costs are another expense, but I don't have those so readily at my fingertips. I also have to consider my stand costs as they are the only other significant material in my pieces.It has been my policy for the past several years to keep my prices as low as I could, but I was surprised to find that I have only raised my wholesale prices by an average of 5% since January 2005. Bullseye has raised glass prices 20% in the same time period (to be fair, 10% of that increase took effect in November 2008 and is one of the primary reasons I am considering raising my prices this year). Stand costs have increased 30% since 2005. As I went from stands mass-produced in China to stands handmade in the US during that time, I consider myself lucky my costs only increased 30%. But they are likely to go up again this year in step with rising steel costs and I need to be prepared for that.So what do I do? A 10% price increase would be reasonable in a stable market, but the marketplace is very uncertain and potentially unstable right now. The news abounds with stories of people taking 30% (or more) salary cuts just to be employed. Is it even rational to think of increasing prices now, or would a better business strategy be to tighten my belt a bit more and keep working on growing the customer base and not on growing the income? This is the time a business or economics degree would be handy. French and linguistics don't get you very far in the world of finance--and both autodidactic glass artisanry and do-it-yourself business ownership are only worth a hair more. I bet Warren Buffet or someone like him wrote a book on the subject, but I'm not going to get it as it would only put me to sleep. Economics does that to me--one reason for the lack of the aforementioned degree.I need to mull some more, but I have to make a decision by Thursday as the new show season starts Friday and the pricing for the year needs to be in place by then. What to do, Who to ask. Any advice?"},

There will be no earth-shaking goals, changes, pronouncements this year--at least nothing that I'm going to plan now. I can barely keep up with my business the way it is.For instance, Why would I need to put a small jar in the studio to store all the glass that I would otherwise throw out in a year? Yes, it's cool that my entire glass waste for a year would fit into a little jelly jar, but I don't need to prove it to me or anyone else.And, yes, I've always wanted to know exactly when the different flowering trees, vines and shrubs bloom here in Atlanta, but I probably don't have enough real need to set up a gardening calendar on Google so I can Jott the date to it every time I see a new plant species in bloom throughout the year (and that's after jotting the temperature and whether or not it rained to it _every_day_). I just don't have that much large scale garden design left to do here that would benefit from knowing *exactly* when azaleas, camellias, gardenias, magnolias, jasmine, crepe myrtle, cherries, peaches, etc. bloom and does their blooming season overlap in a meaningful way for a non-stop blooming garden. If I had a new yard to do--or if I were a landscape designer, maybe it would be worth the vig, but me, now? No.Instead of focusing today (yesterday, now, the first of the year) on what I'm going to do, I am going instead to reflect on where I am and how truly great it is. For example, next Monday Dee (my friend the jewelry artist who does the same shows I do), and Becky (the wonder assistant and glass bead jewelry designer), and Todd (my new collaboration partner who is Bentwell Metals), and Bill (my first collaboration partner who, along with his wife Elaine, was Elliott Metal Works and is now Black Cat ArtWorks) are coming to the studio to do a dry run of Tuesday's Mart show set-up. Stacy (the former wunder-assistant and still good friend) was going to make a run to ULine to pick up the foamcore for me Monday, but it'll be too big to fit in either of our vehicles so I'm having it delivered instead. Bill and Todd will follow up the dry run with the real thing on Tuesday and Elaine and Bill will also be back at the end of the show (down from Greenville) to help me break down.That I have professional friends who pitch in, hang out, help out, and in so doing enrich Siyeh Studio with me is so... amazing. A day with everyone here--no matter what we're doing (even cleaning out the garage to move everything to the studio as we did last summer) makes my heart feel so big I'm afraid that there isn't room in my chest for it. We are all helping each other build our businesses however we can, and the community we have built too is... I don't have words.So now, the first of the year, I celebrate my friends and my colleagues in the art/craft business, and I know that working together, we are all going to have a stronger better year--regardless of the economy--than we ever have before. Go Dee! Go Becky! (B Bird Designs website coming soon.) Go Todd! (Bentwell Metals site coming soon.) Go Bill and Elaine! (Black Cat ArtWorks site coming soon)."},

Too acidic after a champagne-filled night), the burble of the new air filters in the fish tank for music. New Year's Day, traditionally a holiday in the US, will not be a day off for me--not with set-up for the Atlanta's Gift Mart starting Tuesday. Today I fire two big kiln loads and Dave is going to help me set-up the lovely back wall display Bill (from Black Cat ArtWorks) made for me so Becky can paint it tomorrow.Though most details for the two upcoming new shows are taken care of (I got the foamcore walls for the Dallas show confirmed and I got a hotel room purchased on Priceline), there are still a couple of things that caused me to wake with a heart-pounding jolt this morning. A month or so ago I felt very smug to find the Houtz and Barwick aluminum director's chair available on the web again and I ordered one (direct). A week or so ago I realized I had never received the chair so I tried to call the company. All their phone numbers were disconnected, there was nothing on them at all in directory services. Fortunately they didn't charge my credit card either, but I was out a chair. I meant to find and order another one, but I forgot until 9:30 this morning when the remembrance woke me from a sound sleep.So today there will be a chair acquired and a reminder sent to Taylor Kinzel that I need my pedestals back by Monday. Tomorrow, when the rest of the retail world is back to work, I need to find two large white plastic buckets with lids, a couple of bags of sand, and two big beautiful ferns to display the Bentwell Metals' Gem Stakes.For now I should call to see if my child is ready to come home from the sleepover she went to last night. I should. Really I should."},

Again appropriate as I am on the Otherside Of the Postcard! It only took *six hours* yesterday to design it. I futzed and I putzed and I putzed and I futzed. Every time the phone rang I barked at the caller and told him/her I would call back tomorrow. Now if Image Media follows through on their promises, the Rosen Group will have my postcards in time for the cooperative mailing next week--and I will have postcards to hand out at the Atlanta's Mart show. I look at it and see a couple of things I would change, but I give a philosophical shrug and move on. I just hope the font on the back doesn't have raggedy edges or it was a wasted effort. (Image Media only accepts pdf and Photoshop [of the formats I can produce] and I work in Canvas--the export to pdf looked a bit squodgy [skwo-jee]).Today shipping, and firing, and shipping and more firing. I managed to scrounge up a dusty old sheet of dense white to use for one last Christmas gift and, wouldn't you know, it doesn't react with French Vanilla! Maybe it was a sheet of curious, or maybe the formula was changed between 2004 (when it was made) and now. I suppose I shouldn't even say it was old. I was talking with Patty from Bullseye a week or so ago and I randomly (randomness plays a large role in my life) pulled out a sheet of Bullseye glass to check the data on it and it was made in 1988. Oy, I hold onto things forever! But it's not like it goes bad, right?One last note and then off to the studio to meet with the two Beckys. I met with Becky the accountant yesterday and she has me just about completely convinced that putting EVERYTHING into Quickbooks will meet 90-95% (my numbers, not hers) of my needs. I was telling Dave this over sushi last night and that I would probably abandon the ERP system in favor of Quickbooks as my development window (December) is almost over with no progress made. I said it was too bad as I had all the workflow and datamodeling sketched out. He said it would only take him about 15 hours to do about 90-95% of it in Grails with the workflow and datamodel sketched out--and it would be web-enabled so I could access it from anywhere... Now I have a quandary. With the Quickbooks solution I will still have to manage my production cycle separately (firing schedule, frit inventory, and maybe mailings). With the ERP system I can manage my business entirely in it, but I'll still need QB data and entry for my accountant, account reconciliation, expense management, etc.--lots of double entry. Oh the choices!"},

I have moved to the otherside of Christmas--one major event down, one (two combined) to go. \"How long will I slide... I don't believe it's fair...\" So say the Chili Peppers, so it goes.Got lights for the upcoming shows on Friday. I still need to put together the gorgeous back wall display that Bill from Black Cat ArtWorks (fka Elliott Metal Works) made for me to take to the shows so I can paint it. I think I'll get the spouse to help me with that one. I also have to figure out how to hang all the hanging work on the foamcore walls. Oh yeah, I also need to *get* foamcore walls for Dallas. There was no one at the Dallas exhibition services to help me with that on the 20th when I was getting the rest of my forms in. Hope I have better luck today or I'm in Barney (rubble... trouble).I also hired a bookkeeper on Friday and she comes today to begin the task of desnarling my mess. Now there will be two people working in the studio named Becky. Maybe it should be a policy that your name has to begin with \"B\" in order to work there... or maybe I'm still groggy and delirious from a night of glass dreams (glass shows, glass display, glass production, swapping out glass from galleries, etc.). I am lucky that she is also a friend and is giving me her non-profit rate. Or maybe that's not so lucky--let's hope it's not prophetic.Worked on the postcard last night. I think I can get it designed, submitted and proofed before 3:00 today meaning I can have it in time for the Buyer's Market mailing program--if I can get them to let me split the shipment and have it delivered to two addresses ground. I looked into just having it overnighted, but the UPS charge the postcard company lists for overnight from Florida to here for a box of postcards is $209. I think not.Fired a full load yesterday, two to do today. Also cleaned the studio big sink and the top of my desk. Wow. Other people may wait till January 1 for the new year to begin, but for me it's the Monday after Christmas. My loins are girded (or they will be once I've gone upstairs and performed the morning's ablutions and dressed) and I'm ready for it.Shown are some of the new gem drops and gem stake drops from Todd at Bentwell Metals and me.

{"title": "Woe, Woe!", "date": "Friday, December 26, 2008", "text": "Coffee was brought to me in the Barcelona mug, I lost it without ever having taken a sip. It's somewhere in the house, but I have searched every room--2-3 times. I ended up pouring another cup in the Denver mug. No music. 'Tis the day after Christmas and life is a mess, though better for me than for others, I guess. And that's as much as I'm going to attempt to rhyme.So far today there has been no glass. There has been a massive house straightening--and the aforementioned loss of the coffee--and I have dropped and irreparably broken my Kindle. Now it's time to cut my losses and get on to glass.The last gift I made for Christmas this year that I couldn't mention on the blog (because my spouse reads it) was a backsplash for Dave for our kitchen. It's one solid piece of glass 30\" X 20\" of white-backed Morceaux de verre Trout (it has black speckles in it which this pic does not). Photos to be posted when it gets installed.One last rant before I go off to make the LAST ORDER OF THE YEAR and prepare the first firing of pieces for the Atlanta and Dallas shows. Last week UPS did not bother to come and get a pick-up I had scheduled for orders that were requested by Christmas. That story ended ok--though the local service center never called about it, apologized about it, even acknowledged it (though the customer service representative said they would)--as the packages were all delivered before Christmas. However I overnighted an envelope to Montana on Tuesday with guaranteed delivery on Wednesday... and UPS just left it their facility in Kalispell after it arrived at 1:48 pm. They didn't even try to deliver it. When I called to ask what happened, the representative said she was very sorry, she had no idea why it hadn't been delivered, and sadly, she was unable to process my request for a refund of the overnight fees because they don't guarantee anything between 12/22 and 12/25. I would understand if the delay was weather-related. I don't expect them to cover Acts of God. However it was beautiful, clear and sunny in Montana when the package arrived and it arrived in the middle of the day. Did people just decide to knock off early that day?I slough off the Kindle woes (the replacement will arrive Monday). I slough off UPS (they are as dead skin to me). I buck up, cheer up, mount up and start firing glass. Glass always makes me happy. May You and Yours be happy too."},

{"title": "Twas the Day Before Christmas and All Through the Studio", "date": "Wednesday, December 24, 2008", "text": "No coffee, no music, what kind of Christmas Eve is this? I intended to post yesterday as I was in the studio firing, but my fingers were too numb to type--it was 36 degrees in there when I started my day. I think it was warmer outside by then. It had warmed up to 46 (after the furnace had run full-blast for a couple of hours) by the time I left. These old southern houses were not built for cold weather. They have lots of air flow, which is great in the summer when you want the hot air to rise out of the chimney, but it's, shall we say, less than optimal in the dead cold of winter. But enough whining. It's not like I wasn't prepared for it--I wore two big sweaters layered and a scarf over. Just wish I had me some of them fleece crocs... (wink).I thought I'd write a Day Before Christmas post this morning, but I lack the energy. So then I thought I'd fall back on a Stranded post from last year, but it turned out to be the day after Christmas *two* years ago. Whenever and whatever, it's better than anything I could come up with this morning. But back to glass, glass incarnate. There will be firing today, and the continuing Christmas present crafting (I decided yesterday to knit scarves for a Jessie's friend Grace and her American Girl doll). There had also really better be some photography and postcard design or I am not going to have a card ready for the Buyer's Market's co-operative mailing program (they have to have my printed postcards no later than January 5).Compartmentalizing. It's all about compartmentalizing. Dave did it before the election. Every time I asked him about doing something or making a decision for something that occurred after November 4 he told me that that was negative time and we could talk about it after November 4. Basically, for him there was no time after November 4 until after November 4. I feel much the same about Christmas, and then about the January shows, and then about the Buyer's Market, and then about ACRE, and then about BECon, and then about Summer Camp and everything else. If I had to look at it all at the same time and plan it out, I'd go blind and my brain would burst.A friend just called, her car won't start, and she needs a jump so I am wrapping up here and heading out. Have a safe and warm Christmas everyone, hug the ones you love and give thanks for them. The rest, too, shall pass. (And thanks, Ren, for all the goodies that came yesterday! Christmas music and Guinness truffles--I'm guessing, huzzah!)"},

Panic attacks over, mysteries solved, projects nearing completion, open studio over, fusing tests done, presents to wrap and send with Jan back to the rest of the family in Illinois. God bless you and send you a Happy New Year.It's a clear sign of over extension that I shot up in bed with a shriek at one minute to 3:00 am on Saturday morning--waking myself and Dave in the process--with the realization that I hadn't faxed my exhibitor services forms in yet for the Dallas FINDS show and they were due by midnight Pacific time. I threw on a nightgown and groggily hurried to the studio (Baxter didn't even wake enough to come with me). When I got there I found the forms and the send confirmations for them nestling comfortably in the fax machine... then I remembered that I had faxed them at 9:00 pm the previous night before watching (sleeping through, really) \"The Ref\". I hadn't even woken enough to question my panic, I just acted on it in the desperate hope that if I were only three minutes or so late they would give me credit for getting my forms in on time (midnight Pacific time being the same as 3:00 am Eastern time). I trudged back home to bed and apologized profusely to my long-suffering spouse.I think I briefly mentioned that the hard drive on the house iMac died last month. I was sanguine about it as I was absolutely, positively certain that I had a back-up of all the photos for the past seven years, the complete iTunes library of all our cd's (laboriously ripped to the hard drive and then stored in a closet), and every other important document and file we had ever stored on a hard drive. I was wrong. When I finally went to restore the data to the new drive in the iMac, I found nothing but an empty external drive where all the back-up data should have been. It's been a couple of rough days, but I think I have solved the mystery of where it went and the data *may* still be recoverable from the alleged back-up drive. I am going to wait till after Christmas to work on it more--no reason to add more stress to life right now..The weekend saw the completion of a few more Christmas presents--though I can't talk much about them as the recipients read this blog. This afternoon I make the last of the gifts that will be done before Christmas (everything going to France is going to be late this year--as usual) and begin the great wrap-a-thon.The final open studio was on Friday and most of the pieces were picked up yesterday. I have a couple of orders left to get out this week, and a present still to do, but glass is done for the moment. Of course I haven't even started firing the pieces for the Atlanta and Dallas shows that begin on January 6... but that panic is being safely compartmentalized until *after* Christmas. I also fired my last reaction test with Bullseye glass and was saddened to find that the translucent white 0243 does not react with French vanilla. So far the only whie glass that has the cool reaction with French vanilla I want is the now discontinued dense white 0313.Now off for my one and only trip to a retail establishment during this Christmas season for a last-minute spousal gift. Love and joy come to you, and to you your wassail too, and God bless you and send you a Happy New Year."},
{"title": "Friday is Such a Final Day", "date": "Friday, December 19, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the Pike Place Coffee mug, \"Walking In the Air\" from the Snowman by George Winston on iTunes. The week before Christmas comes to an end. Two more orders to get out, odds and sods still left to make, and vacation has already begun--at least for most of the other members of my household. Dave's sister Jan was supposed to come for the weekend and arrive today, but she was flying in from the Midwest and they were due for ice storms today so Air Tran suggested she fly a day early--at no additional charge. Wheee. She got in last night and will attend J's winter assembly at school with us today. Then the J is off until some time in January... right about when I am heading to the Atlanta's Mart for the show there I think. Oh it looms.But there is no panic, only Christmas joy. Lots and lots and LOTS of Christmas joy... I wonder if Dave put spiked eggnog in my coffee this morning, I am feeling just a bit too relaxed and happy. Today is the last day of open studio and it's a long session--double the usual length and with double the number of people I wanted to have at any one time. It will be fun, and jolly, and other things that end in \"olly\", of that I'm sure.Sample pieces of two of Bullseye's new reactive glasses--reactive ice and reactive cloud opal--arrived the day before yesterday and I have already run a test strip for each of them with some of my current reactive glasses--including a small bit of the old dense white I had on hand. As I expected, they do not react to French vanilla, nor do they react to the dense white either as I had thought they might. I didn't fire against the full range of the reactives I have on hand, but of the ones I did fire I was surprised to find they don't react to the 0305 pink either (as French vanilla does).The reactions I got from the new white were more subtle than they were from the new clear (reactive ice). That is one stunning piece of glass! It looks at first pass just like the 1101 clear--I'll need to remember to check today to see if I can tell the difference at a closer look (like I can between the 1401 clear and the 1101 clear). If not it's going to be fun keeping them separate. Anyway, the jade green and the Egyptian blue really popped against the clear with a solid black line of reaction between the colored and clear glasses. Another interesting point with the new clear--something you don't notice with the other reactive glasses unless you use a base of, say, 1116 turquoise with French vanilla pieces on top (something I have never done)--is that everywhere the glasses touch there is a reaction so from the underside the piece looks like clear and black. When you flip it over it's clear and all the other opal colors.  In reacent years I have moved away from production series using reactive glass, but this new clear looks like it's going to make it into the regular rotation in at least frit and maybe more. Wonder when they'll have it out in irid sheets?Time to get to the studio. I'll daydream about the summer camp plans and BE Con later when I have more free time (kilncasting this year--wonder if I can manage the trip out?)."},

I'll knuckle down and get what I can done. I finished two scarves--one knitted one woven--for gifts yesterday. If I didn't have to ship anything I would be golden. Ah well, no time to worry, just do.Funny story I forgot to share yesterday: Sunday afternoon at 3:00 as I was weaving, the home phone rang and the call was from a phone number I did not recognize in Tacoma Washington (I love caller id). The caller was a very polite man who had bought my book and wanted to ask me how to make one of the pieces shown in the  book--a bowl I named Cailleach's Cradle. The blue lace wall sconce is based on it, but the instructions for the bowl are not given. He was reverse engineering it and thought, since my phone number is openly published with directory assistance, that he'd just call to get some things clarified. I gave him detailed instructions and wished him well. I wonder if Stephen King gets calls like this. Or Dr. Mike Adler. He's a famous author too.Yesterday ended with a little impromptu open studio, and as soon as the attendee comes to review her pieces this morning before I slump them (I'm shipping one of them for her tomorrow and she needs to pick which one of the three she made she wants to) I'm heading down to Todd to drop off more glass and pick up more ornaments and jewelry.

However I have a backup of the iMac's contents on another external hard drive--including all the music--and I figured I could scope the music off of it. No such luck. It looks like everything is saved in a back-up format not readable except by the computer that backed it up (at least that's my hope because if it's not readable at all I have lost all our family pictures for the past 10 years, all our music, all the email Dave wrote me when we were first dating and being apart for 10 minutes was too long--in short, everything digital that matters).I would love to test my theory about the second hard drive only being able to be read by the iMac, but unfortunately when the iMac came back from the Apple Store it was without its power cord so cannot be started up. I just need to power down my amygdala (here's my real-world reference) for a few days till the new USB cable arrives from Western Digital for the laptop's external hard drive and Dave picks up my iMac power cord from the Apple store for me.

It's been about four years since we last did this, and I have to say the cookies are always better in memory than in reality--I am spoiled by my abundant access to professional pastry chefs.We each baked two batches each of three kinds of cookies for 12 batches of cookies which we greedily split into big ziploc bags at the end of the day. I chose peanut butter thumbprints with milk and dark chocolate kisses, Mexican wedding cakes, and spritz (butter press cookies). Becky chose anisette crisps, key lime filled cookies, and gingerbread cookies. We have bags and bags each, and the kitchen is clean again!Towards the tail end of the baking session I had open studio for two seventh graders and one of their mothers.

I have another session scheduled tomorrow and I'll remember then.Just after Dave came home from work, the open studio ended, Becky and I finished baking, and Dave picked up J from school (but a bit before the babysitter arrived for the evening), another friend dropped off his dog for us to watch for a few days while he is out of town. Dave called the whole thing writhing chaos, and, much like \"Shakespeare in Love\" and my usual business day, it all turned out fine but how it did is a mystery.Tomorrow I take another batch of glass to Todd, fuse the two orders I got today, prepare a piece for Patrick from Taylor Kinzel to pick up, deliver open studio pieces to school, and preside over another open studio for two. It will be a fun, exciting, rewarding, exhausting day--just like today."},

For yesterday I had one of the two business checking accounts entered and reconciled and the statements for most everything else printed out. It was enough for her to tell me to get ready to pay taxes through the nose in April. But that's good, right? It means my business had a really good year and I'm doing my part to support the economy, keep money flowing, and contribute to a 10 million dollar bonus for the CEO of Merrill Lynch. Well two out of three ain't bad.Today is the first open studio day and I am excited. Got to remember to go over and turn the heat on about noon--don't want to make studentsicles. While I'm there I'll check my stock for the two glasses I want to play with for Christmas gifts. I was really panicked when I found out Bullseye was discontinuing one of them, but I got an email from them yesterday and they have replaced it with a new reactive glass coming out in January. In fact I heard yesterday that they have several reactives coming out including a reactive clear! I can't WAIT to get my hands on some of that.Todd called last night and demanded more glass to wrap. He is on a roll and the latest work is big necklaces like he one he made me to wear to the show on Saturday. Speaking of the show Mary sent me more pics and I feel just jolly enough this morning to post them. The necklace doesn't show too well in the pics, but you can get a feel for it.Now I need to get the list of pieces for the Atlanta and Dallas shows done and faxed to Bill, and to put the finishing touches on the new display layout for them.

They made me think of winter and I am dying to try some out. Unfortunately Bullseye just discontinued one of the glasses needed so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to do. I think I have a sheet or two in the studio--just enough for a friend's Christmas present.The ornaments and garden stakes (gemdrops and gemstakes) were a hit--as was the large Moonrise piece that Patrick talked me into taking down from the wall in the studio office and putting up in the gallery.

One of the parents called me yesterday to ask if it would be possible for her son to make some more ornaments to give as gifts. I had been considering starting an open studio program so this seemed like the perfect opportunity to pilot it.From 3-5 every weekday for the next two weeks the studio will be open for up to five people at a time to make ornaments, small plates and bowls that I will then fire and deliver to school for them. I have set the costs for the pieces very low for the pilot program, and it is initially just open to the 7th graders as they have already been to the studio and know the procedures and safety rules. They can bring family and friends if they are willing to sponsor them (show them the ropes and mentor them through). I will be in the studio, but I won't be hands on teaching as I do not have the time right now.Depending on how the next couple of weeks go, I may put together a permanent set-up for open studio and start a formal program. I certainly haven't been using the gallery room in the studio as a gallery. Might as well make it a teaching space that can host gallery events as appropriate.Now off to get the last work out of the kiln for the glass show and then primp.

I passed briefly through the office this morning (the room in the house with a desk, a file cabinet and a bookcase--nominally an office though really just a place to pile paper crap and keep a ferret) and wistfully thought of what I could do to clean it up and make it usable if I just had some free December time. Then I realized that it's not about an actual real amount of time--it's all about perception. Take my friend Bridget. She may angst about many things, but I doubt not having enough time is one of them. If Bridget had been in the Donner party, she would have made it through--and not by killing her companions. Oh sure, she'd waste not want not after natural causes took 'em, but she wouldn't hasten their demise. The point I'm trying to make is that Bridget just rolls up her sleeves and gets it--whatever \"it\" is--done. No muss, no fuss, no whining. This is not to say she's superwoman and she is on top of everything, but I am pretty sure she spends a lot less time whining about what she wishes she could get done than she does just getting it done. A pre-New Year's resolution: In 2009, be more like Bridget.And let's not wait for 2009, let's just do it right now. The sample sets went out yesterday, and while I was waiting for the UPS site to come up so I could ship them I whipped up an info sheet and subscription form for additions to the set (with pricing and everything). Some time in the next couple of days I need to get a good photo and write up an article for the website on their availability. I don't like doing sample sets. I'm not charging for them what I would charge for an equivalently sized piece. But, like shows and marketing, I believe them to be a necessary evil for business growth.Today I fuse the additional pieces I need for the glass show this weekend--after I figure out what they will be. I mostly mulled it out while I was anxiously waiting to get to sleep last night, I just need to write out the firing schedule before heading off to the first appointment of the day at 10:00.The second appointment of the day is with Todd. Today I get to see what he did with two kiln loads of glass shards, scraps and squares and a whole bunch of wire and bamboo. With this new line of work, I am much more focused than I have ever been on the importance of marketing and advertising. When the economy is tough it's even more vital to aggressively bring yourself to people's notice and differentiate yourself. I believe that these new pieces fill a perfect niche. They're beautiful, bright, whimsical, handmade by professional American artisans, very reasonably priced, and made from recycled materials. What demographic did we miss there? Next step: Photos, a story written up, and ads/postcards/info cards/a web page created.Friday I am scheduled to meet with my accountant to review my books before the end of the year to see if there is something I need to do for taxes, payroll (what's that?), etc before 2008 scurries away. Grumble, grumble, grumble. Now that I'm all motivated for pulling together a new product line, I am even less inclined than usual to work in Quickbooks. But needs must when the devil drives.Side note: I was compelled to look up that idiom when it popped into my head--hence the link--and was vastly amused to find this additional reference to it from an article in the Times from 2002. \"Applied conscientiously in the rush hour it [the rule ‘women and children first’] would ensure that no male adult would ever reach his office on time, if at all. Needs must when the Devil drives is a more realistic motto for the Underground.\" I read that quote and picture Dave shepherding Jessie off to school every morning with a harried look on his face.

Well, suffice it to say we've been pretty miserable here.It's Dec 1 (pronounced deece). Dave says that a lot; Dec 1, Dec 10, Dec whatever. I don't remember any Novs, and there were certainly no Octs... I'm rambling. Delirious with the almost lack of pain perhaps? But to the point. It's the first of December which means I am staring down the barrel of the Taylor Kinzel glass show this weekend, a meeting with my accountant to go over my books on Friday (I haven't entered anything for the year yet), and a list of the work I will need from Black Cat ArtWorks (formerly Elliott Metal Works) for the Atlanta and Dallas shows due today.Yesterday as I wallowed in bed in pain, I realized that I can no longer comfortably rely on the foamcore wall and pedestal display system I used at shows before teaming up with Black Cat. A significantly large percentage of what I plan to show in Atlanta and in Dallas is the collaborative work with Black Cat. It needs to be hung on the walls and needs a heck of a lot more than foamcore to support it. I scramble today in my newfound lucidity to design a display that will a) support the work, and b) fit in the minivan. In our current display (the foamcore and gridwall set-ups that we store in Philly and in Vegas), each 2' wide gridwall panel weighs 24 lbs. I can't see loading up enough of them for a 10' X 20' booth into the minivan... the tires would explode. Then there's also the expense. I need another solution.And that's what's cookin' today.

I give thanks that my child is cooking with her father and still has all her fingers.I began preparations today for next year's show circuit. Yesterday I mentioned to Bill from Black Cat ArtWorks (getting used to Elliott Metal Works new name) that I am planning to add \"Whimsically Bent\", the collaborative works of Todd Briske and Brenda Griffith, to our booth for Philadelphia. He asked what I'm planning on *not* showing. I hadn't thought of that, but I keep adding and adding new work--mostly the big steel and glass collaborative work I do with him and Elaine, and I have \"retired\" about as much work as I want to. My booth isn't getting any bigger--I really can't afford bigger than 10 X 20 either in terms of cost or set-up/break-down time. So what to do?This morning I scanned an email from Amazon.com about black Friday electronic deals and a portable digital projector caught my eye. Hmmm. Maybe instead of bringing *all* the work, I bring a projector and run a slideshow from my laptop on the white foamcore walls. It was an idea worth pursuing so I started researching options and prices. It turns out that while there are cool, new, relatively inexpensive, wireless projectors that are the size of my iPod and hook up to it, they won't stand up to the 2000 watts of halogen light that will also be filling my booth. There must be something in the mid-range price, larger size that would work, but how to know which one? Maybe I could just rent a high-end projector until I figure out what I want and the price drops more. Nope. I checked local prices and 3-4 weeks of rental would just about pay for my own high-end one.What about some other technological solution? Instead of a projector, what about a large flat screen monitor? Oh yeah, now we're in a better price point, and no worries about the picture not showing up in the bright booth. Monitors are a couple hundred $$, but they only go up to 22\"-24\". Oh hey, I already have a 20\" iMac that is wiped right now because it just got another new hard drive last week. What about just using it? No additional cash outlay, it has its own storage and software so I could put all the pictures and slideshows right on it--no need for cables to the laptop... But it's only a 20\" screen. The images are supposed to grab people walking by the booth better or at least as well as the actual work would do. To do that, the images need to be at least the same size as the work and bigger than would be better.Even if I could afford a 36\"-44\" flat screen, would I want to hassle with shipping it around and worrying about someone stealing it at the show? No. So I'm back to projectors. I like this one, but for that price I'm really going to have to make sure I have a strong, valid need for it. It's too expensive to be just another cool slightly used gadget in my electronics cabinet."},

My list of things to do today is long and tedious--another reason I am still in the comfy chair with a blanket on my lap making lists and chatting on the phone. A quick post and then to work (forms, forms, forms, forms).New business direction ideas from the show: Open studio and summer camp for 7th-12th graders. I had several people ask me (parents of the 7th graders and others who knew what I had done with them) if I opened my studio the same way to other people or groups--kind of like pottery places do where you can come in and paint pieces and have them fired for you to pick up later. It might be fun to offer making suncatchers, wind chimes, Christmas ornaments, etc. during very limited open studio time. I can add info and sign up area (including a calendar) on the web site (as I revamp it). Small groups only.Several of the 7th graders (and their parents) asked me if I might offer summer camp sessions and I thought how fun it would be to do some mask-making sessions. I could do some research and offer a bit of education on the use of masks in various cultures. Then we could make some examples of simple bent rectangular and oval masks. The camp would culminate in the participants casting their own faces and making pate de verre style multi-fired masks that could then be decorated with wire, feathers, crystals, shells, beads, etc.Now I just need a way of fitting these ambitions in with an increased production schedule from the new shows I'm adding next year--an assistant will help with that. Good thing I have a lot of applicants for that position right now (and for apprentices--and I don't have to pay them!). Oh yes, the high school asked me if I would do a fieldtrip/workshop for their students too... Better get to work!"},
{"title": "Monday Madness and Collaboration", "date": "Monday, November 17, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Snow (Hey Oh)\" by the Chili Peppers (the Red Hot Fest continues) on iTunes. As promised yesterday, I write the saga of the new collaboration.I love Wikipedia: \"Collaboration is a recursive process where two or more people or organizations work together toward an intersection of common goals — for example, an intellectual endeavor that is creative in nature—by sharing knowledge, learning and building consensus. Collaboration does not require leadership and can sometimes bring better results through decentralization and egalitarianism. In particular, teams that work collaboratively can obtain greater resources, recognition and reward when facing competition for finite resources.\"Working with Elliott Metal Works has definitely been an intellectual endeavor that is creative in nature and I strongly believe that we have both obtained greater resources, recognition and reward at our shows as a result of our joint work. I have been inspired to create new styles and colorways and my sales have increased dramatically with the addition of the new work--moving both my art and my business to new levels. The partnership has been so stimulating and lucrative that I am all fired up about forming a new one. There are still more directions I would like to take my work that are closed to me when working with steel--e.g., it's very challenging to overcome the rust issue when designing pieces for outdoors, and the steel work is predominantly two-dimensional.Todd Briske is a local wire artist whom I have known for a number of years. He recently spent a couple of days in my studio helping out with the 7th grade fieldtrip. He was like a kid in a candy shop with all the broken discarded pieces I have lying around and during downtime, he'd grab up some of my junk, wrap it in aluminum wire and hang it on the back studio fence. I was completely enamored of the results and thought what a great potential collaboration I could have with him. Evidently my subconscious came to the same decision as after a couple of weeks of percolating, ideas for combined aluminum wire and fused glass work came pouring out of my head. Though the pieces we plan to do don't look anything like the work on the fence, they were a good jumping off point for my back brain.When I met with Todd last week to propose working together to him, he was just as giddy about the potential as I was. To start us out and test the waters, I am making up 100 ornaments like we did with the 7th graders and he's going to wrap them in large gauge aluminum wire for added decorative interest and hangability. He's also going to time the process so we have a starting point for figuring out how many we can sell. Won't do any good get an order from, say, Neiman Marcus for 1500 of them if he can't produce that many without having a mental breakdown or losing control of his hands... and the same goes for me. I haven't tried to whip out 100 small ornaments at a time either. I haven't been much of one for small work at all, but helping Jessie with her jewelry over the past couple of weeks was fun. And wow is it easy to pack and carry!On a more practical note, I will also gain the benefit of having a big strapping male to help set-up and break-down at shows. Delicate little me is just going to LOVE having an extra set of hands... (I'm getting too old for the physical rigor of the show circuit). Todd was initially interested in replacing Becky as my assistant, but I think collaborating on work is much more appropriate and a better fit."},

So why am I up so early on a Sunday--especially a Sunday after a festival? I am up because it is a very cold morning (I am not heating the upstairs yet this fall and with our bedroom door closed our room hits refrigerator temps) and Dave already got up--taking half of the warmth with him. He did cover me with a down comforter from the closet before he went downstairs, but by then the sun streaming in the bathroom window and my whirring mind had prodded me fully awakeAll through the day yesterday people asked me how the show was going, was I doing well. It's an indication of my mindset that every time I was asked, I didn't know what to say and stumbled out a meaningless \"good\" or a more honest (and puzzling to the questioner) \"interesting\". Why such difficulty with such an innocuous question? The question means is the show living up to your expectations, are you getting what you wanted to out of it--in short (usually) are you making a lot of money. For both professional and hobbyist artisans the main reason to do a show is to sell the work, i.e., make money. We're usually not just out there to have a good time. I don't know about the rest of you (except Ren, I think this is true for her too), but I have a good time by sleeping in, not by doing shows.This morning as I lay pondering and puzzling (and shivering) in bed, I realized the reason I had such difficulty with the how's-it-going question was because I never thought of the Waldorf holiday fair/artist market as a show-as-usual and so I hadn't actually set goals. I hoped for good sales, but I didn't expect them. What I ended up getting from the show was ultimately more valuable and more exciting to me than one-time sales would have been (though sales were okay too), and because I hadn't planned or even thought about getting it (what I got), the way it played out really was \"interesting\", intriguing, and inspirational enough to motivate me out of bed and onto laptop this morning.So what did I get?!? (you ask in exasperation--stop dancing around and spill it!) I got ideas for 2-3 for new business directions. Add this to the new collaboration I formed on Thursday and 2009 is shaping up to be a very motivational, expansive year! Tomorrow I'll detail the collaboration, and Tuesday I'll write about the business ventures after I've had a bit of time to flesh them out further. Now the day is over and it's time to Race For the Galaxy against my spouse while J plays Monopoly with Gramma."},

I have my feet up and am posting after the opening two hours of the Waldorf School Holiday Fair Artist Market. I had a realization this morning as I was gearing up for the day. With my uber organized, detail-oriented personality, I am incapable of matching effort to event. It doesn't matter if I'm doing the Buyer's Market of American Craft or a tiny school craft show in a basement room with burned out florescent lights, I put 100% thought, planning and angst into it.I also can't sell old work. Apparently I am not just bored by making it. I sold one piece tonight and it was a platter in one of the newest colorways (Tropical) cut-down from a large panel and slumped. What to do, what to do. I think I'll follow Becky's suggestion and take a bunch of new work in tomorrow too.Jessie did very well tonight. She only sold two necklaces, but she traded three necklaces a pin and a ring for a really cool crystal, feather, leather and copper piece from another artist. That's my girl--already figured out the best part of shows is the trading. Pics are of her just after set-up and getting the first check for her work. Yeah she smiles now, wait till it bounces...

It's not cold enough here to snow yet, but I am still on my Chili Peppers kick. Today the post is all about the glass--or at least the glass from a business perspective (ostensibly the reason for this blog).Yesterday I got the latest issue of Profitable Glass Quarterly. Loy Allen's orchids are on the cover and I feel smug as I suggested they do the studio profile on her. She is a North Dakota boro artist from whom I bought a praying mantis for Dave at the last February Buyer's Market--gorgeous work. The issue also contains an article I wrote on pricing work for the artist. Today I get to wrestle with and eventually reconcile all of the factors involved with pricing as I prepare for the Waldorf Artist Market this weekend. These factors include my expectation that this won't be a high dollar show and my desire to move one-of-a-kind, limited edition, and retired series work.Let's not beat about the Bush (unless we're really lucky and we have a big stick and the secret service is conspicuously absent), the economy is tight. I anticipate that the majority of the shoppers will be parents who already pay private school tuition in the aforementioned tight economy and won't be up for big ticket glass art. Add that to the fact that it's the school/church variety holiday craft show--not a well-advertised established art show run by either professional promoters or a strong neighborhood volunteer network--and I do not think I'll break a $1,000 this show. I might not break $500. Heck, I might not break $250.On the other hand, I am pretty prolific and have a lot of work hanging around the studio that I can't market to galleries because the shows I do are order shows--not cash and carry. That means I would have to take these pieces as samples and I either can't or don't want to do them again. I just want to get them out of the studio so I can free up room for current work. I would like to recoup a bit of the cost, but I'm not picky as long as they just Go Away.Add together my expectations and my situation with an abundance of work to move and the temptation is great to offer everything at wholesale or even below. Is this a good idea? Probably not. In Art (Craft, whatever...) perception is everything. This will be the first time most of these people have seen my work. Do I wish to set in their minds a perceived value of it based on the price I am asking for these pieces? There is nothing wrong with them technically or artistically, I am just bored with them. We artists have tiny attention spans. We get bored, we move on, we don't need old work around to remind us of what we used to do.Yes, I can put out signage telling people what a great steal of a deal they're getting and not to expect these prices Ever Again, but do people really read? Will they remember? Even if they acknowledge their bargain intellectually, viscerally are they going to think that's what my work is worth? I really, really, really want to sell these pieces--and I wouldn't mind a quick fix of Christmas cash. I don't have room for both the old work and the new (I am sharing three six foot by three foot tables with Jessie and another jeweler--Dee and Todd aren't able to do the show so there'll just be the three of us and I expect to fill almost two tables on my own). Am I shooting myself in the foot? Mox nix, I'm going to go for it and just weather any pricing fallout.Jessie will probably be the big hit of the show. Her work is perfectly priced and gorgeous--and it has the advantage of having been designed and created by a seven year-old (with a bit of expert advice from Mom and Dee on glass and jewelry making). How could you resist rings for $4 and a pair of dichro earrings for $8? I'm setting her up to take care of me in my old age. Note to self: Do Not Become a Stage Mom."},

Some days the glass is half full. Some days the glass is half empty. Some days you can't find the glass. Welcome to Wednesday. The Waldorf Holiday Fair/Artist Market is this Friday and Saturday. Guess I better root through the studio to figure out what I'm going to take.Dee is coming down today and bringing her new family addition Sombra (a Bouvier de Flandres) to romp with Baxter and Seraph. I'll get her to help me root (and dust). One of the really big pieces I had to refire Monday because it had schmutz in it *still* had schmutz in it when I opened the kiln yesterday. After two firings there are a lot of air bubbles too close to the surface to fire it again (they rise a bit every time the glass goes liquid) so I can't fire it again it. Looks like it'll be a display piece for the new January shows (20\" round panel for a stand) and I'll have to remake the piece for the gallery today. It and the sample sets are all I have left on the schedule. (And new work for the Taylor Kinzel Glass Show the first weekend in December and for the Atlanta and Dallas shows...)Got another show solicitation yesterday, this one from the One of a Kind Wholesale Show in NYC a the end of January. I was tempted for a nanosecond--and then I remembered I am already doing *two* new big shows in January. No need to be nuts (nutser).And that's it for glass. What I was really thinking when I started the post was that I still don't have the loom warped and I am only 1/3 of the way through knitting the first scarf for the Artist Market. Looks like my textile offerings are going to be a bit sparse. I need about five more hours a day--or I need to sleep less. But I like sleep. I need sleep. I am crabby if I don't get sleep. So I'm back to petitioning for five more hours in a day. Anyone else care to sign?"},

Yesterday was a glassilicious, weaving and knitting-filled day--well nigh perfect in other words. I reviewed the layout for my upcoming sidelight article in Glass Patterns Quarterly and it's gorgeous. I committed to the Dallas Finds show and picked my spot (a 10 X 20 in the Atrium--prime, prime, prime). Unfortunately I didn't get the scheduled shipments out as a couple of the pieces were not perfect and I had to refire them. I have my fingers crossed that I will be able to ship all but one order today--and it can go out tomorrow along with all the sample sets.When I have nothing left to make and ship for the year, what will I do with myself? I spent part of yesterday afternoon at Kavarna with the spouse and I just couldn't pick up the threads of the ERP system to date. Note to self: Do not start a software development project and then let it languish unimagined and untouched for a couple of months. I reviewed the requirements I wrote up on paper again and hope to be able to actually analyze the current database structure by next week. Development to follow?Have you ever noticed how the minute it looks like you have some spare time something breaks to fill it? The hard drive on the home desktop decided to commit suicide over the weekend and now I look forward to the joys of taking it in, getting it replaced and having the data pulled from it... I roll on the floor laughing so hard my sides hurt. Scratch the having the data pulled part: It's always way too expensive to try to get data off a failed disk. Glad I backed everything up recently before upgrading the OS. Probably lost the complete collated iTunes, but the music is all safe on one of the laptops or the backup drive. Grr. What a time-wasting annoyance, and nothing to do with glass, weaving OR knitting! And speaking of knitting, I fringed the scarf I knit for J last night. Cute, cute cute and just little girl sized.Many words are coming to me in threes this morning, wonder if it's a portent of the day. Now it's 7:15 and time to roust the Sprout for school.

But yesterday I finished J's knitted scarf but for the fringe, and I wound a warp for seven chenille scarves on the warping mill. Later today I'll warp the loom for the first time in over six years (oh it's good to have the basement finished!). The scarves are to sell at the holiday fair this coming weekend. The warp (the length of the scarves) is in charcoal chenille and each weft (width) will be in a different contrasting color from hot pink to fern green. I will weave them in 12 basic tabby and twill patterns that all have the same threading and treadle tie-up. But glass first...Shipping, shipping, shipping today (and one fuse load) and tomorrow and then all the orders for the year will be out. I also have the last batch of ornaments to clean up and deliver to the 7th graders for them to put ribbons on before the holiday fair.

I'll get Mom to help me with that task.In celebration of the end of the election project for Dave and the final orders shipping for me, I am having a Kavarna afternoon with my spouse and working on either the studio books, the ERP system or the website.

The order is in now--Jessie is adding glass buttons to her offerings for the Holiday Fair next weekend--and should be here mid-week next week (just in time to glue up the buttons!).While at Kavarna I had a chat with the sales rep in charge of the handmade section of the Atlanta Gift Mart in January and I have decided to do the show.

No post yesterday as I was off to the 7th graders at l'aube of dawn and had all the Jessie-out-the-door things to do too (Dave was still at CNN making the servers run on time for the election). But he was home last night and we all had a non-burned home-cooked meal of chipotle chicken, rice, beans, fried plantains with sour cream, and tortillas. Ah comfort starch.I am fueled for a big glass day--too bad there isn't big glass to do. I still have yesterday's loads to fire--life interrupted glass as it has so often lately--but I should have them in by noon. I realized this morning that I have an appointment scheduled with my accountant tomorrow to go over my books for the year to date. I am going to have to reschedule as I haven't entered anything into Quickbooks since January and there's no way I can get it all in this afternoon--life interruptions again. I finally broke down and bought Quickbooks for the Mac. I got it just after a new version was released and so far it hasn't been too heinous (of course all I've done is migrate my old data and attempt [and fail] to establish connectivity with my bank accounts).It's good to have the election done. It's been Dave's project for the past three years and now that the climax is over he'll have a lot of Kavarna days between now and the end of the year. Kavarna days (days when we work from the Kavarna coffee shop in Oakhurst) are good for me as they focus me on the ERP system and my website. It's hard to go to the studio when there's nothing to fire. It's a wonderful, welcoming space, but so is my house, and it's too easy to putter at home if I don't have something that must be done in the studio.

Either that or I'm just procrastinating about getting over to the studio to work on the sample sets some more--they just won't die. Really, I'm going to have to make a sample set bar every time I make a regular piece just so I never have to do six simultaneous sets again. I find myself tempted to retire colorways just so I don't have to make samples of them!Glass calls to me in all seasons but fall. Fall is given over to textiles, and this year since the old studio (the basement) has been turned into a lovely room and central living space in the house (and is coincidentally the home for the loom) I have been in a froth of knitting, preparing to weave, and buying yet more yarn on ebay. The aforementioned yarn started arriving yesterday and life is now rife with possibilities and little projects. None of this yarn is destined for sweaters, oh no. This is a couple of days on a scarf here, a couple of days on a poncho there. It would be less than a couple of days but the knitting and soon the weaving all happen in the evening and on the weekends. Glass may not call, but it still demands.Yesterday a lovely celebratory lunch with Becky--celebrating her move on to a new full-time professional position. It still escapes me why anyone would want to take a full-time well-paid position outside the arts when there is so much room to starve in creative poverty in the arts industry. I hope the new position works out for her. In this tough economic climate people are lucky just to have the security of jobs. I am going to be glad if all the galleries that owe me for work get it paid off before the end of the year. I had another one yesterday tell me the checks (multiple, post-dated checks) are in the mail--just tell me, not ask if they could change our agreed upon terms for their initial order. I am more than happy to work with people as they go through tough times--heck, I'm still owed a couple hundred dollars by a gallery that closed several months ago (and it's getting time to have another chat with them)--but I like to be asked for terms instead of having them dictated to me.But it's Friday. It's Halloween. It's too wonderful a day to start out being crabby about money. Take care of the people around you and the rest will take care of itself.

Yesterday I completely missed posting as I headed off to the Waldorf School at 7:30 am for another fun-filled morning of ornament-making with the 7th graders. The pictures are from their visit to the studio a week ago though, as I remembered my camera, but forgot to take any pictures at school yesterday!I am so energized and renewed by the experience of seeing what vastly different and wildly creative pieces 24 people can produce with access to the same raw materials and canvas size. It is such a privilege to share knowledge with an enthusiastic group and it makes me wonder again why I don't teach more. I have one more Wednesday at Waldorf before the Holiday Fair in mid November, and I'm already looking forward to working with the 7th grade on their auction project for the spring--and maybe some individual projects. I may have to think about opening up studio time in the afternoons for students who wish to pursue work in glass... Maybe next year I should think about branching out and offering classes to students at the Waldorf High School.In the meantime, I have another teaching/sharing opportunity coming up with my ikebana group. I am in the second instructor course now and one of my assignments was to do arrangements in personally designed containers. I took two vases to class that I made when I was researching projects for the book, and the rest of the group was so excited by them (and by the fact that they are the most basic of beginner projects) that they asked if I would teach a container-making session in the studio for them. Need to get that on the calendar for some time in November or December too.The studio calendar is still beautifully clear after next week. I continue to slog through the first batch of sample sets, and today I begin the last two orders of the year, then... nothing concrete planned! Dave is working 70 hours between now and Wednesday morning and then he, too, is staring down the barrel of nothing but documentation and writing a few tests for the rest of the year. I almost wish we were going somewhere, but I hate to travel around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Besides, I think the spouse is going to be tired and brain-dead himself and need a little time just to be around home.Becky's last day as studio assistant is tomorrow and then Dee takes over--though with my upcoming schedule I can't see needing any help until after the first of the year. Guess we can always play with the vitrigraph! Oh and she's doing the Holiday Fair with Jessie and me in November. And speaking of the J, she is so worn out doing projects and playing with Gramma every afternoon that she crashed in the car yesterday after running to Target to get her vampire teeth for her Halloween costume. (Like the stylin' rainboots?) Even after we got home and I opened the car door she still slept on, little dulcet snores emanating from the backseat.Gramma is going to make her a cape today out of blue-satin-lined black polar fleece for the rest of her costume.Now I suppose I had better stop chatting and get to the studio. I don't know why I am so disliking making the the sample sets--it's just like making actual pieces. Maybe it's having to do every single blessed colorway... Good-bye lunch for Becky today.

They are going to figure out what they want to do and I'll take all the materials and tools and we'll work in their classroom Wednesday morning making pieces to sell. They kept everything they made last week and need to make some ornaments to sell at the holiday fair.Now off to ship and put in another supply order from Hoy's. Happy weekend!"},
{"title": "Thursday Mysteries", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, no music. I am poised to hear the front door open and my child come in screaming about the way her sleeves feel weird, one shoe is smaller than the other, the socks don't feel right, and she hates her overshirt--basically the same sounds she made as she went out the door with her father on her way to school in the midst of an apocalyptic meltdown. The \"I told you so\" I got from the spouse as he went out the door didn't help. (He told me I wouldn't be able to solve an irrational problem with rational means. It didn't matter if J tried on all her clothes--old and new--in a calm frame of mind and said they felt fine. She would still melt down out of the blue some mornings with oversensitivity to some perceived bump or tightness or itch or SOMETHING. I hate that he was right.) *sigh*Shaking off the nerve-shattering start to the morning and moving on... Stacy is heading to Commerce this morning to meet Bill and get my latest load of stands (once a studio assistant, always a studio assistant ;-) as I have to get a kiln load in before a 10:00 meeting in Decatur followed by an 11:30 meeting in Buckhead to help Elaine with her Washi Arts blog. Back in the studio at 1:00 to get the second kiln load in and ship a piece to Asheville. Then of to get J from school at 2:45 and then her friend Grace (also Stacy's daughter) from her school so they can have a playdate this afternoon while I get the third and final kiln load in... It's a full day.And now, as promised, the scoop on Jessie's Jewels. I previously mentioned that I'm doing the Holiday Craft Fair at J's school in mid-November as a way of cleaning out a bunch of old work and pieces with slight flaws from the studio. Jessie likes to make things in the studio too and is always asking me if she can make \"dewdrops\" (that's what she calls the ubiquitous glass blobs you can buy anywhere these days). The other day I let her make little fused pieces from shards of scrap and scraps of dichro. They turned out really well and I thought they would make nice children's jewelry. So yesterday I priced some findings for necklaces, bracelets, rings and pins, and found she can make a tidy little sum for college on $3-$5 jewelry pieces and  $.25 pieces of fused glass. I ordered the findings, and yesterday after school she and her grandmother whipped up another small kiln load full of little fused pieces. We'll see if she maintains the interest and focus for it. It would be a great way for her to build a savings account without having to work at Burger King or some other more traditional high school job (and as she's starting when she's 6, think how much she could have saved by the time she's 18!).I close with the tale of the assistant. I am reminded yet again of the scene in \"Shakespeare In Love\" when the Geoffrey Rush character explains the nature of the theatre business to Mr. Fennyman the apothecary (also the money man for the play and a bit-part actor in it). Some time ago I paraphrased and adopted that monologue as my studio motto: \"Allow me to explain about my business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. So what do we do? Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery.\"My continuing tale of assistants is the same way. First I needed help and mentioned to my friend Stacy that I needed to start looking for an assistant. She told me that coincidentally she wanted to pick up some part time work and so began the first assistantship. We fit beautifully and life went on well. But her her business got too busy for her to continue splitting her time so she let me know I needed to find someone else. She and Becky (another old friend who used to own the first gallery I was in in Atlanta) met as they helped me setup for the Decatur festival in May and Stacy reminded me that I really needed to start looking for a new assistant in front of Becky. Becky said she needed something for the summer until her new job started and I was set again. Then last week Becky reminded me in front of Dee as we were preparing for the field trip that I needed to start looking for a new assistant as she starts her new job at the end of the month. And guess what? Dee wants to be my assistant now! Am I lucky or what? It all turned out well and I don't know how. It's a mystery.Now off to get the first kiln load in before my 10:00."},

I am filled with joy this morning--though not for anything New Orleans oriented. That choice was incidental. Dave worked until 10:30 at CNN last night--got to love those 13+ hour days--so he doesn't have to go in right away this morning. He is dropping the Sprout off at school and then home to code for awhile. I am looking forward to a little time together, just us and our laptops. And tonight my Mom gets in from Montana for a month-long visit! Joy, indeed.I should probably run over to the studio and turn the heat on before Becky gets there. It was really cold in there yesterday. I had to take a break in the afternoon to come home and treadmill just so I could warm up and wake up. At least I remembered to get the orchids in yesterday (it's 43 degrees out there again this morning!).Today, firing, shipping, and unpacking glass--all the things I didn't get done yesterday. Becky gets to sort the last of the student projects into their boxes so I can deliver them to the school this afternoon. I am sure they are anxiously waiting for them.Stacy harangued me (again!) about not posting pics from the fieldtrip, but my house is so clean I can't find the gizmo I need to transfer the files from the camera to the computer.

Last night I hauled the big black sweater (knit for me by my Father-in-Law) out of the depths of the closet and cuddled up in it. This morning I resisted turning the heat on to take the chill off (it was 62 degrees in the house) and am buried again in the sweater with a chenille throw over my legs and feet. I am reminded of my time in Chicago when the temps would dip in October and the powers that be wouldn't turn the heat on in the big buildings because there would be a few more days of Indian summer heat before winter settled in for good and they couldn't switch easily back and forth between heat and air conditioning (or they just wanted to save on utilities). Outside it's 41 degrees. I hope my orchids didn't die. I hadn't realized it would get so cold so soon (it's been in the 70's and will be 74 again tomorrow). Got to bring them in this week.I never got around to posting about the field trip over the weekend--too busy at home. I didn't treadmill either, but I should have carried a pedometer yesterday as I did nothing but walk all day. While D was at CNN (no days off till the election has gasped its last), J and I cleaned and straightened the front porch, the front hall (there has been an old kitchen table in it for the past several weeks and you know how much stuff I can put on an empty flat surface...), the breakfast room, the kitchen, the living room, and the dining room. Unsurprisingly it took all day. The breakfast room has been my pseudo office for a couple of years, and I found bills and other papers from its inauguration as I cleaned up. I banished them all to the real office--and hope to get that great snarling pile of unusable room straightened out next weekend.I did go over to the studio a couple of times over the weekend to fire and move stuff to there from the house. It, too, is clean, tidy, and spacious thanks to Becky, Dee, and Todd--even after the whirlwind that was 30 people-as-locusts! While we waited for pizza to be delivered Friday after the fieldtrippers had left, everyone put away all the materials--Becky is dangerously organized. Then we came over to our house and had lots of pizza and a couple of bottles of champagne. I think it's safe to say a good time was had by all--and we only needed a bandaid for one student (Todd went through three during clean-up, but the actual fieldtrip was safe).Today, back to real life. There are 115 sheets of glass and 660 lbs of frit left to unpack and move into the studio. Before that, an article review, a firing, and ikebana, with another firing to follow. Tomorrow, more of the same. Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives--too bad I never had the time or interest for soaps."},

I was harangued (HARANGUED!)  by Stacy for not posting earlier today, but, hey! I was busy! Today was the dress rehearsal for the 7th grade field trip in the studio tomorrow. Actually it was both the dress rehearsal AND the planning meeting... some of us aren't very good at doing things in advance. After J has gone to bed I will head back to the studio and put the example pieces we made today for tomorrow in a couple of kilns to fire. The fieldtrippers are going to do both tack and full fuse projects to observe the effects of time and temperature on the way glass melts and fuses.For the concerned out there, I have eliminated the vitrigraph part of the program for the day. I figured that it was not a good idea to have 24 12-13 year olds playing around with molten glass on their first day in the studio when their parents haven't signed any release forms for them... I replaced it with painting--glassline paints and mica gum arabic mix. Should be exciting.I wish it were still light outside as I would love to take and post a photo of the way Becky's friend Todd wire-wrapped my trashy treasures from the studio and hung them on the fence. It is so much more artistic a presentation than just using Ace Hardware plate hangers would have been. Todd is the one who was roped into presenting the painting sessions tomorrow.So the fieldtrippers will be in the studio for 2-1/2 hours. I am going to do a half hour at the beginning of the visit on studio safety, an intro to kilnforming, a brief demo of cutting and making a Morceaux de Verre piece including a side-by-side of pre and post fired pieces, and I'll finish with a tour of the studio. I'll also make sure they know that my book is sold in the school shop, if they're interested in learning more ;-). Then the 24 will break up into four groups of six to through three 1/2 hour work sessions and lunch. Todd, as already mentioned, will lead the painting session. Dee is going to demonstrate combining strips, shards and circles together to fuse into open pieces (no base glass under them). Becky will show how to use base squares of clear irid to hold shards, stringer, frit and dichro chips either tack or full fused onto them. All the ornaments made will either have loops fused into them or be wire-wrapped after firing. I'll float from group to group and answer questions. All of the pieces made tomorrow by the fieldtrippers (four or five each) will be sold at the Waldorf School of Atlanta Holiday Market on November 15-16, come on down...The glass arrived from Bullseye today, but there was no way we could get it unloaded with all the studio prep for tomorrow. I was all sanguine about leaving it out as the sky was blue as blue could be all day today, but I just saw it's supposed to rain tomorrow. Grr. Got to find the tarps to cover it tonight.Dave is going to run buy a couple bottles of champagne for me now--I promised Dee, Becky and Todd that we'd have it at 1:30 tomorrow when the field trip ends. I may not post tomorrow, Stacy, but I'll get photos and a day-in-review up over the weekend."},

It's from the workout playlist--I am anticipating the day. Vacation's over and I'm almost awake enough for it. The glass might come today, it will probably come tomorrow. Dee will be in the studio tomorrow and Friday to help with the prep for the fieldtrip and fieldtrip itself. So will Becky, and I am hoping I can get a friend of Becky's and potential new assistant Todd (a wire-wrap artist) to help. If he can come help, I can add an extra dimension to the work the kids will do, and I'll be free to float from group to group.I really need to sit down and plot out the flow of the two and a half hours they'll be there. Tour of the different areas of the studio, intro to fusing including examples of the different stages of fusing from tack to full and slumping, brief touch on the physics (COE, viscosity, surface tension, etc), cutting glass, demo of making a morceaux de verre piece ending with opening a kiln and taking out a finished morceaux de verre piece for comparison. Then break into groups and go through the stations: lunch (outside at the picnic table), vitrigraph, cutting, and assembling ornaments for me to fire after they're gone. Sounds about right, except that there's no way I can fit 24 12-13 year olds in the kiln room at the same time and even making it work in the cutting room is going to be tight. We'll work it out. And I need a bunch of tools too from cutters to wheeled nippers, bottles of glue. Yup. Need to do a step-by-step with Becky and Dee.Talk about being back into the thick of it right away! No easing back in for me. I guess that's what yesterday was for, unfortunately it was also a little girl playdate at our house so my studio time was limited. Life choices. Glad I get to make them.Becky won't be in till 10:30 today so I am going to head over to the studio now to get today's kiln loads prepped. I hate having to pull from my extra-wide sheets, but I have got to get pieces fired for orders.A last note: I am physically, mentally, emotionally and every other way incapable of throwing out pieces that didn't turn out. I even have all the pieces that have broken at galleries, in shipping and at shows. But I can no longer have them cluttering up the floor or shelving in the studio. The pieces fall into three groups: finished work that doesn't fit my current commercial series or has a slight flaw in it, pieces that aren't/can't be finished or are broken and the glass is not re-usable, and broken pieces that can be reused in a melt of some kind. Yesterday Becky and I hit upon a genius solution for all of it. The slightly flawed/not my current work I'm going to sell at Jessie's school's holiday fair for bargain (and I mean *bargain*) prices. The unfinished/unusable pieces will be affixed to the fence in the back of the studio with plate hangars and nails or arranged on the ground in the front garden. I've already had one piece stolen from out there, but I don't mind--if someone finds it beautiful enough that they want to keep it, it's better than my throwing it out. The meltable scrap will all be consolidated into storage one bin. I look forward to having a lot more room to store actual production work by the end of the year!And now back in the saddle..."},

Jessie's pre-teenager and my inner teenager both like to sleep late (and mine likes to go to bed early too). I find myself dozing in the filtered fall sunlight a lot--the only energetic adverb that can be applied to my activities of the past four days is \"voracious\" and it is only linked to reading on the Kindle. It's been a lovely little unplanned vacation. Today I really need to get back to the real world--glass to make, glass to ship, the schedule for a 7th grade field trip in the glass studio to plan.My glass order from Bullseye is due this week and I lucked out and they were able to send me 120 sheets of clear irid. Glass ahoy! Time to go grab a mug of coffee...  Ahh, Austin mug and sweet Italian cream coffeemate (one of my little perversions).One last subject change before I head off to the studio to ease back into work: Inspired by Dave, Stacy and Becky I got back on the build-a-healthy-body wagon again last week. It wasn't a lot of fun--sometimes you get endorphins, sometimes you just get tired, last week was just tired for me. But I made it through the week and have added a new goal for this week: Increase my treadmill time by one minute every day. This tiny adjustment is very unlike me. I have always been a woman of big sweeping strokes and bold action ala \"let's double the time this week!\". I think the lack of endorphins generated from last week's workouts and my current extreme laziness enabled sanity to prevail. A minute is nothing, as I proved yesterday when I tried it out the time extension for the first time. And yet, at the end of a month I *will* have doubled my time. Small steps, big goals.

I should've driven him to the airport and kept the Mini for the weekend. Heck, I (we) should've gone with him! In 10 minutes I'm dropping J off at a playdate for the day. Sadly it looks like it won't be a sleepover, but then I don't know what I'd do if I were alone a day and a night. I can't remember the last time I was home with neither J nor D... Must have been before J was born so almost seven years. Weird. I spent over half of my adult life living alone, and now I can't even remember what it feels like.But glass, you say. What about glass? Wednesday I took some of the clear irid scrap that I suspected to be contaminated with yellow and fired it to fuse temps in the little kiln. I suspected it because it looked like it might be a bit more yellow or off in some way from the rest of the scrap. I fired about 10 pieces--all identical pre-fire--and only one of them changed, but it struck to a bright yellow. The good news is that it was only one. The bad news is that it was only one. If all of them had struck I would feel more confident about my ability to spot the problem glass. But since I was only about 10% right, I have no way to tell which scrap (morceaux) might be a problem. Becky and I identified about 20-30 lbs of morceaux on Wednesday (up to six 5-lb jars) that could contain contaminated glass... What a massive headache. Bullseye wants me to fill out a standard form of what I did, how I combined the glass, the manufacturing dates and sheet numbers of the affected glass, ya de ya de ya. While I can see the value from their viewpoint, all it means from mine is wasting a lot more time on an expensive and time-consuming problem caused by someone else's mistake. I am not paid to do quality control. I understand their desire for some evidence that the glass was contaminated, but the data I have provided already--written up by my rep, not me--should be enough. The information requested on the form just irritates me.Shaking it off. One of my galleries called yesterday about an order for 150-250 pieces for a client by Mid-November. On the one hand, I would love to have an order this size as the year slows down, on the other, it's a short amount of time in which to do that many fused and slumped pieces, and the client (understandably for an order that size) wants pricing closer to wholesale, and the gallery wants to make their normal cut, and I can't really go lower in my pricing... I feel a bit squeezed. Got to work it out today to see if it makes sense or if I should just walk away. This is a gallery with whom I have a really good relationship and I want to do it if I can, but I don't want to lose money. Bullseye has raised their glass prices 10%, my prices will not go up to compensate till after the first of the year, shipping has also skyrocketed this year, and I'm being asked to go even lower than my regular wholesale pricing.Okay, I need to find a happy place! This week has been filled with gloomy posts. I am going to end with a ray of sunshine... I'll let you know when I find one."},

Good thing my firing schedule is light right now. One of her friends from school and her family are off to Bermuda for the break. I wish we were going--I need a beach.Lost two more large pieces to the contaminated clear yesterday--the replacements for the first two ruined  by it. And I was very careful when I laid them out to check for any suspicious looking chunks of clear. I did find a couple of pieces of scrap that have obvious yellow streaks in them (already made into morceaux and mixed in with all the rest) so I am solidly confident I have identified the problem to be yellow contaminating one or more of my clear sheets. As the current Bullseye yellow formula darkens on firing it can be difficult (if not impossible) to see it against the irid surface. It is also reactive with turquoise resulting in brown where they touch and ruining my pieces which are in shades of turquoise and blue--no browns allowed--ordered by a new gallery.*sigh* Remaking again and wondering how many more pieces I am going to lose to the contaminated sheet(s). Considering I cut over 20 sheets of clear irid for my work last week I am lucky to be able to identify a range of production dates the glass could have been in, and there is no chance I can come up with a sheet number. I am, however, sending the scraps I did find with yellow in them to Bullseye. Of all the colors that could be accidentally mixed in with the clear I can't think of one that could be worse than the yellow.In answer to the question posed by the title of the post: No."},

The big stories are the debate last night, and the fed and other central banks worldwide joining to enact emergency rate cuts. Scary times. Today's post, to the sound of the rain, is all about the economy. I hope I can feel good by the end of it...I got a call from one of my galleries yesterday about a past due invoice. They were frank and honest about not being able to pay it till at least the end of the month because their credit line is frozen, their rent is past due and all sales have to go to pay rent before paying artists.Another gallery called and asked to exchange two large pieces of work they've had for over a year for several smaller pieces so they can stock new work in hopes of holiday sales without having to come up with as much cash for them.About a week ago I contacted the only non-local gallery where I have work on consignment (almost $1,000 of work) about terminating our relationship as they have only sold one small piece during the past year they have had my work. The owner asked if I would be willing to leave the work till the end of October as they have a big event in October and more work might sell. A comment she made during the conversation referencing them having sold \"a few pieces\" makes me begin to fear that the time between now and the end of October is less for them to sell more work than to use to come up with the money to cover the work they've already sold and not paid me for--sales that will be obvious when I get the remaining work back. Or worse.Finally, the gallery that closed its doors in the spring still owing me money has not made any payments on the outstanding amount yet, nor have they communicated any intention to. I know that most people are as honest as they can be, and they do what they have to do to minimize the impact of their losses. I just wish that, for once, I would not be in the last of the bottom pile of people who get an exhausted shrug and a dazed apologetic look when the financial dust settles.I am especially focused on finances right now as I just ordered over 700 lbs of sheet glass and 500 lbs of frit from Bullseye that I have to pay for at the end of the week. A net 30 manufacturing type business means you are at the mercy of payment cycles while having constant expenses. In order to float it all you either need to have a big bank account or a big line of credit--either of which remain basically constant with the fill-ups and drains in the cycle. I don't have a big bank account, and, unfortunately, I think my line of credit might also have been frozen by the bank even though they never said anything to me about it.However, I end on if not an optimistic at least a resolute note. I don't have time to be Chicken Little. Yes, the sky may be falling, but running around and flapping my wings about it won't change anything at all. The best I can do is to keep on going, follow my long-term plan, be happy with stability if not growth, and be able to weather (hopefully small) losses. This is not the time for radical, panicked changes and hoarding. This is the time to stay the course with grace, determination, and calm.PS--Thank you, thank you to Ren for the lovely artwork above.

Unfortunately, the treadmilling was about the only success from yesterday--except for the new mermaid piece.For the first time in a very, VERY long time the irid on the back of the Bullseye glass in my pieces reacted with the thinfire on the shelf and ruined two of three 16\" X 24\" panels fired on Saturday. If that wasn't bad enough, three of four 16\" rounds had a brownish streak in the the clear area of the glass that wasn't there before the glass was fired. It's definitely in the sheet glass--not a contaminant on the surface, but it must have been a striker color because I couldn't see it before I fired. I assemble on white paper so any discoloration would show glaringly before the piece ever made it into the kiln.So today I have to remake all those pieces. But before that, the dentist.

Today is another big shipping day--probably the last one of the year. Orders are tapering off, which is just fine as I am ramping up to doing ornaments with the 7th graders at J' school for the holiday fair, and then helping them come up with and execute their own personal projects. So many possibilities, so little time!I am also preparing to wish Becky good luck and good bye (just as an assistant, not as a friend--though I do also wish her good luck as a friend) at the end of the month as she embarks on a new full-time job. I shall be assistantless again, but it'll all work out. It always does. (\"Fall On Me\" by R.E.M.--I may have to save this playlist!)With all the will in the world I did not get the Chanukiote designed for the Jewish Museum of New York again this year. Time trumps will every time. I think the best thing to do is just keep working on them so I'll have them for next Buyer's Market. (\"Tourniquet\" by Evanescence from \"Fallen\"... I think that's all the possible axes for \"fall\": song title, artist, album with 36 more songs on the list.) If I take both the Chanukiote and an apple and honey plate--done by February, Elise might forgive me for not having them (again) this year.The post today ends with inspiration--it's not glass and should arguably be on Stranded in the South instead of here, but, whatever.On Saturday I saw Stacy for the first time in a few weeks and I was amazed: This weekend she will realize her goal of going from couch potato to 5 K and she looks fantastic! Sure, she's lost weight and toned up (exercise will do that to you), but more importantly, she *glows*. I was completely awestruck at how great she looks.Closer to home, my own spouse has taken up the sledgehammer (also known as the shovelglove) and his upper body now has dents in it. No, no--not from dropping a sledgehammer on it, but from the workout carving out and defining his muscles. He's been at this for three weeks now (in addition to lunchtime walks carrying a big weight in his backpack) and, like Stacy, is looking awesome--he glows too! I told him when he started that if he got in shape I would get up off my lazy behind and follow suit. Both he and Stacy have me so motivated that I actually walked on the treadmill yesterday and did my own sledgehammering!

Closer inspection revealed that iTunes was completely broken--it didn't remember that I moved the library from the laptop hardrive to the external drive--and I had to reset the location and rebuild the Library. So it chugs along rebuilding and I blog in silence. Did any of the preceding sentences make sense? The same technology that allows us to listen to any music we want with the click of a mouse also makes our lives needlessly complicated... And I just realized that the reason the Library was broken is that I renamed the external drive where it lives from \"Austin\" to \"Missoula\" so I could name Dave's new external \"Austin\"... I am a moron. I broke it. I fixed it too, and the National play on.That's enough about things other than glass--today is all about the glass. I have already been to the studio to open kilns and check the status of the *four* (count them, FOUR!) firings I did yesterday. Three will be cool enough for Becky to unload when she arrives, Bettina--who is already slow to cool due to her extra insulation and the big cordierite kiln shelf--is still over 500 degrees. It'll be several hours before we can open and empty her. When I looked at her controller I noticed that the firing took over 11 hours! It usually takes 5-6. I must have maxed out the electrical consumption and created my own mini brown out yesterday.Today I fuse, I ship, I slump, and I photograph all the cool new work that's been coming out of the kilns before it heads out the door. One of my galleries requested large oval pieces of glass (instead of rectangles) for several of the large stands, and they also wanted the Elliott Metal Works Mermaid done as a stand for another glass oval. That piece won't be done till tomorrow, but it's going to be stunning. Maybe I'll have time over the weekend to update the website with pics of all the new work.Now time is awasting, got to head back to the studio. This time I think I'll get dressed first."},

Sadly, I will need to fire some this weekend to make that goal, but being caught up will be worth it! Thanks to the 20 sheets of glass I blew through for this week's kiln loads, I need to get another order into Bullseye by tomorrow. I think I'll up my order to 120 sheets this time. I can't even begin to imagine how much frit I'm going to need... And this time I need to remember to ask my rep NOT to have the entire shipment banded together. The last order I got was over 1500 lbs and the driver and I together couldn't get it on the pallet jack and off the truck (the truck was parked on a tiny incline--just enough so that I had to get a couple of guys from the autobody shop across the street to help unload).Good things were accomplished yesterday on the ERP system. Too bad I won't be able to market and sell it, but I think it's too mesyncratic (like idiosyncratic, but more personal and less Greek). Ah it's good to sit in the sun and listen to Elvis guilt-free. Even if I were back in the studio there's nothing I could be doing as all three kilns are too hot to unload. So I'll post, work on the ERP system until my battery dies, and then read from my Kindle as I wait for Bill. I'm all technology all the time!"},

Several orders are due to ship and a few more came in last week. Once I get the current batch done I'll have a break till the middle of October--and none too soon.

Blech today, and looking forward to more firing. More shipping. More orders to process. And sidelights to do the final fuse on. I say final, but due to unfortunate time constraints the final also will be the first with all the components together.Up till now I have been working piecemeal on the sidelights--making gems, doing simultaneous design and layout (the way I work best), making more gems,  cutting more raw elements, and doing more design--adding to the final work a little more every day. Today, instead of the planned tack-fuse, I am going to have to Very Carefully full fuse all the gems, cut elements, and frit together as the sidelights are scheduled to be installed on Saturday morning and they will need a long time to cool.Better hop to it!"},

Oh I'm not planning to rush out and buy a new one, but if someone decides to sell a used one in my area I won't dismiss it out of hand. While Bettina and Bertha are great for big production loads, I am finding myself cramped on space for small fix loads like a re-slump of one piece, or a fire-polish of another, or a repair fuse of another. With the increased number of pieces being fired every day I have a commensurate increase in pieces that need a bit of tweaking--and tweaking delays shipping in an already tight schedule.Okay, almost 9:00. Off to the studio!A final note:iTunes played a really weird random mix this morning. I started with Gogol Bordello and then it went into \"Decoration Day\" by the Drive By Truckers, then \"Night, Pt. 1: Snow\" by George Winston, and ended my blogging set with \"Shake Your Groove Thing\" by Peaches and Herb...

I can't believe I didn't hang at the Continental Club every Wednesday night at midnight to see him play when I lived in Austin. And I can't believe he isn't firmly entrenched on the top of the list of the hottest singer/songwriters in America. His voice, his writing, his music... magic. Now back to glass.After two nights of little sleep I was exhausted, but yesterday saw me on the road to Commerce at 7:00 am to meet Bill and get a load of metal work. Back in the studio I fired a full load with the penultimate yellow frit #02--have to hold on the rest of the pieces that need it till next week--including the sidelights I'm doing for GPQ. Unfortunately, though I have a little left, the rest of the pieces I have scheduled need more than I have. Ended the day with a bit more data modeling/database implementation (Filemaker Pro arrived Wednesday and I know just enough to be dangerous).

UPS managed to destroy another of my shipments to Hoypoloi--that makes two in a row, two in a week--which ate up a good part of my afternoon, and the rest was spent shipping, placing glass and packing supply orders, and taking orders.I could have fired yesterday in spite of the fullness of the afternoon, but I discovered that I only have about a pound of medium yellow frit left. Yikes! I just got a big glass order a week or so ago. I am blowing through glass at unprecedented speed. Got another order in to Bullseye--just in time to beat their across-the-board 10% price increase. While I was at it, I also placed the beginnings of an order for mid-October that includes 90 more sheets of clear irid. The frit is scheduled to ship today so I ought to have it by mid-week next week.Today I finish up my data modeling for the ERP system-just in time for Filemaker Pro to arrive this afternoon so I can begin the implementation. Yesterday I did the design for the order process. Today I need to put the finishing touches on it and then figure out the client data model. If I have time, I might begin layout for a materials management module--but that's definitely a phase II component. I want to have some system up and running asap that will keep to a minimum the number of pieces I go to ship and find I didn't fire, or for which I didn't order the metal--or orders that I forgot to schedule at all.The first horizontal lattice piece--a double-wide too--is done and shipping to California today.

I spent a considerable amount of time last week evaluating POS (point of sale) software and other pre-built business process management systems, and even the most expensive of them don't meet more than 50% of my needs.

In software, a detailed design is actually a Good Thing.Sound like an ambitious day? It certainly is. I don't think I'd have the nerve to even say I planned it if I hadn't already had two big cups of coffee and a chocolate croissant--sugar and caffeine make me daring. Maybe tomorrow I'll post about my experience with UPS claims yesterday early evening--or maybe I'll just let it go and not get all riled up again.

Today is more traditional; I'm in my jammies, the family is newly out the door for school and work, and I organize myself with a post.Yesterday I fired the \"gems\" for the studio sidelight project--over 350 of them made up of over 700 glass squares (that I also cut yesterday). It sounds like a lot, but it goes surprisingly fast with the Cutter's Mate and the Morton System. Today I get the fun part of designing the windows. You might think I would have drawn the design before creating glass elements for it, but that's not the way I work. I did calculate how much of the design I wanted to be \"gems\" and how much I wanted to be \"other\" (frit or maybe solid pieces), but for me the flow of the piece can only be done in real size and in color and texture. This project is for a how-to article in the next issue of Glass Patterns Quarterly and I'm combining several basic techniques for a whole new look--fingers crossed that it all turns out!______________Time has passed and I was not able to add the pics I was going to put on this post this morning as the gems were not fully formed and I had to refire them--the photo at right shows what they looked like before they were fired.

Well, I am fed up with the way I currently manage my business is a series of Excel spreadsheets and Word docs. I wanted to get a real database and the one that looks best for my needs is Bento by Filemaker Pro--only available for Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). I had 10.4 (Tiger) (at least the names are better than Windows--I'd rather have \"Tiger\" or \"Leopard\" than \"Windows\" or \"Vista\"). Does this all sound way complicated? It is.

I seem to be incapable lately of expediting tasks and keeping on top of everything.I am reminded, as I lag ever further behind in my ideal production schedule, of the article I finished recently for the upcoming issue of Profitable Glass in which I referenced a panel I participated in for the Arts Business Institute at the last Buyer's Market. One of the topics we discussed was the amount of time we actually spend in production. Most people starting out calculate their potential income based on full-time production and this week further proves to me that full-time work does not even close to equating to full-time production. I am lucky to spend 25% of my time producing work (and realistically, it's probably a lot less).But I am not going to let the inevitability of a full inbox when I die ruin my weekend!

I was careful yesterday to start Bettina's slump well ahead of Bertha's fuse so that they wouldn't be drawing full power at the same time (in case that was the problem). When I peeked in the studio in the late afternoon Bettina was off and Bertha was at 1450 (her full-fuse temp) so I think everything went well.Today, the Monday that is not Monday, I have ikebana and five orders to ship.

And yet I am in the studio early every the morning, work without slacking all day and still don't get home till very late--exhausted, sweaty and grumbly. This situation has got to end never to be repeated. A regular assistant is now a necessity, no longer a luxury.Yesterday--though I did not post here--I did spend much of the morning on Blogger. I helped my friend and ikebana instructor Elaine set up her blog on washi and ikebana._________________________I started the above post on Friday morning, but before I could finish, Bill arrived at Starbucks, we planned, we traded pieces, and I got back to the studio. I did not get the second big load in, again. Saturday followed the same path of in the studio early, but deviated in that I *finally* got two big kiln loads in simultaneously. Unfortunately, when I went over and looked at them this morning the fuse load was underdone and I had to refire it. The only thing I can come up with is that somehow Bertha wasn't able to get enough electricity so didn't reach full-fuse temp--or reached it but wasn't able to stay there long enough... or I used the wrong firing cycle and I can't even imagine how I did that. Whatever it was, she seems to be firing fine now.Tomorrow--Labor Day--sees me labor more with two full loads to do. Thank heaven Becky is back Tuesday! Shown at top right is Bettina's first fuse load on the new shelf."},
{"title": "Wet Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, August 27, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the studio Chicago skyline mug, \"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\" by Deathcab for Cutie on the iPod. Key words in that sentence were \"studio\" and \"iPod\" (which lives in the studio). I arrived in the studio at 7:55 this morning to find the truck with my glass delivery waiting for me. The driver had arrived about 7:30 but never called. No one called. Someone was supposed to call. I'm just lucky I decided to head to the studio to wait for it and post instead of posting from the kitchen table at home as I usually do. After a half hour of slipping and sliding in the mud that is the vacant lot next door (three days of rain and it's a swamp here)--and with the additional help of two guys from East Lake Auto across the street--1525 lbs of glass was muscled onto the lift gate, lowered to the driveway and pallet-jacked to over by the back door. Now I sit, covered in mosquito bites (I never saw fewer than eight at a time feasting on my legs), and post. It's only 8:40 and the biggest line item on my list for the day has been checked off.Yesterday was an... interesting day (in the Chinese sense). I arrived a the studio at 8:55 after having posted (and showered, washed my hair and brushed my teeth). I decided against cutting up anymore of the few extra-wide sheets of clear irid that remain in the inventory. Instead I figured I would get all my orders packed and sent and I'd do a little organizing. When I called to check on my delivery time I was told in the afternoon so I figured I'd be having a late firing day. Fate, it seems, had Other Plans. I worked solidly all day cleaning and packing pieces for shipping, fielding phone calls from almost everyone on the planet, and waiting. In the process I discovered a corollary to the adage that your stuff will always grow to fill the space allotted to it and that is work will always expand to fill the time allowed for it. I.e., I never get done early and yesterday was no exception.The glass finally arrived about 3:30 but not in a truck with a lift gate. It said clearly on the manifest \"Lift gate delivery\". What, did they think the driver was going to lift 1525 lbs of glass off the truck with his hands? What I don't understand is why he bothered to come out at all. He could see the two cases of glass shrink-wrapped together and stacked high with cardboard boxes shrink-wrapped to them. He could see that they weighed 1525 lbs. Why would he even make the drive? Just so he could say he attempted delivery and therefore the service times were met? They weren't--4-5 business days for a shipment picked up Monday means delivery by the following Monday and yesterday was Tuesday. Deep breath in, deep breath out, let go the frustration. It's all over, the glass is here safe and sound, and I can unpack and start cutting it this morning.Now a quick run to the post office and the bank and then I'm in the swing!"},

I ended up not firing yesterday as the only sheets of clear irid I have left are a few extra wide pieces that I like to save for 20\" round pieces. No glass to cut means no pieces to fire. This morning I'll pack to ship everything I got done over the weekend while I wait for the delivery. As soon as it gets here, I'll unload the cases (undoubtedly in the rain) so I can cut and fire two fuse loads--Bettina gets to go out for her first fuse spin today.I have another try for my Niche piece in Middle Ground, but even without looking at it I've decided I don't like the colors I chose and I want to do it again.

The tropical depression formerly known as Hurricane Fay spread a cool rainy grey blanket over the  weekend in Atlanta. This morning is still cool, still wet, still grey.Jessie discovered the industrious spider's work on her way out the door this morning and I have not regretted more not having a good manual SLR camera. Digital auto-everything is great for capturing our fast lives, but it is lousy for focusing on the minute details of the bejeweled beauty of the spider's work. Time to dig out the old Olympus and polish it up? Probably not. Just the time-slowing effects of this weather.The weekend was full of glass. I thought I would finally fire a fuse load on the new shelf in Bettina, but I was able to get everything into Bertha so Bettina was used only for slumping. One anticipated but lamented side effect of the new shelf in combination with Bettina's extra insulation--she's made for high-temp, long casting firings after all--is that cool down from a slump load in her takes even longer than cool down from a fuse load in Bertha. Timing is going to be tricky when I need to get a load a day out of each of them.One of the pieces I fired this weekend was the first iteration of my idea for a Niche piece. With a postmark deadline of August 30 (Saturday) I'll barely have time for another iteration, but the design needs tweaking. The Beatles are whispering the words of wisdom on iTunes right now and saying \"Let It Be\", but I think my answer is to futz with it."},

Ahh, the quiet of a house empty but for me and snoozy dogs. Time to make some progress! I have been occupied with other than firing for the past couple of weeks since I got back from the BMAC and today, today, I begin the big fall firing schedule that ends in November.Besides the regular production firing I have four special projects front-loading the schedule. Last weekend I finally settled on a technique to use for my Niche entry for the year--better late than never! Now I need to start testing pieces with it to see how it works. It's based on an idea I have been toying around with around since I started the book (first iteration from two years ago shown at right) and I think I have finally figured out how to add the last visual punch that will make it scale for larger work and translate into a good product line.The other special projects are a backsplash for our kitchen (commissioned by my spouse as payment for childcare while I was in Philadelphia for the BMAC), sidelights for the studio (the project I am doing with the large kiln shelf from Ditore Glass Works to write up for Glass Patterns Quarterly) and the hanukiah for the shop at the Jewish Museum of New York.

If there's a pertinent meaning to this one, I don't see it.Some might say what Dan is doing over there at the studio right now is gilding the lily, but that bit or porch overhang that he is adding on will keep the rain off me and my laptop in the morning when I am unlocking the backdoor, and it will also keep the J dry when she runs over in the rain and struggles to open the door. As a last step he's going to put a little shelf on the right next to the door so I can set stuff down to get the keys out and into the lock. Some might wonder why I am having this trivial construction done, and I probably wouldn't have, but Dan was already up there putting new fascia board on the sides of the studio so I can get rain gutters mounted (got to have rain gutters in order to use the rain barrels doncha know).Yesterday there was no post. I thought I would be able to do one when I finished my article for Profitable Glass. But I didn't finish until 11:00 last night. This article took a lot more time and effort to get right than the previous ones did. Today I am finishing the last editing (now that I am finally working--it was J's first day of school, first day of first grade... we started the day at the opening assembly) and (at last!) firing a couple of kiln loads. I am looking forward to getting a lot more done now that I don't have to break to make breakfast, make lunch, answer questions, tie knots, and other mommy activities throughout the day. Yes, part of me regrets the end of summer and its potential for lazy, sunny days. But a greater part sighs in relief at the focus fall brings.Off to focus!"},

But the day had other plans for me, and I finish it without having fired a single piece or made any headway on the article I have due tomorrow for Profitable Glass. Yes, there is shelving in the office closet and the rain gutter/rain barrel system has been exhaustively designed--and the former studio is much closer to done than it was--but otherwise the day has been almost a complete production loss.The bright side to my cloudy day is that I am still on schedule with my orders because I can power up Bettina and crank through them starting tomorrow.

Tomorrow I fire--and I'm going to pull out the big guns and fire both Bertha and Bettina with full fusing loads.  J has a friend from down the street over right now and they are playing in the pool so I'm working outside and watching them. I still haven't finished entering the orders from the BMAC into the computer, or updating the firing schedule and those tasks (and this post) will take me through till Dave gets home at 5:30.In the meantime I got my book projects back from my publisher thanks to Becky the Wonder Assistant who went up to Asheville on Friday. While she was there she took a little gallery tour and checked out a couple of galleries I'm in. One, the Grovewood, has only one piece of my work in, but I have a big order to ship them this week or next. And they also use one of my pieces in the header on their website (shown above). The other, Blue Goldsmiths, has quite a few pieces--including the lattice shown at right which is already sold.Today's big accomplishment was getting a shelving unit from the Container Store for the closet in the studio office. Becky has been grumbling about the piles of crap all over the floor, but I haven't had anywhere to put it all so it's just stayed on the floor.

There was no post! I hit the ground so fast in the morning that I never got a chance to sit down and post (that'll happen on days when I have nine people spread between the house and the studio to supervise). Suffice it to say, it was a big day, and I'm glad it's over (and I got caught up on the week).I have reconciled myself to needing another day of transition before I get back into full production in the studio on Monday. Actually, it's three days, but I am really trying to take weekends off this fall. Heck, if the workers of the fine state of Utah get to go all French on us and go to a four-day work week, I should get weekends off. Sure, some of them are working 10-hour days, but who isn't?And it's a good thing I am waiting an extra day before I begin full production (which requires cutting lots of sheets of glass) as my Bullseye order won't be in till the end of the week next week, and I am completely out of normal width clear sheets (just shy of 20\" wide). All I have left are a few 21\" wide sheets that were mixed in with my last two orders, and I like to save those for when I need to cut a 20\" round.Today the former studio will be carpeted and the water lines that used to run to the three-bin restaurant sink in it will be re-routed to a laundry tub in the garage. There is already a workbench complete with an 8' X 4' pegboard over it in the spot in the garage where Bertha used to sit. It will be like there was never a studio there at all!Now off to contemplate the last week of summer. School starts next week, so even if the weather says differently, fall is here."},

When I look forward to August, in my mind I see a Ward and June Cleaver kind of time where we all relax and enjoy the end of summer and prepare for the start of school. I see me wearing pearls and gingham and sipping a gin and tonic as I watch Jessie and the spaniel romp on the lawn. I can't quite wrap my mind around the image of Dave lounging in crisp slacks, white socks and wingtips and puffing contentedly on a pipe, but almost. Instead I'm off balance, off center, wobbly, anxious and grumbly. I can't find my happy place--or get anything done. There are too many one-off tasks looming.I think it all has to do with change and routine. I do very well in a crisis--when the world ends, I'm the gal who will get you through it without falling apart. I also do well when life is all settled into a placid routine with no projects threatening, no travel, nothing unpredictable on the horizon. However I completely fall apart in the transition times--coming home from vacation and trying to get the home and hearth into the settled routine state, coming back from a show and shifting gear from presentation and sales to production and shipping. This post-BMAC is worse than usual--I think because we were only home from the vacation in Montana for a week before I took off again to do the show. July was essentially completely atypical time, off-schedule and out of routine.I loved the vacation--couldn't have enjoyed it more, but I looked forward to getting home to routine (and my own bed) again. Then I had a good show and got my display and materials all stored in Philly for the February show--and I was ready to be back in the studio and in the daily routine again. But I'm home--been here a week--and I can't get my mind inserted into a routine! Okay, it's only been a week. It feels like a month, but it's only been a week.

However the dog days (according to Wikipedia) also refers to a time period that is hot or stagnant or marked by a dull lack of progress. Bingo. The dogs have come to roost in the studio and the house.

The to-do list and the day tomorrow are organized (and Jessie is set to go to the zoo with Becky and her nephews away) so I can have a Kavarna day and maybe get caught up on paperwork. And, finally, the glass order is in to Bullseye and reviewed, I hope they'll be ready to ship soon.

It's August 11th today, Monday, and I feel the weight of the month pressing down on me. The deadlines begin to pile up starting Friday and reach a crescendo of effort the day after Labor Day (early this year--September 1). Some of it's production--the least scary and most comfortingly predictable of the things I do--but a lot of it's writing, designing, webbing and other hard-to-time-quantify activities. Activities that could go easily and quietly into the \"done\" pile or that could turn into a day (week?) down the rabbit hole at a mad tea party. I don't have a week to spare.And while I am dwelling on upcoming scary things this fine morning, I am going to be help-less again come September: Becky the Wonder Assistant is heading back to corporate America for a Real Job. After almost a year with steady help, I can't go back to a one-person shop--I need to hire someone new. And this time it won't be a friend helping me out on a part-time temporary basis--it'll be a Real Employee. I am hoping for a mother with little kids in school who just needs something with flexible hours and a little extra family income (not the rent).But let's end the post on a positive note.

We're going with Freshaire paint--an eco-friendly paint with no VOC's--in \"Evening Peruvian Lily\" in the Botanicals collection. The paint is more red than it looks on the web--it's a warm terracotta color.So the first paragraph of the glass blog is about paint for a no-longer studio.

I also had a *great* time participating in the Arts Business Institute's panel discussion on the impacts of wholesaling for the visiting artist program. I hope I can work more with them.To quantify sales for the show's bottom line, I picked up 10 new galleries and took orders from five existing clients. I had a few more personal shoppers than usual, but overall it was a great show. I am really looking forward to working with the new galleries, and I'm glad my existing customers were also able to place substantial orders. Best of all, two of my existing clients requested new pieces so I have fun design work ahead.Also on the fun list, I got a call from Marlene at Ditore Glass Works yesterday and my new kiln shelf has shipped! I can't wait to get it in Bettina and try it out. The week while I was at the BMAC was pretty rough for Dave and J and Dave says his cut for it is getting the new backsplash for the kitchen bumped to the top of the firing queue. The timing ties in nicely for the article I am doing for GPQ on using the Ditore shelves for firing large pieces. The only downside I can see to the shelf is that I won't be able to get it in and out of the kiln by myself--it will probably need to be a permanent fixture (it is 30\" X 71\" and weighs 144 lbs).Today I have to type up and email out all the orders from the BMAC, desnarl invoices with a couple of galleries, write up an order for metal for Bill, and figure out and submit a glass order for Bullseye.

We had a severe thunderstorm in Atlanta on Tuesday night. We had 2200 lightning strikes in a half hour in a very small area. It was exhilarating, and I didn't know enough to be afraid. It's not like I went and stood outside in it or anything, but I did sit right by the window on the second floor working on my laptop. I was lucky. The alarm system in the house and the studio and the new 3-in-1 fax machine were not so lucky. I spent over two hours on the phone with alarm company and ended up replacing the panel in the studio (for over $300) because the dialer was fried, and then rewiring all three keypads in the house system. Then the phones worked again--but the DSL did not so I had to completely reboot the modem and router (and I recabled the whole system). It was exhausting, hot stressful and took forever so I did neither glass nor web work the entire day.Then I left for Philly and had the first day of set-up. I thought I'd have either the time or the energy to post, I was wrong. It was 91 degrees and humid the first day of set-up and it was all we could do just to get through it and collapse at the end. the second day of set-up (yesterday) was a bit cooler outside, but still stifling in the convention center hall. I managed to do price tags for the show after a room service dinner (with white wine) and during Con Air on TNT. They're showing True Lies tonight and I have to say it's more appealing than going to the Museum of Natural History for the Buyer's Market party. On the other hand, it would be a good business move to go to the party and mingle with fellow artists and buyers. I just don't think after the week I had that I have the margin to spend on my business.And speaking of business, this afternoon I am on a panel of speakers for the Arts Business Institute Visiting Artist Program discussing The Impacts of Wholesaling. I am really looking forward to it. Becky the assistant is participating in the visiting artist program except during the panel (someone has to mind the booth) and I am looking forward to picking her brain on everything she heard after the show.It's the middle of the first day.

Got to get back in peak condition by Thursday for the BMAC.The firings continue apace as do writing commitments. I have my first regular column (on product viability) coming out in the Fall issue of Profitable Glass (going to press today), and I have the second column (on pricing) slated but not written for the Winter Profitable Glass. I also have a how-to article for either sidelights or a backsplash for a kitchen stove using special large, baffled ceramic shelves that are perfectly flat and smooth and don't warp for Glass Patterns Quarterly's Winter issue. Never a dull moment here. Hot and muggy moments, yes. Dull, no.Another short post today I'm afraid. Too tired and sore to scintillate. Vacation and birthday review coming up on Stranded in the South over the weekend (Saturday's Movie Day!)."},

I like the result.So far today I took the cat back to the vet for a glucose curve (she was diagnosed as diabetic but in otherwise good health by the vet yesterday--not bad for a 17 year-old cat), dropped the dogs a the groomer, left the child with Dan the carpenter to be handed off to Becky the wonder assistant at 9:00 am, and now I sit in my doctor's waiting room... waiting. By 10:30 this morning I will be in the studio and Doing Glass!Yesterday's firing went well, and I checked in with both Jeff (for the new pieces I did for him for the BMAC) and Bill (for our BMAC shipping and display status check). Today I have another big firing, the last follow-ups on outstanding invoices, and Web Work. I am hopeful--confident even--that I'll have at least a rudimentary wholesale ordering system for my galleries ready by the BMAC. Now if I could just get a cd of hi-res images of all the work together...The vacation is over, but I am well-rested and glad to be home. Leaving Montana it's always touch and go for me as to whether I'll be able to settle back in home right away. I pine. but this time I came home to a beautiful blooming garden with lots of new growth on all the plants I put in before I left. Just walking through the studio garden and checking out the plants lifts my spirits--and what a great place to put the glass \"mistakes\"!"},

I leave Thursday accompanied by Becky the Wonder Assistant. It will be good to have four of us to set up the booth.Today: fire, finish a full page ad for the fall issue of Profitable Glass, take the cat to the vet, clean the pond filter, clean the pool, supervise the carpenter and electrician who are finishing out the basement, and breathe. J has the rest of the week off to get back on Eastern Time (she is still sleeping now and it's almost 10:00). Time to go throw cold water on her. Heh.Hey! I just had a big black ant chewing on my toe! I didn't know they bit people. I was just sitting here blogging and minding my own business when I felt something poking at my toe. I thought I just ran my toe into a sticker or something but when I looked down there was a big black ant viciously and methodically attacking my toe! He didn't live long.Okay, off to get the kiln load in and do some attacking (of the day) of my own. It's good to be home."},

I sit on the small balcony off of our room and endeavor not to panic at the upcoming day. Today is my father's 80th birthday and I have planned a surprise dinner party for him at Finn & Porter. I had nightmares about it all night last night. I dreamed that there were three floors of party, Russian waiters, and hundreds of people pouring in--too many to count and I didn't know any of them. Add to that that I kept getting driven away from the party with tons still to do and dropped off far away with no way to get back except to walk--even though I knew it was a dream and I should be able to just place myself back at the party, I couldn't. And in the dream I had forgotten to get a cake... and I woke in a sweat to the realization that I forgot to order a cake. Thank heaven for Bernice's Bakery. In Atlanta we have Southern Sweets and rely on them heavily for all celebratory baked goods. I am happy to find my hometown has not let me down and I'll be able to get a couple of cakes at Bernice's to feed the 26 people coming to dinner...After this morning's trip top Bernice's we are heading to the restaurant--I haven't been there since it was taken over by Finn & Porter and redecorated--to pick out the wines and appetizers and look over the room for decorating. Once I have seen the room we'll go get flowers, balloons, etc. to decorate it with. I think I'll also get paper and markers and set Jessie to make a birthday sign that we can have everyone write their names and a message on for him to take home.Why am I stressing so much about this party? I have no idea. Probably some deep Freudian thing about daughters seeking validation through their father's approbation. Whatever. None of this has anything to do with glass--and probably won't today even though I have great Internet connectivity again.Tomorrow I'll finish the new firing schedule (two asap orders came in over the past week that I need to get out before Philly) and I still have about half of my work for the Philly show to get done in the few days following my return from Montana.

I did the cursory I-wonder-if-they-have-my-book-check, and they did! I, as nonchalantly as possible--which is to say not at all, carried it up to the customer service counter and asked if I could sign it. The clerk was suitably excited to have an author in the store and was delighted for me to sign it, and just as I was starting, I saw a step-cousin-in-law I hadn't seen for several years. She took this picture of me signing my book. I signed in the wild! And what better place to see a copy of my book in a bookstore for the first time than in my hometown and the place where the glass all began for me.Now off to pack and head to the lake cabin to stay for the next week.

I will get a bunch more up there today, and then I'll tackle the behind-the-scenes, for-galleries-only catalog ordering system.Of course since this IS my vacation I also spent some time in the lake, and I decided to reward myself for website virtue by posting the video of lake frolicking here. Ah that every day could end with a float on Flathead Lake (funny how the best site for Flathead on the web is not a .com, .net or .org, it's a .name domain). In the first part, I am floating alone, tethered to the dock by a long rope tied to my foot.

I got seasick filming it so I can't imagine watching it. Video tomorrow.Real work was also done today. I  ordered the last pieces of the display for the BMAC, brought up my accounts receivable up to date, and contacted everyone who is past due. It was scary to realize that I have five figures out in receivables and half of them are past due (over Net 30).Now I'm going to break and go out to the lake with the family for more lounging in the sun and floating chair.

The doors are open to let in the cool Montana morning breeze, and the loudest noise I hear is the refrigerator occasionally kicking on and humming. The absolute quiet here is startling. There's no doubt I have become acclimatized to living three doors down from one of the busier streets in Atlanta--and having my studio nestled close to the same street. It's a street where cars and trucks provide a ceaseless bass note on which all the other city sounds build. Heck, even our birds are noisier--even with the windows closed and a well-insulated house, the finches, cardinals, sparrows and all the other neighborhood birds raise such a racket starting as soon as it gets light that it's impossible to sleep through! I think the sheer absence of background noise woke me here this morning (that and the fact that it's two time zones later than Atlanta.)The video is my panorama from my parents back deck this morning. Thank you to George Winston for the song \"Returning\" from Forest.Away from the studio, yes, away from work, no. The Buyer's Market looms inexorably, and the website cries loudly to be updated. Today I check in remotely with Bill, Becky, and Stacy about the status of the studio and BMAC prep for the week (and worry at their heels like an amped up terrier). I also contact Patty and Dinah Hulet with a proposition that I have had no time to get to them for over a week now.

It's Saturday movie day, and today's movie is from the fireworks last night. No, it has nothing to do with glass but everything to do with the mental health of the glass artist. The video isn't about great fireworks--they were okay, by no means great, it's about people cheering for them and celebrating being alive, being together with friends, having a day off, and enthusiastic optimism about life in spite of the economy, the upcoming election and the continuing war in the Middle East. For me it was one of those rare, perfect moments of building a community--one of the first ones I've had here in Atlanta.Ok. I've reflected, I've basked, now it's time to get to work. I leave for Montana tomorrow and I have an order to prep for shipment Monday, lights and foam core to buy and carpet to order  for the BMAC, and all my work to inventory for the show to see just how much I have to make when I get back from Big Sky Country.It's not like I won't be working while I'm there (at least for the first week). My parents have dsl and I plan to buy a wireless router at Best Buy when I arrive so I can work on my website from anywhere in the house--even out on the deck looking over the lake. I am very excited about this busman's holiday--no contractors to supervise, no kilns to load or orders to ship, just web and catalog and printed materials for the BMAC to create. J will hang with the grandparents--they can entertain her. Dave will be out for the second week and I'll have vacation and relax (and read) then. I do plan to post--at least for the first week--and there'll be plenty of video both here and on Stranded in the South... really, Stacy."},

Whew!Today is a work day in the studio too--at least the morning is. The afternoon will be at a 4th of July picnic with the other rising first graders (that's what they call the kids who are going into first grade in the fall. Who knew?) at one of the families' house.

The spouse just started a blog (Professor Schadenfreude's Cavalcade of Wonders and Software Development Blog) and within two days he was geting 138 hits a day because he's on a java blog aggregator. But there don't seem to be any blog aggregators (sites whose purpose is to list all the sources of information for a specific group--like java developers or artists--in one place to make it easier for interested people to find them) specifically for artists or craftspeople.

It sometimes happens, and there's nothing to be done except to be flexible, and to recover as best I can. I did get two shipments out today, and I will have the pieces Jeff Manpearl commissioned for his new work for the Buyer's Market show done and read to ship on Monday.

Sadly, we won't be able to be there for the actual birthday--we have to come back on Sunday the 20th. But we'll be there just before the birthday, and, heck, when you've made it to 80 what's a day or two either way?The photo is from the studio news of the day Tuesday. I mentioned that I was afraid the cheeping in the chimney would end badly, and it almost did. Tuesday afternoon J had a playdate with an old friend and I brought her mother over to show her the studio. We walked into the gallery room to find baby birds all over the floor in various stages of fledging, and the sound of a lone peep emanating room the chimney. I rounded up the stragglers on the floor and got up into the chimney where I found the last of the hatchlings clinging to a brick and peeping for dear life. A few phone calls later and I was on my way to a local vet that acts as the go-between for the wild bird rehabilitators in the area. Turns out I had five baby chimney swifts, and I left them in the vet's capable hands, a meal already being mixed up for them. The chimney swift woman was to pick them up by 7:00 and they would become someone else's problem!I have enough problems of my own--chief among them a dearth of firing time. On the other hand, the former studio basement is on its way to becoming a finished part of the Griffith manse--and the future home of the great loom that now lives in our dining room.Tomorrow is another day in the studio during which I will celebrate my independence from the basement and the cube--two fates worse than death.

It ended badly then and I have a horror of a repeat.New series going out in the world today: Tropical. It has a lot of the same colors as Cosmic (which was formerly Cosmos), but it avoids the darker tones, incorporates a new blending technique, and I think really zings. Passionate is still my favorite new series for the year though.The pieces pictured are (in order) Tropical Koi (wall), Cosmic Framed Poppies (wall), Tropical Koi Float (stand), Tropical Float (stand), and Passionate Poppies (stand). The glass in all but the Passionate poppies is 24\" X 16\", the Passionate Poppies glass is 12\" X 18\".Notice the difference in the metal work between the koi wall and stand pieces. I wish I could get these pieces to photograph as well as they look in person. The colors are so stunning and vibrant, and there is incredible depth in the glass... but it just doesn't come across in photos. I'd be tempted to blame my poor photographic skills, but the professional photographers who have tried to capture these pieces have not fared much better than I did.A final note on the pictures: Personally I prefer the Poppies in Passionate--I think there's too much competition between the dark glass and the dark metal in the Cosmic Poppies.In other studio news, I ran across two articles/blog posts on Siyeh Studio and the book this week. The first is on Sustainable Living, sustainable living articles, blogs and links site on the Zimbio zine network. It was written by the Best American Arts people about The Greening of Siyeh Studio. The second is a blog post/review of A Beginner's Guide to Kiln-Formed Glass on the Hawley Studios blog.Writing this blog post today and continuing the catalog of references to Siyeh Studio and the book on the net is part of the preparation for updating the main Siyeh Studio website while I'm in Montana for the next two weeks.

Then there's a kiln load to cut and get into Big Bertha... and it's already 1:30 pm. Oy. Becky the Wonder Assistant has a cold so she was dragging today too. Only Jessie--who is in the studio all week as she has no camp scheduled--is perky. Nothing like a perky six year-old to make you feel really old and draggy.The vitrigraph experiment was interesting. When I opened the kiln yesterday to take out the empty flower pot I instead found a half-full flower pot. Because of the lower temperature for the flow, we would have had to pull another couple of hours to use all the glass in the pot. Good to know. Next time I'm going to put it in early in the morning and plan on pulling around noon--rather than starting the whole process at 2:00 pm.

Everyone got a chance to pull and twist molten glass stringer--even Jessie (though she had to stand on the step stool and was closely monitored by three nervous women). We kept the temp pretty low (I think it never got above 1650 degrees) so we got twisty rod more than stringer--which is what the group wanted. The lower temp made for a more controlled, wider flow. The width showed off all the colors in the pot nicely. There is a good article by Phyllis L'Hommedieu in The Flow magazine winter 2007 issue about pulling glass rod from a vitrigraph that was the basis for our play.I wanted to put up the video showing the prep leading up to pulling the rod/stringer, but the 128 mg size is making everything choke.

The Sons of William opened for them, and they were really great--I'm going to be getting their first album.Started the morning in the studio by finding one more thing that was stolen in the burglary--the craftsman stained glass lamp from the office. It was just an inexpensive Home Depot lamp, but it was a special wow-I-have-a-real-studio-not-a-space-in-a-basement purchase and I was really bummed to reach to turn it on only to find it gone.

The studio is *really* starting to come together outside. And with Becky riding herd on me, it's also coming together inside. Pretty soon I'm going to turn her loose on my desk and watch my papers magically file themselves (they will cower and run in fear from Becky).My glass order--150 lbs of frit--from Bullseye should be here tomorrow and none to soon as I will run out of yellow medium today with more cosmos, passionate, fresh and flame pieces to do (all series that require yellow). Still haven't finished the firing schedule, but I am keeping at least a day or two out on it so full loads are firing daily. Today is the last day of single kiln firing.

I need to call Licha to see when she can come and play.This afternoon Jessie finishes week two of Circus Camp and Dave and I are going to the show at 2:00 (more video opportunities for me!). Before we go I'll finish my piece list and firing schedule for the BMAC and get the metal order for it to Bill. When we get back, I'll ship a couple of orders and fire a full kiln load--it'll be a long day, but what a successful week!Back to work. Pictures next week of the new front of the studio."},

Been in the saddle thirty days, oh, Montana bound. This ain't no time to be polite, I may be spoilin' for a fight. I'll be raisin' hell and drinkin' whiskey down. So come on in without\" knockin', stay till the last dollar's down.\"). My father's 80th birthday is 30 days from today and I have FINALLY hammered down the details for his surprise party in Montana. Today I put together the invitation and send it out to everyone.What does this have to do with a day in the glass studio? The glass artist is a whole person--as is everyone else. It's naive to think we can compartmentalize our lives into set time and function slots and make it all work (the home slot, the work slot, the spouse/partner/parent slots). I am simultaneously a glass artist writing the web portion of an article for the upcoming issue of Profitable Glass magazine, a child planning the party of a parent, and a friend recovering from a night of spontaneous waitressing  and bartending for a friend in her restaurant--that's a story for Stranded in the South--and those are all different slots. What about all the roles/tasks we have to juggle at the same time in each slot? I have a carpenter and an assistant to organize and supervise today in the studio (the employer role of the glass artist slot), I have pieces to create and fire, the aforementioned article to write, the firing schedule to update.... the list just goes on for the glass artist slot (and all the other slots). Throw the knife, catch the knife, throw the knife, catch the knife.So where am I going with all this? Is it bothering me? Am I complaining that this is what life has turned out to be? Not a bit of it! I am consumed with joy at the full richness that is my life at 47. I was a better waitress last night than I was 20 years ago when it was my regular job, and the reason I was better is that I more mentally flexible and adaptable than I was 20 years ago. I am more confident of myself, my abilities, and my skills. I never once got flustered last night, and I truly jumped into the middle of the deep end with no paddle. The water was just fine.I believe I was able to work as I did last night because I keep my life and my time fluid. I don't have a work slot that goes everyday from 9:00 to 5:00 followed by a home slot. I work as much and wherever as it takes to get each job done, and the importance of each job in each slot is constantly evaluated and re-prioritized as necessary so that the musts do get done when they need to, some nice to haves get accomplished, and many things are left for later. there is never--and will never be--enough time to get to everything in the in-box and happiness comes from realizing and accepting that one, hard fact of life. The slots and their jobs rise and fall in the hierarchy of importance, and their flow ensures the balance of my life and my ability to surmount new challenges with grace and verve.Enough writing about working, it's time to actually work."},

No parentheses for the last one--it gets its own paragraph.I did a little calling around after I found all my credit card info on the Arabic language credit card fraud site. I called my clients and the other artists I know who were on the list. I also called a couple of random people just to make sure they knew what was out there. Though most of them knew there had been fraudulent activity on their cards (most, not all--one had not), no one knew from where or how. Guess EZ Pedestal not only didn't notify me, but they didn't notify anyone else either. And since they were aware of the existence of the website back in April--and that all of our personal info and card numbers was posted on it--I'm really, really surprised they never told any of us.

It's random, but if I'd picked, it's the one I would've picked. Last night I Googled Siyeh Studio--as I periodically do just to see what's out there on the great, big interweb thingie--and I was shocked to find my name, address, phone number, email address, and Visa credit card number and expiration date on the web! There is an Arabic language youth site called Dos1.com that has a message forum which Google translates as \"Forum Credit Card world of credit cards\". Someone hacked the EZ Pedestal site back in April and posted dozens of credit card numbers with the corresponding personal information on the forum.Was I surprised to find my info there? Absolutely! Should I have been? Probably not. This is the world in which we live, and I had someone tell me today (in connection with this credit card issue) that Americans are perceived to be naive because we are not taught from infancy how to work the system, to cheat, to lie and to steal well. Two of my clients and two other artists I know were also on the list. Small, sad, world. An interesting note: I was also able to get right to the page where my info was listed by doing a web search on my credit card number.... A useful Google tip if you think your credit info is out in the world and you want to find where.Other searches turned up more positive results. Profitable Glass Magazine has their on-line profile of Siyeh Studio up. I found myself credited (in a former life) on the acknowledgments page of the book \"The Life of Arseniev: Youth\" by Ivan Bunin, Andrew Baruch Wachtel--I went to get the book on Amazon, but the price for vanity was a bit too dear.I also found a cool blog called Made in the USA which features reviews and giveaways of American-made goods, and they featured one of my platters donated by Best American Arts! The comments about my work were especially gratifying (and that could have been ugly). The give-away itself was linked on another site.I guess the post should have just been the Good and the Bad--though the Bad was pretty Ugly too."},

I took the vent off and, sure enough, when the floor settled earlier this year, the duct had slipped out and fallen to the crawl space floor below. No wonder the house was not cooling well--I was blowing a lot of the cold air into the open crawl space below the house. I pulled the duct back up and fixed it in place, and I'm cooling right down now. When it's 95 degrees out I just have to cool the studio down with more than fans. I am being as energy conscious as I can, but the heat is just killing me.____________Now Becky (the new assistant--and NOT Becky Wang) is hard at work breaking down cardboard boxes and unpacking shipments.

But no, it's supposed to get to 92 degrees today and that's just too hot to do anything outdoors (or in the studio).

Gotcha Day is actually May 21 and we are just getting around to celebrating tonight... we've been busy. So tonight we have presents and cake and go to see Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull--maybe at the drive-in, maybe in an indoor theater (after all, it's HOT out there).The most exciting news from yesterday is that my friend Jeff made me a new Goddess to replace the one that was stolen! He left the glass out of this one so I'll be forced (twist my arm) to put my own glass in it. I am so psyched and it is so beautiful. Thank you Jeff (hug, hug!).

Yesterday, as Stacy pointed out in her comment, was NOT easy. Six orders went out, two were rescheduled (with components refired) to go out today, two of the six were sent out as partials--one has a piece going out today and the other has two pieces going out tomorrow (I had a large piece thermal shock during slump for the first time in, well, a VERY long time!). Three kilns fired yesterday, two full and one half full, even though the day started with no firings scheduled at all--all to correct mistakes. Even minus the mistakes, twelve boxes weighing 357 lbs were shipped yesterday. Whew! The only time one day's shipping came even close to this was the corporate gift order for 114 pieces, and that one was a LOT easier to pack (Stacy would ask how I know as she packed that whole order). I do know that it was a lot easier to ship as the client sent me pre-printed labels and scheduled the pick-up themselves.Today I work on the website--I hope to have ALL the galleries listed and mapped by then end of the day--and do mop-up shipping and firing from yesterday. Tomorrow will also have a Kavarna morning and more web work.So yesterday I mentioned the greening of Siyeh Studio. I am very excited about where I am now in the process and that it matters to someone other than me--there is a growing number of galleries and other vendors who support green art. So how am I green? Think Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.Reduce. I have a zero-waste process for my production work. For the Morceaux de Verre pieces there is no unused scrap, and the small amount of mixed frit left from each piece is reserved for another new series called Frittered. In addition to reducing my materials use, I limit my energy consumption as much as possible. I fire at night in the summer and cool with fans instead of air conditioning. I hope to have my schedule worked out enough to fire in the morning in the winter and use fans to move the heat from the kilns through the studio for secondary heating. My lighting is all fluorescent--even the front porch light bulbs are long-life fluorescent spirals. The attic has been finished off so I can have insulation blown in--further reducing the energy needed to heat and cool.Reuse. The most exciting development in the studio is efficient water management. I took a class in making rain barrels last Saturday and came away with five--three for the studio and two for the house. Two of the studio ones are designated for grey water from the studio sink and lap grinder and the third is for the gutters (which I have to buy and get installed in the next couple of weeks). All the water is for the new landscaping I am putting in the front and back yards. I already use very little water in the studio, and being able to reuse everything but what goes down the toilet is going to be GREAT.I go through a lot of sheet glass and many, many 5-lb jars of frit a week. The sheet glass comes packed between sheets of thick fibrous paper that are good for weed control in the garden, art materials for papier mache, drawing and painting for J and her school. The frit jars are #1 plastic and recyclable, but I am never short of people who want them for storing screws, nails, small toys, pasta, crafts--the list goes on. Whenever I have a sack full of empties I either give them to my carpenter Dan (who parcels them out to his friends and neighborhood handymen) or I take them to J's school and leave them in the conference room for the teachers and other parents.Recycle. I have applied for my own studio recycling bin for all mixed paper, old magazines and diet coke cans. Cardboard boxes and fluorescent light bulbs require runs to two different drop-off locations. I got the addresses this morning and I think it'll be worth it to make a run every couple of months.Now if I could just get Dave behind the idea of a studio goat to keep down the weeds in the back and chickens for fertilizer for the garden..."},

It is summer in Atlanta. The weekend saw the last big three-kiln firing for awhile on Saturday, and lots of gardening including two classes, one on making rain barrels (I now have five--three for the studio and two for the house) and the other on making a succulent hanging basket. The small pond was relocated to the front yard (from the front porch) and stocked with plants for the fish to live in and eat. The back deck was cleaned and now hosts all the house plants and orchids for the summer. I even cut down all the six-foot high poke weed, trimmed the trees up, and hired Bruce from down the street to weed the beds.So why is my Monday morning post full of gardening? Because it is a time of transition in the glass studio. Today sees the last big group of orders from the BMAC and ACRE go out. Though there are still orders to do from both shows, there are no more days when more than two orders go out, and the orders themselves are small. They are also staggered through November and my next show isn't until August with the summer Buyer's Market.Today I have Stacy to help pack and ship, and tomorrow and Wednesday are both going to be web development days. For the rest of the summer I will spend at least one day a week on web development and marketing and one day on business process. A third day is dedicated to studio optimization and going green (more on that tomorrow). The remaining days are enough for production. Normally I would be looking to the summer for product development too, but the new glass and metal pieces and glass colorways already created this year are enough. Better use of the time will be getting a catalog created on the website and setting up on-line wholesale ordering for galleries.And now off to clean and sign and pack and ship. Huzzah!"},

This week sees the last of the big production going out for the summer. There are six more orders scheduled for June, one for July and two for August. Stacy is easing out of her assistantship as her own business heats up, another friend is looking to pick up some fill in over the summer till her new job starts, and then come fall I hope to be ready to hire an official assistant. Stacy had the great idea of looking for a student at the Savannah College of Art and Design (Decatur campus), Emory or Agnes Scott College--all relatively close to the studio. I am also thinking a Mom with a child/children in school during the day who can do 10-2. Fall--when school starts--is the best time to find either a student or a Mom.So summer... looms. Time to get a Niche entry done? Time to get the studio finished? Time, maybe, to garden and hang with my child?... I can always dream. Unless, of course, I get another big corporate gift order, or the new casino client places a big order due in August, or the economy suddenly turns around, gas prices drop, people rush to buy art from galleries and galleries rush to reorder from me... I think a lazy summer gardening with my child and waiting for business to pick up in the fall is the most likely (and frankly the most appealing appealing--the new studio is a warm place to be)."},

We arrived--after turning around and going back home once for my cell phone and a utility knife--at 6:10 to find the drive blocked by a sheriff and no one allowed to unload behind their booths. Didn't I call the Decatur Arts Alliance Thursday morning to ask if I would be able to unload behind my booth as my dolly/handtruck had been stolen in the burglary? Wasn't I assured that I would be able to? Yes and yes. The volunteers weren't scheduled to show up to help people until 6:30 (i.e., amble in, get registered, start filtering through to help set-up about 6:45)--another major error--even though set-up officially began at 6:00 am. I know there are always last minute snafus that make running a festival... challenging, but have your people there 15 minutes before the artists arrive to have a fall back for them (both the problems and the artists).I almost turned around and came home--was within 25 seconds of it--but then my booth next door neighbor lent me his dolly and the sheriff found us a close-in unloading spot. Volunteers showed up in another 15 minutes and the unloading process lurched into gear. The next big snafu was all mine--I couldn't remember how to get my tent together. I had Dave and my friend Becky there to help and it took all three of us about 20 minutes to figure out the top pole arrangement (the top bars are crucial as the awning, french wall and backdoor all depend on the right hardware in the right place on the top bars *before* the legs go on. Oy. But we overcame that obstacle too, got up the simplified display (tables and tablecloths), and I had everything up--if not priced--before the festival opened.I went off to get a bank (fast cash from checking in 20's, buy a diet coke with one of the 20's and voila! Instant change!) and when I got back Becky had been joined by Stacy (I have had a lot of help this time). We finished pricing and schmoozing, and Becky left to wander. Stacy and I then regarded my booth with some misgiving (I only brought two sizes of work priced under $55 and had nothing from $55 to $120--the majority of the work was $380-$420) and I resigned myself to gathering a good mailing list and not selling anything. I sent Stacy home after a couple of hours as it was apparent I was right about sales and wouldn't need really need help selling and wrapping.However the day was a surprise. I didn't need help, but I had some good sales and some really good sales, and I am getting a great mailing list. It was relaxing and fun--though I am still not all fired up about more outdoor festivals. Dave has insisted I take pictures of all the tent joints and Becky suggested colored tape for all the pieces showing where they go. Whatever. If someone brings me red, yellow, blue and green tape or paint today, I'll do it. Otherwise I might just write on everything with a Sharpie. (What, you didn't think I'd just do nothing, did you?).Now off for today. J is going to keep me company this morning and early afternoon. Her big news is that I pulled her first natural tooth yesterday at the festival (the first tooth was lost unnaturally a year and a half ago at school and still has not been replaced). I would have pictures of her smile and my booth today, but I left my camera in my sales cabinet at the show. I hope it's still there this morning. *sigh*"},

That takes some huevos, naming a new song with the same title as a very famous older song. Speaking of huevos, I'm doing the Decatur Arts Festival this weekend and setting up in three hours tomorrow morning with Dave and maybe Jessie to help. I might rather be in Tahachapi or Tonapah (speaking of \"Willin' \").In a rare burst of common sense, I'm not firing anything for the show today. What comes out of the kilns (three) from yesterday is the last I will have for the show. Today I will assemble pieces that go in frames (the lattice, dreaming woman, single koi, ginko and moonrise) and I'll pack the van--without my stolen handtruck, grumble, grumble, grumble. I'll also redesign my display for ease of set-up and stability for the new big pieces (tables instead of pedestals) and print out all the materials I want to hand out at the show. I feel like the Little Engine That Could--I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...Pictures and a review Monday, but for today, I'm just willin'.PS--Just found the replacement for my stolen cart at Amazon--helps to know the name for searching as just looking for \"hand truck\" is useless."},

T-2 and counting for the Decatur Arts Festival. Today I fire the final pieces for the show--tomorrow is all about packing and designing display... and figuring out how I'm going to set-up in three hours on Saturday morning. Oh yes, and printing out price tags, business cards, etc.Just a few short weeks ago I was in Vegas doing the ACRE show and I posted how set-up took 20 hours. Decatur is not Vegas, and a street fair is not a convention center show, but I am still concerned that I will have more than a little difficulty getting the tent up for the first time in two years, leveling all the pedestals for a street instead of a floor, and then putting up the work--all in three hours. The math just doesn't work (and \"Long Division\" by Deathcab for Cutie just came on... iTunes is psychic). Maybe it's time to completely revamp the display--no pedestals at all... I'll have to think about it.Yesterday I stayed focused and on track and didn't stop to smell the roses or chat all day. As a result, I got all my work done by 5:00. I can't work like that. This week has shown me that I am at the point where I must have an assistant. I *can* do all the work myself, but if I do there is no time for any product or business development or client interaction at all--I spend all my time just producing work--or I work 70 hours a week.That last paragraph is too introspective for this week. I just need to get through the weekend and then I can analyze and plan to my heart's content. Now I need to go see if the burglars stole my hand truck out of the shed too.PS--They did. The list of items lost to the burglary just keeps growing. *sigh*"},

As soon as I posted yesterday I got an instant message from my spouse querying the city of my coffee mug in the post. Turns out I was drinking from the Atlanta mug--chosen by the spouse, probably in honor of our homecoming, and brought to me in bed--not Denver. When I posted I just glanced at the mug, saw the \"N\" and a 60's style skyscraper and thought, \"Denver\". Really.Good thing I got a lot of sleep on the vacation and charged my batteries to the full line as I am burning through charge rapidly this week. It has become clear to me how much I rely on my assistant as she was unable to work in the studio yesterday due to her real profession. I unloaded kilns and cleaned the pieces in them, shipped four orders and a book, fired three kiln loads, got out a press release, filled frit jars and fielded innumerable first-day-back phone calls and instant messages all by myself. Sniff. And today I am going to run out of morceaux so I will have to make morceaux, unload three kilns and clean the pieces in them, ship four large orders, fire three more kiln loads, fill frit jars AND get a mammogram! Sniff, sniff.I could really use help halftime, the question is who and how to pay for it. An apprentice would be a fine thing--in the true, old-fashioned sense of the word 'apprentice'. (S)he would sweep the floors every morning, make morceaux, fill frit, unload kilns and wash pieces, and ship orders. Stacy does as much of that as she has time for, but as I mentioned, she has a full-time real-world profession and is just helping me out a few hours a week. I need a serf. Or a smurf--they're hardworking and always cheerful, and blue!... and I am light-headed from lack of sleep.J woke again at 5:30 and came in with us. She had to wake me from a dead sleep to get me to move over and make room for her, and then I spent the next two hours dodging flailing elbows and feet. Did I mention that my batteries are re-charged? Nothing can drain batteries like a restless child in your bed. Off to get the mammies grammed and then work till I drop."},

Home sweet home. I post from the skychair this morning, surveying a yard still drenched from last night's rain and covered in last week's explosion of weeds. Oh dear. Gone one week and the pokeweed in the back is already five feet tall--it grows faster than the bamboo! Much though I would like nothing better than to grab a hoe and hit the dirt in this fine 59 degree weather, I have a studio to run. Besides, it'll be 81 before the day is out and that's just too hot to garden for me. (The studio has air conditioning and I might even turn it on today.)Yesterday I should have posted as I fired three kiln loads (two biggies and a medium) and caught up on all the correspondence that accumulated while I cruised the Caribbean. But yesterday was for getting the vacation pics and info up on Stranded in the South--this might be the first vacation I've actually managed to post about in two years... Today, tomorrow, and Wednesday there are orders to finish and ship, and the bulk of the week--and the firings--is dedicated to preparing work for the Decatur Arts Festival this coming weekend.It's a good thing I just had a vacation as I updated my firing schedule last night and I don't have a day off now till June! However another benefit of being gone for a week is that the payments for previously shipped orders also accumulated in my absence giving me the false sense that I am not working for free. I'll just keep telling myself that I am growing the business and investing in the future--and no pay is better than commuting and working in an office...One of the new clients I picked up at ACRE is a big casino in Vegas. Working with them might turn out to be a mixed blessing as anyone doing business with a Vegas casino is apparently intensely scrutinized by the Nevada Gaming Commission (can you say Ocean's 11?). It's not that I have anything to hide, but I'm also a single business owner/artist. I don't have a million dollar liability insurance policy for both my business and my car (I don't even *have* a business car). And all the business licensing docs. Feh. I got them when I started, at a previous address, with a slightly different name...In a previous life I worked as a software engineer for a large company and was hired to install a system in the secure area at Los Alamos. When I got to the entrance they told me I'd need to leave my laptop, my cd's, my cellphone, my pager, my palm pilot and any other electronic or computing device I had on me at the gate--I couldn't take them in. I asked how I was supposed to install software if I couldn't even get it in the building, and how was I supposed to test it if I couldn't get on their network to use it? They were mystified. It was a challenge. We overcame. Shades of Los Alamos revisit me as I try to fulfill the documentation requirements to be a vendor for a casino.Now off to the studio where chaos awaits for another jampacked, laugh-a-minute week."},

And then May will be all over but for the shouting--not that I actually expect shouting, but that's how the phrase goes.Sometime between now and the demise of May I have a lot of other work to get done. Do I look like a salmon to you? I feel like a salmon. I am beating myself against the rocks to get upstream... where I'll die. I need to stop being a salmon and start being a... sea lion!

{"title": "More Burglary Fallout", "date": "Thursday, May 08, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the Alaska skyline mug, \"So Long, So Wrong\" by Alison Kraus and the Union Station on iTunes. A friend commented yesterday that I seemed very calm after Monday's burglary. It's all on the outside. Last night I was awake on and off for most of the night thinking I was hearing noises over at the studio and fretting that the alarm system might use the phone line so the alarm company wouldn't be able to get through on our phone to tell me the alarm was going off. (The siren isn't loud enough to hear at our house. I'm thinking of changing that.) Oy.Shaking off the night terrors and moving on... Bettina sailed flawlessly through her first firing yesterday bringing me to 36 sq feet of production kiln space with Middle Ground and Little Boy ready to step in for onesie twosie firings. A potter reading this post might wonder why I listed the sq footage of the kiln and not the volume. I am a traditional kiln-former and--unlike the aforementioned potter--I don't stack my pieces on rows of shelves in the kiln. Everything is in one layer so the glass can \"see\" the heat.My glass was delivered from Bullseye yesterday and I met Bill at the Starbucks in Commerce to look over booth design for August and pick-up stands for all the orders going out in the next two weeks. We're in really good shape for the August BMAC even though we are booth starting almost from scratch for booths. I like the Easy Pedestals so much I am going to get another set for Philly, and both Elliott Metal Works and I need to get new lights, new grid walls and new foam core.-------------------Just got over to the studio for the day and as I finished straightening up the office I found one more thing that had been stolen: My Goddess sculpture from Jeff Manpearl of Ferroglyphs. This is the hardest loss. Everything else I could (with the exception of the toilet paper stand) more or less understand, but this isn't something they could sell. This is something beautiful that I had, they saw and decided to take for themselves, for a gift for a girlfriend, for Mom, for whatever. That theft is the most personal, the most disrespectful and the most demeaning."},
{"title": "Robbed", "date": "Wednesday, May 07, 2008", "text": "(The following was written late last night and I am finally getting around to posting it with the photos)I contemplate a glass of wine or something stronger--the day certainly deserves it, and I listen to my own fingers typing for music. It's 2:00 am Wednesday. A restless Sprout, a late-working spouse still at CNN (it's a primary night after all), and the events of the day have driven me from my bed with an undeniable anxiety attack.The studio was broken into and robbed last night (Monday).The burglars were idiots.They left my iPod (no, I no longer leave it there at night), my printer, my fax machine, my laser printer, and my briefcase with my digital camera, my 360 GB external hard drive and my 7-port hub. They took... the toilet paper holder out of the bathroom, the new towel ring I bought on Sunday with the toilet paper holder at Home Depot, two halogen work lights (my photography lights), a little cd player/radio and the 5 HP compressor out of my shed. The compressor is the only serious loss.Though the policeman who took my statement tried to assure me the break-in wasn't my fault, I know it was. I didn't go back last night after the electrician left to put the alarm on, double-check all the deadbolts and lock the shed. I was lazy about changing the burned out front porch lights and so didn't have the screened-in front porch well-lit.No more.The doors are alarmed with no entry delay. The motions are all on and I made sure they're unobstructed. The doors are all deadbolted. The window that was smashed to see if I had a working alarm system has been replaced. The front porch light bulbs have been replaced and they are on for the night. Indeed, for tonight, all the studio lights (the banks of fluorescents) are on. The shed is locked. One of the horses may be gone, but the barn door is well and truly locked.Jane Davidson--a fellow fuser from Chicago--came down for a pre-arranged studio tour this morning at 10:00 and arrived to two police officers, Stacy, Dan the Carpenter, me, and eventually my spouse, all discussing the break-in. She was very sympathetic and helped me clean up the broken glass. Her cab driver was so nervous at seeing the police he was going to drop her off without charging anything... bet there's a story there. But now's not the time for that story, this is MY story.MY story gets more convoluted. Turns out (one of?) the burglar(s) tried to sell one of the halogen lights to the body shop across the street from the studio at 5:30 this morning. Unfortunately the body shop guy didn't give him the time of day so he didn't see the actual light (nor was he offered the compressor). He said the guy was jittery and seemed high even at 5:30 am. The rest of the description he gave me of the would-be seller exactly matched the description of someone I met yesterday morning in front of our house as I was hosing off the car seat and the car mats after Jessie threw up in the car on the way home from school (what a week!). I was in a not-too patient mood and scared him off with my crabbiness before he hit me up for anything, but I found out later that he also approached a couple of my other neighbors, and they both remembered him quite clearly. He told all of us he was living with another neighbor a couple of doors down so I stopped by and asked her if he lived there and she said no. But when I described him, she admitted she knew him, and would only say he had family on the block... and then she pointed him out as he walked by further down the block.My spouse would have been proud of me. In former times I would have marched up and accosted him. But this time discretion won out over valor and I decided just to pass the info I had on to my neighbors, the police, and the neighborhood security force so they could watch out for the guy. My guess is that he'll disappear for awhile--warned off by the neighbor a couple of doors down.Now I shake it all off and prepare to go forth tomorrow morning to meet Bill and discuss display, get stands, and prepare to ship. I didn't fire today so Bettina's test flight will be tomorrow instead. And I'm off to sleep. The pictures are the broken window in the office, the ransacked desk (with the toppled cardboard boxes in front hiding the briefcase),  Jane hanging in the studio, and the opened (and fingerprinted) bathroom cabinets."},

The papers and mail got sorted much later in the morning than anticipated, and the rest of the day slid on. It ended with her not being able to sleep last night--because she spent most of the day in bed--and climbing into bed with us about 10:30 when I was just too exhausted to boot her out. I was the creme in the family Oreo sandwich cookie all night while Dave hung grimly onto a tiny sliver of the edge of the bed. Neither of us slept well (she is a *pushy* child!) but she woke refreshed, and ready to take on the world again.Today, child off to school, clean slate--and Bettina wired and tested! The plus side of Denver Glass having sent the wrong amperage kiln is that I can fire all four kilns at the same time without even coming close to the studio's capacity. The downside is that I don't think she'll be good for anything but slumping (a lower temperature than fusing) as underpowered as she is. I hope they get me my new lid SOON!Bullseye sent my glass last week, it ought to get here today. The next big round of metal from Elliott Metal Works will be finished today and I'll meet Bill halfway to Greenville at the Starbucks in Commerce to go over booth design for August and to take delivery of it tomorrow. It's actually cheaper to drive--or even pay someone to drive--to pick it up than it is to have it all shipped UPS.Dan the carpenter is back in the studio today and the last of the work will be done--the studio already has a picnic bench in back and now it'll have a porch swing in front (we had one that we hadn't put up at the house for the past four years). A door will open out that now opens in, the little kiln room will be exhausted (just like me!), and the bubble wrap will be hung. Hallelujah."},

Tomorrow Dan the carpenter puts in an other exhaust fan, switches a door direction and puts a walkway in the attic (a prelude to blowing in insulation)--all steps toward keeping the studio a cooler place this summer. I haven't turned on the air conditioning yet--the heat bills from the winter scared me too much. I'm waiting till the studio is a little more energy efficient. Till then, I sweat.Kiln loads are going apace, the glass is on its way from Bullseye--I need to check with Denver Glass to see how my new kiln lid is coming along. My guess is it isn't. Before Ikebana this morning I will get the papers and mail sorted into piles (today, this week, eventually, file, and throw) so I know what else I have in front of me before we go (yet again) on vacation at the end of the week.

I never should have played those last three games of solitaire on the computer last night.The firing schedule is done, the orders are to Elliott Metal for their part, and now the work begins. The electrician came last night and did the initial connection for Bettina. He's coming back Monday evening to finish and test her out. Good thing as I have 185 pieces scheduled to fire this month and will need all the kilns to get them done.Yesterday someone made the comment to me that my post on ACRE seemed a bit of a suck up to the show people. Not at all--I calls 'em as I sees 'em. I think the ACRE staff tried really hard to have a great show for the artists and I don't think they succeeded  yet--there just weren't enough buyers. That said, I still had a great show, a really great show. I just feel bad saying so when so many other people didn't. I heard several worst show ever's at the show from other artists, but I was reluctant to put that out there because it was so not the case for me.Enough on ACRE. We move on to the next show--the BMAC in Philadelphia in August--and wait until next year to grade ACRE (three years to get it all together is a good length of time). Bill is coming down from Greenville next week to deliver the first round of metal and pow wow about our display for August--he believes in getting a jump on things and not leaving them til the last minute... think it'll rub off on me? Sara Creekmore sent me a link to a great looking hanging system from Walker Display that I think we might use instead of cable-tying everything to the foamcore and grids. The cable ties look really clean, but the foamcore is unusable after a couple of times (and it takes forever to put up). With a holeless system we could conceivably not have to replace our foamcore for several years and still have a very flexible display.Okay, packing supplies to put away, a cutting list to organize and start on, a kiln load to get in, and invoices to utz people about paying.

I have four orders from the BMAC to go out tomorrow or Monday (mostly still to fire...), three more BMAC orders scheduled for the end of next week, and then four ACRE orders scheduled for Monday the 19th.I could probably make this schedule without breaking a sweat if I weren't going to be out of the studio from 5/10 to 5/17. As it is all of this work must be mostly completed before I go. We were supposed to go away with friends to a lake house they have this weekend to relax and unwind after last week at ACRE, but I am completely and totally snowed under. Stacy, my assistant, also has a real career (she mostly helps me out because she's my friend and because she thinks artists are cool) that is in high gear right now so I can't even push a lot of things off on her.Why then, if I am so busy, am I posting? Because I am sitting waiting for the refrigerator repairman to come and tell me there's nothing he can do, he'll have to order the part and come back again./ I am so sick of people WASTING MY TIME! He knows what kind of fridge we have, he has a good idea it's a motor issue, but he was honest (under pressure) when I asked him this morning if he was going to have what he needed to really fix it and he said probably not. So I am in the house instead of in the studio, writing instead of getting the kiln load in. This afternoon it's the last gymnastics and ballet for the year (yea!) and at ballet it's a participation class. I get to dance too, as does Dave who will be coming to class to surprise the J.Okay, off to putz with the firing schedule to see how I can get everything done.

It's 8:32 here in Atlanta and 5:32 in las Vegas and in my body we're not sure what time it is, but it's damn early. Today I enter of all the ACRE ordes into the computer and email off the confirmations to the galleries. Then it's time to get a kiln load in and put out all the fires that flared in my absence--like the explosion of the one-year-old fridge in our house. I don't think it actually exploded, but the noise of the bearings going and the heat it started to put out made an explosion (apparently, I wasn't here for any of it) seem imminent.Last comments on ACRE before I hit the day... Even with the perfect booth and lots of great new work there's no guarantee you're going to have a good show. ACRE needed a lot more buyers in order for everyone to have a good show. We were lucky because our work appealed to the buyers who did come. Others with as good or better work and great booths might not have done well because their buyer demographic didn't show. The Wholesalecrafts people do an excellent job promoting the show, soliciting people to attend, and rewarding attendance (free shopping credits) but it's a second year show in a really tough market. It's amazing that the show was as good as it was with the economy in the state it is, the fact that it's an election year, and with Iraq still a mess of unknown proportions.Kudos also go to the exhibition services side of the house. Champion is an excellent vendor. We were not unusual in having our work waiting in our booth by set-up time. And the empties were brought out really fast after the show--none of this waiting till the carpet gets rolled up nonsense. The free drayage at the show is also a really big boon for the artists (like us) who are trying to expand their booth design and size and who have outgrown carrying everything in our personal vehicles. I am dreading the BMAC in August with the drayage that Hargrove charges if you don't use them as your carrier. My experience last year was use them and pay huge freight fees (as opposed to the shipping charges incurred if merchandise--like foam core, plastic pallets or gridwalls--is shipped via the manufacturer direct to the show) or don't use them and pay exorbitant drayage. But that's August. This is April, and Champion was great.The convention center is also really well serviced--the restrooms are always clean, fully stocked and fully functional. The Philadelphia convention center restrooms have been a pit for the past couple of years with broken faucets, lethargic cleaning people, no soap and few paper towels--but I digress, this is April, and Las Vegas, and great.I am looking forward to next year's ACRE show, and I take it as a personal challenge to look at my booth, my work, my pricing and my self-promotion over the next year to see where I can make improvements to continue to increase my sales and grow my glass business. Now I go find a refrigerator repairman."},
{"title": "ACRE in Review", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2008", "text": "Just finished a grande Starbucks with lots of half n half, the clacking of flip-flops and the chatter of travelers at the airport for my music--interrupted by the PA system with the message, \"Attention please, would the passenger who left his hearing aid and false teeth in the men's room please return to claim them... if he can hear this message. Thank you.\" There you are. That sums up Las Vegas.I always plan to do a big review of a show when it's over, but when the time comes to write I end up at a loss. I could gripe about economy and the scarcity of buyers, I could note the increasing sense of desperation and fear I see in many of the artists as they see their orders shrinking and scramble to figure out what they could do differently, but instead, I'm going to focus on the positives. There is no doubt that it is harder to make a living in the fine craft sector than it has been in previous decades, but as I can't do anything to change that difficulty, I'm going to write about those things I see making a difference in the level of success an artist has at a show.I wrote on day 2 or 3 about the long set-up time we had. We had a commensurate break-down at six and a half hours. However I think it was my best booth ever, and your booth set-up is the first thing that differentiates you from the artists. We went for a clean white canvas and relied on the work to provide the color and interest pop. Buyers are there to see your work and if it doesn't grab them in the 18 seconds (or whatever) that they give you in a scan as they walk by, then you've lost them.We're lucky in that a lot of our work is big and is, or can be, displayed on the walls, but for artists who make smaller more detailed items, a big, beautiful poster of the work in a prominent place in the booth is essential. I still would like to see us shave a lot of time off the set-up, but after this show and the tangible results in sales, I'm not going to skimp on the display. Why spend all the time and money to do a show and then do a lesser display because it's faster and easier to set-up? If you *can* put up the best booth you can design in a short time, great! But in the current market every edge helps and better is more important than quicker.Another factor for sales success is having new product for every show. We had four new glass colors and nine new glass and metal pieces for this show--and that's just since the Buyer's Market in February. I'm not sure how much new we'll have for August for the Buyer's Market, but the 13 pieces and four colorways we have already added this year (including the new work for the Buyer's Market) is probably enough.Now to post. More musings tomorrow."},

Only the end of the day will tell if it surpasses the February Buyer's Market Show, but it is closing in.Last night I had dinner with friends Keith and Mike at Bradley Ogden in Caesar's--what an incredible meal! For sheer guts on the part of the chef (and on our part for ordering and eating it) the appetizer of frog's legs adorned with a stinging nettle espuma had to be the most extreme. I had halibut with meyer lemon gnocci and a citrus vinaigrette, Mike had lobster and potato pirogies, and we all shared a Maytag blue cheese souffle.

I haven't eaten yet either and I'm just not hungry. Weird. Hello to Dinah--I'm finally posting, and Dave, the pic is for you. I look out my window to the mountains, but if I look right, Rosanne Barr is waving at me from the hotel tower next door. It's a bit... disconcerting.Day 2 has been very slooooooow. Yesterday was an unusually strong Day 1 for me, today has been a normal Day 2 for a  slow show. I'd like to say that I have used the time to get caught up on my order write-up and scheduling, but I have done more chatting with other artists and their spouses/partners than I have working.The big news of the day is that next year's ACRE show (yes, we're already looking ahead to next year's show...) is the end of March instead of the end of April and it will be in a different hall which means new booth locations for everyone. Gulp. I went ahead and put my application in as I am already committed to doing the show (Elliott Metal Works and I are storing our booths together here after the show--including all the work--because shipping it back and forth one time would cost as much as a new booth) so I figured I might as well get my application in. The end of March is not good--it's only a month after the Buyer's Market next year. I would like them better spaced so I could get repeat orders from them instead of one or the other. But it is what it is.____________The secret to getting orders (or at least retail inquiries) is to try to post. I've taken a couple more orders and need to get them all entered and scheduled before heading out to dinner with friends tonight. Ciao!"},

I got back to the hotel and had a glass of sauvignon blanc and a Snickers bar in bed for dinner.This morning I used every minute till 45 minutes after the show opened at 10:00 to finish set-up. In all it took about 20 hours to get the two booths set up--and there were three of us working. We need a better process. I think it's my best booth ever--and my best work, but there has got to be a quicker good way to get a display up.The show started with a bang--I took a big order from a new gallery in Sedona 45 minutes before the doors even opened. Since then there has been a lot of buzz, a lot of traffic, and a lot of energy flying around--and one more order.

Since then I have read and replied to all my email (off-line as I am averse to paying $12 for connectivity at the hotel when it will be free at the show in an hour), and I have watched the night sky lighten to a pale slate grey over Vegas and the mountains beyond.Set-up commenced yesterday just before 2:00 for us and we knocked off at 6:00 with the grid walls all up and covered with foam core where possible (the shared walls are only covered on one side until all the art goes up on that side and then the other side is put up and a lesser amount of work is hung on it). We were pleased (and I was surprised) to find all of our crates waiting for us in the booth and it was the work of a moment to snag a forklift driver and get him to move them around so we could set-up easily and efficiently.Today the hall opens at 7:00 am and we are planning to be there on the dot (an easy matter as we are all on Eastern time). I am not going to make any rash predictions about getting done by noon, but I am cautiously optimistic that we won't be there all night.

I woke this morning at 3:30 and by 6:30 I had built up a full-blown panic attack which exploded all over the kitchen. It wasn't pretty. Why so stressed? I have no idea. I was packed and ready to go last night. Everything fit, I got everything done, what could be wrong?Yesterday didn't go as well as I might have hoped. Bettina arrived, Dan and Lee uncrated her, added her wheels and wrangled her into the kiln room, and I opened the lid. Oh no. There should have been eight full banks of elements in the lid and there were only four. The lid was also put together with two sections of fiber board with a seam down the middle and only one row of supports on each side. That'll never last--the boards will warp and fall in no time. So I called Holly at Denver Glass Machinery and we got it all straightened out. There was a misunderstanding about my available power and they built this monster kiln to only use 56 amps instead of a dedicated 80. No harm, no foul and they are sending me a new lid... soon. I hope soon enough. She said to go ahead and use it as is for now.And now we are getting ready to board. I will arrive this morning and head straight for the convention center for set-up. In a perfect world we will be all done today and ready to go Saturday morning so I won't need to go in tomorrow and can spend the day working on my printed materials... ROFLOL!

It seems that the Illinois Department of Revenue has upgraded their computers from a DOS-based system to a Windows one (one wonders if they got Vista, it would serve them right). In the process, every sales tax account that wasn't zeroed out generated a bill.It took about a half hour just to get through to them yesterday to find out what was going on with the bill I got. Turns out it was in regards to my sales tax payment from December of 2004. When the woman who was helping me said that I remembered what happened. Back then I mailed my payments in instead of processing them through the wondrous Internet. Thanks to the (in)efficiency of the US Mail service, my payment took about two weeks to get to them (someone hand-carried it by foot maybe?). When I filed it on time I took the timely filers discount of $5. When they processed the payment they denied my $5 credit and billed me $25 or something for filing late.I called them about the bill and they tracked down the envelope--with the postmark date for the filing--and saw that, indeed, I had filed on time. I was told I might get one more bill and I should ignore it as it would be fixed after that. And it was... till now. I blame Bill Gates. The original $5 is now $45 (penalties and INTEREST) and I have to decide how much it's worth to try to find all the original documentation from 2004 (or to write a letter detailing what happened if I can't find my original I-talked-to-so-and-so-on-this-date notes). *sigh*And now--several hours later and after the safe arrival of Bettina--I finally post.

Won't THAT make tomorrow fun!So far this week the shipping supplies arrived, the frit arrived but the sheet glass is still at Bullseye--fortunately I have enough for now, and I found out the kiln is scheduled to arrive Thursday... I am most unhappy with Denver Glass Machinery about this last fact. I made it very plain that I had to have it before Thursday or it would have to wait until my return. I was assured Monday that it went out last week and would be delivered in four days. What, apparently, they did not understand is that the delivery schedule is four days not including the pick-up day OR weekends, and it went out Friday... do the math. Fortunately the shipping company, when I called them to check the delivery date, was VERY accommodating and they red-sheeted it through and it will now be delivered tomorrow. Keep your fingers crossed.New at the studio since the last post: There is a ramp leading to the shed, more glass has been moved from the old studio over to the shed, the floor has been supported with eight new columns and a couple of big beams, there is a lovely 10 ft bamboo hut lashed together in the studio yard with over 100 new bamboo shoots (covered in Tanglefoot) coming up next to it, and the porch is almost completely screened in (to be finished tomorrow)! Much glass? No. I am working up samples and a proposal for the sign for a new gallery in O'Hare Airport in Chicago, and have done more experiments with Lee the glass blower on incorporating blown pieces into kilnformed work, but there hasn't been much in the way of production.Tomorrow there is packing, and the arrival (hope, hope) of Bettina, and the end of the contractor week. There is also somehow, somewhere the updating of the website, the 800 word article for Profitable Glass, the invoicing and other assorted paperwork. Oh yes, and a pick-up of all my remaining work at one of my local galleries that is closing the end of the month.

I also huddle and shiver and ponder the economy. There are mixed signals all around me as to its state. On the one hand, my orders are up from last year and I feel that my business is currently strong. On the other, I have had two galleries who placed orders at the BMAC ask to pay for their orders with a credit card after their Net 30 terms had passed citing poorer sales in their businesses than anticipated (I hate giving someone credit for 30 days and then having to pay the 2.8% credit card fee on top of it), another new gallery canceled 1/2 its order before I shipped it for the same reason, and my carpenter says for the first time in his life he's really worried about having enough work as he doesn't have jobs already lined up to get him through the rest of the year--very unusual for him. All of these omens and portents have made me pause this morning to consider my strategy for continuing to grow my business through this tough time, and I realize that I might need one (a strategy)--the seat of my pants might not be enough in the times ahead.On a happier topic--the times just past--I had a great visit with Ron, Christie, Erin, Robert and all the rest of the cast members (Disney has no \"employees\") from Hoypoloi and Pop in Disneyworld. They work in a crazy-busy environment and are still warm, welcoming, fresh and appreciative of both artists and guests (Disney also has no \"customers\").

Friday afternoon I ordered my pedestals from Easy Pedestal on the marvelous Internet. Monday the purveyors of the aforementioned on-line establishment called to inform me my credit card did not go through. I was puzzled but figured it was just Chase being cautious at a large purchase over said Internet so I called them, confirmed the charge, and thought nothing more about it... till a couple of hours later I got a call from Ladybug Fashions in New York and the woman asked me if I had ordered 25 pairs of sneakers on the web on Saturday to be sent to Colorado... Uh, NO!, was my answer.I called Chase back and it turns out that someone tried to buy from Overstock.com, Bed Bath and Beyond, 6pm.com, Ladybug, and several other websites on Saturday using my identity and business credit card. Chase had already declined much of it due to suspicion of fraud and the items that did initially go through were caught before they posted to the account. Two days before I am due to leave on a business trip/vacation I have to cancel my business credit card and get a new one. Chase overnighted the new card, we got it in time, the trip is saved! Souvenirs for everyone!Now the tales of the day before leaving... Dave took J to Zoo camp and I rushed to get glass out of the kiln for two shipments--one to California, one to Pop Gallery in Disneyworld for an artist in the gallery weekend there (here) this weekend. I also met with Lee Ritchie, a local glassblower and Jessie's teacher's husband, and have a couple of buckets of System 96 scrap from him that I am going to experiment with for kiln-forming (this is post-hot-process glass scrap and who knows what's happened with compatibility--to shift or not to shift, that is the question--and contamination. Got the shipments out, a couple of slump loads in (pieces I took out of the kiln at 5:30 this morning and brought with me), met with another friend who is making a Ren Faire costume for J and reviewed patterns, got the tax papers all to the accountant, the notes written for the housesitter, the packing done... You know, when I wrote that I'd write about the day-before stuff I was thinking of a lot more and a lot more interesting recitation. Oh well--I'm tired, drained by the Mouse.Today, Disneyworld Day 1. There was the tea party with the Mad Hatter and Alice in Wonderland mentioned in the first paragraph for J, a pedicure for me, a walk for Dave, pool time and a nap for all. Then dinner at Narcoossee's at 9:00, the fireworks at 10:00, and now we're all ready to fall into our eyelids. Tomorrow, the Tragic, er, Magic Kingdom! (I've been hanging around Dave too long...)"},

It's another rainy day in Atlanta and I find myself (still) surrounded by amphibians. Yesterday saw no diminishing of their numbers--though much good work around here was done. Home Depot had 1 gallon azaleas on sale for $2.00 each (I got 15 for the studio and our backyard) and I also got four raspberry bushes and two blackberry bushes for the studio. No rush to plant anything--I need to put in raised beds with good drainage for everything. Good thing I have a lot of landscape timbers.It's spring break for the J and she sits on the arm of my chair with her head on my shoulder waiting for me to finish posting so we can go to Ikebana. Then she has a playdate with her first best friend in Atlanta (Keziah). I will drop her off and then stop by to see a local glass blower with a lot of free System 96 scrap--I have a great series in mind for it.

The taste of frog is heavy on my tongue.The installation/construction of the shed from Tuff Shed (Home Depot contractors) today was a revelation. I had forgotten what it's like to get a bid from a contractor and have it done *exactly* as speced--no cost over runs, no time over runs, no hidden costs, no sloppy work, no lesser-quality job or materials, just done right, right on time. I'm so excited I think I might go back to Home Depot tomorrow and buy a picnic table for the backyard at the studio. Got to have an employee lunchroom doncha know (and they have really nice ones on sale right now). And speaking of the studio, I am putting in raspberries and blackberries along a fence by the new path. The fence is ugly (well not *ugly*, but it's just a wooden privacy fence) and the fruit will be enjoyed by all (I feel guilty now that I am depriving the squirrels of the new bamboo shoots).Since that the shed is up, I need a ramp for it. All I want to do is garden and work in the yard and, guess what, I can do that this weekend! I am not firing! I am not working in the studio at all. Glass Incarnate will become Grass Incarnate, or Bamboo Incarnate, or Shrub and Flower Incarnate.

Now a quick post and then off to pick up the Sprout from school and to prepare for the usual Thursday craziness of gymnastics followed by ballet. I'll be glad when this year's over.As I juggle Sprout extracurriculars this afternoon I will also finish the layout for my ACRE booth and order the display units (pedestals, tables, whatever) for the tabletop pieces. Then I'll finish my 800 word article for the summer issue of Profitable Glass (the extension of the print article on product viability), and I'll have three more frogs swallowed. Tomorrow is another day of swallowing frogs for me and a run to Greenville for Stacy.Yesterday when we (Bill and Elaine from EMW and I) reviewed the new glass pieces in the stands we were all less than impressed with the glass for the new koi pieces. Rather than just leaving it, I re-made one of the 24\" X 16\" rectangular pieces and the 20\" round piece this morning. We'll go ahead and take one of the two 24\" X 16\" rectangular pieces I had yesterday (there is one for a stand and one for the wall) and the 20\" round to the show: The round piece is easy to swap back and forth so I can show both, and, who knows, someone might like an aqua and green glass so subtle as to be almost not there (at least to me). The new pieces have to go in the crate at Elliott Metal Works by early afternoon tomorrow to ship off to Vegas, hence the drive for Stacy.The surprise winner in yesterday's glass was a new colorway I created for the ginko wall piece. It has yellow, lime green and turquoise with swirls of deep purple. Turns out it is stunning with the koi pieces so I added a bit of orange in the pieces for today and I have high hopes for success tomorrow. There's also another Cosmos 24\" X 16\" rectangular piece in with the koi pieces to replace the one that cracked yesterday when I removed it from the kiln (for the Float stand).

Being 6' tall, a 6' door (which is what the shed comes with standard) is a constant recipe for pain.But the shed is for tomorrow, and I am all about today. Today I am driving to the hinterlands of South Carolina with the new glass pieces for ACRE so they can be shipped out with the Elliott Metal Works pieces in a specially built crate and we can save on shipping. I cracked the kiln at 6:30 this morning a bit reluctantly as I cracked a piece of glass by removing it too soon from yesterday's firing. The crack doesn't go all the way through a 16\" X 24\" Cosmos panel for a float stand (see pictures in a previous post) and now I'm going to have to refire it or make a new one if the refire fails (it could either fuse back together seamlessly or it could finish cracking all the way) and ship the finished piece to Vegas.

What a great scene he did fighting the assassin naked in the baths--and the rest of the movie was really good too. The mug is for Barbara Muth. I can't remember if I have yet written this down, but in case not... When I was writing the acknowledgements for the book I was a bit rushed, and I should have been keeping written track of everyone I wanted to thank from the beginning. But I didn't, and I forgot to include a few at the last minute. The most prominent of the not-mentioned was Barbara. She helped with project ideas (notably the Harlequin candle trays) when the publisher wanted to switch things around. She was also a great sounding board and early encourager in the process--as well as just fun to be around. So thanks, Barbara. And thanks again for the mug.\"The End of All Things\"--a very Wagnerian, ride-the-Valkyries-off-to-Valhalla kind of piece from The Lord of the Rings--just came on iTunes reminding me of the day ahead. Today I slog through the last big pieces for the new designs. I write \"slog\" because it has been tough matching the new metal work to the glass. I need new colorways or reworks of old colorways to best show off the new metal, and I am coming up dry.The new spring greens with yellow, chartreuse and the new Bullseye pea green with a bit of black (a bit too much black) were uninteresting. Feh. The blue, turquoise and orange/amber inspired by the copper seahorses in our powder room were either boring or just odd. Only the rework of \"Conundrum\" (shown in Sunday's post below) turned out well. Yesterday I reworked \"Water\" for the new koi pieces and added some black to \"Flame\" for the new poppy pieces. As soon as I'm done posting I'm going to go see how they turned out. Wish me luck. I will either do some more tweaking of \"Water\" and \"Flame\" for today's pieces or or repeat yesterday's formulae.Tomorrow I have to take all the new pieces up to Greenville to Elliott Metal Works from whence they will be shipped off to ACRE in Vegas... and I still don't have my display done!

Looks like they're having cheese danish. I'm going to have a toasted everything bagel with creamy Jiff peanut butter. Back to \"Ada\".It's Sunday, I post because I write. I finish my web article for Profitable Glass and send them all the photos for both the Siyeh Studio profile and the print and web articles on product market viability. Yesterday I fired several new pieces that I hoped would be three new colorways for the Morceaux de Verre series. I peeked in Big Bertha when I was at the studio a couple of minutes ago and was less than thrilled. I hope they look better out in the light and cleaned up. It's true that I'm stretching my comfort level and going to combinations that are more edgy and complex and less obvious and safe. I just hope I don't have a kiln full of failures.The glass in the piece above right is a revival of one of my first color combinations, \"Conundrum\", reworked for flow and with a bit of black added. I was so excited about how it turned out that I may have gone a little overboard adding black to other pieces (specifically the ones in the kiln right now). I'll have to wait till Bertha is cooler than 248 degrees to really see. The \"Conundrum\" above is in a new collaborative piece with Elliott Metal Works called \"Locked\". It's about 28\" tall and 18\" wide based on the glass size--I haven't measured it yet for final dimensions.Another new piece that came out of last week is \"Float\", shown at left. The glass in it is 24\" wide by 16\" tall and the entire piece isn't much bigger--though over two and a half feet of glass 3/8\" thick is already pretty big. \"Float\" is a fun piece because it gives me a huge open canvas to flow color over. Colorways like \"Cosmos\" (shown) work especially well because there is enough room for all the colors to get a turn to romp around. My previous pieces of this size were the hanging panels and they had to have holes drilled in them to display them. Holes for the sake of hanging rather than beauty feel like desecration to me and I'm glad to be able to avoid them in this piece. Thanks to Debbie Suchy of Eclectic Galleries in Jacksonville for the request to do a big horizontal piece in a simple stand. I can't wait to take this one to ACRE in a couple of weeks.The work over the past week to get ready for the Profitable Glass photos had an unintended bonus--it brought me a lot closer to being ready for a studio grand opening. Probably the biggest feeling of accomplishment and completion came with the painting and furnishing of the gallery (shown at right). When you walk in the front door of the studio, it is the first room you enter. The walls are a soft grey with a subtle white glaze over them and the lighting is all low-wattage halogen. Once the floor is cleaned and mopped with Quick Shine it will really look like a professional public art glass gallery. Time to have an open house...But now it's time to get writing, photo-editing and planning for the display at ACRE. It's only a few weeks till the show and I still have to figure out what I'm going to display my work on besides the walls. Ho boy."},

Yeah, it was a random choice that again shows the omniscience of the iTunes player. Today is the final photoshoot in the studio and we are to the point that I think the studio and work shots will be easy. The difficult part is going to be getting the lighting and staging right to take pictures of the new work. I am working for a cover shot for the magazine, and I'm not a professional photographer. I almost wish I had thought to hire Bart and have him come in for the day, but it wouldn't matter because he shoots slide film and I have to have digital images uploaded for the Profitable Glass staff by Sunday--no ifs, buts, or maybes.Thanks to Dee yesterday and Dee and Stacy on Wednesday the painting is all done but for the bathroom. The bathroom is still in a condition such that my child asks me if she can home and use ours instead of going at the studio. *sigh* So there's a dead spider or two in the corner and some little dead bugs in the tub. What's the big deal?There was no post yesterday as my normal writing/organization time--around 8:30 am--was taken up by back-to-back phone calls and then it was time to paint. And then it was time to fire. And, whoopsie daisy no gymnastics or ballet today! And then it was time to eat, get the Sprout bathed and read with her (she finished reading \"Go, Go, Go\" her first Dick and Jane book last night) and get her to bed. I planned to write an 800 word web article, update my firing schedule with all the new collaborative work and catch up on other computer administrivia after that and instead I fell into an exhausted sleep.Now it's almost 9:30 and I need to hit the ground for another full day. The picture at top right is my paperweight from my class last weekend. It stands about 6-1/2\" tall and I love it, but I have no plans to quit my day job--glassblowing (even if you just manipulate it and don't really blow it) is really hard and it takes a long time to gain proficiency.

I will need to take a break at some point in the day and go pick up my glass piece from the class I took over the weekend at Duckbill Studios.

I had hoped those were over, but they appear to be a cyclical thing. My wonderful spouse wakes up and hangs in there with me--he patiently waited while I worked off anxiety filling all the plastic eggs with candy and hiding them and the real ones in every obscure nook and cranny I could find. He met his daily requirement of Easter Bunny duties by procuring the candy and dying the eggs with the J while I was blowing glass yesterday.I had to post today as Janet Thompson sent me her photos from a paperweight class we took at Duckbill Studios yesterday. It's been seven years since I have done any hot glass work and it was great to get my hands molten again, so to speak. I'll get my piece back Tuesday or Wednesday after it's annealed (I made a huge egg-shaped paperweight).

And pouring the shed slab. And pouring the rest of the ramp. Why do I think it won't all get done?Dave and J just headed out the door to school and I looked down and saw Dave's laptop on the coffee table. I had a moment of panic and wondered how he could have forgotten it and then I remembered he has had Fridays off since mid-February because his team had to work so much over the Christmas holidays. Hey, I was working a lot then too, can I have the day off? Not likely. Yet again a feature of small-business ownership/self-employment. But I am not bitter--there are really many more ups than downs to owning your own business. Perks like being able to set your own schedule (i.e., work all the time), no set limit to your compensation (you can have everything that's left after the bills get paid, if there is anything) and no boss to answer to (only clients). Move along, nothing to see here.On this fine Friday Dee is coming to help out in the studio and Stacy is in all day too. Besides firing and shipping, we are going to paint, hang work and curtains, put together shelves and get things stowed for the photoshoot. Maybe I can even get Dave to come over and paint this morning... hmmm. The landscaper and the concrete guy will both be back doing their things. I hope their \"things\" keep them at opposite sides of the property or at least me on the opposite side of the property from them. I'm such a conflict-avoidant coward!New pieces done.

Even if you only deal with well-recommended people they can still be blind squirrels and their recommendation to you the occasional acorn. The torrential rains yesterday--falling as they did before all the concrete work at the studio was completed--left a beautiful muddy trail that shows exactly the path the water takes to get off my property, and it's not down the drive all the way to the street (and then to Mexico and freedom) as I was promised. No, it's halfway down the new part of the drive and then off like a shot straight across the flowerbed-to-be and into the two neighboring yards. I'm pretty sure that's against code. It's definitely un-neighborly, and it annoys the heck out of me because I don't want the topsoil to be continually washed out of the flowerbed.In addition to his lack of leveling skills, in the process of putting in said driveway and the accompanying sidewalk, the contractor nicked the water line by my water meter. Oh boy. He called a plumber to fix it, but the leak is on the city's side of the meter so he can't touch it. His assistant said he called the city to tell them, but I have my doubts. I also have my doubts as to whether he pulled the necessary permits for doing any of the work in the first place. More oh boy. And more proof that being an artist who is also a small business owner means wearing lots and lots of hats. Today's hat is the tough contractor-wrangler hat a la Crocodile Dundee. I am woman, here me roar.Today's kiln load is a slump for orders shipping tomorrow. Yesterday's fuse load had three new collaborative piece in it--new in both shape and color, and I can't wait to see them today. One of them is hot pink, garnet red and black. It might be too dark, it might be stunning. It's definitely a stretch.I close with the big news of the week--I got my first royalty check for A Beginner's Guide to Kiln-Formed Glass! I understood I wouldn't be seeing any royalties (on account of the advance) for a long time, but the first half of the advance was paid off with some to spare based on sales through December 31.

I could have done a cheap job and just replaced my sidewalk to where the oak tree came out--leaving a broken sidewalk in front of the vacant lot and a break between the two, but I had the oak tree stump drilled out completely (the city was supposed to do it and did a half-assed job) and everything leveled for a smooth new sidewalk all the way down the street.I also had the driveway widened a bit at the bottom so it'll be easier to get in and out. In the backyard they will pour a slab for the shed and a big smooth ramp for the deck to the kiln room--just in time to roll Bettina up it at the end of the month.I'm late posting this morning as I went Home Depot after dropping J off at school and finished ordering the shed and picking up a few odds and ends. You can never have too many odds and ends from Home Depot. Tomorrow the landscaper timbers, dirt and mulch will be delivered, and the Georgia Gardens crew will start the yard renovation that will culminate in the removal of the fence between our yard and the studio yard, and the installation of the shed. Whoo hoo!On a side note, the GG crew will also be cleaning up our yard for spring and I am having them cut down all the bamboo that's leaning into the yard. Then I'll take those bamboo poles and construct a dome hut in the back corner of the studio yard with the lashed together poles. Add a mulch floor, some flowering vines climbing the sides and voila--playhouse at the studio! The hut is the perfect solution for what to put in that corner as the bamboo grove is right next to it and will continue to spread into the studio yard. Eventually the hut will be surrounded by living bamboo and we'll have a path through it to the secret, hidden hut.Though all of the proceeding verbiage pertains to the studio, it has nothing to do with glass, and glass must be done today. I thought I was going to have a week off from firing to work on the studio proper, but a couple more orders came in and it turns out I have a full schedule for the next couple of weeks. I'll still paint and organize all week, I'll just fire too--got to pay for all that concrete somehow."},

Jimmy Ruffin on iTunes. Oh yeah. I hesitated posting this morning as I know my spouse is going to read it and there's no way he won't feel distressed and guilty. Dave, honey, it was the universe--not you. You have a good time listening to great music, talking code smack, and drinking frufty beer with wheat, oats, orange peel and coriander interspersed with vodka. Think fondly of me.It was a tough night bleeding into a tough morning and a heavy schedule in the studio today. Highlights include the deerhound going out at 1:30 and 3:30 am--after not quite making it out at 2:30 and my cleaning that up at 3:30, the Sprout aggressively cuddling in the night and biting my back hard about 4:30 followed by flinging out her arm and poking me in the eye about 6:30. The spaniel decided the deerhound was getting too much attention by being sick so he threw up all over his dogbed while I was wrestling with mulch and finances this morning. Oh yeah. There's my prep for the day.I'm a Mommy and a glass artist/small business owner all day today--the J doesn't have school. So far this morning I got the mulch and soil for the studio yard ordered and delivery scheduled. I have a call in to the concrete guy about redoing the end of the driveway (now that the oak tree that warped it all out of shape is gone) and putting in the new sidewalk. I have picked out the shed and the options that I want and I'm heading to Home Depot within the hour to get it ordered along with the 4X4X8 landscape timbers to border the path from our yard to the studio. I have the landscape people scheduled to put out the soil, timbers and mulch, and I have the carpenter coming (soon I hope) to shore up the floor so I can get the rest of the glass moved out of the basement. When he does that he'll also put me on his schedule to screen in the front porch. Since DHL basically forgot to pick up my shipment on Wednesday, getting the porch screened--and therefore the shipping area secured--has moved to a priority.Four orders go out today, and two--maybe three--full kiln loads go in. Bill (and maybe Elaine) are coming down in a week to bring the metal components for and to look at the new pieces we have for ACRE--including a 16 X 24 horizontal panel on a stand. I'm really excited about the possibilities of that last one.Yikes! It's after 11:00 and the shipments have got to be ready by 2:00. Got to run. Tonight J has Grace over for a sleepover (Grace is J's best friend and the daughter of Stacy the Assistant extraordinaire). Stacy and Grace's sister Alice will be bringing Grace and staying for dinner. I can already taste the first glass of red wine..."},

Got a new one up last night. It's not perfect, but it'll do. Like it? Also got more markers on my gallery map on the studio website. Waiting on the afore-mentioned spouse (java coder extraordinnaire) to figure out how to get the gallery urls and phone numbers to show up in the info boxes, and how to get the info boxes to show on mouseover. Maybe I'll send him a link to the googlemaps api docs.Yesterday was a hard day for the J. First she got up at 6:30 am to take her daddy to the airport,  then she was supposed to have a playdate with a friend after school (the friend's mother was to pick them both up) and the mother didn't pick up the friend, the grandfather did and he didn't take Jessie. So she had to wait for me at school till I could get there for her. Then I bumped into her in the kilnroom and she fell into the side of the kiln and scratched her neck. Too much trauma, not enough sleep. She curled up in the big, green studio chair under a fuzzy blanket and napped for a couple of hours. I got the kiln load in in peace--and DHL didn't show up till I called to remind them I had a shipment to pick up. Shades of service to come?Today is the once-every-five-week-Thursday-from-hell+cleaning people and it's scheduled from first thing this morning till ballet ends at 6:00 pm. Add two firings, shipments to prepare for tomorrow and the big Home Depot list to make (I have too much going today and have to reschedule the run till tomorrow--with the J as she HAS NO SCHOOL!)... I'm going to be hopping. I don't know how single mothers do it!"},
{"title": "The Middle of a Full Week", "date": "Wednesday, March 12, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the Alaska skyline mug, \"Mr. Brightside\" by the Killers on iTunes. The firing schedule is done through April 1 and, lo and behold, I don't have anything scheduled for next week! Zip, zilch, nada. Oh what I can do with a week of no firings! Of course I could do the following week's firings in advance, get them done and packed and hold to ship them. But that just feels wrong. Much better to seize the time and finish painting and setting up the studio. I've been in for there for several months now and it's time to have it done. I probably will do some firing--pieces for the studio gallery which I will get set-up for the photo shoot for my studio profile--but I can see dedicating the whole week to paint and finished storage.Tomorrow is my big run to Home Depot to order the coldroom countertop, a shed, and landscape yada yah. Oh yes, one other thing I'll get there will be the supplies the carpenter needs in order to shore up one of the beams in the floor. Yesterday, as I was arranging the new frit and loading the glass cases in the coldroom from my Bullseye shipment, I had the occasion to see the base of the wall between the coldroom and the workroom. On one side of the wall are three full cases of glass, on the other, a steel rack with about 800 lbs of frit. The wall used to meet the floor. Now there's a one inch gap between the floor and the bottom of the wall. Oh dear, sag, sag. The carpenter had looked the floor over before I moved in and told me it was all shored up to support the weight, but I think he was thinking more the weight of the kilns in the kiln room and not the glass and frit. Now I just hope he can fix it before the beam cracks and the floor falls in...It's Wednesday, another shipping day, two orders to go out and a fuse load for Bertha to get in. The spouse is off to Austin for the SXSW Music festival. He (likely) gets to see REM at Stubbs Barbecue tomorrow night. I'll be Sprout tending. There will be payback. (Though I will probably get to see the performance too as they're filming it for Austin City Limits)."},

This time change thing is hitting me hard. I am DRAGGING again this morning--and my glass delivery is due today. Thank heavens I have help coming--both Dee and Stacy will be here today.Had an interesting call on Friday that I am still mulling over. I did a trade with another artist couple at the BMAC in February. They ordered a Cosmos in Love (Cosmos in the Love stand--Green Lantern in Love shown for reference to the right). I made it and shipped it out, and the couple that got it loved it. But they called on Friday to let me know I had sent the wrong piece. They ordered a wall piece--not a table-top piece. Well, I don't have a wall piece like this and I couldn't figure out where the disconnect was, then it hit me--we displayed these pieces on the front vertical pillars of the booth on little shelf brackets that Bill had made to hold them.Now I have to wonder how many other people either didn't order them because they thought they were wall pieces or ordered them thinking they were going to get wall pieces. And, hey, maybe we need to start selling the brackets so they can be wall pieces! The bracket is a cool little invention of Bill's where the base plate on the stand slips into a slot on the shelf so it won't fall off. You end up with a very little footprint for the shelf and it looks like the piece is floating on the wall. It was made for the show environment, but why not market them for customer use?Got my four orders out yesterday. Got the firing schedule re-jiggered so I could keep firing full loads and not need any turquoise #2 until the glass comes in. Today more firing, unloading glass--and planning the studio front and back yards! Home Depot, bless their big boxy hearts, is having a 12 months (no payments?) no interest event from 3/13 to 3/19. Can you say a countertop for the coldworking room, a shed, mulch, topsoil, landscape timbers, and pavestone for outside? Everything I need to furnish the outside of the studio (and the last big purchase for the inside) on a deferred payment plan. Oh I'm all about that. Now if I could just get the rest of the inside finished. I need one more week of painting, a little more storage and layout organization and a trip to Target for wastebaskets, toilet paper holders, towelbars, etc. It's not totally out of reach... but then there are the other seven case of glass to move over. Ugh. Maybe I'll just keep firing."},

I hate daylight savings time, and it's just too damn early to be springing ahead. Good thing the spouse always wakes early or the Sprout and I would have slept right through the start of school. Big news of the day is that I got Google Maps integrated on my website over the weekend! I have a couple of things to work out so that the gallery weblinks and phone numbers show up and the info box comes up when the pointer moves over it, but I got the basic map up all by myself. Whoo hoo!Today is Monday so there are orders to pack and ship and kiln loads to do. I also got the metal for a new piece from Elliott Metal Works over the weekend and I'm looking forward to making the glass. It's a very alien, retro-80's Terminator piece. You'll see when I put up photos.Okay, almost awake (grumble, grumble, grumble, mutiny, mutiny, mutiny). Time to call Roadway and find out when they are going to deliver my glass (won't be before tomorrow). I am out of turquoise #2 frit and almost all the pieces I have scheduled for today require it. Going to have to move things around on the schedule and fire everything that doesn't have turquoise in it today so I don't get behind (again)."},
{"title": "What Is This Handbasket? Where Am I Going?", "date": "Friday, March 07, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans skyline mug, \"Call Me On Your Way Back Home\" by Ryan Adams on iTunes. It's a day. I have a big order to ship to a new gallery this morning. Problem is, I don't have their address, phone number, zip, zilch, nada except an email address--and the email I sent bounced. Oh boy. But the Internet is a mysterious and powerful device whose power is only exceeded by it's mystery. I looked up the gallery in Google. Hmmm, nothing there. So I looked up the owner's name in the 411 listing for the town and voila! The complete company address and phone listing was there. I had spelled the gallery name wrong in my initial search. Whew!Got a note from a client this morning, I have a piece featured in a buy American blog! It's not that I have a problem with people in China making a living, but the problem with the idea of a a global economy is that you don't live globally, you live locally--and that means paying local prices for living. I have to make an American wage in order to pay American prices for food, housing, insurance, health care, etc. So I have to charge American prices for my work (making it hard to compete with the Chinese manufacturer who pays $.25 an hour for his labor).Another little note on shipping. Bill, I'm not sure people do realize the cost of shipping. We get a lot of mail order stuff from Amazon through their prime service--we never pay shipping. Others who don't use prime (with Amazon) often wait two days to get their stuff with free shipping. My Mom in a tiny town in Montana got a vacuum cleaner shipped to her from Amazon with free prime shipping. I can't imagine what the shipping would have been otherwise on it.And the USPS is cheap. People who sell on eBay ship through them with low postage and free boxes too. But they are just too risky for business shipping of glass--it's hard enough to get UPS's insurance to pay up (and now I wait for the eventual claim I have to make with DHL to evaluate their claims service). USPS in my experience doesn't even pay up when they LOSE they package completely, so I have to go with a more expensive shipper. It's all a question of risk management. Another artist told me yesterday that he lost a client this year due to his shipping costs (the same one that charges $5 per box).I do use recycled materials where I have them (thanks for the suggestion Maria!), but I don't go out of my way to get them as volume packing takes a lot of time and goes much faster with uniform materials--bubble wrap in rolls always the same size, boxes in a predetermined set of sizes, etc. Stopping and futzing to get non-standard materials to fit just so takes time--and time is money for a small business. The answer is clearly hiring someone (Stacy the Assistant!) to do all the packing, but the cost of her labor also needs to be built in then--even more than mine. A business owner can work for free, but employees must be paid. (Whip the serfs!)Storage for shipping materials is going to be a little shed behind the new studio. I'm going to scope one out at Home Depot next week. I had one in our backyard built by a local company a couple of years ago and I'm not going that route again. The yahoo didn't even get the door to hang right. No, it wasn't worth fighting with him about it. I made him fix the gaps, level the unlevel and get the doors to at least close. This storage will also hold old glassware (stock for etching that I no longer do) and my display supplies (tents, tables, etc.). Too bad I won't have it by the time I need to do the photo spread for the Profitable Glass studio profile.Okay, off to ship and fire. Have a great weekend all."},
{"title": "Thursday Which is Hump Day As Monday Was Vacation", "date": "Thursday, March 06, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the San Francisco skyline mug \"Ada\" by The National on iTunes. California dreaming indeed. We are obviously still on California time here in Casa Griffith as we didn't wake till almost 8:00 this morning. It was a rush to get everyone out the door on time. Now I sit at the kitchen table (my later-life desk) laptop in front of me, papers and files arranged fan-like around it. I post, I make calls, I post some more, I buy a song on iTunes, the day continues.The kiln load went in so late yesterday it won't be ready to take out till late this morning or early this afternoon so I have a couple of hours to get through line items on the List. The BMAC is still a fresh memory and now it's time to start gearing up for ACRE in  Las Vegas. I have already shipped my booth and work in the Hargrove (exhibition services) caravan from Philly, but I didn't send my pedestals--I don't want to store them in Vegas as I need them for the gallery and shows here. Now I need to find a replacement for them. Do I go to the cardboard pedestals? Or do I try for  shelves that hang off the grid walls?  Maybe a combination of both?But the display conundrum can wait. A more pressing issue is shipping. (This is a true stream-of-consciousness post...) Yesterday I spent four hours packing and shipping pieces. I am pretty sure the cost of my time was not figured into the work, nor was a complete and accurate accounting for the supplies used for shipping (Styrofoam peanuts, boxes, tape, bubble wrap, and fragile stickers--it all adds up). But how to charge for shipping? It doesn't make sense to try to make it a percentage of the piece cost because the actual shipping costs vary wildly depending on how many pieces are in a box, the box size, etc.Another artist told me yesterday that he charges $5 per box for packing materials, etc. I haven't done anything like that yet as I have felt bad about adding anything onto my shipments--shipping charges are already so high--and that's still just materials and not labor. But maybe the labor charge could go into the piece cost as a fixed percentage--it doesn't vary from shipment to shipment like materials do. If I had Quickbooks for Mac right now I could just whip over and look up how much I spent on shipping materials last year to see how much of a hit I'm taking (the bubble wrap flowed like water yesterday), but since I have it for Windows I would need to launch Parallels, start Windows, then wait for Quickbooks to open. Too much time. So I'll fret instead.No, I'll not fret, I'll get on with my day. Good luck with your surgery today, little Allie. Good Speed to everyone else."},

Four of the five orders were shipped, the fifth was packed and will ship tomorrow. The kiln was loaded and fired. It was a day of one damn thing after another. A day when there was no schedule to follow. A day of flying by the seat of my pants and trying to get through a To Do list as long as, well, I don't have one of those, but you know what I mean. And I did get through the necessaries. I got the orders shipped and the kiln loaded.However I didn't get any analysis done (am I making ANY money at this glass business thing? I should look at my shipping costs and my credit card handling charges and my materials costs and my prices...), nor did I get anything done in marketing, website improvement, studio cleaning, business process improvement, planning for the year. All in all, I end the day filled with disquiet. My bottom-line was not all that I could have hoped last year. Yes, it as another Growth Year where I poured everything back into the business. But somewhere along the way I need to find out that I can pay a mortgage, support a family or even just myself (no, Dave, I am not trying to tell you anything--I'll love you forever and be your life partner at least that long), a time when I can say I MAKE A LIVING AT THIS GLASS THING.

She has been exhibiting at the show for the past 11 years so I don't know what was up with my eyes. Probably missed her because I have never completely walked the glass aisles--much less the whole show. Maybe in August. Having found her this year, I have already begun a collection of her work. The first piece in it is the large mantis for Dave. No, I'm not trying to tell him anything!"},

Even with the beginnings of a looking-to-be-nasty cold, it  is so good to be home!Today I write and organize. I have a 1200 word article due for Profitable Glass and I have the firing schedule to finish building with the orders from the show and I need to make a list of buyers I didn't see at the show. My current drop-dead-go-live date for the new website is Friday, and I will start making calls next week, telling the buyers I didn't see at the show about the new site, saying I missed seeing them at the BMAC and offering them an incentive for ordering before the middle of March.Bill commented on yesterday's post \"Having mostly new customers sounds pretty good, actually.  Isn't that supposed to be the point?\" No, for a wholesale show it is the OPPOSITE of the point: If you're going to go to all the trouble of a show for a one-off sale instead of establishing an ordering relationship, then you want to sell at retail where you make twice as much for your work as you do at wholesale. My ideal wholesale show would have about 30% new buyers and a retention rate of 80% of the previous buyers for 10% growth in accounts... Reading over that I have a feeling I've done some fuzzy math, but the goal is the same--some new, strong retention, and then increased order size across all for another 10% growth.To finish today, here's a report card for this year's February Buyer's Market of American Craft:Hargrove Logistics (specifically Tracy Crea) A+, responsive, professional, human, timely--a tough mix to pull off and she was excellent.Hilton Garden Inn: A, the staff, service and facilities were excellent, the only negative is their choice of pay-tv providers--when you pay $14 for an in-room movie you should be able to pause and rewind as necessary.BMAC site staff: varied from A (Laura Bamburak, the Mixed Media manager) to D (whoever dropped the ball when I asked to speak to whomever has taken up ownership of the Wholesale Matters blog since the departure of Daniel Waldeman--I might as well not have existed)Aramark Food Service: B, expensive but not bad quality and variety, good serviceJava City (coffee place in the convention center by the entrance to the halls): C,  slow sullen service, expensive, poor selectionAttendance: C-, I don't know what the attendance figures were, but I saw far fewer people there than I have in the past and there were too many artists who said they didn't see their regular buyers there for my low viewing numbers to be a fluke.Sales: A, In this weak, scary, empty market, I managed 15 new buyers, 7 repeats, and 61% sales growth over last February's show. Last February was not as good for me as last August and I'll have to look at those numbers too, however I'm comfortable saying my business is growing steadily at the BMAC. Now off to write some more!"},

It's the road home from Philadelphia! Elaine is driving and she and Bill are in the front seats listening to their iPod through the car speakers. J is in her carseat next to me in the back and she is watching a dvd through the car system and listening through her headphones. I have the sunscreen up on the window to my left and I'm listening to my iPod and writing up this post to upload later. It's a technology marvelous day!Yesterday was just too full of stuff to post. First there was packing and getting out of the room, then I stayed busy enough at the show that I never even got the chance to get coffee, much less post. The show ended at 3:00 and we broke down and packed up until 9:00. It's a grueling job. The new booth is gorgeous—we need a few tweaks, but it's mostly just stunning—but it's time-consuming to assemble and disassemble. Most of what we had there we packed up into crates and into my new pallet—which was just the right size—and it'll be shipped off to Vegas for the ACRE show in April.All that's coming home are a few pieces I am going to swap out and all my pedestals. I need the pedestals for the studio gallery and the Decatur Arts Festival in May. Yes, it's after Vegas, but I don't want to have to deal with shipping them back. I need a display solution I can use and store in Vegas, and I'll keep driving back and forth to Philly with my regular pedestals. Why not get more pedestals you might ask. Well, they're nice, but they're sinfully expensive. I can't afford another $2,000-$3,000 in pedestals. Not only that, but looking at our booth, I couldn't help but feel that the pedestals were a weak point.So how was the show? Well, it was unexpected. I am still analyzing the figures and the concrete sales numbers (more of that business/marketing speak... I wonder if I'm coming down with something?), but I already know that most of my total orders were for sculptural decorative glass and metal pieces instead of the functional glass pieces, and the vast majority of my new clients bought the glass and metal. I only had one new gallery order a broad body of work spanning functional glass and decorative glass and metal, the rest of my functional glass orders came from existing customers--and I saw few of them.In the end, sales  numbers were solid and the due dates are spread out between now and the middle of June, and that's really all I could have hoped for.______________________________Now it is several hours later, we're home (having dropped Bill and Elaine off in Greenville), we're clean (well bathed), we're fed, and we're ready for bed. Tomorrow more show and industry musings. G'night!"},

It's the penultimate day of the Buyer's Market of American Craft, and I am feeling my age. This is a MUCH easier show than any retail show I do, and I'm still exhausted. Time to stop drinking anything with alcohol or caffeine in it, to lose weight, and to take up walking, yoga and meditation. Artificial stimulants and depressants can only carry you so far. Then in a couple of years I can write a book about how those lifestyle changes affected my life and my art and I can go on the talk show and book tour circuit... Clearly I'm delirious. I want to go home.And it's a good show! Or good enough so far (talking about sales here). After I posted yesterday I took seven more orders. The orders are unusual in that they're almost all for the new wall sculpture and tabletop pieces in stands--it seems almost an afterthought for the buyers to throw in a few small rectangular plates or a shallow dish or two. And the buyers are almost all new--I'm not seeing very many of my regulars. I was talking to another artist in mixed media this morning and she said she hadn't seen many of her regulars either. She hasn't moved from her usual spot and she is attributing not seeing her regulars to them not being there.The best news on the orders I've taken is that no one is in a rush to get anything so I can have a bit of a breather when I get home. The only I-want-it-now order I got was from a Personal Shopper (someone who has a business and uses it to gain entrance to this wholesale show to buy for herself at wholesale prices pretending to buy for a business). I am not thrilled with PS's, but if they are polite, wait until I am finished with whatever real buyer I'm talking to, immediately step aside if a real buyer comes into the booth, and cop to being a PS right up front, I'll deal with them. This woman was/did none of the above--she actually interrupted a conversation with a real buyer and it didn't become clear till the end of the order-writing process that she was a PS. I just didn't have the energy to confront her about it so the order stands--though I have plenty of personal outrage now, after the fact. Whatever.Good thing I get a firing break when I get back as I have to finish my article for Profitable Glass and get the website live this week. I have been sporadically working on the site over the past few days and I am *almost* ready to go live. I have Christian now on Skype......And I lost Christian so I'm going to finish up this post and get it up. Then I'll enter my orders into the firing schedule and my show data into Excel, update the to-do list for the website, and start uploading images. Maybe I'll have lunch--and maybe I'll write some more orders (that would be nice--only one today so far)."},

Day 2 of the February Buyer's Market of American Craft--historically the biggest wholesale show for my craft demographic, and I have written one order today. Add that to the two from yesterday, and things are not looking good. Yesterday Bill asked in a comment if  could say \"Economic Downturn\", I may have to learn to.So far the universal consensus (among the artists contributing to the discussion) is that there are fewer buyers, more lookers, and the orders placed are uniformly small. Does it have anything to do with this being an election year? My first year at this show was the last election year so I don't have good sales figures for comparison (I expected not to do well as it was my first time here and I met my expectation). Is it being in Inspired Interiors? Today I am more comfortable about my decision to move as the one order I did get was from a new (for me) gallery in New Hampshire and the owner said how nice it was to find me outside of glass--the glass section is just too overwhelming. If I don't see my regulars here I am going to follow up and offer them the show special for all orders placed by the end of February. However, while on the one hand I feel good about having a post-show sales strategy, on the other I know that most buyers will have used up their spring budget by the time they get my pitiful little bid for their business so I am not likely to get many (any?) takers.I am beginning to think that making a living in American craft now is going to require a much more diverse strategy than it has in the past. Instead of being able to rely on one or two big marketing pushes (and the visibility garnered from a wholesale show qualifies as a big marketing push), I think I need to focus on a constant, diverse flow of marketing. And I think it will be beneficial to outline marketing goals and target specific buyers--less scattershot and more focused... Good grief, I sound like an MBA candidate. Further proof that it isn't enough anymore (if it ever was) to be just an artist.The highlight of the day so far was the two visiting community college students who came into my booth and said my work was \"righteous\". I think their names were Bill and Ted.PS--The show isn't as gloom and doom as my posts have seemed. There is more to doing a show than orders written at the show... and if I think about it long enough, I'm sure I can tell you what that more is..."},

It's Day 1 of the Buyer's Market of American Craft, and I feel like a fish out of water. It's my first year out of the glass section and in Inspired Interiors, and while logically I know it's the same buyers for the whole show, my gut is telling me that I don't know any of these people and they don't seem to be interested in my work. My unease was just further cemented when one of my regulars walking by the booth did a double-take when he saw me and said \"This isn't the glass aisle, I'm not ready to do glass yet!\" He'll be back tomorrow… I hope.Four hours left to go and I can pick my bunny rabbit up from Camp Buyer's Market and take her back to our room to watch \"Enchanted\" and cuddle. J is a bit… overwhelmed. While it sounds exciting to go to Mommy's show with her, and Daphne and the rest of the Camp Buyer's Market people are wonderful, it's also long days with no normal routine, lots of rushing and stress… and a mostly absent Mommy. I took a break and took her to lunch today and when I returned her to camp she clung and cried—something she's never done before. Five minutes of tucking her in to rest and watch Peter Pan and I could go back to the show floor, but it was a wrench.Picked up two new galleries today in two orders, but the traffic has been very light. I hope it's because I'm in the middle of the hall instead of on the side (the glass section is all along one wall) and people will get to me tomorrow. If not... Hmm. I don't have an if not scenario so I had better not need one.And calloo calay, the best part of being in Inspired Interiors up by the front doors is that I am on-line with free internet! Haven't had that happen in about four years. I close with a Hello to Maria the potter and lurker who stopped by my booth today to tell me how much she likes reading Glass Incarnate.No coffee yet, \"Come Pick Me Up\" by Ryan Adams on iTunes (thank you Keith, I love the album). The J continues to sleep, I post quickly and then get on to line sheets and price labels. Oh what an optimist and a fool I was yesterday! I tempted the gods of set-up and said aloud (twice!) that I thought I could be done setting up by noon (we started at 8:00 am). I walked off the floor at 8:00... pm.I am so glad J and I are staying across the street as by 8:30 she was in the bath, room service was ordered, and I was off my feet for the second time of the day. The Hilton continues to be MARVELOUS.The new booth design (grid wall panels with foam core over them all cable-tied together) is fantastic. It's clean, bright, well-laid-out, and has great flow through. It took a lot of time to put together this first time, but I am confident/hope/pray/implore it will get faster and eaisier with practice. As with all good booth designs, breakdown will be *much* faster than set-up.I am almost too tired this morning to be coherent, and I really got up to work, and not to ramble on, so I will sign off and continue tomorrow. I think there was something I said I'd post today, but darned if I can remember it."},

The in-the-other-bed part is significant. Last night as I was posting, J was snuggled in my double bed next to me. She fell asleep there, and when I came back from he last trek to the bathroom before sleep, I found her sprawled asleep in the middle of the bed with the effective weight of ununhexium. She's a very small child, but she has a very big sprawl that evidently weighs more when unconscious. I was about to spatula her over into her bed when I thought, what the heck, these are identical hotel beds. I'll just take the other one with Wolfie and Dolly (she had Bun Bun with her in my bed). Problem solved, a relatively good night's sleep acquired! It was only relative as I don't sleep well in hotels anymore--most of them have too many covers and I sleep really hot.Back to the show... At the end of loading the car Tuesday I got a bit sloppy. I managed to leave behind my show wastebasket, carpet vacuum, carbon paper, clipboard, black folders (sort of on purpose), and my toolbox. I ws unconcerned about the toolbox as I am right next to Elliott Metal Works and figured that Bill would have a complete toolbox. I was right, but the one esoteric item he doesn't carry is an engraver--hope no one wants to trade for a new piece! Today, in addition to doing my line sheet and other show documents (business cards? I am undecided. I might hand out postcards instead), I need to get a wastebasket, and toothpaste, a toothbrush and socks for the J (the sock monster LIVES in our laundry room and feeds entirely on small child socks). I think there's a K-Mart I can get to without ever going outside of the Convention Center at the end of the underground mall.Panic attack: I don't have enough work to display. I don't have either the tables or the bookcases or the corner sales cabinet I have always had in the past so I only brought enough work for 13 pedestals. I don't have any of the hanging panels that made my booth so dominant and bright last August. No wonder my car was so empty on the way out--I didn't bring anything!... Breathe. Less can be, no, less IS more. Think I'll work on the line sheet some... Damn--last thing I remember that I forgot: the Joomla book Dave got me. I need to work on the website. Oh well, I have it electronically and can just muddle through with that (I hate reading on a laptop screen).Happy Valentines Day all, got to go start pulling the day together!"},

J was a trouper and even got up this morning at 5:30 am with no complaint. Actually she got up at 5:40 because we didn't get our 5:30 wake-up call. When I brought the lack of call to the attention of the front desk person as I was checking out I was told that I couldn't possibly be 100% satisfied with my stay because I didn't get my wake-up call. And their goal was 100% satisfaction so, would I be 100% satisfied with my stay if they comped my room ($90)? Sure I would!Unloading went damply smoothly--nothing worse than a light drizzle--and set-up progresses apace. I should be doing my line sheet right now (the shiny paper with pretty pictures and prices that I will hand out to buyers at the show), but I am going to post and sleep. I have faith that set-up will fly tomorrow and by noon (!) I'll be back in my room working on printed materials and my website...And pigs might fly out my... ears... too. I can always hope!

Yep, you read right, the J and I. The spouse's work schedule is just too uncertain with all the primary and caucus hoopla so she is going with me. My work schedule is full, but definite, and the Buyer's Market has a kid's camp during the hours that I need to be on the floor either setting up or selling. The big question is can I fit all my stuff, Dee's stuff, J and a seat for her, and a seat for another passenger on the way home, all in the back. The dolly might just push us over the limit.

It'll either fit or it won't, and if it doesn't there isn't a whole lot I can do about it. I'll just have to fill the crate till it's full and ship the rest in boxes from Atlanta in April.

Why not just have one great big site with a constant streaming outflow of information—blog posts, photos, articles, publicity--everything currently on Siyeh Studio and Glass Incarnate? Nope. Won't work. The photos I want on Siyeh Studio are finished work—not experiments, not my sweetheart swap pics, not the studio cam. Speaking of the studio cam (no, I don't have one), I want a live studio cam. Drop in, listen to the music, see what's happening at that moment in the studio (is it shipping? Is it grinding? Is it CREATION? The problem is I'd need to mount the camera on me (like the light on a miner's helmet) as I move constantly from room to room doing different things… But back to the website.Maybe the reason I keep ending up with a never-finished website is that I don't really know what I want it to be when it grows up. I slap some haphazard things up and plan to do more later. Well boys and girls, 'later' is now. Got to, got to, got to GET IT DONE. The postcards are going to start hitting galleries TODAY and the curious might (hey anything is possible!) pull up my website to check me out.Every time I have sat down to work on the Siyeh Studio site in the past couple of weeks I have been lured away by the Glass Incarnate site. I *know* what I want up there and I keep slipping into putting it up. When I do determinedly focus on the Siyeh Studio site I get lost in some little arcane detail like how to put up a Google maps version of my gallery locations instead of a static list. Who cares?! Just get something up now. Something. Anything but an interminable  \"Under Construction\" page.So what to put up on Siyeh Studio? Well, an obvious answer is a somewhat manipulable slideshow with examples of all of my work on the front page. Draw them in. Also on the front page should be a listing of upcoming shows, awards/publications or other news. I was accepted to the Decatur Arts Festival for this year today (yea!) so maybe I need to have a retail corner to let people know when I'll be doing a retail show or having an open studio.The items in the last paragraph all feel like the vaguely fall under the heading \"news\", and isn't it a nice coincidence that my Joomla template has a Content item type called \"News\"? Also on the topic of potential \"news\"… What about all the donations I do? I don't take a tax deduction on them (for some reason the idea of doing so makes my accountant shape her fingers into a ward against the evil eye) so what about putting in a plug for both the event and my altruism by writing up a news blurb each time I donate a piece and include a picture of it with details about the particular auction?So on the front page so far, upcoming wholesale, upcoming retail, upcoming charity events to which I have donated work for an auction and a slideshow. Four is a good number. I like four.What other kinds of content? Well, an artist bio is a good thing. As is a statement of techniques and materials. The there is the work itself. I need pictures of the various series and color ways within them—and for gallery clients I need a password-protected price list and ordering mechanism. I need a contact me form for inquiries, and I could use a registration form for eventual e-mailings. Last for the moment, I need a listing of all the galleries that carry my work (in a Google maps form would be nice, but I can wait)."},

They say all the right things, they charge the right amount, now let's see if they show up.I spent the weekend trying to match the color blend on a set of custom plates I did two years ago. I have two of the original pieces here for comparison, and it's a good thing as the first fuse came up too washed out. Did the second fuse yesterday and I am betting I got devitrification on the cranberry, I never even took the pieces out of the kiln from the first fuse--I just added more blended frit on the problem areas (since I don't have to kiln wash or otherwise prep my kiln shelves there was no reason to remove them). When I finished adding the frit I noticed a little haze on one part of the cranberry (a solid element surrounded by frit and so not covered by the color adjustment). It's only going to get worse in another full fuse. So I'll see how the color turns out today and either do a superspray surface correction and one more color tweak--or I'll redo them from scratch.FedEx just called, they have pretty much lost any chance at my small business account. they recommend I just call the day before I have a shipment going out and request a pick-up. My volume is too little for them to do a weekly pick-up. They must really deal only with the big fish if 6-12 boxes at a time requiring a dolly to pick-up is not worth their while to stop the truck. Please DHL, don't let me down.Hargrove finally got me an official paper quote for the pick-up of my crate--and they upped the amount another 25% over the verbal making the shipping *double* the cost of the crate and 2-1/2 times what a regular freight company costs. Time to get creative on logistics again...And now it's off to work. Miles to go before I sleep, glass to fuse, and orders to ship.

{"title": "Stick It To Me", "date": "Friday, February 01, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, on-hold music from FedEx in my left ear. You know this story can't go anywhere good... Is there ANY good shipping service out there? I have years of poor experience with the USPS so even though they're aggressively trying to move into the package-moving space, I am uber wary to try them. We all know where UPS stands in my estimation, now FedEx has twice failed to get me set-up for pick-up service... Who's left? DHL?Continuing in the poor service thread this morning, I am not confident that my shipping to and from the BMAC (Hargrove's pick-up of a pallet and delivery of it to the show and then their caravanning of the entire booth to Vegas) is going to go off smoothly either. Yesterday afternoon I called to find out how best to get the collapsible crate I am buying (to ship and store my work and display) to Philadelphia for the show. I was told to fax over the shipping form, they would fill it right out and fax the quote back. I let the person I spoke to know that I was talking about a pick-up next Monday for delivery to the advance warehouse (which is in itself ironic as I don't care when it gets there as I don't even need it till after the show anyway, but they have a delivery cut-off of next Friday so I want to make sure I get in for it). I was told no problem, they are pretty caught up, they'll get right on it.Ok. I fax my form. I wait. I sleep. I check the fax machine this morning and nothing there--without the quote, I can't place the order. I call. I say, \"Hi, I sent you a fax yesterday afternoon and I never heard back.\" The person I speak to is quite affronted that I expected him to get back to me right away and that annoys me because I had that expectation because THAT IS WHAT HE TOLD ME WOULD HAPPEN. Then he tells me someone else would be handling my order and getting back to me. I inform him that I spoke to that particular someone else yesterday afternoon and was told that HE (the person I am speaking to) would be handling it. He tells me *someone* would get back to me within a half an hour. Guess how long it's been since then? Less than a half an hour? I think not.Why do I need to ship with Hargrove in the first place, you might ask. Surely the vendor for the crate has a shipping service. Yes, they do. Are they more expensive? No, they actually charge 45% of what Hargrove will charge. Can they not get it shipped? Oh yes, they could have had it go out today. So why am I shipping with Hargrove? Because if I don't Hargrove will charge me the equivalent of TWICE the shipping charge from the manufacturer just to move it from the loading dock to my booth. They call it a ($180) \"material handling fee\". The crate only costs $137. The whole why-am-I-not-shipping-it-here-to-Atlanta story is just as long and convoluted so I am going to skip it. Suffice it to say that some days it feels like everyone you deal with is out to stick it to you somewhere, somehow.Now I wait for Christian to call about the web stuff..."},

Got another nibble yesterday for 400 pieces. Spurred me to create a how-long-does-it-take-to-make-X-of-these chart. You know, I can make 300 sushi pates in two weeks, without even pushing it? And when Bettina arrives I'll be able to do it in one. Whoa.Also got all the weights of all the pieces into a spreadsheet (hate NPR, love Excel--what's the world coming to!) and used it to validate my pricing model. What do you know, it worked! It worked in a backwards kind of way, but at least I'm not giving the work away. Unfortunately, it did change the costing slightly on my product inventory so I'm going to have to adjust those numbers in QuickBooks (will the QB ever be done?).Some of the balls I'm juggling are dropping perilously close to the ground and I need to finish them up--the mailing list must get done *today*, the website must get at least the old content moved to the new site and the new site activated by Monday with a plan for new data propagation in place.

(Actually it's \"Tribal Connection\" by Gogol Bordello). Live from Kavarna, Gogol Bordello on cd... I think I preferred NPR. I hate NPR.I am posting late as I finally tore myself away from the FASCINATING website creation work I have been immersed in since yesterday afternoon. The current bit entails renaming all the pictures I have of my work with obscure but meaningful names so I can upload them and know what the heck they are in the folder without opening them. E.g., TrMRo2DNo.jpg is a picture of a Morceaux de Verre \"Trout\" medium round art panel in a \"Nouveau\" stand (shown above). It's both more and less complicated than it sounds, and thought the renaming task is a bit dull, the rest of my interactions with the Joomla content management system have been decidedly spicy!It is turning into a week of juggling (how many balls can I keep in the air?). Yesterday at 4:30 I got a call from the corporate gift company that ordered 114 long rectangular platters for their client last month. The platters all arrived unscathed, on time and stunningly gorgeous--the client was thrilled. The client was so thrilled that she managed to come up with extra budget for the other event they had talked to me about and wanted to know if I could do 430 of anything by February 8... twelve days hence. I said I'd call her back in 15 minutes. After much measuring, head scratching and frantic calculating I determined that there was no way, no how I could do 430 of ANYTHING in twelve days. I regretfully called back and declined. And oh how it hurt! An order that size is a serious chunk of change and I did the 114 without even breaking a sweat (or getting bored--how many things can you really say you can do 114 of without getting bored?). But there are only so many pieces that will fit into the kiln, only so many firings I can do a day, only so much frit and glass I have on hand and the sum total of all of it is not enough.Out of the ashes of my decline rose the phoenix of Bettina, the new kiln, however. I called up Denver Glass, spoke to Holly, and hammered out the specs. I am getting the same interior width and length of Bertha, my current kiln, (72 X 36) but I am getting her 12\" deep instead of 9\", and I am getting 4\" of fiber blanket on the sides instead of 3\". In addition, I am getting extra reinforcement around the sides and lid to protect against warping and a Bartlett controller instead of a TSC. The extra fiber blanket and reinforcement are so I can do melts and casting (longer, higher-temp firings) in her. The Bartlett controller is necessary so I can delay the start time of the firing--I won't be able to fire both Bertha and Bettina at the same time as Bettina is going to need a dedicated 100 circuit all on her own. So I'll load them both, program them both, and have Bettina actually start when Bertha is done. The Bartlett will also tell me exactly how many kilowatts I used in the firing--a neat perk for figuring costs. It'll be 10 weeks till she gets here, but it'll be worth the wait. I love Denver Glass Machinery.Dee came down and helped in the studio for the day yesterday. While I puttered with Joomla and RocketTheme templates for it, she weighed all my pieces for the shipping weights chart, and inventoried all the 5-lb frit jars. When the call came in about the 430 pieces she did the math with me and then commiserated with me. So other organizational tasks are getting done--even if not by me. Though I, personally, am almost finished with the annual finances! All that remain are the material and product inventory numbers and the entry of everything bought from the personal accounts that needs to be listed in the business.This afternoon I am doing a little promotional material work--no brochure, catalog--on cd on-line or printed, or printed price list for me this year. I am trying to go with a web key drive--like a little USB flash drive--printed with my logo on it. If I can get it done, when it's put into the USB slot of a computer it will immediately launch a web browser and go to a welcome page for galleries on my website. On that page will be a printable price list, a photo catalog, a terms sheet, an order form--everything a gallery owner needs to know to place an order. Slick, huh?*Though I am enthralled by the new technology options, I am not neglecting the tried and true advertising methods, and this evening I'm going to finish up getting the mailing list details assembled for Stacy so she can put them all together and I can get my postcards out this week. And then there are the orders I still need to fire and ship--or sign and ship (in the case of books), and a class list to put together (still), and a swap piece to fire, and a self-portrait to work on, and an article to write... Never a dull moment (hope those balls in the air bounce when they hit!).*The USB flash drives are too expensive to hand out to everyone who wants a little info, and the web keys--while not as pricey--only work with Windows and I just can't get behind that. Guess it's going to be the old folder and price list option for one more year... *sigh*"},

Another week begins after a promise-of-spring weekend here in the south.  The rest of the country, well the northern parts at least, are going to have wait weeks and weeks before they get lured by spring. It begins here in January.The teasing promise of spring continues on this week with temperatures in the 60's and sunshine. Thoughts of taking the week off for mental health reasons are forgotten in the rush of endorphins brought on by warmth and sunlight. Instead, it will be a productive--one might even say prolific--week, I can feel it in my bones. And as it's Monday, it's a good day to organize the calendar for the week.Monday, Dee comes down for the day and we are going to move, move, move glass. I'll also do a couple of kiln loads, set-up the new shipping scales, plan the work for the BMAC, and ship a book order. Something else I thought of last week that I really should have thought of before is making a weight chart for my work. Shipping has always been a hassle because I have had to get everything boxed up and weighed before I could enter the shipping info into UPS (now FedEx). But if I know the pieces that go in a shipment, and I know the weights of each piece, I can estimate the weight within a couple of pounds and schedule the shipment for pick-up before it's boxed. Weighing all the pieces and creating the chart will be a great project for Stacy. Another Stacy project is to whip my gallery mailing list back into shape before, uh Wednesday. Better get moving on that--postcards to go out and all.And now Dee is here so I have to run. More on the creation of a good mailing list tomorrow!"},
{"title": "UPS Holds My Package Hostage!", "date": "Friday, January 25, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the Los Angeles skyline mug, \"Tangled Up In Blue\" by Bob Dylan on iTunes (it ought to be tangled up in brown). Back to our regularly scheduled format. Yesterday as I was at Kavarna coffee blogging my open letter to UPS, my package was still languishing on the front porch after the previous evening's non-pick up fiasco. After I finished my letter/post, I  opened a FedEx account on-line and entered my package info preparatory to printing out the FedEx label and shipping it out when I got back to the studio. Then I went back to entering and reconciling last year's business data.When I got back to the studio the package was gone! There were two delivered in its place so I knew who had taken it, but I hadn't wanted THEM to take it anymore. By 10:00 pm last night the tracking info still hadn't been updated so I was sure that the physical package had gone the way of Amelia Earhart, the pick-up request, and the original system tracking info. But apparently I am to be lucky this morning and the package has resurfaced and is on its way to Chicago. Just let them try to charge me for the pick-up... \"Psycho Killer\" by The Talking Heads comes on iTunes. My laptop and I, we are in sync today.And the finances drag on and on and on. I discovered the mileage tracking tool in Quickbooks yesterday and it gave me joy (I am easily amused). Will today be the day I finally beat the paper into submission?

{"title": "Good-bye UPS", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2008", "text": "Re UPS tracking number 1ZR516F40390285569Dear UPS,Today I switch to FedEx. You seem to have made a lot of changes in how you do business for the new year, and for your customers they are uniformly for the worse--1) Your new web software is buggy, 2) I no longer have a regular driver--the drivers and their level of competence vary from day to day, and 3) your customer support system is configured to provide anything BUT support.In the four years you have been my exclusive shipper, I have put up with watching my boxes of glass bounce off an overloaded dolly wheeled by an overzealous and inexperienced driver (really), I have philosophically accepted the continual rise in your prices aligned with a commensurate decline in your services--always polite, rarely helpful, increasingly slipshod and haphazard. But today I finally reached my limit. The 30 minutes I spent this morning (on top of the hour fifteen last night) *not* getting a problem resolved by customer support or a supervisor was the last straw, I am the camel.You redid your website for the new year along with raising your prices. It takes me a little longer to process my shipments, but it's prettier (maybe the increased prettiness is supposed to offset the decreased usability? Not a good idea, but not my call...). Yesterday at the end of a very busy day in the glass studio I entered a shipment into the system and scheduled a pick-up pick for no later than 6:30 pm. Based on the lack of reliable pick-up service I received for my shipments over the holidays, I checked at 8:45 pm to make sure it had been picked up. It hadn't. I looked on my UPS page to make sure it had been entered correctly. It had.I called Customer Service. I *hate* calling UPS customer service. The voice response system (VRS) is one of the worst I have dealt with (only Delta's comes close)--the options never match what I need to call about, and I am not allowed to get to an operator until 4-5 tries by the robot voice. By that time I am so enervated, aggravated and stressed that it's hard not to snarl at the customer support rep. (Note: Ask your reps how many callers are cranky when they get to them, and if the number is high, re-think your phone tree options.)The ever-polite support rep can't find my pick-up request in the system. Nor can she find my tracking number. We ditz around for several minutes while she verifies that they have *nothing*. She says I need to speak to web customer support, gives me the number and transfers me. She transfers me on the dot of 9:00 pm and I get an answering message saying the hours are 7:30 am to 9:00 pm EST. If I have a shipping emergency I am directed to press one of the buttons (who remembers this level of detail the next day?) and enter my call-back number. I do. Then I'm told someone will call me back within the next hour. I wait. They don't.This morning I called customer service again and I am already wound up before I ever get the annoying VRS. I try to state my problem as briefly as I can as I really don't want to waste a lot more time getting this one package picked up and to the Art Institute in Chicago by tomorrow. Bottom line: The support rep can't find the tracking number or the pick-up request in her system. She tells me I need to speak to technical support. I say  don't want to speak to technical support to spend more time helping UPS fix their technical problems--which are, by the way, NOT MY PROBLEM. My problem is that I want my package in Chicago by tomorrow. Why their new system failed is NOT something I wish to spend my business day helping them figure out. Please just enter the shipment again, get it picked up, and pay the difference as it will have to go next day air now instead of ground. Figure out on your own time what happened with my shipment. She can't do that (the whole just-enter-the-shipment-and-make-the-customer-happy thing).I ask her if she can just look in a regular browser window to see the package--I would happily give her my login and password and she could see exactly what I see in all its hyper-linked glory. She says no, only technical support can do that. I repeat that I wasted an hour last night waiting for them to call me back and they never did, and I am not willing to give them any more time for, again, THEIR PROBLEM. After a bit more going around, I ask for a supervisor. The supervisor cannot see the tracking number in the system either (surprise, surprise!). She also cannot find a record of my call-back request from last night... I hear the disbelief and boredom in her voice. The front-line support staff may have to be excruciatingly perky and polite, but the supervisors are above that. Fine, whatever. I am not going to argue with her about yet another failure in their system.I move on. I lay out in plain and simple English what I expect UPS to do to resolve this issue. I expect them to create a new shipment request, get my package picked up and off to Chicago for arrival tomorrow. She says she'll have to put a call in to the local distribution center and someone from there will have to call me back within an hour to discuss how they can help me. I explain to her that a customer support model where the customer cannot even get to someone who can resolve her problem is not customer support at all. Having to wait for someone from the local distribution center to call back--not to be able to be transferred there or given the number to call myself--is ludicrous and I am not doing it again (refer back to the pick-up nightmares in December). I am not sitting around waiting for another hour for someone to call me to fix what is obviously a bug in their software. I set the phone firmly back in its cradle."},

Ah, there we go, \"Just Can't Wait\" by the J. Geils Band on iTunes. As many of you probably laid odds, I am not taking vacation this week. I already lost yesterday to bookkeeping (I sorted the papers in the breakfast room into files--or put them in a pile in the office) and I still haven't even started entering data into Quickbooks. Today the sales tax report is due and to complete it I need my total sales numbers for the year. Oh boy, you can see where this is going, can't you?Today is lost to the paper shuffle (and shipping). The order for exhibition services from Hargrove for the Buyer's Market is due Thursday--and and I don't *have* to wait till the last minute to do it, and my postcard will be ready at the printer today--need to update my gallery mailing list and get it out (there's another good project for Stacy--updating the mailing list).But all is not lost! There is next week to pine for! If I get all my work done for the BMAC this week, get the outstanding orders done and shipped a little early, there is really no reason I can't take next week off... Or I'll just wait till the end of February when we go visit Bill and Bridget in California and Do Sonoma/Napa with them and a bunch of other friends. A couple of years ago we all went to the Paso Robles area and this year we're trying the experience again (though in Sonoma as they won't allow us back in Paso Robles... just kidding).All levity aside, it is almost impossible to take vacation as a sole proprietor. When I do go away, I still check my email and voicemail every day for orders, inquiries, etc. If I have an assistant, I check in with her to make sure she's still on track. If it's a vacation where I am still here and I get a rush order, I will fire or ship or whatever a gallery needs. I know this is more about my mindset than the ways things have to be, but I believe a business's success is rooted in its customer service. In this very connected Internet age we expect immediate response and service and if we want to succeed, we give it too.I have procrastinated long enough: Time to Quickbook."},

And sometimes--take yesterday, for example--they are downright annoying!It's time to file my annual sales tax reports for Georgia and Illinois. It's not almost time, or they're coming up soon, or anything less dire. No. It's time. They are due the 20th of the month following the end of the reporting period (2007) or the first day that's not a postal holiday, if the 20th falls on a postal holiday. We have many things for which to be grateful to Martin Luther King. I, quite unfacetiously, am grateful to him today for one more day to get my accounting done.Yesterday I discovered that I had never installed Quickbooks on the laptop. Kind of hard to do your accounting these days with no accounting software. I dutifully found the cd, dusted it off and went to install. During the marvelous installation process I am given no options for which components I wish to install. (Oh and by the way, I am installing Quickbooks 2005 for Windows on the Parallels Windows installation on my Mac. I am forced, due to the reported bugginess of Quickbooks for Mac, to use my old Quickbooks for Windows. I hate Windows.)Usually if a software application has other third-party pieces bundled with it, it gives you the chance of installing, say, Internet Explorer 5, or Flash Player 7, or whatever. Not Quickbooks 2005. It tells you it's installing them, then it fails to install Flash Player 7 and quits. I dutifully try to manually install Flash Player 7 to get QB past its hump, but it's no longer available--support has been discontinued by Adobe (another favorite company...) and you have to install FP 9. No biggie, I think, QB just needs to see an instance of FP to continue the install... Let's ALL roll on the floor and laugh now.Fortunately the Internet is a mysterious and powerful device whose mystery is only exceeded by its power and I find a posting on some troubleshooting forum that points me to an old support article at Intuit, which in turn points me to a file on my cd that will install just the QB application and not all the other nonsense. I'm saved! Not so fast...Sadly there was one more piece of windows software necessary to complete the QB install--the .Net framework. I went to install it manually (from a download on the Microsoft site) and find out I need to download and install the Microsoft installer application in order to install the .Net framework, in order to install QB 2005. Gusty sigh. Oh hey, did I mention that in order to download the free installer application from Microsoft you have to first download an application from them that will check to make sure you're running an authentic copy of Windows. If you're not, nyah, nyah nuh boo boo. So I download and install the authentication software. I'm genuine (whew!). I download and install the installer app. I download and install the .Net framework. I FINALLY install QB 2005 and restore my data file to it. Then exhausted, I go drink heavily. (Actually I go eat steak and golden potatoes prepared by my wonderful spouse and drink Turley wine.)Today I will finally enter all the data form 2007 into Quickbooks so I can file and pay my annual sales tax.

As I scurry around trying to get everything done so I have nothing that must be done next week, I stumble across this post from mid-summer Stranded in the South (don't ask, it's too convoluted):\"As I scurried to ready myself for the BMAC in Philadelphia, I took a break to have lunch and catch up on my email. In my Inbox was the following from my mother:When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 glasses of wine...A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full.They agreed that it was.The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full.They agreed it was.The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous \"yes.\"The professor then produced two glasses of wine from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.Now,\" said the professor, as the laughter subsided, \"I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things; your family, your children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions; things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else; the small stuff.If you put the sand into the jar first , \" he continued, \"there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. Do one more run down the ski slope. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal. Take care of the golf balls first; the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.\" One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the wine represented.The professor smiled. \"I'm glad you asked.

My Montana genes must have kicked in (or my cosy sweater has), because I'm toasty!The big order is out on the studio porch for shipping, the supplies list is done and off to the publisher (and they have already put up their beautiful new website which lists my book prominently), and I finally allowed myself to open a box from Larry at Colour De Verre (I traded him a couple of signed copies of my book for a couple of molds). I had been holding off opening it until I got the big commitments off the to-do list because I knew all I'd want to do when I saw the molds would be to play with them. And I was right. I am dying to make the blossoms today! (The dragonfly paperweight project in the book was made with a Colour de Verre mold.) Sadly I have to be in the house waiting for the dishwasher repairman this afternoon. I'll be updating Quickbooks and doing other bookkeeping tasks to finish my week.Will I get the week off next week? It still remains to be seen. If I get all of my necessary work done and orders shipped, I'll take it. If not, I'll get a massage and a pedicure and be happy with them. Now I have an hour and a half to get today's big fuse load in (custom windows, dinnerware, the Enjoy bowl, and an order for the Art Institute--full, full, full)."},

If you don't, it's too late to do anything about it, I dropped it at the printer 10 minutes ago. Printing. Printing is an issue for everyone in the arts and crafts field. Many people I know choose to go with Modern Postcard, or Image Media, or some other on-line, gang run printing company. (Note: \"gang run\" in printing does not mean run by a gang. Instead, \"gang run printing describes a printing method in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common printing sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste. \")I am usually all about on-line servicing, but I have tried both of the previously-named companies in the past and not had good results. Yes, the pricing is attractive, but it is balanced by a lack of individual attention which for me in the past has meant that I end up getting something I am not happy with. I could pay more with the on-line company for a higher level of service, but I'd still end up with a faceless person over the phone (at best). Or I could pay more and deal face-to-face in person with someone in a local company who is looking at a proof of my card with me and addressing my concerns *personally*.Now that the card is done it's time to move on to the suppliers list (to the publisher *today*, absolutely, positively, no more delays!!!) and the class list. I have three places interested in having me teach classes for them, time to get something to teach put together. Oh yes, and firing, and labeling the boxes for tomorrow's big shipment, and gymnastics, and ballet. Oy. It must be Thursday.PS--It SNOWED here yesterday!"},

Today begins with a Kavarna morning (and all the goes with it--which today apparently includes NPR, slow Internet, and a stale chocolate croissant... *sigh*). Stacy (the Assistant) likes NPR. While I share the politics, I just never got into the whole public broadcasting thing. Give me some trash satellite radio any day. I just don't feel like having my awareness elevated at 9:03 am!!Yesterday's work ended at 11:30 pm with one last (re)slump load in Middle Ground. I do seder sets for the Jewish Museum of New York once a year (not surprisingly, a few months before Passover) and from year to year I forget the issues with them.This year I made the small plates a little too big, and I didn't get the first set slumped enough so I had to reslump them. I made the molds for them out of a piece of ceramic fiber board and they have a sharp drop from the rim to the bottom of the plate that takes both significantly longer and a higher temp than a regular slump does. Usually I slump at 1265 degrees for 15 minutes. To get these right, I do 1275 degrees for 45 minutes--and the cold spot in the front right of Middle Ground still keeps that spot from slumping as fully and I have to turn the piece and give it another jolt (after cooling it from the first slump, of course). So this year a bit of grinding followed by fire polishing, and a bit of reslumping and all of a sudden I am late to ship them. *Sigh*. They'll go out today.The big order will go out Friday (whoo hoo, Christmas is saved, shoes for everyone!) as will all the other current small orders. I am still on track for taking next week off--if I can get my postcard designed today, my supplies list to the publisher, my Quickbooks data entered from last February on, and a couple of class offerings to Ed Hoy's today. It sounds impossible, but I look at what I managed to accomplish yesterday and I have hope.The word on the new website is Joomla. There will be more words soon (a template has been picked and acquired).In addition to getting articles reviewed and ad copy in yesterday, I also applied to the Decatur Arts Festival. I had been diminishing my presence in the local art fair scene in the last couple of years, but I think I need to change my stance on those shows now that I have a big above-ground (windows make an incredible difference!) studio. After much mulling I think it would be a good idea to replace the One of a Kind Show in December with a four-day Studio Open House/Holiday Sale with some of my local artist/friends in the new studio in November. But my local retail mailing list is way out of date. To beef it up I need to do a few shows around the area during the year leading up to the show.Looking at what there is, it's too late to apply to the Dogwood Festival (and breakdown for that one is so hellish anyway). I need to figure out if I want to apply for the Marietta Art in the Park again. It was a good little show a couple of years ago and I had decent sales (and a good mailing list return). January, the month of the eyes-are-bigger-than-the-stomach syndrome (or in this case, the ambitions are greater than the energy). Time to throttle it back and get on to postcard design."},

Do you ever wake up and just know that today is going to be the day that you get everything done? I woke this morning at 6:30 and I just knew that I'd get the ad for the Glass Expo brochure in today, and I'd get my application for the Decatur Arts Festival in, I'd sign all the rest of the big order pieces so Stacy could box and ship them, I'd sign and ship all the book orders, I'd fuse a big window commission (or slump a big AI order--one or the other), and I 'd finally format and send the supplies list to the publisher. I would--will--do all that. And I'll raise hell with the pet insurance company for the way they handled Jester's claim, and I'll pick Jessie up from school at 1:00, and I'll wrangle the alarm company technician (again)... Was I dreaming? Did I become a superhero in my sleep? We'll see.I am finding that everything has a life cycle. It may not be the life cycle you expect going into whatever it is, but it has--independent of you and your expectations--a life cycle. When whatever it is is done you can look back and just know that however long it took was its actual life cycle. For example, you get an assignment on Friday and it's due the next Thursday so you think it has a one week life cycle, but you don't actually get it done till the following Tuesday so its real life cycle is 12 days.Clearly, the problems I am having with tasks, schedules, juggling, etc., can all be laid at the door of incorrect life cycle assessment. And today I just feel the end of the life cycles of many things has arrived. How does it all work out? I don't know. It's a mystery. Now off to design, apply, sign, organize, wrangle and ship. Oh yeah, and fire too. This is a glass studio, after all."},

I got the beat alright, I finally got my iTunes libraries synced between the desktop and the laptop and I cleaned off over 10 gigs of space on the laptop as a result. I should just move all my music off the laptop and carry my iPod with me everywhere (plugging it into the laptop in the morning while I post). The problem for me is that I just hate to have things dangling off my laptop--be they external drives, iPods, whatever. I want a bigger hard drive. THAT would make me happy. Now I have room to install the Adobe C3 Studio software for the latest Dreamweaver, Flash, PhotoShop, Illustrator, etc. Of course it still remains to be seen whether I need all those applications now that I am going to a kinder, gentler content-management based web site.Now for glass. It's a big week in the studio this week as I gear up for the BMAC with its concomitant annual advertising requirements (postcard design, ugh), and get all the current orders finished up and shipped out. Oh yes, and copies of the book! My publisher sent me some complimentary copies of the book that I had earmarked to send my family at Christmas. Have I mailed them? Of course not! Since I haven't written my Christmas cards yet, it's not too surprising I haven't mailed off the books either. Today, today (at least for book mailing). (Maybe I'll send Valentine cards this year instead of Christmas cards.)Also today is a conference call (via Skype) with Christian the website guru. The current plan is to have at least the rudiments of the new Siyeh Studio content management system up before the BMAC... Four weeks from today I leave for the BMAC. So much to do, so little time. Off to dress and brush the fur off the teeth in prep for the day."},
{"title": "The Zen of Blogging", "date": "Saturday, January 12, 2008", "text": "No coffee (it's only 6:00 AM on Saturday and I have hopes to get back to sleep after posting), the sound of the Spaniel chewing a rawhide bone for music. I press my palms together and bow to the four corners of the world. Rituals provide the foundation of our daily lives. They ground, center, and calm us as we forge our way through the chaos surrounding us everyday. Change is anti-ritual. In general, we humans don't like change. The act of writing this blog every morning is my primary daily ritual. When I don't do it, I get anxious--of course lots of things make me anxious so this state is neither unknown nor unexpected in any given day. Take yesterday for example: I didn't have time to blog because I had my assistant here most of the day and I was on the phone for three straight hours being interviewed for a studio profile in the summer issue of Profitable Glass. I missed blogging--not like I missed a bus, but like there was a big, gaping hole in my day. I woke at O Dark Thirty this morning and lay anxious and squirrel-caging until I finally decided to get up and center myself with a post. Blogging, my version of yoga.It is the beginning of January, almost the middle of January actually, and there are a million pesky little things to do in the studio. I find myself picking one up for 10-15 minutes then being distracted by another which I then pick up, discarding the first still unfinished. I am not at my efficient best right now. I blame not taking time off in December like I promised myself I would do. Now myself is sullen and rebelling, but I think I have found the answer: I am going to try to take off the week of January 25. Whoa, radical. Time off two weeks before the BMAC. My work time is measured right now in countdowns to the Buyer's Market (the emails the Rosen Group sends out every week to prepare us for the show), how can I even *think* of taking time off? Simple: If I don't take time off to recharge, the results could be catastrophic. I harken back to my experience at the BMAC last year starting with the first day out, the drive there, day 1, day 3 and the final review. If I had had more emotional, physical, spiritual margin, I would have been better equipped to deal with the inevitable adversities of doing an extremely large show show in the wintry north.Yesterday Stacy and I did an inventory of all my finished work and I may have enough left from the One of a Kind Show in December that I only have a few pieces to make for the BMAC. Huzzah! I do want to try out some new colorways incorporating opal glass, but there are few enough of them that I can squeeze them in with my current pre-show orders and commissions.And now back to sleep for an hour or two before a full day in the studio. Got to work today if I want to take time off in a week... (does that even make sense?!?)"},
{"title": "Still Alive", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2008", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug (fitting as I have had a software-full couple of days and Austin is also known as Silicon Hills), the credits song from the XBox game 'Portal' on iTunes. Yep, that's right, on *iTunes*. One of my recent little software acquisitions is a shareware program called Tubesock that takes any YouTube video and translates it into either an MP4 movie or MP3 audio for the iPod. I can now watch the cowboys skate whenever I want, and I can listen to this greatest-of-all videogame songs *whenever I want*. Yeah, the sound quality could be better, but the tech is just so cool! (If you click on the play button below, wait a few seconds--the beginning of the video is silent).Why is a glass artist nattering on about computer software? It's time for the annual laptop purge. I have 33 gigs of music on the laptop and a not-much-smaller amount of pictures. It's full. I need to move everything over to the main desktop and back it all up. But that means organizing it all uniformly so I can tell if I need to move it or not. So as I was looking for tools to streamline the process (new stuff comes out every year, some year I'll be lucky and what I really need will be available) I stumbled on a couple of very cool Mac widgets. The first, Audiobook Builder, takes audiobooks from either files, iTunes, or cd's and converts them to a much smaller, audiobook file for iTunes that has bookmarks (so you can listen for awhile, go listen to something else and come back to the same place in the book--trust me, this is a necessary when you listen to books on your iPod). The last is MultiTunes which is supposed to let me switch between all my iTunes libraries from within iTunes... I haven't made it work yet. We'll see (I'll pay for it if I can make it work--I downloaded SyncOTunes yesterday and it didn't do what I needed it to do so I deleted it and did not pay--I love try-before-you-buy shareware!).Now for the glass artist/business news. Besides putzing around with software videos, music, etc., Stacy and I wrangled the storage and shipping options to the ground and hog-tied them. Self-storage is not a viable option. Between the lack of drive-up and 24-hour access at many of them, the cost of renting the panel van to move the stored items to them, and the cost of the units themselves, they are not a good solution for the professional arts/crafts business. A far better--though still expensive--option  is All American Convention Services. They do not have a website (so I never would have found them on my own), but Champion, the exposition services company for the American Craft Retailers Expo, gave me their name and phone number.When all is said and done it's going to cost me about $700 per year to store my booth and materials there (the parts of it I can leave there--I still need to figure out what to do about my pedestals and lights--I can't afford multiple sets). That sounds like a lot, but it pales in comparison to the cost of shipping to and from--shipping which also has the possibilities of loss, breakage and arrival delays. Making a living as an artist/craftsperson gets more expensive as you move into the bigger venues. The more big shows you do the more you spend on booth fees and services, shipping and marketing. And to succeed, you had better be sure your pricing covers it all.Better quit messing around with fun software and get to my Quickbooks. It's time to find out if all the expenses I incurred last year were balanced by revenue. Keep your fingers crossed."},

It is January after all, and I can't keep having upbeat posts that scare Bill. I think I'm mentally a couple of weeks behind of where the calendar is--probably because I fired daily all the way through Christmas and New Year's. Right now I feel reflective, nostalgic, wistful, content, slow and at peace--all at the same time. It was 54 degrees F this morning when I took Jessie to school. The morning is grey-blue and moist (it rained last night--again... what's this drought thing I keep hearing about?), and the squirrels are all busy chewing through our front porch screens (to get to the pond for water), and rooting around in my flower pots for tender shoots or forgotten nuts (crash! crash!). Winter in the south. Forsythia and some camellias in bloom. Taking J through the heavily tree-lined streets to the forested campus of the Waldorf School I can almost pretend I'm in Montana... except for the lack of snow and cold.But this is not the time of year to to be contemplative! This is the time for forceful action and confident planning. It is time to forge into the marketing stream and grab all those fat gallery fish in my bare hands.... *sigh* I sit and diddle my feet in the water and ponder the colors of the scales of the fish swimming past. Maybe new tech will perk me up. I got a 7-port hub yesterday so I can hook up my scanner and back-up drives again. I have slides from Bart of recent work still unscanned, and I have all the images of my work to organize on a big drive (and back-up) preparatory to creating the new website and digital catalog. Ah, now that's better! Concrete, unachievable  planning always makes me feel good.Did you ever read Martha Stewart Living? The front of each issue had Martha's calendar of everything she had going for that month on the day it was scheduled (and all tasks were only allocated one day--HOW DID SHE DO THAT?!?): winterize the ponds, clean the rust off the metal garden furniture and repaint, stake the roses, fertilize the orchids, prune the fruit trees, disembowel the hedgehogs... I feel a bit like that right now--not the hedgehog-disemboweling part. I feel like I need to create a calendar of annual tasks and then I need to weave all the one-offs into it. Every year I need to create new marketing materials and revisit pricing in January--before the BMAC in February. I need to factor in the cost increases from my suppliers and shippers and my own inflationary needs. I also need to review the state of my materials inventory and tools and order new pieces as appropriate--I already know I need new diamond hand pads and lap wheels.This year for one-off tasks I need to finish painting, moving and setting up the studio. Still ahead are acquiring the new big kiln, a shed, and a water recycling system for the lap grinder--and putting together a financial plan to pay for all of them. Time to get my feet out of the water and start grabbing fish or it's never going to happen. Two fish (orders) came in yesterday. I am going to turn them into 5000--or maybe 500."},

Oh the check marks are flying onto the list as the tasks fly off!So it's early January, must be time to put together a marketing strategy (including a postcard mailing) for the BMAC. Last week I got an email from the Rosen Group, Countdown to the Buyer's Market #5. They send out prep/pep emails once a week for the several weeks leading up to the show. Usually I skim them (Bad businessperson! Sit! Stay!), but this one I read and I was really impressed and motivated by the marketing suggestions contained in it. After several days of mulling it over I am still so impressed that I called them this morning and got permission to reprint the meat of the email in my post today.Measuring Your Success at the Buyers Market“How was your show?”It’s a question you’ll be asked repeatedly… by fellow exhibitors, by visiting artists, by your exhibits manager, even friends and family. What will your answer be?Setting goals & objectivesAbout six weeks before the show (now!), take some time to WRITE DOWN some specific goals and objectives for the show. They should be realistic and attainable. You should, of course, include your total sales goal, but think beyond the bottom line. Tradeshows are much more than an order-taking opportunity… they are a venue for developing and maintaining personal relationships with current and potential customers.Some sample goals & objectives:Collect contact information/business cards from 25 new buyersMake personal contact with one member of the mediaBring 80% of last year’s buyers back to the boothAdd three new buyers from the west coastSchedule social visits outside of show hours with two top buyersDistribute 50 catalogs to qualified leadsMeeting your goals & objectivesYou can’t just sit in your booth, keeping your fingers crossed that you’ll meet your show goals. After you put your goals on paper, write down at least one specific step you can take before or at the show to meet that goal:Collect contact information/business cards from 25 new buyersIf you missed out on the show’s co-op mailing program, you can still reach new buyers. A little bit of internet research will provide you with the store names and addresses of retailers across the country. Give a handful of them a call, or send out your own postcards. Also, don’t discount networking opportunities at the show. Attend retailer breakfast seminars, the NICHE Awards and the show party and INTRODUCE YOURSELF to buyers. Exchange business cards. Not all business is conducted on the show floor.Make personal contact with one member of the mediaSend out pre-show press releases to targeted trade media (“Sue Smith Debuts New Ceramic Work at Buyers Market in February”). Put press kits in the Press Office in Room 304. Watch for black badges on the show floor and introduce yourself to members of the media.Bring 80% of last year’s buyers back to the boothSend a letter or handwritten invitation to last year’s buyers providing them with incentive to visit your booth (all returning buyers who write an order at February’s show will be entered into a drawing to win a free iPod). You should CALL all of your previous year’s buyers to see if they’d like to schedule an appointment in your booth.Add three buyers from the west coastDevelop a special sales plan for specific buyers. When a buyer enters your booth, pay attention to the store location listed on their badge. If they are in your target area, engage them in conversation about your work and your hopes to increase your presence in their region. Offer a special incentive to them to write an order (free shipping, etc.).Schedule social visits outside of show hours with two top buyers.Call your top buyers next week. Invite one to dinner on Friday night, and one to breakfast before the show opens on Monday. Build your relationships. Find out what they need.Distribute 50 catalogs to qualified leadsDon’t just hand out your sales materials like candy. Learn at least one qualifying piece of information about a buyer and get their business card before giving away any sales materials. Give catalogs only to buyers who you feel legitimately could turn into potential customers. Have postcards or other less expensive handouts available for buyers who may not be a good match for you.Now, how was your show? By setting specific and MEASURABLE goals, and taking action to meet those goals, you will be able to most effectively determine whether or not you had a good show. Remember, your show experience is about more than the number of orders you write on site; it’s a valuable opportunity to take steps that will help your business flourish over time.-------------------Thanks, Christine, for a very well-written piece.

I've often wondered what one's supposed to do with one's ducks once one gets them all in a row. Is it supposed to be easier to shoot them then, or am I just too much of a hunter's child?I have the penultimate kiln load of rectangular platters ready to hop into Bertha when she is a little cooler, and I *have* sent the suppliers list to Stacy so she can format it. All in all, not a bad day's work. I still search for the cheapest, easiest way to get the Siyeh Studio/Elliott Metal Works boothes to the BMAC in Philadelphia in February and then on to ACRE in Las Vegas in May and then back to the summer BMAC in Philadelphia in August--whether cheapest and easiest equals shipping all the time or having two display set-ups and storing one on each coast has yet to be determined.

But for fun (and to read back over next new years) I am going to list the big projects on tap for Siyeh Studio in 2008:Develop and maintain a coherent web presence that combines Siyeh Studio, Glass Incarnate the blog, Glass Incarnate the professional site, and FeSiO all in one placeWork out a photo management system and set up a permanent photo area in the studio so all new work makes it right up to the websiteFinish the physical remodeling and improvement on the new studio (painting, shipping area, mudroom, gallery, etc.)Simplify show display shipping and storage between Vegas and PhillieSet up a bookkeeping system that I can update easily throughout the year so I don't have 11 months of expenses and reconciling to do the first of JanuaryAdd Big Bettina to the kiln familyCreate and send quarterly mailings to galleriesDevelop and maintain a catalog on cd with all the Siyeh Studio and Fesio workI could go on, but I am already beginning to scare myself. Now off to the studio!"},

Is eggnog good in coffee? I'm afraid to try it to find out. I am the parent of a six year-old teenager. Yesterday she deigned to rise at 10:00, who knows when she'll grace me with her presence this morning (afternoon?). So it's Saturday and I am posting, what can I say? It's been a topsy-turvy week. Dave is already at work, and I will spend at least a couple of hours in the studio today. And where have I been the rest of the week? I took Thursday and Friday OFF. Oh, I still fired three loads in two days, but the big loads were just slumps of the long rectangular platters and I only spent about 45 minutes a day in the studio to do them. I took a much-needed well-deserved rest and READ A BOOK. Today I finish the last of the cutting and I fire a fuse load, crack that whip.I think I'll also put the shipping room (which holds all the finished work) back together. It's still upside down from my trip to Chicago. The rest of the glass work I have looming will be done on the computer. Website, finances, logistics for upcoming shows (hotels, shipping choices, storage options, etc.), class offerings for the coming year, the suppliers list and actual supplies list for the book, and a column on start-up costs and considerations for Profitable Glass are all due in the short to mid time frame. If I'm really good, next week I'll finish painting the studio.The J has awoken and nestles next to me on the arm of my comfy chair, jostling my elbow (and lecturing me about the size of germs--\"They're not invisible, they're just so small you can't see them\"--after having sneezed on my gingerbread). She squiggles so much it's hard to write or concentrate, it's time to get on with the day. Later I'll try to write a review of last year and a plan for next. Some call it resolutions. I call it a call to battle and a girding of the loins."},

I'm back in the no-days-off-till groove again. This time it's for the gift order of 114 long rectangular platters due January 10. Oh man is this mix HAPPY! \"Bongo Bong/Je Ne T'aime\" by Robbie Williams now playing on iTunes. If it doesn't spice me up for a full-throttle day, nothing will. (Thanks Ren!)It's Boxing Day. I wish we were celebrating in the time-honored fashion (laying around drinking, eating, and watching the telly). But I sent Dave off to work today sporting his new CinnaBoost (shown here attached to the backpack with carabiner and the saga of the creation of which is narrated in today's Stranded in the South). The hanging jump ring sets mine apart from all the other Minty and CinnaBoosts: Dave asked if there was a way I could make it a hanging tool for his backpack, and a hammer, two sizes of nails, a keyring and a couple of pairs of pliers later...Already today I have fired two orders in one kiln load and ordered some frit from Hoy's as I discovered over the weekend that I don't have enough of the sky blue transparent for the big gift order.

At least I have finished the audiobook that wasn't in audiobook format so wouldn't mark where you stopped and restart from there (oy) on the iPod so I can use it again. As I write my post, J is working on the last of the Christmas presents she is making. I have to get them in the mail today to Illinois. My UPS driver told me yesterday that he thought Monday was a holiday for them, which gave me quite a scare. Luckily for me, he was WRONG.This morning Stacy comes and brings her daughter Grace--I have the apex of a flexible, real-life, productive, powerful and fun business here. Stacy and I will work, Grace and Jessie will play. No corporate office with a dress code, rigid hours, and no children allowed for us. Which is not to say there won't be work--I fired 17 pieces yesterday of which two need to be slumped today to ship Monday. Today, another 20-21. I am experimenting with incorporating opal frit into my Morceaux de Verre style. I am trying for something more substantial in color weight without sacrificing the depth of the transparent glass. I also have the \"Enjoy\" bowl commission to spur me on. The first effort was not as vibrant as I'd hoped. The opals--even with a lot of clear large frit included--were just too flat feeling.In addition to glass (and another playdate for Jessie this afternoon with one of her Waldorf classmates--next I'll put on pearls and a lace apron, bake cookies, and cement my role as June Cleaver) I have a Christmas gift to... assemble, another one to *start* knitting, and some home electrical work and plumbing to do (one fried dimmer, one dimmer to put back, one major leaky faucet to repair and two occasionally leaky faucets to give the fish-eye... I may just buy a laundry tub when I'm at Home Depot getting the dimmer and hire the plumber to take care of all the water work--I know that's the solution Dave would like best!).Christian has begun the work on the websites and I think I'm just going to bite the bullet and do it all the way I want instead of cobbling and making due. Blog, group list, catalog, everything all incorporated into the site as appropriate and all the sites seamlessly in one place for management. Wish us luck.J is calling for breakfast, actually, no she's not--she got the cream cheese out of the fridge, the bagel and the knife and she's making her own breakfast. I love having an autonomous child! Just six years old and self-sufficient! Next she'll be driving herself to school. Oh wait, she can't reach the pedals. Oh well, in a few years. Now off to glass."},

I really hate it when my regular driver, Al, is either on vacation or supplemented by holiday help. The Next Day Air package I scheduled to go out yesterday to Seattle did not get picked up. In spite of repeated calls to USP customer service, repeated assurances on their part that it would get picked up, and the driver entering into the on-line system that it HAD been picked up, it was still sitting on the porch at 6:30 this morning. LALALALA, It's beginning to look a lot like disembowelment, uh, I mean CHRISTMAS. \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" (covered by Bing Crosby) is on the iPod. I particularly like the line \"And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again...\". It's nice to see some things never change.Today for J is the first day of Christmas vacation. Today for me is the first day of cutting and firing the 114-platter order. For Dave it is just another day in the run-up-to-the-Primaries hell (his team is working on rewriting CNN's election software and the move-up of the democratic primary dates has really boogered things up--everyone wants to be first, and, really, Iowa  and New Hampshire deciding the candidates?). We still haven't even put up the rest of the Christmas decorations (outdoor garland and lights, lights on the piano, decorated J's tree... oh I am a bad Mom!). At least the presents are bought and (mostly) shipped.But glass, glass, glass. This morning--and every morning except Christmas--for the next couple of weeks in the studio. This afternoon--and for many afternoons over the next two weeks until she goes back to school--a playdate at our house for one of J's school chums. During the playdate I will be at home instead of in the studio, and I will be working on end-of-the-year finances, class offerings, a supplier's list, marketing plans, and websites. The days are full.But first, a quick run to the post office to pick up a package. Stay safe, stay warm, stay happy!"},

Today I am going to finish listening to it--and cleaning up a bunch of loose paperwork ends. But first I am going to receive and unload a delivery of glass from Bullseye and begin the cutting on the first load of platters for the gift order (114 Pacifica long rectangular platters... whoo hoo!).As nice as all the little to-do items are, I have been thinking a lot lately about posting and the purpose of this blog. I write every morning as I'm getting organized for the day, and my postings reflect this action of mental organization. Boring. By mid afternoon I usually think of something that would be really interesting and pertinent--at least for other glass people--and that I culd write much much more eloquently. But I don't write in the afternoon so my postings consist of organization in the morning, and we're back to boring. I think I'm going to experiment over the next few days with alternating posting times to see if I can write the more interesting things I'm thinking about instead of the stream-of-consciousness organization that is my every morning.Now off to fire.

Two days have passed since my return from Chicago and I am finally slipping back into the groove. I fused a couple of pieces in Middle Ground yesterday and will slump them today. Today I will also fuse two Cosmos lattice panels--the last of my show orders and do a little experimenting with an opal bowl in frit. I return to opals from time to time to see if I can work out a series like Morceaux de Verre that is predominantly opaque glass. The timing of today's experiment is driven by a commission I got yesterday as a follow-up to the One of a Kind Show. A man wants a gift for a friend in the colors of the Red Rock Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Pumpkin, paprika, and pea, with a dash of gray, white and black. The closest matches I have for the colors are opals so I'm off to blend and play again.Stacy is coming to the studio today too, and I want to plan the next steps for finishing it up (painting, furnishing, etc.) and spring marketing with her. All this needs to happen before 1:00 as I pick J up then and we are going to make little Christmas ornaments before she goes to Fun Friday. While I am not taking official vacation time over the next couple of weeks, I am planning to work less. My glass order from Bullseye comes next Wednesday, and Thursday I need to begin firing every day to get the corporate gift pieces done for January. I hope to be able to do the kiln loads first thing every morning so I can spend the rest of the days with the J while she is on winter break. And I will take off Christmas Day completely.Oh yes, and in the next couple of days I need to knit J a pair of fuzzy slippers for school. She has a pair of fuzzy store-bought slippers, but she doesn't like them and so wears the \"borrowing slippers\" from school everyday--they're a much-worn, much-loved pair of big-yarn knit slippers. That'll give me three active projects on the needles--Dave's sweater (from several years ago) J's coat and now socks. Hands gotta be busy!"},
{"title": "Alone Again", "date": "Thursday, December 13, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Denver skyline mug, \"Blue Christmas\" covered by Dean Martin on iTunes. It was a random selection, but I am nonetheless a bit sad today. Yesterday was supposed to be a tri-generational crafting, bonding, relaxing day with the women of the family. And it almost was. I started the morning by beginning the Christmas shopping on-line. Jessie and Mom got a leisurely start on the day and then Mom went to print out her boarding pass for today, but she couldn't because *her flight had already left*. And the day went to hell in a handbasket after that.How did we *both* have the wrong departure day? We were both so sure she was leaving today. My Dad had already left Polson for Missoula to pick her up so I couldn't reach him to let him know she had missed her plane (cell phone? don't make me laugh). The Missoula County Airport at Johnson Bell Field in Missoula Montana does not have a paging system. It has very nice people from the luggage handlers to the counter staff to the airport police--and I talked to many of them in an effort to get a message to my very hard-of-hearing-almost-80-year-old Dad. Northwest found Mom a place on a Delta flight connecting with Alaska Airlines through Seattle and we got her to the airport and checked in for a 4:45 pm flight.About two hours after Mom's original flight arrived in Missoula I got a collect call from the airport--which didn't come through (\"Yes I'll accept the charges. Hello? Hello? Dad?\".... silence)--but with three more phone attempts on their part and mine I *finally* got connected to my Dad and passed him the message to get a motel room for the night and to pick Mom up at 11:00 pm when she arrived in Missoula (neither of them can see well enough to drive the mountain roads at night).It was an exciting, stressful day, and not recommended. Now I am alone listening to Christmas carols and posting. This afternoon sees the last day of gymnastics and ballet until after the new year, and late this morning I'm going to see about heading to Olympic to check out their big kiln. I am more and more dubious that I will be able to make it fit, but I owe them a look see.next week and I'll begin on the Big Order. And seeing as it's December, I need to start  all of my expenses from 2007 in Other than that, I am tying up loose ends and last orders. My glass should be in from BullseyeenteringQuickbooks... Oh I hate that job. If I had been better about doing it all year it would be... easier. Now I don't think I  even can get all my PayPal transactions downloaded--I don't think they maintain a long enough transaction history. *sigh*  *sigh* *sigh*."},

Got the van unloaded yesterday and everything mostly stowed. It's a bit dismaying to realize that with all the space in the new studio there's still nowhere to put the show supplies (tents, pipe and drape poles, walls, shelving, lights, stands, etc.). As I was walking across the yard I thought about putting in another shed--this time there instead of in our backyard. Oy.Yesterday was a studio-thinking day in other ways too. I had a conversation with the head of business development for our neighborhood association and Thursday evening I am going over to meet briefly with him, his wife, and a couple of newly-arrived-in-our-community lawyers who are also interested in developing the small businesses here. Unlike many neighborhoods, ours is a diverse and complicated little inner-city hood that consists of more than manicured lawns and two-car garages--in fact I'm not sure we have any manicured lawns and two-car garages. So the concerns of the association and its mandate also differ from the typical neighborhood/homeowner associations. We have businesses in our neighborhood--all around the new studio as a matter of fact--and helping direct what kind and how they grow is the provenance of the neighborhood association. I will need to get the studio property rezoned if I want to formally operate a gallery and teaching studio there, and meeting with the neighborhood association is the starting point for that long road.Yesterday I also measured the kiln room for Bettina and there is no way the Olympic kiln with the measurements given is going to be doable. Yes, it would fit in the room, but there would only be a 1-1.5 foot walkway between her and Bertha. I am going to see about going out to Olympic tomorrow and looking at her in person to see if there is any way to adjust the width.Today, however, is a Day Off (more or less). I do need to fuse a couple of pieces for orders that I need to ship this week from the One of a Kind Show and a gallery, but other than that I am spending the day with my mom and my daughter. Mom goes back home to Montana tomorrow so Jessie stayed home from school today to spend some time with her. We are going to make little Christmas ornaments for packages, decorate Jessie's tree (a little live Virginia pine that I am going to plant in the backyard in the spring), hunt for acorn caps for the little dolls I am going to try to make, and just hang together.It's going to be 72 degrees here today and \"White Christmas\" covered by Rosemary Clooney is on iTunes... my live is just chock full of dichotomies."},

Home is where the heart is and my heart being with Dave and Jessie, my home is in Atlanta. Damn glad it's not Arkansas. Neither this five year-old, nor his grandfather nor his father should be at all proud that he killed a 445 lb bear. From a blind in a tree with a rifle for no purpose other than sport--and because they had a tag... I'm from a hunting family and I'm ashamed of and for them. But this story is not going to sidetrack me from my morning or my post!\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\" covered by Sarah McLachlan is now on iTunes. That's better.Got home and (mostly) beat the ice. The load out was about an hour and a half yesterday--longer than in previous years, but it didn't stop us from making it through the beginnings of the ice and freeze in Indiana and on home. We had everything packed up and ready to go by 9:30 on Sunday, then went back to the room for a bottle of red (one less bottle to pack!) and room service sandwiches before crashing. Crashing hard but not for nearly as long as either of us would have liked. Poor Mom got a cold not too long after our arrival in Chicago but carried on like a trooper nonetheless.So how was the show? It was Okay. I did a brief, informal survey of other artists at after the end on Friday and the unanimous response to the question, \"How was your show?\" was \"Okay.\" As was the case last year there were artists--a lot more then there should have been--who didn't even make expenses. I hope the show provides them some other value than immediate income--exposure, recognition, credentials, future income... something. The ones that I saw who looked busy throughout and who had a product that I thought would do well were the ones who said \"Okay\". Even the gourmet food vendors said \"Okay\". Money is tight for everyone, and shows are just tough right now. I'm glad I got the first of the corporate-gift orders to provide me with a decent income for January as I wouldn't have it otherwise.I had the same sales as last year just about to the penny, but my expenses were a lot higher--$1,000 in hotel, $4,300+ in booth and then there's gas, parking, and meals. Of course it's not over till way after it's over, and I still might still get a couple of big orders. But this time my response to the show is really not about the money--it was only okay because I was too tired from all the work I had to do to prepare for it (and move the studio) and missing my family too much to get into the spirit of it. I grumbled and groused my way through the week and was a general sour puss (internally, if not obviously).It was good to see old customers and friends. It was good to get to talk about my work with people who had never seen it before, it was great to sign the book, demo a piece and watch people frantically taking down everything I said as I did... but I was (am)... tired. At the end of the show one of the staff came around to ask me if I was planning to do it again next year and I said I'd have to think about it. If I had had to make up my mind right then I'd have said no. But Dave made me promise not to make any decisions there, to wait till I'm rested and not so... broken... anymore.So now I rest and mend. And soon I paint (the rest of the studio) while I wait for my next glass order from Bullseye to get in next week. Oh yes, and I do Christmas crafts with my daughter, and I make, buy and wrap presents. I might even post on Stranded in the South. I'll still be on Glass Incarnate for the rest of the year, I just won't BE glass incarnate for awhile."},

Lat year the pack-up took us till 10:00...Yesterday afternoon I did a little kiln-forming demonstration in front of the demo stage and thanks to Christian, I have photos! Yesterday was all about the schmooz. I sold a modest number of small pieces and one or two medium and big pieces, but the big talk was The Book. I had several people come in to tell me how much they liked it--one of them the owner of a a store selling supplies and materials for stained and kiln-formed glass. She said several people have told her what a great book it is, and I got a warm fuzzy glow. She also asked if I teach classes... I need to get that class list made up!Dinner last night was sushi with old friends/customers who came down from Wisconsin to do the show. I gave them free passes to it a couple of years ago and now they are regulars who break their piggy bank on beautiful art and craft annually. On a happy-I-am-not-staying-out-in-the-suburbs note, we left the restaurant last night in the freezing rain. Freezing rain that had coated the sidewalks and was encroaching on the streets. The walk back to the hotel was treacherous enough--I can't imagine what it would have been like to have to drive somewhere (and to have to drive back in this morning...).Yesterday was the birthday of my neighbor across the aisle, Royal. We're southerners together, he's from Birmingham. (Did I just say I'm a southerner... whoa.) It was also Jeff's wife Jessie's birthday.

But I am not having a good day selling my work. Today is the day of the Christmas gift shopper, and not for BIG pieces. Can you say \"sushi plate\"? Good thing I brought a lot of sushi plates. I need to go raise my blood sugar--lack of food is making me cranky.The day started with a bang--I was asked if I had a big piece to put in the fine art gallery area to replace a piece that sold yesterday. Said piece--Cosmos in Love--is strategically placed at the entrance to the gallery in front of James the bartender (Hi James!). I will be visiting James the bartender later today... Hopefully after selling many more large pieces and no more \"Would you take price - 30% for it?\" questions.I have a presentation on making sheet mica and fusing it into glass on the demonstration stage at 4:30 so I had better run.

It was nine hours and the people around me who weren't selling gourmet food didn't selling anything. I had a few small pieces go, but not enough to make the rent. Fingers crossed today will be a MUCH better day.On the plus side, it was slow enough that I got to chat with old friends and make a couple of great trades--content-management-based web service set-up for FeSiO and Siyeh Studio from Christian, and a psaltry (with music, a tuner and some harp music cd's) for Jessie for Christmas from Jeff.  Heck, I gotta get that wine in the car somehow. If I can't sell the big pieces I'll at least trade them for something smaller!On the minus side, I would rather be home with Seraph the red-antlered reindeer and the rest of my family. This may well be the last year I do this show. The winter travel can be very dodgy, it takes place at a time of the year I would like to be preparing for Christmas, Love and Good Cheer with my family and friends, and so far the sales just don't warrant the effort. Okay, that's enough negativity loosed into the world.In spite of the slow sales, we had a fun night last night. Got out of the show about 9:30 and jostled in the snow for a cab. You might wonder why we needed a cab when we're staying across the street, but the answer should be obvious: The Quest for the Harold's Chicken Holy Grail (Harold IS the Chicken King). We took the cab to north Milwaukee arriving just in time to get our order before they closed. I could have placed my order over the Internet and paid with PayPal, but that just would have been wrong. I called it in.When we were so late picking it up they called me on my cellphone to see where we were and to let me know they were closing in 15 minutes. Is that great service or what? Back in the room with our Harold's feast (tell me why I ordered *four* six-wing dinners again?) smothered in Hot AND Barbecue sauces, we opened a bottle of wine club red (if I can't fit it in the car to get it home, I can at least drink it!) and watched (chose and paid for, even) Evan Almighty on the t.v.

We were out by 8:00 last night.) and not able to get back on the floor to fiddle until 11:00 this morning--an hour before opening. I'm sure I'll manage to fill the time with some kind of putzing.I did not get the order for 400 pieces yesterday afternoon. The male client decided to go with electronics as the gift instead. The woman wanted art, the man wanted tech toys. Go figure. As a result, I can get the 114 pieces I did get an order for done in Big Bertha so I am putting the decision on the new kiln on hold, again. There are strong pros and some cons to both options and I am just not comfortable making such a big decision while on the road and unable to measure the space for the seventeenth time and not having even seen one of the options.The One of a Kind Show begins today. I am wondering if it is a reflection of the tough economy in the arts and crafts market that I am seeing more artists from the Buyer's Market doing this show than ever before (the Buyer's Market is a wholesale show where artists sell directly to galleries and the One of a Kind Show is retail). Or maybe it's just that everyone has heard what a good show it is and wants to jump on the bandwagon. I have my hopes that it will be a good show, but I admit to being more nervous about it than I have been in years past. Part of my nervousness is due to the enormous quantity of work that I have that I don't want to schlep back to Atlanta with me! Got to have room in the van for all that wine...Now it's time to make the price labels and send an invitation email to everyone I can think of with free passes for the show. In case you are reading this post and don't get email from me, here's a link to the on-line free pass. Drop by if you're in the neighborhood! Pictures tomorrow."},
{"title": "Snow!", "date": "Wednesday, December 05, 2007", "text": "No coffee, the hum of the heater as music. Last day of set-up before the show will begin with a run to the hardware store and Starbucks. Too much Greek food and wine last night at a lovely dinner with my in-laws at the Greek Islands Restaurant. It's a favorite. Dave and I celebrated our engagement there with Bill, Bridget, and a horde of other friends--Stuart and Andrea met at that dinner. Nostalgia wafts. After dinner, in the gently falling snow, my in-laws transferred a ton of wine and 100 of my books--both that I had had shipped to them--to my mini-van and Mom and I brought them back to the hotel. I had better sell a whole lotta stuff or I'm not going to have room in the car to get everything back to Atlanta!Snow. I am so woefully unprepared. I have my wool overcoat, a remnant from the days when I lived here, and the thick leather and wool gloves that live in its pockets. And I brought two pairs, flat and heeled, of stylish leather boots. But I didn't bring *snow* boots and this morning we need to run to Ace Hardware (there's a huge one just down the street--takes up about a whole city block, all underground)... in the snow. And today, being set-up, I need to wear my lime green Crocs. Crocs in the snow. Oy.Dan the carpenter took up the kiln room floor yesterday and reinforced it for the new kiln. The Olympic kiln that I am looking at (GF15E) is side and top firing with independent controls for all the elements. She is substantially heavier than Bertha, and needs 68\"-74\" clearance from the wall--tight for a room that already holds Big Bertha. She's also only 60\" long, but she's 12\" deep (Bertha is only 9\" deep) and she's kiln brick with a solid lid so she can be fired to 1700 degrees F--helpful for doing melts. It's my recollection that Bertha is only supposed to be fired to 1600 degrees--and I know her front buckles in at really high temps (I love her anyway). Timing for the Olympic is good--I can have her next week on my return from Chicago--and she's a local girl so I can probably get Thomas the tow truck guy to pick her up and deliver her for me.The Denver kiln I am looking at is Big Bertha's twin (just like this one but 72\" long instead of 60\"). She's lighter, and a known quantity--fiber blanket sides, ceramic board lid, top-firing only--but she can't be here for 4-6 weeks. Delivery will also be an issue as she's too big for a lift gate and I don't have a loading dock. Price and electrical requirements are the same for both... Oh the kiln room will be really crowded if I get the Olympic! On the other hand, it will be well-nigh impossible to do the big corporate gift order if I don't as I did get the \"little\", initial corporate gift order for 114 due by mid-January (Christmas is saved! Shoes for everyone!).Now it's time to get my Bullseye order put together with numbers both including and not the big order. I find out at 5:40 PM today about the big order. Keep your fingers crossed for me. Then it's Off to the Show! The last time a pre-show was this fraught for me was the Buyer's Market in February 2006 when I was negotiating my book contract. Yee, yee, yee."},

Left Atlanta almost exactly 12 hours ago. Yep, do the math; finally got on the road at 5:45 PM. Made it as far as Elizabethtown and crashed--no, not the car, just the bodies--at the Hampton Inn. Hope to arrive in Chicago about noonish.Let me explain the trials of yesterday, no, there's not enough time--leaving in five--so let me sum up: For the first time I couldn't fit everything into the minivan. In supreme overconfidence I canceled the Econoline on Sunday, sure I would be okay. he new plastic shelving we bought at Home Depot on Saturday was the casualty--it got replaced with a couple of small tables that are probably going to need to be augmented (and I have no idea where I'm going to put all the work and boxes at the show).I found one kiln and am waiting to hear on the second. I did hear that the 110 pieces are a probable and the meeting for final approval on the 395 pieces is Wednesday afternoon. The one kiln I found is 1700 lbs and the lid-lifting system makes it 68\" wide--a tough fit for the kiln room and no way for the floor. My carpenter is going to go in today and cut the existing plywood floor out, put a new floor support system in and put in a new 3/4\" plywood floor... just in case. My wonderful assistant Stacy is going to supervise (and deal with the studio security alarm) in my absence. Yee Haw.Made a commitment to do both jobs based on the availability of the first kiln (I can have it the day I get back from Chicago, it's almost built). Finally got to see the specs on the web just now... and it looks like there's no lid reinforcement to keep it from torquing, and, more importantly no lid elements--side-firing only. Oh great. That won't do at all.The road to Chicago, something about insurmountable obstacles and imminent disaster. At least it didn't snow... oh wait."},

Ah, it's good to have a child old enough to do chores and get an allowance! The kilns are open and cooling in preparation for the final three loads before the show. I canceled my reservation for an Econoline van this morning. Yesterday I bought plastic utility shelving at Home Depot that I think is going to be strong enough--and that is definitely light enough--to hold all my backstock and packaging. Whether I'll have enough room for both packaging and backstock (with any storage system) remains to be seen. Since J is staying here (and not taking up space with a seat, a car seat and a body) and I have a lighter display, I am going to stick with the mini-vanI sat down yesterday and counted up all the work I have for this show and it is the same (by value, not by piece count) as it was last year. And last year I didn't fire nearly as much. What the heck? Then I looked at the pieces and now I get it. Last year I took everything I had--old series, fill-in work, whatever. This year I am only taking the most popular work--Morceaux de Verre and only certain colorways. As a result, all but about three pieces were made in the last... 12 days. Over $20,000 in glass in two weeks. I feel somewhat better about feeling like a corpse.Now off to sign all the pieces, inventory the final total, get the last slump loads in and begin the packing. I watch Dave and Jessie bringing all the Christmas ornaments and other decoration down from the attic and I know that my day is just beginning."},

Pain au chocolat from Trader Joe's for a family breakfast then we acquired two Christmas trees--one cut for the living room and one live Virginia pine for J's room now and the backyard in January, a wreath that we'll decorate with pine cones, nandina berries, acorns and other findings from the yard, and the shelving I need for the show in Chicago next week. It was a great morning.I wait for the kilns to cool so I can load them for the day. The last fuse load I think, even though Bertha is already loaded with molds for a slump. That'll give me tomorrow to finish any edges that need it and clean the pieces from the fuse. Later this afternoon we'll put up the outdoor Christmas lights and garland and do the wreath. Tomorrow we'll decorate the tree--after the branches have fallen. It was interesting explaining to Mom why we would wait to decorate the tree. Dad always cut our trees and we brought them home from the forest (western Montana, remember?) so the limbs were never bound up for days on end necessitating time for them to relax and fall naturally again. Now my parents have an artificial tree and, again, no need to let the limbs fall.I am as ready for this show as I can be, and the price--while high--has been acceptable. When I finish this post I'll count up my pieces to see what I actually have for the show. As usual, I made a plan weeks ago, I followed it, and I have no idea (right now) what it was.For the curious out there, I met the rep for a company that provides corporate gift ideas to corporations. They initially contacted me to see if I would be interested in doing 100-150 shallow round dishes (7-1/2\" round) in some color for a client here in Georgia by mid-January. I sent samples, and when they were presented to the client, she loved them. She loved them enough that she asked if I could do a bigger piece instead, say, the long rectangular platters (15 X 7). I said \"Sure!\" Then (in yet another phone call--all of them taking place between 3:00 and 4:00 pm Friday; the end of the business day and week for my suppliers) she asked if, instead of the 100 odd for mid-January, could I do 400 for the end of January for another event. I said (after a bit of quick exhaustion-hazed math), \"Sure!\" thinking I would be able to get another big kiln quickly. I compounded my absurd optimism by calling back a couple of minutes later and offering the possibility of doing BOTH the 100 for mid-January and the 400 for the end of January. Now keep in mind these are the same style (though not color) pieces I do for the winter gift catalog for Art Institute in Chicago. I have more than a little experience in whumping them out (and, no, Dee, no ground edges!).After I got off the phone with her I did a quick pass of the manufacturers of the kilns I have been eyeing to supplement Bertha (I am going to name the new girl Bettina--Betty for short). I wasn't able to get a final answer from anyone at the end of the second Friday after Thanksgiving crouching before the impending December madness, though the initial response was 6-8 weeks as they all need to be custom built. But I am not worried. If I *had* to do it with just Bertha and a prayer, I could. I'd like to kill myself doing it, but I could. And the new kiln would arrive in time enough to provide some help.In the meantime, I am talking to people on Monday about getting me a new kiln soonest. I'm talking to them from the road to Chicago. At Siyeh Studio the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. So what do we do? Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery."},

Tired is not a descriptive enough, evocative enough, accurate, in fact, word. I am in the beyond tired. Sleep is something I usually slip slowly and lightly into. At first I'm laying on the mattress and everything is normal. But then I feel the first shifting of gravity--it doesn't exist for me anymore--and I languidly begin to leave my body for the place of sleep and dreams. I have a second or two to marvel at my weightlessness and to luxuriate in a feeling of total peace and relaxation before I go.But for the past few days (weeks) going to sleep has been... faster. The night before last Dave and I went up to bed and, as is our want, we were talking as we snuggled under the covers. He said something, then I responded... and I fell asleep halfway through my sentence. I woke with a start as I finished talking, horror-struck with no idea what I had just said. Dave paused for a second, mulling over my utterance and then kindly said, \"My heart, I think you have lost all your consonants. I'll help you find them in the morning.\" And that was that.Thanks to Stacy, Dave, my Mom, Dee, and Jessie I have made it through the week and I will be ready to go to Chicago on Monday. While I'm driving up the road I'll be seeing if I can scare up a Bertha II by the end of December to help me complete an order for 400-500 long rectangular platters that I might be getting Monday (due the end of January). Am I INSANE?!?!?"},

Too bad the expenditure of energy and effort I am experiencing right now don't translate into weight loss. (The chocolate-dipped biscotti I'm munching on with my coffee are precluders to the whole weight-loss thing.) But who cares about weight? There's a show coming up next week! Against all odds--and for the first time ever--all of the firings scheduled over the past two weeks happened... and happened when they were scheduled. There has been no slippage.The lack of slippage and sleep have made me cocky: last night I upped the ante and *added* a firing to the schedule. Big Bertha is now scheduled for *two, count them two* slump loads on Saturday. The only way to pull this off is to get today's and tomorrow's loads in early and earlier so she'll be cool enough to unload by 5:30 Saturday morning. One load at 6:00 am, the other at 10:00 pm, then Sunday's load at 2:00 pm so I can unload Sunday's load by noon on Monday... and hit the road for Chicago. Sounds pretty ambitious, doesn't it? But like I said, I'm feeling cocky. :-)Today, J to school (check), dogs to groomer (check), minivan filled with gas and handed over to Stacy so she can meet Bill from EMW up in Commerce and get the rest of my stands for the show (check). Kilns wide open and cooling (check). But I have an appointment from 10:00-11:15 and I wanted Big Bertha's load in before it. Not going to happen. But it'll be in before I pick J up from school at 1:00. Then the rest of the class list for Hoy's, gymnastics for J, dogs from groomer, ballet for J, maybe even the fabric store with my Mom. Whew!"},
{"title": "Hump, Hump, HUMP DAY!", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Montreal skyline mug, \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor on iTunes. Not random, not chance. Maybe not haut musique, but appropriate this morning nonetheless. Today is the hump day to end all hump days. Yesterday I realized that I can no longer go it alone, and today I will be alone except for a couple of hours this morning. Yesterday I had help from both Dee and Stacy all day and for most of the day, respectively, and I just managed to get through the production tasks for the day. Nothing more was written (though I did get the GPQ article in)--including the class list. And yet the day was non-stop, jampacked. Today promises to be more of the same (though I did promise my spouse I wouldn't \"overdo\"--a subject for a post in itself, and not for today's).Yesterday Stacy did morceaux duty and frit refill, Dee helped move yet more crap from the basement to the studio and then did inventory with me. She ended the day (from mid-day on) by doing the second grind (100 grit) of the edges of the little sushi/chocolate/tapas plates (the plates for whatever little thing you like to eat). Stacy did the wash and third edge inspection/diamond handpad grind (220 grit). I did the first grind (60 grit, I'm in a hurry). I made 140 of those little plates for the show and right now I'm thinking $32 is not enough for them to make them worthwhile to do. Fuse a sheet, cut it into five plates, do two grinds, wash and handpad for chips, slump. That's a lot of hands-on time for a piece that measures 3-1/2\" X 8\" and retails for $32. On the other hand, they are always the hottest seller at this show. Last year it looked like the sale table at Filene's Basement with the women clustered around them almost snatching the different colors out of each other's hands.To continue on the topic of not going back... Bill (EMW) called to see how I was doing and to ask if I really wanted to be this busy. I said okay and it's okay. But his question made me stop and think for a moment and realize that, even though she's only been with me a couple of weeks, I would have a hard time going back to working without Stacy. And Dee has been dropping in once or twice a week since I got this studio to just hang and help out. And she really works--there is no just sitting and chatting. Yesterday I didn't even take time for lunch--I grabbed cold leftovers straight out of the fridge and ate them standing by the sink while I was waiting for Mom to finish up what she was doing and get her shoes on so we could go pick J up from school.I still don't have time to update my website, work on my display for next year, manage customer data, or create focused mailings. And I have help! Before you even think it, no I can't hire someone else. I can't afford it. Yes, more business, but now also more expenses--rent, formal utilities of every variety, and more materials... lots more materials. Maybe I'll be surprised at the income that will come in--let's face it, unless I am doing something radically wrong more work means more money--but who has time to sit down and do  financial stuff?!? After the One of a Kind Show. Many things are put off till then.Now off to fire--a bazooka today, I think. And I won't even aim it at Bill (who so kindly keeps sending me drinks through Facebook).PS--Thank you Sue for the lovely review on Amazon! I really appreciate that you took the time to write it when you are so busy yourself right now."},
{"title": "Transcendental", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Pornographer's Dream\" by Suzanne Vega on iTunes. I had a completely sublime, completely unexpected, transcendental evening out with Dave yesterday. I have said before that I am just not a live music person anymore--if I ever was. I get annoyed by crowds, bored with standing, and most of the \"musicians\" of my youth sounded better (much better) in the studio than they did live. So when Dave asked me a week ago if I wanted to see Suzanne Vega at the Variety Playhouse with him I agreed because I love him and so want to do things with him--not because I had any desire to see live music.And let's face it--right now isn't a good time for me to be doing just about anything. I am *buried* in work getting ready for this show and meeting other professional commitments (writing, writing about teaching, orders, preparing for orders, etc.). I rushed like a mad woman yesterday to get all my work done, have a shower (and wash my hair), and hook up the dvd, tv and receiver so Mom and J could watch a movie while D and I were out. By the time we walked out the door I was really stressed and cranky and would have rather chewed my arm off than go out at all. And to see live music... ugh.Dave made the mistake as we were halfway down the street of asking me if I was looking forward to the concert. Me and Georges (Washington--not Bush), we cannot tell a lie. I did hasten to add that just because I wasn't looking forward to it didn't mean I wouldn't enjoy it (though I did have my doubts). I was realistic enough to acknowledge that my crankiness might be almost wholly responsible for my dour outlook and there was hope. He was less sanguine and the evning almost got canceled then and there.As it turns out, my hope was not misplaced. What a great evening, what great music! (What a barely acceptable dinner--though the bass player and other band members, maybe even Ms. Vega herself, sat at the table in the corner opposite us. I recognized the bass player and the woman he was with after the concert in the lobby as being from the restaurant. But back to the other story...) This is my kind of venue and the other people there were my kind of people--they stayed sitting down. Earlier in the day I had groused to Stacy about going to concerts and she said how annoying it was when she went to see the Dixie Chicks with a bunch of women and the people behind them wanted her and her friends to sit down instead of standing and dancing... I dryly informed her that I was one of the people sitting behind her--Scrooge McConcertgoer.But last night I lounged in my seat and munched my way through a vat of popcorn--washed down with a couple of bottles of (hard) cider--and bobbed my head to the vocal stylings of Suzanne Vega. (Oooh, \"Frank and Ava\" from the new album just came on--I love that one!) The Variety is a small, intimate venue with a little balcony and great seats throughout. Dave saw both the Drive By Truckers and the Hold Steady there in the past two months and he is very sorry to have missed the New Pornographers and Jason Isobel. I had such a good time that I told him I'd go see anyone there.But back to glass. Five Days till D-Day and counting. Yesterday I got my article in to GPQ. This morning I need to polish up the class list for Hoy's. I also need to figure out what the heck I've made in the past week and what I still need to make. Sure I have a schedule, but I have been just swapping things around and adding randomly to kiln loads as I could squeeze more in (or needed to change something for an order). I have a little idea what I have... but only a little. Now off to the studio."},
{"title": "New Week, New Opportunities", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Alaska skyline mug, \"Hands Like Rain\" by James McMurtry on iTunes. Up at 6:00 this morning to write, then took J to school and Dave to the train. (I think it's the last day for that--D's rear window is supposed to be replaced today and then he takes back getting J to school and himself to the train... In a way I'll miss the routine, but I'll be able to use the time.) Got home and put two kiln loads in--a bowl to slump in Little Boy and three ovals and two small round dishes in Middle Ground (finally named the two smaller kilns!). Opened Big Bertha to finish cooling the pieces in her and will reload her after I post and finish one of the two articles--maybe after finishing both.The birdbath overslumped, and of course I need to photograph it today to finish off the article for GPQ that's already overdue. Hope I can get a creative shot that shows the beauty of the glass and the interest of the design while hiding the overslump. I might end up sending in the article with all the other photos today, redoing the piece, and sending a photo of it finished later. The problem with that scenario is that I don't have space in either Middle Ground or Big Bertha till after the One of a Kind Show--the birdbath is too big for Little Boy--and that might be too late.The end of last week brought a new opportunity to the studio: I was contacted by a company that works with corporations on their corporate gift programs. They wanted to know if I would be interested in (and able to do) 100-150 pieces for a local company to use as their corporate gift in January. Yes and yes! January is typically a very light month for me in terms of production (though not in terms of work--it's my month to prepare for the February BMAC). and a little extra revenue will be most welcome. They are reviewing the pieces this week and will let me know by next week. If I do get the contract, I'll need to get more molds for that piece. An excuse to shop. Heh.Now off to write and fire!"},
{"title": "Sunday and It's Not Sunny", "date": "Sunday, November 25, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Denver skyline mug, the whisper of air from the furnace blowing up through the vents for music. It is really quiet this morning. Jessie had a sleepover at a friend's house and Gramma is still asleep. This is what it will feel like everyday when it's just Dave and me and the laptops... And then the dogs come in from outdoors and chaos reigns anew. For a Spaniel, Baxter is such a hound!I began the day by limbering up my fingers knitting a few rows on the coat I am making for Jessie. Now they fly over the keyboard as I do this post--the warm-up for writing two articles and class descriptions. For the latter I think I'll start with the how-to's of mica, my version of pot melts, screen melts, variations on pattern bars, working thick with frit and chunk, and maybe pulling kiln stringer.But the articles are for the spring issues of magazines, and spring seems so far away. The classes offerings are for next year too, next year summer and fall most likely. Of immediate, pressing, right-now interest are the changes I am going to make to my display for the One of a Kind Show that is, oh, Next Week!This is a retail show, the only one I still do, so most of my planning has to be completely different than it is for a wholesale show. Sure, big wholesale (order) shows and retail shows have some things in common, but they are more different than alike. The one thing I can count on for every show is that my display needs to grab the attention of the passers-by in the 18 seconds or so that I will get from them before they look on to the next booth. For this show especially, if I haven't caught them in that amount of time I won't get them all. It's a huge show packed with other artists with eye-catching, gorgeous displays and there just isn't time for people to walk the floor twice (i.e., come back).The wholesale shows are even bigger, but the buyers who attend them are, in some sense, professional shoppers. I think they train for the shows like runners train for a marathon. It takes real endurance to walk a show floor and evaluate the work of some 1500 artists. At the BMAC it's common for someone stop by the booth, look around, say they'll be back to place an order, and actually come back and order. At the One of a Kind Show last year (when the number of artists displaying jumped dramatically), I would hear \"I'll be back\", and I'd know I wasn't talking to Arnold Schwarzenegger. The average retail shopper just doesn't have the stamina or the ability to resist being completely overwhelmed by the sensory input so get them the first time by or don't get them at all.So lots of light, open space (a strong body of work is good, clutter is bad), bright colors, check. That's the easy part. I winnowed down the numbers of both the series and the colorways within the series that I am taking this year. In previous years I've taken Morceaux de Verre, Pop Art, Frit Painting, Morceaux de Verre, and boxes--a little bit of everything. But this year I am going to focus on the bell curve, the 80/20 of it all, to maximize sales. Sure, there'll be someone who comes up and asks where are the boxes or the Pop Art pieces--he saw one last year and really wants to buy it now--whatever.At a wholesale show it's good to have one of everything you do (though last year I still cut all the series except Morceaux de Verre for those too) because buyers see the one piece and place orders. At a retail show I actually want all the pieces I take there to sell there so I really need to take the most popular pieces and lots of each of them. Figuring out which pieces to take was the angst of a week ago.This week's angst is how to store all the back-ups in the booth so they are readily accessible and the booth remains uncluttered. Oh yes, and the display doesn't weigh too much or take up too much space in the min-van. I am thinking the plastic utility shelving at Home Depot is the answer. Last year I did the wire-rack shelving I use  in the studio. It's great for size, but it's really, really heavy and I think it's overkill for a four-day show.I also have to figure out packaging. I started many years ago with recycled grocery bags, then moved up to purchased paper shopping bags, then frosted plastic shopping bags and bubble wrap, and this year I think I need to add cardboard boxes for the pieces on stands. Storing all of the packing materials takes space too (and the fire marshal frowns on flammables in the booth). Oh yes, and the wall pieces (lattice and tree) all have their own wooden boxes. Those I am going to have to put in the back-stock area as I just can't see having room for them in the booth.But the day is awasting (and the child is home). Guess I'll keep mulling it over as I put in three more kiln loads (and then get writing!)."},

The day progresses as does studio arrangement and glass production. Yesterday while I was working, UPS was taking the day off. Even the post office was open yesterday, but UPS was CLOSED so the two orders I had ready to ship did not go.Today I already have the small kiln firing and I'm preparing to do the birdbath (again) (for GPQ) in the medium kiln. I enjoy writing, but I've had a hard time swallowing that particular frog. I think  my biggest obstacle is doing the photo shoot all by myself in addition to the design and the writing. The writing is the easy part--I also need to do a quasi-professional job photographing all the steps and the finished piece.Big Bertha is set up for a slump load of the little rectangular sushi (chocolate) (tapas) plates. Those plates are the only production pieces I do where one piece of fused glass is cut into multiple pieces--five, to be exact. For everything else one fused piece equals one finished piece and I don't grind and polish the edges prior to slumping. These little plates are extremely labor-intensive as I lap-grind the edges with two different diamond grit sizes before slumping. I'm firing 30 of them today so I'll be spending quite a bit of time at the grinder this afternoon--and it's already almost 1:00.So much for time to make wee folk dolls today. I am planning a set based on Terry Pratchett's book \"The Wee Free Men\" to give to Jessie for Christmas. I am reading the book to her now as her chapter book before bed, and she spends much time running around the house shouting \"Crivens!\", \"Waily, waily, waily!\" and \"Wee little burdie\" in her best Scottish accent. Never having been to Scotland or having conversed with a Scottish person, her versions are a hoot.Okay, back to glass. It's the weekend, but there is work to be done."},

Yes it is the time of the season. For some, it is the time to shop. For ohers, it is the time to sleep off too much turkey, stuffing and pie. For me, it is the time to fire the kilns non-stop and juggle firing and shipping schedules. Today it is also the time to listen to the assistant working as I post and let me tell you, that is a GOOD sound!Besides firing three kiln loads and trying to spend some time with my family today, I am also struggling with getting my Canon i560 printer to work with my Mac. I *thought* it was just out of ink so I bought a bunch of cartridges (why pay shipping for just one when you can pay the same shipping for a bunch?). But it wasn't the ink. Nor was it the printer (I have two from the old Windows PC days) as I swapped it out. Nor was it the cable as I swapped it out. Ergo, it must be the driver. Grumble, grumble, grumble, hate technology, grumble, grumble, grumble, need a new printer, grumble, grumble, grumble, won't take the same cartridges, can't return the cartridges, grumble, grumble, grumble.Time to get my grumbly self back to the kilns.

{"title": "Giving Thanks and Swallowing Frogs", "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Strutter\" by Kiss on iTunes (what can I say? Guitar Hero infects us all). Happy Thanksgiving everyone, I am swallowing frogs this morning! Ew, you say. But no. I have Stacy (the new assistant) to thank for providing the perfect phrase for something everyone has to do in both their personal and professional lives. Most of my personal frogs have been shoved so far down the list I can't even here them ribbit, but my professional frogs--as frogs will do--are getting in the way of my getting things done. I am so surrounded by them right now that I am getting to the state where I can't even get to production, shipping, and other less cerebral, more hands-on tasks.So what are frogs and why on earth would you swallow them? Frogs are tasks that you really, really don't want to do or that now loom over you because you have left them for so long and they're so late... If you had just done whatever the task was right when you got it, when it was due, it wouldn't be a frog now--and psyching yourself up to do it wouldn't require the effort of psyching yourself up to, say, swallow a frog! Of course some things are born frogs and the best thing to do is just hold your nose and get them over quickly. But that's more like the cleaning-the-ferret-litterbox task rather than anything I have to do professionally.The more frogs I have, the more time I spend on the Internet. I know that whatever I'm doing is neither advancing my business, nor my preferred free-time activity, nor achieving the goal of ticking an item off the to-do list. But the frogs... they peep, they ribbitt, they croak vociferously... In short, they make me look up \"coyote ugly\" in Wikipedia (the definition wasn't there, but who knew the phrase spawned a bar, then a movie, then a chain of bars!) and then in the Urban Dictionary. Ostensibly I do this to enrich the post, but really I am just avoiding the anticipated cold, slimy, squiggly thing going down my throat.But no more running! I embrace the frog! Over the next four days I will write three articles (one of them a how-to complete with photos) and put together a syllabus of classes I am interested in teaching at Ed Hoy's (and in my own studio, for that matter).Though not frogs, I will also fire three kilns at least once a day. Today is Thanksgiving so I shouldn't be posting, and I don't usually post on weekends. But I am in the show home stretch so as I am working, I will be posting everyday through the end of the month.This afternoon there will be turkey (deep fried, yum), good wine, good friends (and family! my Mom's here), and good Guitar Hero. I give thanks."},

It's O'Dark Thirty in the morning the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Jessie has no school today and has a friend coming over for an all-day playdate. I wish I were six again. Maybe. Almost. I know I am rushing toward the busiest, most jam-packed, stressful month of the year with all my reserves used up. Again. Time to reboot--not just for the morning, but for the season.-----Okay, a few hours have passed. Coffee has been consumed. A new playlist has been created for the studio (containing mostly perky music... though I think I did put in \"Hell, No I Ain't Happy\" by The Drive By Truckers). I am in a better frame of mind. I'm still way behind, mind you, I just don't care so much... At least I thought I didn't until Stacy asked me just now why I was so anxious and I started to cry... Breathe."},

Yesterday I left Stacy (new assistant) in the studio working alone for a couple of hours. When I got back she shared with me that after listening for awhile to the playlist I had left on the iPod, she was really depressed and felt like crying so she changed to a different playlist. She was shocked (shocked!) to find that I had left her listening to the melancholy playlist. I'm going to try Ren's melancholy playlist on her next. Heh.What I posted yesterday about there being no way I can get all the work done I plan for the show is true and independent of the number of people who help me. My labor is not the bottleneck; Big Bertha is. (The semicolon is for Dave. He knows why.) I can only fire one load in her a day. If I rush and get stressed, some of those loads will fail and I won't be able to make them up (the whole finite number of days thing).Last night I wrote up the list of pieces I would like to have. This morning, as Bertha cools from yesterday's load, I will plug the list of pieces into the (again, finite number of) slots available in her between now and the end of the month. And yes, I know it'll all work out (the Siyeh Studio motto is at the end of the linked post). However just telling me it'll work out is not enough to convince my amygdala. I might could use a little pre-frontal lobe stimulation too. Either the house had bad feng shui at 5:00 am or my anxiety infected everyone because not only was I up and sleepless, but the rest of the human denizens in residence also all woke for short amounts of time--even my mom in the guest room. But she's old and might have just been up for one of the many old-people night bathroom trips... (Just kidding Mom--you're not old.)So today, more firing. Calling the Merchandise Mart and begging to be allowed to submit my services form late (it was due November 5th), and article writing. Funnily, the topic of one of the articles is realistically determining your work output to evaluate whether you can make a living as a glass artist... Some days the irony just kills me."},

Just call me Frodo this morning--and not for my height or hairy feet. No, I'm on the road to Mordor--otherwise known as Chicago. Don't get me wrong--I love Chicago. I love going to Chicago, I love doing shows in Chicago, I love the show I'm heading up to do TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY! Can you feel the anxiety rolling off my body and flowing through the wires out into the world? I know--breathe. Breathe in, breathe out. It'll be what it'll be. I'll be in that frame of mind by next Monday when it's all over but the shouting. But for now I have to go through the entire process. Really. You can't just \"skip to the end\" (much as I'd like to). And it's the same (or similar) every year.I am reminded of a post from earlier this year when I was a week out from a show and I realized that the work I needed to do to be ready for it wouldn't fit into the time I had. Every show for me seems to have some variation of that theme. It begins with absolute panic at the disconnect between what needs to be done and the time and space required to do it, and moves through frantic activity, failures, and unimaginable stress to an eerie calm acceptance of my limitations as a human being bound by the laws of gravity and the space-time continuum. What I wouldn't give this morning for eerie calm."},
{"title": "Good-bye Oak and Post Trunk Show and Book Party", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones on the iPod. Yesterday was a full day. The City of Atlanta took the big oak out yesterday. I requested it be taken as it was dying, but it still made me cry to see them cutting off the limbs  and cutting it down. I called the grandson of the original owner of the house and let him know they were cutting it. He is a wood turner and wanted some of the wood from it for sentimental reasons. I got the City people to leave some good pieces for him and he came for some of them while I was up at my book signing/gallery show last night.Taking down a tree this big--especially one whose trunk is less than two feet from a very busy road--is a monumental endeavor. It took a team of four all day. One guy was up in the basket with a chainsaw and the rest were on the ground controlling the fall. There were some really scary moments--like when they took the whole trunk down in one piece.There was a grizzled old man with a white pick-up who waited for hours to be able to collect some of the fallen limbs and pieces for firewood for the winter. I was glad to think the tree would be warming him. The limbs the city took away are chipped into mulch which is given away to anyone who wants to get it. This weekend Jessie and I are going to collect some of the acorns from the tree to plant so we can have new oak saplings for the backyard next year.The show and book signing last night were a hoot! All the pictures (courtesy of Pam and Licha--I forgot my camera) are up on Flickr.Thank you Mary and Patrick for a really wonderful party!"},
{"title": "Booth Design Considerations", "date": "Thursday, November 15, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, \"Punish the Monkey\" (again) by Mark Knopfler on iTunes. It is going to be A Day! I was reminded on Tuesday afternoon that today is the first day of the Taylor Kinzel Glass Trunk Show that I am in up in Roswell, and they are also having a book signing there for me tonight... Oh boy. My first book signing and I only have five copies of my book left. Well, that ought to be enough--it's not like I'm J.K. Rowling! So I'm off up there about 3:30, therefore missing J's gymnastics and ballet and relegating Dave to airport pick-up duty at 7:32 when my mom gets in from Montana (yea!) for a month.But enough chatter. Today's topic is display considerations. I am splitting a 20 X 20 space at the upcoming two BMAC shows  and ACRE with Bill and Elaine from Elliott Metal Works. The first step in the design process is to identify the needs. Ours are as follows:Break up the space into areas for each of our individual works and then an area for the FeSiO work and have all of them flow seamlessly togetherHave our own private areas for sales and business talks with our customersHave a lot of wall space for them and tabletop display for meGrab the eye from any angle as people walk byOpen and spacious feelingFlexible for changing layoutQuick and easy to set-up and break-downNot too heavy (or we'll be eaten alive by shipping)Not too expensiveDurableThink we're asking for too much?Let's start with the walls. Movable panels are great for maximum flexibility. Plywood is the first material that comes to mind for DIYers, but plywood needs to be at least 1/2\" thick in order not to warp, and it weighs 50 lbs for a 4' X 8' piece. That's a lot of weight. It also has to be kept painted or covered, and whenever you nail into it you get a permanent hole. Not a great option. So we extended our thoughts and came up with gridwalls covered with foamcore. That's what I had on the front corner of my booth in August (photo at right, wall under the lattice piece).They aren't any more light-weight than plywood, but they don't warp, they attach to each other with cable ties, and the work can be cable-tied to them--even really heavy pieces. The foamcore is extremely lightweight and can be re-used if handled carefully. It can also be decorated with a tissue-paper-and-glue collage that would really set off my work (and hide damage or flaws in the panels). The panel size we settled on is 8' X 2'--and we might cut them down a few inches to fit in a crate made from 4' X 8' sheets of plywood. We put together a common floor layout template and are now tweaking it individually back in our own studios. I am going to create mine with Google Sketch-Up--a free CAD program (Dave wanted to find a use for it, and I was happy to oblige :-).Enough design for today. Up next: maximizing display space in the sweet spot (thigh height to just above head height) and floor covering. Soon: lighting, and extra touches.Now off to make the birdbath for my GPQ article (check out the fall issue for my last article!)."},

No drifting here--moving too fast to drift. Today is the big meeting with Bill and Elaine from EMW in the new studio. I am serving coffee (a blend of French roast and mocha java) and frozen pain  auchocolat (chocolate croissants for us Americans) from Trader Joe's for breakfast. These frozen pain au chocolat are the most amazing bakery goods that you can buy from a store and bake at home. I lived in France for awhile, I know good croissants (and pain au chocolat). What you get from most American bakeries wouldn't even qualify--much less anything from the grocery store. But these Trader Joe's things... You put them on parchment paper on a baking sheet at night before bed (frozen) and prep them in the oven (i.e., put them in the oven and leave them there all night with the oven off). Then in the morning you brush them with an egg and bake them at 350 for 20 minutes. At the end of that time you have the most exquisite, perfect, flaky, crispy, buttery pastry you have ever eaten. I kid you not. And they are $2.59 for a package of four.But back to the day... Yesterday I had both De and my new assistant Stacy helping me and we really powered through things. All the molds (or all the ones I might conceivably use) are now in the new studio, the last of the architectural glass that was moved has been put in its case, books shipped to Europe, and an order shipped to New Jersey. All the scrap glass too big to go in plastic storage boxes (and which therefore stands in the wooden bins below my assembly table--shown above) is now back in the bin (and off the coldroom floor) and it's even sorted by color. I shiver in the bliss of complete organization.------------------It's now many, many (about 13) hours after I started this post. Much has happened, and it will wait for tomorrow.

Our insurance company obviously feels that accidents and vandalism don't happen on weekends as there was no one in at our agent's office Saturday nor was there anyone in the referral area who could tell me where I could get the work done so I could get a jump on it before today. Then last night we discovered that Saturday morning we left a credit card at breakfast and I need to run pick it up from the restaurant today.Yesterday Dave had to work some so we sent him away to Kavarna for peace and quiet and Jessie and I headed for the studio. I fired a commission piece for one of my Florida galleries and J broke out her new sewing kit. The photos at right are her making a little purse complete with closure strap with buttonhole and button sewn on. Wow. She is good and did it all by herself--right down to cutting the buttonhole! It was a good day (and I was tempted to post since we were already in the studio).And now it's Monday and the week is out of the gate with a leap and a bound. I have hired an assistant and she starts today. It's scary, it's exciting, it's an employee... it's a big step.Today is bird-bath fusing (cool new technique incorporating frit and paint).

Completion? No. Progress? You bet!Friday is slotted for mop-up on anything that doesn't get done on the other days and general settling into the saddle of the new studio. And maybe shopping. Shopping would be fun. Shopping for floor lamps for the office, a printer for the studio, shelving for back stock for the One of a Kind Show (Dee convinced me that there is no need to carry the bezillion lb commercial steel shelving units up to Chicago and back just to hold my back stock.

She wants us to adopt the dog in the poster, Angel. \"I would give her chocolate every day--if dogs could have chocolate but they can't because it would make them sick. And I would love her more than anyone else does. And if I had two chocolates, I would give them both to her--if dogs could have chocolate, but they can't because it would make them sick.\" Oh boy. Sadly, we live in a neighborhood where many people treat their dogs this way so the billboard is well-placed for its target demographic.It's cold in the studio this morning! I think there's a problem with the thermostat--it reads 54 degrees when it's sweltering hot in here so I can't just leave it on all night, but these mornings are chilly (she says squeezing her warm coffee mug). My parents in Montana and my in-laws in Chicago must be laughing themselves silly to read that I think southern fall mornings are \"chilly\".All the books but the international ones went out yesterday (yea!).

It's still going to be expensive via the post office (probably just less than the cost of the book).

So okay, blogging from the new studio is not quite ready for prime time. Yesterday was fully occupied with the book. Got another call from Ed Hoy. He wanted to let me know that the response to it  in their showroom has been overwhelmingly positive, and they have a couple slots in their teaching schedule for next year, would I be interested? Heck yes! Got a poke from my editor on getting the supplies list to them for their website, I am sooo behind on that. Good thing I have a whole day dedicated to on-line work coming up. But I can't feel too bad--they don't have my book up on their site yet either. Everyone's behind. And then there's Borders.Last night was date night and we went to Pura Vida for tapas and pisco sours and then on to Borders to look for new books (and pick up a copy of Ratatouille on dvd). With the mellowness engendered by a couple of pisco sours in my belly, I had the bright idea of offering to sign the copies of my book at Borders. I figured between my driver's license and the author photo and bio, I could convince them I really did write it. And I could bask in the public I'm An Author glow. Oh you know where this is going...I waltzed in the front doors and sashayed over to the craft section. Glass, glass, glass. Hmmm. where's glass? Oh there it is, the little section squashed between jewelry and something else. Not very many books in it, and certainly not one of mine. Somewhat chastened, headed for the computer to look it up. Huh. Still in pre-order status. Well they need to fix that! Strode boldly to the info desk and asked the young man when the book would be in! He tapped and he typed and he peered intently at the screen. Where else have you seen it, ma'am? Well, Amazon and some local Barnes and Nobles have it listed as in. Hmmm. Regretfully he informed me that he couldn't even find a Border's number associated with that particular book so they probably weren't even going to be carrying it. Not carrying it! But I could order a copy for you and you could pick it up when it comes in. Sniff. Shoulders slightly hunched, I slunk over to the new hardback books table to drown my sorrows in a new book or three.Books are always good for whatever ails me. Jezebel grabbed my attention--as much for the beautiful cover as for the content (I am a sucker for neo-classical paintings. My favorite being Pygmalion and Galatea by Jean-Léon Gérôme). On the way home Dave consoled me with the idea that they would probably carry my novel, if I wrote one. And heck, I've already written one book so how hard could the second one be? Isn't that what young couples say to convince themselves that a second child is only marginally work work than the first? Hah! I didn't believe that one either! (Well, I did, but Dave talked me out of it.)Today I continue studio set-up--several hundred pounds of back-up frit to move--and I might even fire a load in Big Bertha. Tomorrow, studio blogging for sure."},

I was going to post form the new studio this morning, but there is a little more set-up to get done (including moving over my desk chair) before I'm ready for that. I did get the painting finished in the office  yesterday and Dee got all the shelving units built (listen to the sound of check marks appearing next to to do items) AND she unpacked the new case of glass so I am ready to formally move in. Tomorrow, \"Live from Siyeh Studio mark... 11! Wow. I am on my eleventh \"studio\".I had to put the quotes around studio in the last sentence because I remember the first studio was a corner in the great room in my grandparents basement. I didn't do any kiln forming then, it was a stained glass only studio. I wonder if my Uncle Ed still has the big round window of a mallard flying in front of a lake? It was my second piece and the only one I ever did from a pattern. There was a piece for each feather and I remember being amazed when it actually all fit together. I was never much of a copper-foiler so it was a huge round leaded window.Then I went off to graduate school in Chicago in my 1967 GMC Suburban with the backseat removed. That car was *big*. It seated 20 and I had a small paragon kiln in the back, a case of glass tied to the back of the bench seat, and boxes of tools. Oh yeah, I also had some clothes and books, but those were thrown in as almost an after thought. The \"Studio\" in Chicago was most of my graduate student apartment: the bedroom was the glass studio, the kiln was in the kitchen and I slept on a pull-out sofa in the living room.Studio three was in an old coach house in the Kenwood area of Hyde Park by the University of Chicago. I finally had a 20-amp circuit so I could get a bigger kiln. I bought a 20\" X 20\" Glass Glow from Phil Teefy and tucked it under the stairs in the garage area of the coach house (the little Paragon stayed upstairs in the bedroom/studio). Production firing back then meant two firings a day and for the second one, setting the alarm to get up every time the power needed to be adjusted for a new firing segment (slow ramp, fast ramp, cool, anneal, etc.). Chicago in the winter in the middle of the night in a drafty old coach house. Brrr. I feel so spoiled now.Yesterday I shipped from the new shipping room. It was heaven--no more crowded, dark corner in the studio annex (aka the garage). I am still a little concerned about putting my packages out for pick-up on the front porch. I would feel better if it were screened in. Construction round two.Today I sign and ship all the books people pre-ordered and change the Glass Incarnate web site from \"pre-order a signed copy\" to \"order a signed copy\". I'm already getting inquiries about suppliers so I need to get a list together for Lark and one up on my site asap. Maybe I need a Kavarna Day..."},

I was all set to post pictures of the  tumultuous week up to and including the first kiln load in the new studio and I can't. find. the camera. transfer. cable. I can't find the fly-swatter either and we are *infested* with little fruit fly-like things. I can feel myself getting wound up. Breathe. Breathe in, breathe out. Wash, rinse, repeat.It's Friday now. Yesterday's move wrap-up and install went well. Bertha is level (and wasn't THAT a job in this 90 year-old house with very Un-level floors!) and has a counterweight pulley system hung for the lid, the Styrofoam peanut dispenser is hung, the frit storage racks are mounted, and the middle kiln has been loaded and fired even before the computer control panel has been mounted on the wall. Why did I fire after two long, chaotic, stressful days of moving? Well it's like this...Jessie is in a new school this year and at her school they have a ritual for celebrating childrens' birthdays. I found out that, yes, the date for her in-school party really is *today* yesterday at 1:00 pm, and I had none of my assigned prep for the party even begun--much less completed. The first step was the cake. The kids make a cake in class and the birthday child decorates it with flowers she brings from her garden. Our garden yielded a couple of impatiens, a few marigolds, some ivy and a lacy white flower. It wasn't really enough so Jessie and her Gramma (newly arrived from Chicago) went off on a walk and gathered the last of the season's roses growing through neighboring fences.Meanwhile back at the studio... The moving wound down and the helpers went home after hugs all around. I dragged my very tired and sore body home and sat down to start the little story about the milestones of Jessie's life that her teacher will read in class today when I remembered that part of the celebration includes the birthday child giving a little hand-made gift or natural object to all of her classmates... I had planned to have Jessie make little glass sun-catcher ornaments, but that was before the painting and the move dragged out for an extra week. What to do, what to do. As we are fresh out of Popsicle sticks, little magnets to glue and other ideas, Jessie and I headed back over to the studio to see what we could do.Picture, if you will, a glass studio at the tail-end of the most random, unprepared, chaotic move imaginable. Jessie saw a scrap of clear irid with black streamers in a box on the coldroom floor. I found and assembled the pieces of the Morton cutting system (the cutting oil was the hardest part) and cut the scrap into two-inch squares that we washed and dried. J sprinkled multi-colored frit on them... and then it was time for dinner.As I was waiting for J to finish dinner, with memories and input from Dave and the grandparents, I finished J's story and emailed it to her teacher. Then Jessie and I headed back to the studio where she put little copper loops in the corner of the ornament and covered them with colored circles. It took about 20 minutes to find the computer controller for the kiln (it was still hanging on the wall in the old studio) but eventually it all came together.And the day ended. Well, there was also a hot bath and a white Russian with Bailey's instead of cream in it.Postscript: I found the camera cable AND the fly-swatter so you get pictures and I get dead flies. Enjoy!Moving Bertha:Moving glass:New Studio in chaos:"},
{"title": "Insurmountable Obstacles On the Road to Imminent Disaster", "date": "Thursday, November 01, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug (in honor of the in-laws who arrive later today to celebrate their granddaughter's birthday with us), the quiet ticking of the clocks for music. I just noticed--after months of writing in this same spot every morning--that I am sitting equidistant between two clocks and they tick a fraction of a second off from each other. Time in stereo. (Makes sense that it would be just a fraction wouldn't it as they each tick every second.) And that pretty much sums up October: Time in stereo.I promised pictures today, but I also thought I'd be (more or less) moved by today. Not so. Pictures tomorrow and a full status report. I might even have an idea of the status for the report by tomorrow... But before I go any further, Thank you, thank you thank you!!!! to Dee Janssen for helping with the move yesterday and for committing to come back today for more. So the move, how'd it go? Well...Moving into a new space of any kind is... difficult for me--the title of the post says it all. I see it empty and waiting and I see all of the wonderful possibility in it, and I want to realize that possibility. So I paint and I build and I prepare. And I run out of time. In years past, running out of time meant that whatever was done at the moment time ended was what would get done--I never saw the possibility of work on it/finish it later. (I would have been a lousy candidate to paint the Sistine Chapel--for so many reasons!) In smart times I scaled my ambitions to avoid the disappointment of not being able to finish before the time allotted for prep was over. In not-so-smart times I rushed to finish and did a poor job at the end. With the new studio I've done something else. I started all the painting and prep--every room but one has been touched with a brush and the paint has been purchased for the final one--and when the time for prep ended, I put it down to go on to the next step, the move. I calmly set aside brushes and rollers and picked up the dolly and the UHaul.Even though the space looks even more haphazard than my spaces usually do on moving day (there were immovable objects placed in front of raw plaster in one room), it feels right. I will pick up brushes again again and paint this winter.  In only the instance of the raw-plaster-room will I be painting around objects. Every other unfinished space can be painted easily after moving. And all of the weaving words so far in this post has led to that idea, to that kernel of wisdom that it took me till now to get: Things don't have to be completed in perfect blocks. You don't have to eat all of your peas before you eat your steak and all of your steak before you eat your potatoes. I don't have to finish all the painting before moving--just the painting on the critical path of the move (hallways and the bathroom, e.g., can be done equally easily at any time).Let's extend this thought in the next couple of paragraphs, and we will get to the genesis of the New Move.A big part of the stress of the new studio for me has been that I couldn't wrap my head around moving all of the studio contents--even 200 feet. For a move to be a success for me, I have to have mapped out exactly where everything is going. And let's be frank, I don't even know WHAT everything is, much less where it is now, much less where it will go! I have over 20 years of equipment, experiments, tools tried, tools purchased on a whim to try, molds, stands, other materials, and glass sheets, glass scrap, glass, glass, GLASS!! It would take a year to plan the campaign of the move for everything.Then Dave, who got me through the book, who gets me through life, said \"Why are you moving everything now? Why don't you just move what you need now, and move the rest over time?\" \"Well, Because!\", I stammered. Because I eat all my peas before I eat my steak. Because I completely finish one thing before getting on to the next. Because it's never before been practical or even an option to do a partial move. But now it's not an option, it's a necessity. Yesterday with five people focused and dedicated (and a sixth when it came time to move Big Bertha) we moved maybe 1/3 of the studio. We moved three cases of glass with 12-13 to go. We might move one or two today, or we might not.Today the whole crew maybe minus one will be back to do it all again. The crew is all over 40 years old and I know I'm feeling every year this morning. I can only imagine how the guys--who did all the major lifting and carrying--feel. They'll be here in 45 minutes, and I'm no closer to a picture in my mind of what's going to happen when, what's going to get moved, where it's going to get moved to, where the stuff that's not getting moved is going to be stored, than I was for all of October. And yet, the move will go on nonetheless. It will go on competently, smoothly and efficiently. How? I don't know. It's a mystery."},

Today is a day that deserves a long, thoughtful, weighty post. Too bad. It's Moving Day and I have movers and helpers and a tow truck and its driver to wrangle (a tow truck!). I will, however, take time to say if you plan to use a UHaul truck to move a kiln like Big Bertha, perish the thought: UHauls trucks come equipped with a ramp, sure. but the ramp is only wide enough for a standard dolly (about 24\") which I discovered when I picked mine up at 5:00 pm yesterday. I guess they don't want you to really MOVE things with them. In the spirit of Mysteries and things just working out, Thomas is dropping by with his flatbed tow truck (with a BIG ramp) this morning to wrestle Bertha over to the new studio. I will take pictures and tomorrow will see a really great post. Promise. Now off to get Sprout and Spouse out the door for the day and to prepare for the onslaught of the horde."},

Yep, staring down the barrel of moving day. It looks to be a long hold. Of course it is 10/30--I couldn't move mid-month in an off-month. Now I've made a reservation and within an hour a rep will call to tell me where I can pick up my truck... I will not be a pessimist. I will not be a pessimist. I will not be a pessimist--this WILL all work out. (How? I don't know. It's a mystery*.)Today is the last major paint day before the move, and the office and kiln room must be finished. The shipping room is up in the air. I had the most ambitious plans of all for painting it, but that was before I took down half of one wall and patched it. The new plaster still hadn't dried by Sunday so I couldn't even prime it then. No painting at all got done yesterday**, so the room barely qualifies as a work-in-progress. I may have to punt to something easy for in there.----An hour or so has passed now and since I said everything will work out... The furnace and air man called, I can fire up the furnace (after shop-vaccing the ducts as best I can). The electrician will wire the air conditioner tonight and the furnace and air man will test it and run over the furnace again (now that the electricity and gas are on) on Friday. I pick up Dave at 4:15 from work today and then pick up a UHaul truck around the corner from Dave's work at 4:30. Tomorrow at 8:30 am the carpenter is showing up with two helpers to disassemble and move the big parts of the studio (Big Bertha, the work table, the frit storage, etc.). The helpers will also move boxes of stuff across the wilds of the back yard. So now I have to get over there and GET PAINTING! Pics and more... later in the week.*I started to write the quote from Shakespeare in Love here, but I think I'm just going to morph it into the Siyeh Studio motto:\"Allow me to explain about my business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. So what do we do? Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery.\"**Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away... At 12:15 yesterday I had a miraculous gift of time: I finished all the morning's tasks actually in the morning (how often does THAT happen?) and thought I might get a good chunk of painting done in the afternoon. ROFLOL. The time went... somewhere, and I headed off to get the Sprout at school for trick-or-treating at Turner Broadcasting. We got home exhausted (but happy) with hot pizza about 7:45 and everyone was in bed subsequently."},

{"title": "The 300 Lb Gorilla", "date": "Friday, October 26, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Denver skyline mug, \"Get Together Now\" covered by the Indigo Girls on iTunes. Today I am sore. Yesterday the plumber and his assistant moved the sink 200 ft to the new studio. I thought, \"It would be good, while they're here, to move the lap grinder over so I can see for sure where I want it to go and if it needs a new ice-maker line run for it.\" My first clue that it was not a good idea to move it by myself should have been when I had a lot of difficulty just getting it down to the end of the concrete parking pad in the back of our yard. I should have looked at the damp lawn and the soggy expanse of soil and water oak and pecan tree roots between me and the new studio and just said no.I should have looked at the little hill down through the gate and said \"It could fall on me and crush me like a bug. I think I'll wait.\". But I did none of these things and predictably, there was disaster. I got half-way across the yard of the studio and it overbalanced on the dolly and tipped over and off. Would have been okay if I hadn't tried to grab for it. On the plus side, it was my left arm I grabbed with and I'm right handed. I had to go ask the plumber's assistant if he would help me lever it back up. We got it on the dolly and he pushed and I pulled/supported it over to the ramp and up to the French doors (Thank You Dan the Carpenter!--we never would have been able to lift it into the studio). Turns out it weighs about 300 lbs. For comparison our washer--roughly the same footprint--is only about 185 lbs...What have I learned from the experience? That I am too old to move. I need to supervise. Yes, Bill, I will still move because I am alive. Fortunately for me, words can have more than one meaning and I am too old for the transitive instance of one of the meanings. Now I need to find a moving company that will think out of the box with me and move a few things on a truck and carry everything else. Or I need to skip the company thing and go for day labor and a U-Haul for a day... A few days ago I was hoping the logistics would just sort themselves out in my head. Hasn't happened yet. Instead I am squirrel-caging.The only thing I am really nervous about moving is the sheet glass (and Big Bertha). I do not have the time to pack the glass up in crates and have the crates moved (and possibly dropped or tipped over--happens every move). The solution is to move the sheets by hand--they aren't that heavy--but though I am good at that, it might make other people nervous to carry large pieces of glass across a bumpy lawn. And there are over 15 cases of glass in the studio (what can I say? I'm a pack rat.).*sigh* enough angsting. Off to Home Depot for some more paint, a mop, lightbulbs, and filters for our home furnace. It's getting time to change them and fire that baby up! Groundhog day continues..."},

I get a break in the monotony of painting today. Helmut the plumber is coming to move the big three-bin steel restaurant sink and the lapgrinder into the new studio. Well, he might not actually move the lapgrinder with me as he is a plumber, not a mover, but he'll run the water line for it.Yesterday saw the first of the final decorative paint coats down. I got two walls of the coldworking room (previously the kitchen) done. Had to so Helmut could move the sink. Today  sees the rest of the coldworking room and the final wall coat in the kiln room (and all the persnickety trim). I might get to the kiln room floor. That would be a real bonus. But it's Thursday which means gymnastics and ballet for the J so I have to end at 3:00. Well, I won't really \"end\" (I'm sure there was a collective sigh of relief there). I'll just put down paint brushes and rollers and the rest of the paraphernalia and maybe clean it all. Why is it that the cleaning prep and post takes more time than the painting and I don't even mask off?? I suppose if I didn't purify every roller, brush and tray it would take less time (and water--you're bound to waste one way or the other).It was tempting to post a picture of the papers I shuffled into neat little manila folders yesterday and filed in a cardboard box. The breakfast room (the current office since the real office is filled with so many piles of papers you can't see the desk) is tidy again. Huzzah. Now to order my metal, ship my last shipment till 11/1 and maybe get to painting before 9:00 (ugh)."},

I am possessed, consumed, by the new studio. I woke up today and I am Bill Murray.  The painting is interminable and I am back to having anxiety attacks in the middle of the night. Last night's episode *could* have been caused by overeating dinner at Babette's Cafe followed by dessert (blackberry and chocolate beignets) at Pacific Kitchen, but it could just be the fourth straight rainy, grey day of painting.Before I head out for today's paint-a-palooza, I have to ship three orders, slump a stray piece, order metal pieces from EMW, send in my VIP list for the One of a Kind Show, and shuffle other assorted papers. Does *any* of that sound enjoyable? Where is the playing with the vitrigraph kiln, experimenting with color, trying new mold-making techniques?SLAP! Oh just get over it! Sometimes I think I have the attention span of a flea. I lose sight of the long goal and get discouraged by a little drudgery. The studio will be INCREDIBLE when it's finished, and all the investment of time and money will be well spent. THEN Licha will come play with vitrigraph, and Becky will hang and make beads, and Dee will make molds (or is that Licha again?), and Leah will blast in the cabinet. There will be sunshine again and it will stream into the windows of an above-ground studio for the first time in five years (the last time I had a daylight studio was in Austin).I just have to get through the next couple of weeks and keep the faith that it really will all get done and END.

I had been thinking exactly that, and today looks to be more of the same. A dark grey drizzle day with a gentle susurrus of the leaves in the trees and the fountain in the little pond on the front porch... Holy Poo! I left the water running and overflowed the pond (I can hear the goldfish, \"Hurray! Down the stream and Freedom!\"). So it's going to be THAT kind of day, is it?I wish with all my heart it could be a curl-up-on-the-couch-under-a-cosy-throw-and-read-a-book kind of day. I am in the midst of the new Simon Green (The Man With the Golden Torq) and would love to throw responsibility to the wind and read all day (and drink green tea). Alas, big painting push. The schedule comes together and I have high hopes that by the end of the week the logistics of the move will have come together as smoothly as the logistics for the painting have.You might be saying to yourself, \"How tough can be it be to paint? You get a brush or a roller, slap the paint on, wash, rinse, repeat!\". That is painting for Other People. Here, as an example, are the steps in their proper order for painting the kiln room (all cleaning prep and dry times left out): putty the holes in the floor (plywood), prime the floor, roll the basecoat on the walls, cut the basecoat on the walls, putty the trim, prime the trim, sponge the first accent color on the walls, sponge the second accent color on the walls, paint the trim, roll the floor (with the accent colors swirled into the base), cut the floor, spatter the gold paint onto the floor, turn Jessie loose on the walls with the rubber stamps and the gold paint. Everything in a specific order.This is one room/area out of ten. The others aren't as complicated as this one--I'm mostly not doing the trim, just where it's new and this is the only floor I have to do. But all the rooms have a base color (or two) and one to four accent colors applied in various techniques including sponging on, woolie stamping, roll on/wipe off, and roll on cover with plastic wrap and pull off. The schedule is... intense. Dave, my beloved Igor, did most of the rolling over the weekend, and yet there is still a full week more.Okay, enough talking/writing. Time to do.

But the blog is a reflection of the person, and I'm a pretty in-your-face person so my definition of honesty still ventures occasionally into the realm angels fear to tread. Yesterday manifested a little dust-up that made it crystal clear that I do not have a future in politics or school governance. My foray into the PTA will begin and end with felt fish and no one will get hurt or go to jail (not that the current issue has anything to do with J's school or the PTA).The book has gone back to pre-order status on Amazon!

At least by the end of the day they were singing in loose harmony--of course I still won't have electricity till the end of the week and it's kind of hard to paint in the evenings without lights. I'm already on tenterhooks to see how badly I have muffed the gallery walls by painting them with only the light from dim windows. When 1000 watts of light goes up in there every single flaw in the painting will glare.If you want potted plants on your deck in the fall and you live in a squirrel-infested neighborhood either plant geraniums or get a spaniel. The squirrels have run rampant in my potted plants (the ones that mostly died while I was at the BMAC in August but sort of came back when we got rain) this fall, knocking many of the pots to the deck and smashing them to shards. The geraniums, however, they avoid. I am guessing because of the smell, and I bet mums would be the same. The weather is nice and cool though so I'm just leaving the back door open and every time a squirrel evens THINKS about playing on our deck Baxter the wonder spaniel is out the door gums and ears flapping.Have I mentioned glass yet? No? Not surprising. The last fuse load before the move goes in today, but I've decided to paint in the morning today to see if I can get more done than yesterday. Off to don the paint clothes."},

He loaded the bags from the back yard fine, but when he went to get the bags in the front he found the bottoms of all of them eaten out by termites. He found no evidence of termites in our under the house, but apparently they are alive and well somewhere in the yard (I am guessing that big old dead oak on the front corner of the drive--lots of the refuse came from there).I am not inclined to pay a pest control company $600 to treat and put up monitoring stations which they will then charge me $200 a year to check (they pull the bait out of the station and look to see if it's been nibbled on once every three months). We already do that with our house because, well, it's a new house and it was under a termite bond when we bought it. The studio has already had termites (old tunnels and damage found during the renovation) and had them cleared out. How difficult can it be? Now I wait for my father the entomologist to read this post and have my mother either call me or send me email and tell me whether I can take care of it myself or if I have to break down and hire someone.Math: A gallery in Florida I work with called and asked me to do a piece for a customer's custom stand for which the original piece had broken. The original spec said do a 19.5 inch diameter circle. But when I laid a 19.5 inch circle of glass over the template for the stand, it became clear the 19.5 inch measurement wasn't the diameter, it was a line crossing from one edge of the circle to the other some unknown distance from the center of the circle (see the drawing that looks like a happy face with underwear on its head--the solid dark lines are the sides of the stand, the dotted lines are the measurements I had, the thin line across the middle is the diameter of the circle).What to do? Well, most people either would have paid attention in high school math or just done a lot of little paper templates until one of them fit. I had a better solution: I am married to a mathematician. I called him. Turns out (a2 + b2)/2b is the answer. And the answer is a circle 20.125 inches in diameter. Heh.Money: It comes in, it goes out. Last week was a bit scarier as it went out in a flood and didn't come in at all. This week I got a flurry of checks and am solvent again (shoes for everyone!). Now I'm off to paint, and fuse, and paint some more."},
{"title": "Georgia Power... NOT", "date": "Monday, October 15, 2007", "text": "Turley Juvenile Zin 2005 in the Reidel stemless red wine glass, \"Adrenaline\" by Gavin Rossdale (from XXX) on iTunes. I usually post between 7:45 and 8:45 so I am right on target. But I am off target because it's 7:52 PM, not AM. Today, today... oh boy. Let me 'splain... no, that would take too long. Let me sum up.PTA meeting, check. Ikebana, check. New air conditioning unit installed (a honking big sucker), check. Kiln load in, check. Painting done (not much), check. Electricity on? Oh so NOT check.The studio is located in a house that is a bank foreclosure. It's been vacant for over two years so before the electricity can be turned on, it needs an inspection from the City of Atlanta. Add to that that I want to upgrade the service from 100 amp to 200 amp (can you say Big Bertha Mark II?) and we have inspections galore. It was tedious, but it is DONE (I have an INCREDIBLE electrician). So I call on Friday to ask Georgia Power to turn my service (finally) on. They say Monday, I say Okay! It's Monday. When no one has shown to light my fire by 2:00 pm I call again to make sure I am in the system. Sure nuff--sometime before 7:00 pm.Yawn. 6:00 pm and no one has shown and, hey, I KNOW no one is going to show up before 7:00 pm. I call again and I am told \"my service will be on within 3-5 business days\". I ask, 3-5 business days from when? From the date the inspection was finished? The day I put the order in? The due date? When?!? \"3-5 business days from the due date.\" So why call it a due date if it's not actually DUE for 3-5 business days?And while we're on the subject, it's the year 2007, people. There is NO reason why a power company--who presumably turns on electrical service for people as a primary part of their business--needs to have a 3-5 day window to perform a routine meter install, wire run. When I ask what the issue is, I am told it takes a truck and a crew and so it takes longer than a normal flip-the-power-on call. Okay, so it takes longer. You must know how much longer and you just schedule it WITHIN A PREDETERMINED WINDOW. You are a POWER company, you do this for a living. I am completely dumbfounded to be told that \"they could show up in 10 minutes or it could be 3-5 business days...\".The satellite dish company can give me a four-hour window for a complete install, why does the power company need 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS? I'll tell you why, they have the monopoly and, as the only game in town, they don't have to know what they're doing. The next time someone says socialized anything to me I think I might have to bodily harm them.Postscript from Dave: Poland 1983, a man in a apartment has an electrical issue and calls an electrician. The electrician comes and says, \"I think we can fix your problem. I'll put you on the list. It'll be three years.\". The mans queries, \"Three years in the morning, or three years in the afternoon?\" \"Why do you ask?\" \"Because the plumber said three years before noon.\"I'll regale you with termite tales tomorrow."},

The front and back doors are open and it is CHILLY. It's the first morning I have noticed it to be significantly colder outside than in. Fall must really be here, it's only 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).I failed to fountain. It's the first kilnforming project I've done that required relying heavily on glue--and watertight glue at that. I am just not comfortable with the leaking I'm getting and the wobbliness of the supports holding the middle stand-up in. Then there's the photography. FINALLY after taking all the photos for the article I found the self-timer button. Of course, I still couldn't get the flash to work at the end. Finally at 10:00 pm I threw in the towel and said better to have nothing than to have something half-assed.I'm already concerned that the edits to my article in the last issue make me look like an idiot (all references to Bullseye glass were removed from the article--not by me but for reasons I deem legitimate--but nothing was put into their place so it looks like I just say \"fuse a bunch of glass together\" with no thought to compatibility. Oy.) Moving on...iTunes is failing me right now. It's just too early for \"We Need a Little Christmas\" by Angela Lansbury (my spouse might argue that's it's ALWAYS too early, but that's another subject). Ah, \"This Shirt\" by Mary Chapin Carpenter. Much better.Today I begin all the ordes that aren't due for another few weeks. I have decided to move the studio beginning a week from Saturday and plan an opening party/book release party for Saturday, November 10. It's an ambitious plan, but I think we'll be ready. Just need to get those pesky orders out of the way first (and the more I make up, the less I have to move.

{"title": "Madness...", "date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Los Angeles skyline mug, \"I'll Work For Your Love\" by Bruce Springsteen on iTunes. And the morning begins. There're lots of little things I could post about today like getting the fountain article written for GPQ or making up kits of felt fish for J's school's fall festival--the bricks and mortar of the day. But what burns in my soul is a greater question: How should I paint the new studio?Yesterday I took the little chips I got form Home Depot over and assigned a different pale, safe, neutral color to almost every room. For anyone who has been in our house the color choices are likely to be a shock as the walls of our house are zinfandel, cinnabar, turquoise, cantaloupe, and a green between olive and lime--and that's just downstairs. Upstairs we have faux leather walls in the library, two-tone sponged yellow in the guest room, coral salmon in our bedroom and lavender in J's (and she wants to re-paint it in sea colors with a huge octopus on the wall like the Pirates of the Caribbean Behr/Disney paint theme).Maybe, to quote my favorite movie, playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like me can do. Last night we had dinner with friends Keith and Mike and when I told Mike I couldn't come up with a color to paint the bathroom that would go with the blah beige tile he suggested black. I got to thinking, and while I think black would be too strong, either medium brown with dark brown glaze or a darker brown with black glaze ragged, sponged or other faux-effect over it might be perfect. Then I thought of the tame light green I have planned for the office. What about a deep blue-green glaze colorwash ala Gaudi instead? And for the gallery room how about stark white with pale grey, black and brown marbling veins?Maybe, for the rest of the rooms, a simple colorwash is all that's necessary to make them vibrant, warm, welcoming and appropriate for a \"studio\". Heaven knows I have enough books on faux paint techniques, and there are tons of references on-line. I am tempted to try a shading technique in one room where increasing amounts of white are swirled into the base paint as it is painted and then wiped around the walls so it either lightens as it rises or lightens as it falls...This way lies madness and is what happens when I have a little extra time on my hands."},

The main double gate is across the drive, there will be a little walk-through gate to our yard in back, and another big double gate on the side of the drive at the end for commercial deliveries (no exterior handles on that one). Tomorrow morning the electrician meets with the city's electrical inspector for the final (hope, hope) inspection. Time to paint. Time to move.Today there are NO FIRINGS SCHEDULED. Wow. The fountain face I re-did yesterday for the GPQ article turned out well, and that's all I have going for a few weeks. To ensure that I won't squander this unusual free time I need to plan something for it. Otherwise in two weeks I'll look back and be just where I am now, and who wants to stay in the same place? It's okay to schedule it as time to read a bunch of books, re-plant the garden pots, something else non-glass oriented, but the point is I need to have *some* goals.Today's goal is to get the quickbooks set up on the laptop, work on FeSiO site and materials (new pieces shown here) and put together the suppliers list for the book.

Now it's time to plan the logistics of the move proper. I had set in my head that I wouldn't be able to move till mid December. But I am open for the next couple of weeks on the firing schedule, and the building prep is going on-schedule... Unfortunately, though I'd like to think about and plan it today, I don't think I'll get the peace and quiet. On the slate are the last fountain firing (still haven't gotten that one done), ikebana, drop off a piece to be drilled at Dixie Glasshoppers, take J to the zoo to see the baby panda (and all the other animals), supervise fence placement and tree removal.

Yesterday I managed to go over there only once (on my way to get the fence permit). The carpenter gave me my new keys as I checked in with him and with the electrician. Then I left them all in peace.

An asphalt something like an alley or a drive or a street or a parking lot. Who knows. Kudzu covers all sins. With the herculean efforts of Rudy and his backhoe, a small dump truck was filled yesterday and there look to be 1-2 more loads to go. I hope they go today. I didn't have absolute confirmation form Rudy that his boss is sending him back today...With all the concrete coming out there needs to be dirt going in so 15 cu yds (or two dump truck loads) arrive in 45 minutes. This afternoon at 4:00 (sharp) I go to city hall and get the permit for the fence. As a homeowner (with two copies of my survey and a checkbook in hand), I can apply in person today only between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm and walk out with a permit. The arborist is supposed to give me a permit to cut the two trees growing under the house on the east side tomorrow, the sidewalks are scheduled to be inspected for replacement, and the HUGE oak on the sidewalk and corner of the drive has been requested for removal. I would love to leave it, but it's growing in the sidewalk under the drive and two feet from one of the busiest roads in the city. It doesn't have a root system to speak of and is mostly dead. It's also between $1,200 and $2,500 to remove so the city better step up to the plate.Does this all sound like glass at all? Not to me either. But it's all part of acquiring and equipping a studio.

There are several spots where they spun their tires and sprayed dirt everywhere. But they got theirs. In the back of the yard, camouflaged by the summer's kudzu , is a pile of concrete rubble and cinder blocks. They must have thought it was just vines and hit it square on. Heh.

I'm sure there'll be a crisis Wednesday as we close on the studio property on Thursday at 9:00 AM.Also scheduled for Thursday are Ikebana (dress rehearsal for the Japan Fest exhibit), and gymnastics and ballet for J. I am guessing that between closing starting at 9:00 and ballet ending at 6:00, there won't be much glass done.Sweet harmony (listening to Elvis C. again), sweet Friday. The fountain project write-up for the winter issue of Glass Patterns Quarterly is due. I haven't started it yet. I'm using Armstrong Float Fire, Bubble Powder and float glass for the first time... There's my crisis in the making. Set-up for Japan Fest in the afternoon, an evening with J while D goes to the Drive By Truckers Friday night.Saturday work begins on the studio with the first electrical as a christening. Saturday is also Japan Fest, if we have enough energy to go. Energy must be conserved as Sunday is D's birthday and celebrating must be done. Fortunately I purchased the Great B-Day gift weeks ago and all I have to do is wrap it.Next week, while assuredly not easier (I have three people scheduled to work on the studio Monday including lot clearing and grading, fence and deck prep, door installation, AC repair, etc.), will at least be MORE FOCUSED. Glass, studio. Glass, studio. And it'll be October. I love October."},
{"title": "What's Lost Is Found... Sort Of", "date": "Friday, September 21, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the San Francisco mug, \"Tamarack Pines\" by Gorge Winston on iTunes. As can be told from the title, I found the missing piece. Um, actually, I never really lost it. It all started at 1:00 this morning with the thwap, thwap, thwap of the deerhound tail on the stairwell wall...An hour later after much cursing and swearing (there is a difference) and several trips downstairs to Deal With The Dogs, Seraph was consigned to the backyard for the night, Baxter was lodged in the studio, and the first floor smoke detector low-battery alert (which probably set the dogs off in the first place) was reset. You'd think sleep would be had. Nope.An hour after that I was Still Awake and really wired. I thought of the four lattice wall pieces and the two new tree-and-lattice wall pieces I need to have cleaned, ground, labeled and boxed for my driver to pick up this morning between 9:00 and 10:30 and take to Greenville so Bill at Elliott Metal can put them in the metal and crate them for shipping. I was worried that I wouldn't have enough time to get them ready after getting the Sprout out the door for school. I rose, donned the Black Thing (velour dress-like jammies--no nakedness in the studio... well, no nakedness for any length of time) and went to work. Good thing too--the above-mentioned tasks took until 5:00 am.In the process of the cleaning and assembling of the set of lattices that I believed to be short one piece I found... an extra piece. It wasn't that the lattices were short, it was that I had inadvertently stacked an 8\" square plate in with them giving me an odd number. Now the great mystery is who was the plate for and should it have already shipped? *sigh*Speaking of shipping, yesterday saw glass with a street value of $9523 go out the studio door. Another $2330 goes out today. Would that it all net 30 or credit card on ship orders. Sadly the bulk is consignment. And the dollar amount, while impressive, is not nearly as significant as the weight of it that I had to carry up the stairs from the shipping area in the studio annex (garage off the basement) to the UPS pick-up area (front porch). Oy, I ache today. I can't wait till I'm in the new studio and everything is on the same floor!Have a great weekend and be safe y'all."},
{"title": "Lost in America", "date": "Thursday, September 20, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Cloudy This Morning\" on iTunes. It's not random--I love the song and am feeling reflective (thoughts, not light). Yesterday was going really, really well--I was on top of my schedule and everything was getting done in turn--and then it all went to hell in a handbasket about 4:30 and I neither got the scheduled orders shipped nor got the scheduled fuse load in for the day. *sigh* I'm over my little melt down now and need to pick up all the pieces today.Today's topic is representation for an artist--having an artist rep. One of the orders I (now) ship today is going to a gallery in the midwest whose owner is also going to rep me through her area. Her cut is 15% of everything she takes orders on. 15% off of wholesale seems at first blush to be pretty steep. But I figured my cost of doing wholesale shows last night at 20%-30% of the take--and that's for the really successful ones. Makes 15% look not so bad.However both returns call my pricing structure into question. I believe I am charging what the market will bear, but I know I didn't figure marketing costs to be so high when I did the math on what to charge for my work. Makes me think (for the 3010th time) that we might be better off financially if I didn't work (or if I did something else). My sales increase substantially every year, but there is such a *huge* disparity between gross and net.I start thinking maybe I should do more retail shows--there's a clear profit margin there. With retail, you take your expenses (booth fee, travel, meals, etc.--typically not wages) and your sales and if sales are more than double the expenses, it was a profitable show. Double because you sell at retail which is twice wholesale, and making more than wholesale shows you were better off doing the retail show than just selling the work to a gallery for wholesale.Of course shows--especially retail outdoor shows--are exhausting. Set-up and breakdown are brutal and I am just getting too old for them. Right now carrying shipments up the stairs from the studio so UPS can pick them up is killing me--that and things like moving the 500 lbs of frit I moved the other day. And I'm not keen on giving up my weekends with my family so I can do more shows. It would be different if Dave got into the gypsy traveling show life (I snort coffee just thinking about him in a Winnebago. Can you say Lost in America?). Jessie would love it and she's getting to the age where she could actually help a bit (yep, child labor, my very own sweatshop), but I think I just need to walk away from the idea. Walk away slowly and no one has to get hurt.But, seriously, I think the answer really needs to be to make the wholesale side of the business profitable enough. If marketing costs are so high, prices are going to have to rise too. And if I can't sell the work for enough to make it profitable, maybe it's time to change careers again and become a landscape designer or a writer (fiction this time)."},
{"title": "Missing Pieces... Again!", "date": "Wednesday, September 19, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Gone to the Y\" by James McMurtry on iTunes. I don't know, it's random! The last three songs were \"Mission Bell\" by Fleetwood Mac, \"White Room\" by Cream and the morning started with \"The End\" by the Doors. You got me, man. If there's a theme, I don't see it. Unless it's \"Your day is going to be filled with random, unconnected events\". I don't have time for either random or unconnected this morning. I have utilities to request, a letter to get for termites, insurance to obtain--oh yes, and glass to fire and ship. Whew!Last night was date night--great sushi at Magic Fingers Sushi and \"Moliere\" at the Landmark Arts Cinema. I was really in the mood for a good foreign, period, romantic romp, and \"Moliere\" delivered just fine. \"Shakespeare in Love\" in French (need to watch that one again soon).When we got home I checked email (I'm obsessive that way) and found two more orders for signed copies of the book and a PO for a glass order. Time to update the firing schedule again! Okay, the song now is \"The Voice\" by I Robot. Time to move to a playlist, an organized theme before \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by the Alan Parsons Project or something else really weird comes on. There's some alien *stuff* on my iTunes. Thank you Bryon.And speaking of firing schedules... I am at my wit's end trying to figure out a way to efficiently manage my orders. I went to ship a big order on Monday and discovered I was short two bowls. I had one in inventory and the other I had fused for another order (shipping tomorrow) so I quick slumped the fused one for Monday's order (now to ship Tuesday) and fused another one for today's order. Went to ship Monday's order yesterday and discovered I was now missing two medium rectangular platters! None in inventory, none in process so I had to call and ask what the client would prefer I do--ship incomplete and pick up the shipping on the final two pieces Thursday, substitute something else, or wait till Thursday to ship. She picked wait so I fused the two rectangles in the medium kiln--Big Bertha was already way full--and will ship the whole order Thursday.The point is, I am *still* coming up short at ship time about one in every five orders. I think the weak link in my process is the firing schedule. All pieces ordered get put into the schedule and completed based on their size and colorway and whether a fuse or slump is scheduled for a particular day in Big Bertha. The medium kiln is primarily used for overflow and emergency firings (like yesterday), and the little kiln is for slumping 12\" bowls (I get a perfect slump every time in it due to the even heat all the way around) and small slump emergencies.Somehow I need a better way of checking off pieces as they come out of the kiln and not removing them from the schedule until they have definitely been counted. My spouse occasionally talks trash about writing software for me to manage part of my business process. Maybe I need to take him up on it now and get something that will manage the order processing from receipt to ship and invoice.In the meantime, off to update the schedule based on the past few days firings and add in the new order. Oh yes, and to insure and termite and util. Oy. And the piece I lost the day before yesterday? Still lost. Fugidaboudit. Made a new one yesterday. It was easier. (It's a relatively small piece)."},
{"title": "Lost", "date": "Tuesday, September 18, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Alaska skyline mug, \"Whipping Post\" by the Allman Brothers Band on iTunes. Yeah. Sometimes I feel like I been tied to the whipping post, good lord I feel like I'm dyin'. Evidence? I sat straight up in my mind this morning at 6:30 (my body remained recumbent, it wasn't about to move before it had to) convinced that I had programmed Big Bertha for a fuse firing (way higher temp) last night instead of for a slump and ruined the load. And that's not the worst of it.I lost a piece yesterday. Not lost as in I broke it or it broke. Lost as in, I know it was in the kiln, and then it wasn't. I was standing in front of the kiln unloading it, I lost a few moments, and I found myself with another piece in hand staring into the kiln and counting the remaining pieces. There was one missing. Had it been anything other than what it was I would have thought I just forgot to make it. But it was the bottom piece of one of the two lattices I fired Sunday--absolutely not possible that I didn't make it.I lay out all five panels in the lattice pieces together because I have to put the color down in a flow. I laid out two lattices at the same time Sunday so there had to be even pairs of pieces or I really would have noticed. I remember laying it out, it's not still on the prep table, I don't pick up from the prep table and lay down anywhere else BUT the kiln so it had to go into the kiln. Yet it wasn't there in the middle of the unload. Was it there at the beginning? It's the most likely scenario. Occam's Razor sides against someone coming into the studio annex (the garage--the big door was open) and taking a cooling piece (200 degrees) out of the open kiln while I was in the studio.Today I need to make two more lattice pieces... and a replacement panel for the missing one. Honestly, I looked all over the studio, the annex--even the house!--for half an hour before deciding that it would be easier to just make a new one. Where the heck could I have put it/it have gone?"},
{"title": "Growth", "date": "Monday, September 17, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Delirious\" by Prince on iTunes. The song is part of the compilation Uncle Bryon (in Austin) made for Jessie for her 5th birthday. She's a lucky girl. I'm not a lucky girl, I'm ex-haus-ted. Five kiln loads fired yesterday in three kilns--two of them fuses (which take more prep and more time than slumps do), and that's only the tip of the iceberg as I have 13 orders to ship or prepare for pick-up this week. Thir-teen. Looks like the new studio is going to be the enabler for the next step--Big Bertha 2. And it's time to order glass again--sheet and frit. I moved 500 lbs of frit around yesterday making it hard to believe I need more, but I'm going through it pretty fast.Siyeh Studio is having a growth spurt. I daydreamed again this weekend as I was cutting and prepping pieces about having an employee. Someone to refill all the 1 lb frit jars, cut all the bases for the pieces, crush the morceaux, wash and dry the fused pieces, pack and ship the orders. Ah, it's a grand fantasy, but for the time being it must remain a fantasy. Yes, there's a lot of work. More than I can do on some days and weeks that require working through the weekend, but I think that's more due to poor time management and scheduling (\"Well, I am pretty booked but I'll try to get that order squeezed in for you.\") than to a consistent demand-greater-than-supply on my time. If I were certain that the demand would continue, I might actually hire someone (now that I'll have a studio separate from our house). I did hear unofficially on Friday that I am going to get an order for 50 platters tomorrow with another 50 being needed in the next month. Talk about demand and time management...Good thing I have a lot of orders right now as the new studio means a lot of new expenses. For awhile I am going to need to pour everything that comes in right out into it. But the financial news is not all bleak; I had the property inspection on Saturday and the results were great! Things I didn't know about that could have been a big problem were already fixed (new floor joists and the existing joists shored up, new support beams in the attic for the roof), and it has a new furnace AND air conditioner--the compressor is missing from outside but the air conditioner was installed, and all new pvc plumbing.Since the structure is in such good shape I get to start right away on the improvements that will make it a studio. The electrician is going to put in a new meter and upgrade the service to 200 amps (it's currently 100). The carpenter is going to put french doors in the back bedroom (the kiln room) so I can get Big Bertha in the door (she's too wide for a conventional doorway). He's also going to put a deck with a ramp on it (adding handicapped accessibility to the property) outside the french doors as Bertha weighs about 600 lbs and needs to be rolled, not lifted, into her new home. Then he's going to put a doorway back in between the kitchen and the back hall completing the circular traffic flow through the building (why did they block up that door anyway?!?). Clearing the rubble from illegal dumping out of the backyard and fencing it all in, and removing dead limbs and dying trees (and trees growing against the house) round the work off nicely.Now back to electrical for a second for a discussion of lighting. This is a tricky one. I work with glass so I need lots and lots of light (I also have old eyes and don't see as well as I used to). The rooms have 10-foot plaster ceilings that are not in great shape and had an ugly 1970's texturing job done on them. Each room has a ceiling fan with a light fixture in it in the middle of the room. My options are can lighting--about 5-6 cans per room, or 8-foot fluorescent fixtures (I would probably move the ones I have in my current, windowless studio). The can lighting is good for re-sale, but I am thinking the ceiling is going to need to be redone before we sell anyway (redone as in a new drywall ceiling put in below the plaster ceiling--with 10-foot clearance there is a bit of room to spare), and the can lighting could be put in then. Decisions, decisions (money, money--there's the decider).Now off to work. Shipping, firing, ordering, oh my."},

Two-fold reason for the song/artist choice. The song is in honor of the bank accepting our offer (well, doing a little counter which we quickly accepted) for the new studio property! We close two weeks from yesterday. A real estate deal from conceived to done in just over two weeks. Gulp.The artist choice is in anticipation of seeing Mr. Dylan in convert for the first time from the 11th row center next Saturday night--Elvis Costello is also on the bill. Dylan is also playing at Stubbs in Austin tomorrow night and Zilker Park  for the Austin City Limits Music Festival Sunday. Too bad we don't still live there.Oh the train wreck that is my schedule right now. I can't WAIT till October when all the diverse things I have committed to have passed and I am back on a normal studio/firing schedule! Of course come October I'll also have a new property to be working on and a move to make. Got to think about the timing on that one. I have the One of a Kind Show to do in Chicago December 7-9 and a lot of work to get done for it. I also have a piece in the current Art Institute of Chicago holiday catalog and I'm not sure how orders will fall out from it. They kept me pretty busy last year and I don't want to be caught with my pants down/kilns unplugged this year. The smartest thing will be to plan the move for either before or after Christmas. Heck, I could take the last couple of weeks in December to pack and then move in January. As long as I'm ready for the BMAC in February (where I'll share a 20 X 20 booth with Elliott Metal Works in Inspired Interiors), I probably won't have much firing to do.And I don't have to move far! I'm just going to take down a section of fence and go through the back yards. As soon as we close (and I am over the superstition of jinxing the purchase), I'll do a video walk-over-and-through and put it up here. How cool is it that Blogger now lets you put video directly into your blog--no need to go through YouTube at all. Maybe I'll even do a video construction log of creating and furnishing a glass studio.Okay, enough fantasizing about things other than work.

Because of the no-Saturday thing, pieces that need to be to a gallery by the weekend--weekends being big business days for galleries--need to be out by Wednesday. Shipping Thursday gets it there by Monday and many of my galleries are closed Monday.Oh I'm popular, while on hold, Elliott Metal Works called. I bet they want to know how I'm doing with the pieces we're doing together for the model home in Asheville and the FeSiO pieces they are taking to the St James Court Art Show. At least on that front I have good news for them--yesterday I managed to combine almost all the slump pieces scheduled for two loads into one, freeing up Big Bertha for a full day. Three kiln loads slumped yesterday. Crappy pictures--the iPhone has no flash--but the quantity was too impressive to ignore.Today a meeting with the loan officer for the studio (where *are* the tax papers from the past two years...?), invoices (finally) out, Hoy's order (finally) in, yadda, yadda, yadda.

We offered market value, which is a good offer with all the properties currently on the market. But it happens to be *half* of the mortgage the bank foreclosed on. If they accept the offer it's grim evidence of the state of the real estate market and the effects on banks of all the foreclosures--and good news for us.With the onset of fall come lots of parental duties--playdates to schedule and convey child to, gymnastics lessons, ballet lessons, PTA meetings, school functions, modeling assignments (really)--the list seems endless.

Oh how behind can I get? When Thursday is an Ikebana day I always lose a bit of work time, but today is Ikebana, gymnastics AND ballet for the J (I have to get gymnastics switched today). It's also a scheduled fuse day and I have a ton of calls and bookkeeping paperwork to unsnarl. Apparently everyone at Bullseye who works with my account is new. I found out (from accounting) the day before yesterday that my \"new\" sales rep was no longer there and the one order she did process for me in May appears be snarled up with some of it past due. Bookkeeping called me at almost 7:00 the other night not knowing enough about my account to notice that I am on the east coast and therefore three hours later than they were... Yes, I was working, and yes, I answered the phone. But if I am still working at 7:00 something has gone very wrong and I don't have time to chat.Now it's time for a bit of a soap box. When we evaluate a company for a business relationship we take all the incoming data, all the sound bites we can get, and we form a picture. I have been using BE glass for over 20 years--to this point it's almost all I've used. I've been loyal to the point of ignoring sound bites and resisting the lure and temptation of shiny, flashy promises by other manufacturers--good solid developments from other producers not even making it onto my radar. I've also been dealing directly with the BE factory for awhile now as I need frit in 5-lb quantities, I like BE's molds, and my long-time wholesale supplier (Ed Hoy's) doesn't carry all the molds or frit in that size.But now I am disgruntled enough that it might be time to do an evaluation and maybe move on. So what's going on? Lots of things that I am not going to go into here. The negative energy I have generated so far this morning by STARTING to write it all up has me so enervated that I am just going to drop it. Suffice it to say that everything I have seen in print (oh the beauty of the InterWeb), heard from other businesses and artists, and recently experienced in my (lack of) customer service interaction indicates that the business priorities of my glass producer no longer seem to mesh with my needs of them as the primary source of my materials.For the second day in a row I have not ended posting on a positive note, and I don't feel better about my world. Writing almost always makes me feel better about my world. *sigh* Six orders to get out today. Niche to finish or not. Oh yes, and Ikebana and gymnastics and ballet oh my.

The other slump (a 12\" bowl) thermal shocked during slump so I have to fuse a new one today and slump it first thing tomorrow for shipping.This morning before heading off to Joe's I sneaked in another little casting experiment. *sigh* The deadline for Niche is Friday and I am still futzing with maybe-I-ca-do-its. Got to LET IT GO THIS YEAR! I have six orders to ship today and tomorrow, and tomorrow also sees the next batch (due next week) going into the kilns for first firings. There really isn't time to squeeze in Niche AND GPQ (see below).I'm also speeding toward deadline time on my next article for Glass Patterns Quarterly. As I promised Maureen I would not only do the project but would also create an outline of my project proposals for future issues, I need to get moving.Okay, now that my anxiety attack is back and FULL BLOWN, I need to get working. Posting is supposed to be a mind-cleanser and organizer. I am NOT supposed to finish tied up in knots. That's what you get for planning. No wonder I spend so much time flying by the seat of my pants. What'll get done'll get done whether you plan to do it and do it or just do it. And if you just do it you don't have time to get anxious about how much there is to do."},

It's Tuesday, but it's Monday because it's the first everybody-work-everybody-school day, but it's Tuesday because it's already later in the week than Monday. Whatever. Ants are everywhere this summer. They're even in the fridge (and the freezer! They die there and leave little shriveled chitinous exoskeletons). Monster cockroaches (the big outdoor wood roaches also called palmetto bugs) coming in under the door strips at night--just in time for me to find them on the way to bed. I squeal, I scream, I whimper and squeek, and I smash them with books as I dance in the effort of keeping all the feet off the floor at the same time. Dave disposes of the carcasses. I am not fond of the  wildlife of the south. Give me a good old Montana black or grizzly bear any day. They mostly stay out of your coffee.First day since being back on that I don't have a fuse load scheduled. Slump and ship today. Inventory, order and sweep. Straighten. All the things I thought I might get to (vague hand-waving) other days. And a visit to one of the two local galleries where I have consignment work. I just finished heavily stocking them, even over-stocking them. And I was smote, smited right on down. In the middle of the night Friday a large, heavy painting fell off the wall over the glass table holding the majority of my glass work. The table broke, much (most? all?) of my work broke.The gallery has insurance, but they also have a bit of teensy tiny fine print of which they were unaware which classifies glass as a breakable and only covers it for fire or theft. The owners were most distraught to to learn of the fine print. They assured me that they'll pay for everything... but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. It was an accident. They are a new business struggling to get established. I don't know. I just feel like it would be taking advantage of bad circumstances to get a \"sale\" from this. On the other hand, it's hard for me to take the hit too. I think I need to see how bad it is before I make a decision.Okay, 8:43 am and posting is done.

Today sees four kiln loads--two slumps, two fuses including a *full* (as in packed to the gunwales) fuse load in Big Bertha.Now to wax reflective, mournful and philosophic--all in turn.July and August didn't exist for me. I look back on the summer and I see scheduled bits--the BMAC, vacation in Montana, and I have little memories of them... but they are little island vignettes in the vast Sargasso sea of the nothingness of being that was the summer. Come to think of it, I don't remember June much either. I remember acknowledging the beginning of summer in May. I remember enjoying all the pots of flowers and ferns on the front porch and the back deck. All but of few of those pots now overflow with dead, brown twigs grown moldy from the recent rains.I cast back and I can't find an anchor in what was the summer. There is no binding holding everything that happened together. Jester's illness and death are the mist shrouding August. The extreme exhaustion from post ACRE and editing the color lasers for the book obscure June. As I spent much of my life on the educational calendar, summer was always the golden time of relaxation and recharge. And while it is true that I am (finally) recharged, I had to sleepwalk through the summer in order to achieve it. What a waste.The past few days I have plugged back into the grid. I caught up on all the blogs I read. I updated my professional Amazon profile, I read and replied to a lot of posts on warmglass.com, I updated the Siyeh Studio main page and created a bibliography/library catalog of my glass books on Amazon as the Listmania List Glass Essentials (and linked to it on Glass Incarnate).Now I'm off to get all the kiln loads in. I need another apprentice. Carol is very busy with her law practice and doesn't have time to hang with me on Fridays, and I am getting tired of refilling my 1 lb frit jars (from the 5 lb jars) and crushing and screening my own morceaux. Not to mention straightening, cleaning and organizing. I am *such* a slob!This afternoon I am reviewing a couple of the potential studio properties and looking at three new ones. I should go to Best Buy and get a new digital camera, but that might have to wait till another day (maybe tomorrow). Though the big sales only go through today...Tomorrow I will view the damage and post about a gallery glass disaster my work suffered last week. How much it costs me, I have yet to determine.

I am waiting for my extreme fatigue to be over and chafing that it hasn't yet passed. Maybe this weekend will do it. How can I be THIS tired when I just had two weeks vacation? I must be getting old...Looked at another potential studio space yesterday, very cute, very tiny. The lot the house is on is only 52 X 65 and there is enough room for a small garage on one side of the house... It's a VERY tiny house, probably too small for a studio, but so cute! And our ownership of it would qualify Jessie for a very desirable school district. Doesn't life get complicated with children? I like the Waldorf School so far, but there are some things that make me crazed (they always wear rain boots and hats when outside--even on sunny warm days, even in the shade, even when climbing trees) and the tuition is not insignificant.But today is about the old studio, not the new one. I have been invaded by dust bunnies of the largest kind, so after I get the kilns loaded and firing, I am going to clean. I'm also going to find new homes for all those empty 5-lb frit jars! There are now 8 full garbage bags full of them. Enough is most emphatically enough.This weekend is the Labor Day weekend and I wish I could say I am taking it all off, but I will need to fire every day. Yesterday ended up being all about life--Ikebana, groomer, ballet, teacher meetings, friend for dinner (he was tasty--just kidding!), volunteering for the PTA (how the heck did I do THAT?!), etc. Today will be shipping, firing, cleaning, finances, advertising, new camera (got to take a picture of the new lattice piece in Ocean on white) and more cleaning (twice as much cleaning as anything else).

Thanks to Daniel Waldman and the Rosen Group for the mention on Wholesale Matters Tuesday!Back to Ikebana for the first day in weeks today, need to make a bank deposit, the two dogs go to the groomer, and J starts ballet. None of that is glass, and it's a full day in the glass studio too. Three orders to start today. In a perfect world they would ship tomorrow, but as I need two days of firings for them, that's not going to happen. Thanks to the holiday weekend they won't ship till Tuesday.Fruitfully worked out the beginnings of the co-booth design with Elliott Metal Works yesterday as well as the work flow for our new joint venture FeSiOart.com  (fay-zee-O). Next week I have to squeeze in a Joe's day to get the preliminary website done. I brought home one of the new lattice pieces yesterday (we've beefed up and padded the stand-off mounting system since the BMAC) and I need to see about getting pictures of it of quality for a NICHE submission. The deadline has been extended. I think they're just taunting me.Fruitlessly drove almost to Asheville to see the model home we're (Siyeh Studio and Elliott Metal Works) doing pieces for. The gallery staff was not able to meet us at the last minute so the closest I got to scoping out the space was peering in the windows. But the designs Elaine has come up with are fabulous and are going to be great additions to the FeSiO line (and really fun to do).Was so exhausted last night I retired to bed with the iPod and an audio book at 8:30. Lights out at 10:00. Except for having to get up to let a dog out at 2:00, slept the whole night, nary an anxiety attack in sight.The horse that is the day is chomping at the bit. Time to get riding.

It's a philosophical morning in the studio. Maybe it's the impending purchase of a new studio space and the accompanying financial commitment, maybe it's the result of catching up a bit on my corner of the world on warmglass.com, amazon.com, and cnn.com yesterday, but whatever it is, I am the doe and I pause and sniff the air nervously before stepping into the meadow.To my general unease, warmglass.com contributed postings on studio (and gallery) closings and who \"makes a living\" from glass and do they do it alone or with help on warmglass.com. Amazon.com randomly put the books  \"Seven Years to Seven Figures: The Fast-Track Plan to Becoming a Millionaire\" and \"Girl, Get Your Money Straight: A Sister's Guide to Healing Your Bank Account and Funding Your Dreams in 7 Simple Steps\" up on my Amazon page so I would see them when I updated my blog there. CNN.com yesterday went on and on about the glut (16-year-high number) of houses on the market and the 12-month low for prices (this after a couple of weeks of subprime mortgage crisis news and the repercussions from it) and this morning they want me to \"Retire Happily\" and inform me that the search for self-worth and emotional changes can tarnish my golden years...

Methinks I need to stay off the Net for awhile.Letting go of the big picture and putting on the blinders which keep me safe in my little world, I need to find a use for dozens (hundreds?) of empty Bullseye 5-lb frit jars. I cannot bear to throw or recycle them--not when they beg so eloquently to be re-used, but I have no use for them and I am tired of knocking over the mountains of them as I wend my way through the studio. And now that Seraph is gracing me with her presence and her 32\" swooping hard tail in the studio every afternoon (and chasing Baxter around in it) they are all over the floor more often than not. Maybe J's new school...Today is a slump load day as I prepare to ship two orders tomorrow. Tomorrow I also go to Greenville and Asheville  so won't be posting in the morning (I am just not alive enough at 6:00 am these days to write more than \"garm whahl urrr\"). Going up north to review a model home FeSiO is providing pieces for.FeSiO... another new topic (and thanks to Dave for the name). We (Elliott Metal Works and Siyeh Studio) needed branding for the collaborative work we're doing together. It was getting confusing for galleries to know who to order from, and we also wanted one place to showcase just that work. Enter fesioart.com. I got tagged with the website development... One more site to create and maintain (bringing me up to three and three blogs--including the Amazon one--oy!). In addition to a website we need a product-developemt plan. Right now we all have lots of energy and lots of ideas and if we just keep going we'll be all over the map spinning our wheels. I am not looking for seven years to seven figures, but a little organization won't hurt.Now off to bag up those empty frit jars, inventory the full ones, get in an order to Hoy's and cut the pieces for  the rest of the week's fuse loads.

Now I wish I could call them back and have one more \"stay at home\" day.We all got a late start this morning--I was the first to wake at 7:47 and then it was a mad scramble for Dave to get out the door with J in her new lace-up sneakers (I taught her to tie her shoes this morning!) with all her gear for her two classrooms (changes of clothes in cloth bags, fuzzy socks for slippers, rain pants, rain jackets, pillow, blanket and soft toy for the afternoon class), breakfast and lunchbox.It's the first day of the first full week of \"fall\". I know it's August and therefore still summer no matter how you slice it, but school starts in the fall, school has started, ergo... And it is a bit cooler this morning at 72 degrees (22 C). It's also the last week before the NICHE submissions are due, and I'm not going to make it this year. Time to surrender the fantasy and move on. Finally, it's the first full week back after a crazy month traveling. Time to knuckle down in the traces and start producing again... but I'm so tired! Still on Mountain Daylight Time I guess.The new studio becomes more of a reality this week. I am putting the final touches on the financing and might even get an offer in--though I guess I better review the space on paper one more time to make sure there's room for everything (the sandblast cabinet, e.g., looms). I've even started looking for a used van--though my mechanic isn't holding out much hope of finding one for me. Anyone know someone who has one that might work for me? Some artist retiring or not traveling anymore?Before we all fall asleep reading (writing) the little details of life in the studio, I need to jump into the big news: The fall issue of Profitable Glass Quarterly is  out and I have an ad for the book on the inside back cover. The fall issue of Glass Patterns Quarterly will be out soon and I have both an article and an ad in it. Both ads are for the book, and I have to laugh--I have so spent any possible revenue I might see for this book, first on materials and tools for making the projects and now on advertising for it. But way back in the beginning  knew I would be writing it \"for fame and glory\" rather than any financial gain so I'm not surprised. Yet to come are my ads in the September issue of Fired Arts & Crafts and November's (or December's?) Crafts Report. All are for the book but the last one which will feature one of the new stands... assuming I can get a decent photo.Now off to post on warmglass.com  in the classifieds about the book--and to solicit for suppliers for the on-line suppliers lists (the publisher does one and I'll have one on my website too).

He was only home a couple of days before he had to go back to the vet because his wound was opening up. He has had several more surgeries--including new skin grafts--since then and he now has a perforated ulcer from all the anti-inflammatories he's been on (that was this week's surgery).

I am barely, sluggishly awake. It seems to be 9:00 am here in Polson, Montana which makes it 11:00 am in Atlanta. I can't remember the last time I slept till the equivalent of 11:00 am. It is officially VACATION here in Siyeh Studio, but I missed posting on Tuesday after the Buyer's Market as I drove till midnight Monday and left at 6:30 am Tuesday for a full day driving and unloading. And then Wednesday I was so busy with only-day-before-vacation appointments and shipping two really big orders that I never got to it. Yesterday I was on a plane much of the day (up at 4:15 am and at the airport by 5:30) and then driving from Missoula to Polson, unpacking just enough to find the swimsuits and head for the lake. Ah, bliss.So I must begin today with a bit of work, and, as a treat to myself, I post. First, a review of this year's Summer Buyer's Market. It was a GREAT show for me. After the disappointing sales at ACRE in May, the seemingly very light traffic at the summer BMAC, and the historically lower sales numbers at the summer show as opposed to the winter show, I did not have high expectations for August in Philly. But orders on Friday were good, as they were on Saturday. Sunday morning I was within striking distance of matching 2006 summer sales. My goal was to increase by 10%, and my stretch goal was to increase by 20%. I hit the 20% goal by 2:30, and I will never grumble about the show going to 4:00 pm again as I did 28% of my total sales between 3:30 and 4:00 resulting in 85% increase in sales by the close of the show over last summer and 98% of total sales--pre, during *and* post sales numbers for the 2007 winter show. And I don't even have post figures for the summer show yet, have to wait a month or so to see what else comes in. It was a *very* good show.Best sellers were the new work with Elliott Metal Works--both the lattice pieces and the new stands. I had a 10 X 20 booth and put even less in it than I usually do in 10 X 15 spaces, and I think it was my best booth ever. I still haven't replaced my digital camera so this photo was taken with the iPhone. It's still a pretty good shot.Wednesday, after a hellish day driving Tuesday, I shipped out the first of the orders from the show. One of my best customers, who has three galleries, asked if he could have many of the pieces I had at the show and get them shipped to two of the galleries before  I left for vacation. It was over 90 degrees in the shipping annex (aka the garage) and it was a very complicated order, but I think I got everything sorted out okay. Fingers crossed for today's delivery to both locations.Now today I need to send out printed order confirmations to everyone who placed orders (my handwriting and math at the show are both terrible), and I need to put together my ad for November's Fired Arts and Crafts magazine. I suppose I should be asking my publisher to cover some of my advertising costs--the ad is for the book, after all. Then, vacation. Flathead Lake, Missoula, Glacier Park, bliss, bliss, bliss. See you in two weeks!"},

No coffee yet (I just can't do the little hotel powdered packets), the rumble (and vibration) of morning traffic in the street below is today's music. It's the final day of the summer BMAC. After a blistering set-up, today for breakdown it's expected to be much cooler--though we risk thunderstorms. *Sigh* I'd rather the heat than the wet.I believe I have my best booth set-up ever. Many of my customers and other artists have commented on how great it looks. The only downside to it is that I had to put all the cardboard boxes for the stands back in the car as I have essentially no booth storage. There's got to be a booth solution that feels open, holds all the work, has storage... and doesn't cost a small fortune!For the show itself, sales Saturday were good--much better than expected. Of course I always expect to do nothing the first day so it can't be said I have high expectations. Yesterday I took enough orders to put me within reach of last year's sales. My goal is to increase sales by 10%, stretch goal of 20%, and I just might not make it. I know I have one account who wants to re-order and hasn't been by to do it yet.New this show for me: I had everything priced and all the packets out before opening on Friday. That's the first time I've ever managed that, and this show it was crucial as I am in the first aisle on the right and the buyers stream like lemmings down that aisle first. So far I've handed out about 20 packets. They include a wholesale price list, an artist info card, a best-selling packages recommendations, an order form, a business card, and two postcards showing current work. Orders from people who picked up packets have run at about 5% (1 out of 20). We'll see if more of them bear fruit today.Today's focus is to get through the slowest day of the show (I *really* hate having it on Monday) and to get efficiently and quickly packed and on the road. The show goes till 4:00 (it should be 3:00) and then I have to breakdown, load up, and get south of DC tonight so I miss tomorrow morning's rush traffic.And what else is there to say? The glamorous artist's life on the show road is more like a scuffed house slipper than a Manolo Blahnik stiletto. Dinner has been room service or out with another artist or two. I could've tried to to get set up faster and done a tourist thing, or I could've planned a great meal out. But let's face it, I hate business travel anymore. If Dave and Jessie were here it would be different. But as long as I have to leave my family at home, it's just another work comittment.And speaking of home: Jester broke open a couple of stitches yesterday so Dave is having to wrestle him back to the vet today (in a friend's loaner car) in addition to the normal load of Sprout wrangling. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make this one up to him."},

Last day of of set-up dawns bright and already hot (77 degrees). Yesterday went extremely well. The car was unloaded by 1:30 and the walls were up by 2:30. It took quite a bit longer than I thought it would to get them up and it's going to cost somewhat more than I thought it would/should, (I hate paying by the hour for exhibit hall services) but that was the *only* dark cloud in the day.Before I left last night I had the carpet, the overheads for the lights, the lightbars, the tables, the sales cabinet and all the pedestals up. Today hanging panels, draperies, tablecloths, cleaning the pedestals, lights and glass. The display set-up (of course) is completely new. There's no French wall back area--all 200 sq feet are open. I also have a 2 ft X 8 ft grid wall panel covered with foamcore in the front corner of the booth where I will hang one of the new wall sculptures. I don't have enough storage room for all my boxes, but Dee said I can put them in her booth (she has tons of storage) or I can just put them in the minivan.And speaking of the minivan, I am going to tell a big secret here. The loading dock for the Philadelphia Convention Center has a block-long ramp down to street level. At one side of the bottom of the ramp is a little outdoor parking lot. It's not only the cheapest parking in the area, but you pay at a machine in advance and just put the ticket in the window. I leave my vehicle there the whole show after unloading. It's even possible, when the line to get into the loading dock after the show is too long, to wheel your dolly down the ramp and load directly into your vehicle. And if you load into your vehicle in the lot, there is one holy grail spot at the end of the first row, right at the bottom of the ramp. Of course this spot was already taken when I parked yesterday, but as I was walking toward the ramp the owner of the car in it was getting in his car. I asked him in disbelief if he were leaving and when he said yes, I raced back to the minivan and quickly bogarted his spot. The only bad thing is that now I can't run to Home Depot for extension cords or anything else. Hope I have enough.Okay, enough writing and procrastinating in the air conditioning--time to go set-up in the heat!P.S.--Jester's second surgery went well and he is expected to come home Saturday."},

All my bags are NOT packed, but the car almost is and that's the bigger part of the battle. Out today by 10:00 am. When I finish the post I'm going to call UPS to find 0out where my info cards are. I'm sure I'll hear they're in Antarctica or some such. *sigh* ImageMedia is losing points fast. Telling me that two-day air means before 10:30 am when it really means before end of day because they don't want to spring for even more shipping charges after screwing up my order.But looking forward... Off to Philly today with Bill and Elaine of Elliott Metal Works. We're caravaning up together as I have to stop by their place anyway (I have glass for them, they have metal for me), and I'm driving alone. I have a lean mean set-up for this show. Even with all Dee's stuff, the car is very lightly packed. I'm not taking any Cloudstone, Pop Art or clear textured pieces. It's all Morceaux de Verre and spread out in a 10 X 20 space. I hope this isn't a mistake. But I think I made the right choice. I want to concentrate on the glass and metal work (the new stands), and though the rest might sell better to the summer buyers (historically I've seen more local gift market buyers than big buyers from far-flung galleries), I have to do what you do if you stay on the pot.Freebird ended and \"Jessica\" by the Allman Brothers is now playing. It's another long song so I might actually finish with it.It was weird to have the car mostly packed last night. All I have left are my clothes, the toolbox, the tech (printer, iPod, laptop, cables, phone, chargers and cables) and the paper (show docs, hotel docs, blank materials for creating show packets). I do have to get my two-show contract for next year's BMAC's post-marked today which means I need to scan the slides I got from Bart. Off to do that next before hitting the road.Jessica is only half done and I am ready to go! Tomorrow late (or maybe Thursday), live from Philly. Be safe."},

It was a weekend, a little slice of life with all the highs and all the lows, and I am putting it up in Stranded in the South as the bigger posts this morning. Now I gird my loins and get ready to leave for Philadelphia tomorrow. Because of Life over the weekend I was in the studio till 1:00 am last night and the night before (load from Saturday shown--photo courtesy of new iPhone) getting the firings in. Today I tidy up paperwork (bills, show applications, ads, etc.,) and then I begin to pack. I probably won't load the car till tomorrow morning as I don't need to be on the road till 10:00, but, then again, why not get a jump on it for once?I have a niggling feeling I've forgotten something important that I have to do today, but for the life of me I can't think what it is. I know I want to get my new laptop bag with the Siyeh Studio logo embroidered on it from my friend Michael (it's a gift). I can't wait to see it! And I'm going to swing by one of the potential studio properties I looked at to measure the rooms (give me something to think about while I'm in Philly). If I have time, I might even squeeze in a pedicure. Might as well dream big!"},
{"title": "Saturday", "date": "Saturday, July 28, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans skyline mug, my daughter asking her father why it is so quiet and him replying \"We like it that way.\" as my background music. It's Saturday. As such, it's not a typical Glass Incarnate day. However it's also three days before I leave for a major show, and, hence, a work day.Haven't picked up my slides from my photographer yet. Since he said they didn't turn out and are probably not usable, there hasn't been much of a rush. But I need to get over there today to see if there is anything worth salvaging and to pay him for his time. I also have a load to fire, next year's BMAC contracts to get in, a book ad to create, and the rest of my advertising deadline schedule to figure out for the year. gack. Oh yes, and the dog to collect from the vet (fingers crossed--no word yet this morning).It's a grey, still, humid day out there. That's pretty much what I feel like inside too. Our household is being ravaged by some kind of intestinal bug that leaves me feeling lethargic, crabby, and not the least like eating. J is whiny (I grit my teeth) and lethargic (thank heaven she has a play date this afternoon--something to get her moving and occupied). Only Dave seems to be more or less his usual taciturn weekend self.Since I didn't sit down to write and whine, I had better get on with the day. Tomorrow a perky post!"},
{"title": "It's Friday, WIll It Be Fun?", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Washington DC mug, \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John on iTunes. I feel a bit raw and bruised this morning (mentally, spiritually) and out of sync--just like the characters in Almost Famous on the bus the morning after the band fight in the midwest, the subsequent party with the teenagers ending in a swan dive into the swimming pool... Maybe singing along will give me the same uplift and healing it gave them. On the other hand, life isn't a movie. *sigh*Do I seem just a wee bit scattered this morning? Real estate shopping will do that to you. The owner of a small business is the conductor of the train. The business is set on a rail-like path and goes forward as fast as the owner drives it, much like the train. Real estate shopping is a bit like getting off the train, hopping in a car and whizzing cross-country for awhile before coming back to the train, still waiting patiently in the station. The train has not moved in your absence because there was no one there to move it. A business, like a train, needs to keep moving. Two days of nothing happening in the studio might be bad (who knows where I am--I still haven't done my firing schedule for this show yet!) and definitely makes me anxious--especially a few days before a show. I still haven't done any more than inventory the work I have on hand--I haven't made a single new thing.Yet there was no better time to go looking. Between the BMAC, Montana and BMAC orders I will probably be booked now through September. If I'm not, affording a studio at all becomes an issue. Today, though, I am back grounded in the here and now. I have to compartmentalize and put all thoughts of new studio space out of my mind. Focus on the show and what I need for it. Dee is bringing her stuff down today (I am driving stuff up for another artist--a jeweler so not big stuff. She flies and helps with the gas money and the unload on the other end) and I am finally shipping two orders and firing up Bertha for the first of at least three loads pre-show.Jester (on the left above, his sister Seraph is on the right) is doing well after his surgery yesterday. They grafted a piece of skin from his stomach over the lower part of the wound on his thigh to cover it. They had to turn the skin so they said the hair might grow in upside down. My question is, who could tell?!? He comes home (hope, hope) tomorrow with a follow-up visit on Monday to have a drain removed from the wound. Then it's either convalescing at home or our local vet, depending on how much he needs to be monitored.I just added a photo of him with Jessie to give a better idea of his size. He looks kind of puny in the pic with Seraph and he is 130 lbs of lean muscle and bone. The vet told me yesterday that he weighs more than she does.Now off to figure out what I have to do today to be ready to go on Tuesday..."},
{"title": "Big Day", "date": "Thursday, July 26, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Denver skyline mug, \"Into the West\" by Howard Shore (from the Lord of the Rings) on iTunes. For now it's just my spirit that goes into the west, my body is short-term and long-term bound for the east. Today I am off to look at more little house waiting, hoping to become studios. The neighborhoods I am looking in are filled with tiny bungalow and ranch homes from the 30's, 40's and even some early 50's. The homes have open, flowing floor plans and hardwood floors throughout. The neighborhoods are all shabby genteel inner city girls who are starting to shake their skirts, fluff their hair and strut into the desirable first-time-home-buyer market. Some are already renovated--and still reasonably priced, and some need a bit of work. It's a smörgåsbord (hey, notice all the little dots and doohickeys on that word? I have a *really* nifty spell-checker--it even corrected \"doohickeys\"!).So what am I looking or in a studio now that the world is my mollusk? Well, the internal necessities are: a kiln room that can be closed off (it gets mighty hot when Bertha is all fired up) and that has a big enough door (or double doors) to get Bertha in and enough room for all three kilns, a work table and all the mold storagea wet-room/washout area for the restaurant sink, saws and grindersa room for shippinga frit layout area for my wall of fritan inventory rooma main work area that will hold my cutting table and maybe all the glassa small officea teaching areaa room for the sandblasting set-upa photography rooma small gallery area to display current work and use for a studio open house a couple of times a yearWhew! When I look at it in the detail, that's a lot of space! I currently have the 30 X 14 I indicated yesterday, and the majority of the 20 X 20 garage, and a 10 X 10 photography area in the craft room. Everything I have fits, but as anyone who's been in my studio will tell you, there's no walking room. There are paths through piles, and the \"wall of frit\" is daunting all by itself!Okay, Stacy's here and we gotta go! The fridge gets delivered today, Jester has surgery this afternoon (he's doing *really* well--more on him tomorrow), it's a full day!"},
{"title": "Studio Shopping", "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Los Angeles skyline mug, \"Choctaw Bingo\" by James McMurtry on iTunes. I hate being sick. All day yesterday my innards let me know they weren't happy and didn't want company so I didn't eat. I also didn't move around much. I did get a couple of loads fired--including an overnight turnaround on a couple of pieces for a local gallery that they'll pick up this morning. Other than that about all I got done was updating the Locations page on my website. This morning, as I am feeling MUCH better (though still not much inclined to eat), I unloaded a kiln, started prepping a shipment, and inventoried all my current work to determine what I need to make for the BMAC. Got to write this quick now and head off for a shower as I'm going studio shopping with my realtor at 10:00. My photographer called last night and none of the pictures he shot on Saturday turned out. First I had the wrong stand to shoot and then nothing I did have turned out. Did I mention the weekend was cursed? I rescheduled the shoot for 8/24--Jessie's first full day of school.Now a few notes on the studio. We bought our current house with an eye to suitable studio space in it. I have a 30 X 14 (more or less) room in the walk-out basement (it's basement at the front of the house and first floor in the back--we're on a slope). I had it wired for lighting and plenty of outlets, painted the walls white, stained the concrete floor, plumbed a big 3-bin restaurant sink and moved in. Big Bertha (the biggest kiln) won't fit through any house door so she lives in the garage adjacent the studio (the garage is under the living room, all part of the house). As time passed I took over more and more of the garage: The little kiln lives there as does the compressor, the shipping area, extra glass crates for a set-up table by Bertha, all the ceramic mold storage, the etched glassware storage, and all the show booth and art fair display materials (tent, pedestals, lights, carpet, etc.,). There is a little craft room of the studio and it now houses the photography set-up. There is also a bathroom hose bathtub is filled with rolls of bubble-wrap and bags of Styrofoam peanuts (yet more peanuts lurk in the garage).It's a bit cramped, but it works. What doesn't work so well is the treadmill in the Library (or the guest room if we don't have a long-term guest), the loom in the dining room, and the odds and sods of furniture tucked into inappropriate nooks throughout the house because there is no appropriate space for them (which surprisingly enough does not translate into the furniture itself being inappropriate--we still want it, tits on a bull though it is in the current layout). If we are to remain here, stranded in the south for another nine years (the current plan), we are going to need more room. We *could* build onto the house (with great difficulty), but it makes more sense to buy  another piece of property and just separate the studio right out--much better return on investment.Now off to shower. Tomorrow: What to look for in a studio.PS--Jester is much better today and they are looking at doing wound-closure surgery tomorrow or Friday, and he might be home for the weekend!"},

Jester continues to improve, I shipped an order yesterday and am plodding through the rest on schedule for today and tomorrow shipping. I seem to have caught whatever intestinal bug Jessie had at the end of last week (it was inevitable) so I am spending most of today on the computer--makes sense since I am at Joe's. This afternoon when I get back to the studio I will ship and slump.Today I work some more on the website, and I plan my pieces and firing schedule for the BMAC. I leave in a week, guess I better get to it. As tomorrow I will be looking at potential studios with my realtor friend Stacy, I'll also spend some time today writing up my needs for a space. I love designing studios! Heck I love organizing--at least the planning part of it. I'm not so down on the actual *doing* (and I DREAD moving the studio! I already told Dave I wasn't moving it again... but that sentence never worked so well with houses, why would I expect it to work with studios?)Yesterday saw me conquering the immunization certificate requirements for J's new school (two hours at the Dekalb County Board of Health clinic because her doctor's office doesn't have an opening till August 16--when we're in Montana and she can't go to school without the certificate), beating the printer into shape (the info cards finally look the way they should), and knocking some sense into the remote control. I look forward to nothing new going wrong today."},
{"title": "Breathe", "date": "Monday, July 23, 2007", "text": "Coffee in a Kavarna go-cup (Dancing Goats blend with an extra shot of espresso and real half-n-half--we were out of coffee this am), \"Racing to the Red Light\" by James McMurtry on iTunes. I sit here with yet one more thing gone wrong (this time a piece of technology failed--not critical but intrinsic to the daily functioning of the house) and think how very lucky we are. The past week has brought many trials, and they have all been so well staggered that even the most serious could be faced with calm if not serenity. I think on the recent trials of two of our very good friends, and I see mine for the little that they are. Perspective.However, little does not mean nothing. The most distressing and looking to be long-term concern is the illness of Jester, the beloved deerhound. Last Friday morning I took him to the vet. He was almost unable to rise from his bed in the morning and there was a pool of blood under it. The vets still don't know what caused the problem--words like snake bite, cancer, and anal-gland abscess fly though the air with as much meaning as so many dust motes. Whatever. From the anus to the knee he had a mass of dead tissue that finally split open and revealed itself. He went through one surgery and suture. It split open almost immediately. Saturday we had to transfer him to a large emergency veterinary hospital. He has had to have the wound debrided daily--twice under general anesthetic and twice sedated.Finally this morning they say it is looking better and they can start thinking about the major reconstructive surgery he is going to have the end of this week or early next week. I hope to be going up to see him this afternoon if I can get away. For now he's on injectable morphine and anti-inflammatories so I at least know he's not in too much pain.In the meantime I plan for the BMAC--also next week. I thought seriously this morning about canceling the show (and taking the huge financial hit both from the cancellation fees and loss of income), but on top of the enormous veterinary bills, I just can't justify it. Instead I am going to ask a friend with a larger vehicle (as I will be in Philadelphia with the mini-van) if he can help Dave pick up the dog from the emergency veterinary hospital (on the north side of the city in Sandy Springs) to transport him down to our vet where they will board him for a week while I'm gone. Jester is 130 lbs of lean muscle and bone. He is the size of an adult human on four legs. He is likely to have drainage tubes in his wound and other care requirements that I just can't drop on top of Dave in addition to the rest of the pets, the household and the child while I'm gone. Oy. But the vet staff loves him and he'll have a bed in the corner of his own room--no kennel (he's too big for all their kennels)--so I know he'll be well taken care of.So that's the big thing. I'm not even going to list all the other things that lined up one after another to cause me (thankfully) mostly difficulty and not pain. And these things, as I indicated previously, have been very considerate in their timing: each thing that has gone sideways, broken or vomited in our bed in the past week has waited to do so until the previous one was at least under control. I still have margin. I look forward to the day I don't need to be using it, but at least I still have it.Today I ship two orders and fire the first load of the final summer order. Everything that comes in from now on will be done at the end of August--after the BMAC and the Montana trip--in the twilight of the summer. Creedence Clearwater Revival sings \"Someday Never Comes\" in the background as I close. Ain't it the truth.PS--Immediately after posting the above, I got an email from the printer with my proof for the info cards. After I spent last week doing a camera-ready version (because they so badly hosed up the first version I sent) they sent me an email this morning requesting I approve... the exact same proof they sent last week. I still haven't fixed the thing that broke an hour ago. They begin to pile up."},

I feel a bit like Chicken Little this morning. I am crouched in a fetal position on the floor with my arms over my head wailing about the end of the world when I feel a tap on my shoulder. It was just an acorn, I am told. I cautiously lift my head and peer through my fingers waiting to be smote to dust. Nothing happens. Hmmm. What does all this mean? From Daniel's comment on Woe! Woe!, apparently not all versions of Internet Explorer render my beautiful pages as muck. Since IE is only installed as part of the Win 2K operating system and I never upgraded it, I am running IE 5. Glass Incarnate looks heinous on IE 5 (the nav buttons at the top *each* span the width of the page and are stacked one on top of the other). It looks the same on the iPhone--and the iPhone runs Safari. I don't have Safari on my laptop and I don't seem to be able to install it.... oh boy. It's going to be another one of THOSE days, is it? So feedback, please. Anyone else see a messy layout with the menu buttons all stacked on top of each other on Glass Incarnate? If so, what's your broswer and version? Thanks!Yesterday, thanks to the heroic efforts of Mike Ziolkowski, I got an ad finished for the inside back cover of Profitable Glass magazine. Today I have to get it to them--and I hope it will be less effort than creating it was, but I'm not holding my breath. I also have to finish the artist card proof (LOOM, LOOM) and get it in to the printer. Finally, there is glass to fire!

I think I'll go cry... again. woe. woe.Coffee is a large Jittery Joe (extra shot of espresso), music is satellite radio rock, it's Tuesday, and I'm Live From Joe's! Yesterday, let's pause a second and remember yesterday. Yesterday I was so dead, flat-out, balls-to-the-wall busy that I didn't even get out of my jammies till 4:55 pm. A neighbor came by with her little girl looking for Jessie for a playdate at 4:45 and caught me still en jammie... I don't think she's coming back... ever. But I got to the bottom of the pile and I annihilated it! I usually just sort into four piles (studio to do, home to do, studio to file and home to file) and then I skim the top layer of both the to-do's doing just enough so they don't turn off the water and we can limp along for another week. Yesterday I not only sorted, but I bagged the to-file piles, executed the majority of the to-do piles and neatly put the rest of the to-do's in a folder to get to... eventually. I finished my last task at 11:00 pm when I faxed a revised stand order to Elliott Metal Works for my BMAC needs.A note on the time-honored tradition of bagging piles of papers... Back in the Dark Ages of Graduate School I went to my advisor to pick up a paper that I had written for her weeks before. She baldly told me that she didn't know where it was. Her husband had reached his limit on papers piled all over their apartment and done one of his periodic purges, i.e., he put everything in green plastic garbage bags and put them in a closet. She would get me my paper back... eventually. I'm not sure I ever saw it.The intense deck-clearing effort of yesterday has freed me up to do graphic design today (two magazine ads for the book and the proof on the info card) at Joe's and then begin the full-out firings that will continue until I leave for the BMAC. And then summer will be 2/3 over. How did that happen? I blink, it's over. Summer is already half over now. (Forget the whole starting June 22 thing: Summer is June-August. Period.)

{"title": "Come What May", "date": "Friday, July 13, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Search and Destroy\" by Iggy (Pop) and the Stooges on iTunes. Thus far this morning I have conquered converting audio cd's (which show up in the music library and thus in random shuffle) to audiobooks on iTunes and joining tracks for gapless listening. Scripts were required for both. In the process I discovered that though Harry Potter books are not yet available on Audible, they are at the iTunes store--and for less than the cd's. *sigh* I just got Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on cd from Amazon.com... all *23 cd's of it*. There are 624 Mg's of data on each cd for a total of just over 14 Gigs. That's about all the hard drive space I left on my little beleaguered Mac. Fortunately, when iTunes got through ripping the cd's they only took up 1.44 gigs. The sad thing is that had I bought the iTunes store version to begin with and not done all the ripping and converting I could have used only 264 mg (note that that is just about exactly 23 times smaller than the original cd's). Everything is getting smaller (chips, space needed to store data, etc.) unless it's getting bigger (hard drives and other storage devices, transferal rates, bandwidth, etc.). What does all this have to do with glass? What do you think I listen to while I am driving to Philadelphia, Vegas, Chicago, etc. for shows? Philadelphia BMAC, here I come! And as I am doing set-up by myself this year I will have even MORE listening time.Today, lots of piddly... poop to get through before I can get to the big part of the day--fusing! Image Media decided to send me a proof that looked nothing like what I requested. I sent them a pdf of the *exact* layout I wanted and, evidently, they didn't think it was jazzy enough as they added a background, color to the font, and changed part of the font to script. I hate script. So I spent the better part of the afternoon yesterday angsting (at least I know how to spell it now) over what to do. My friend Mike who just did a new logo for me sent me yet another re-do, and now I have to gird my loins and beard the graphic designer at Image Media in his den (and beat him over the head for wasting my time).I also have to finish up with Hargrove (what an Italian opera THAT has turned into) and get my display forms in. Every show I seem to find myself throwing up my hands and saying \"I'll fix it next time\". I tried the PVC walls for the last show and though they are a nice, bright, cleanable white, they have several drawbacks: They are a tad long and so bowed from the weight of the hanging panels (whose chain pushed down on the tops of the panels), they are heavy (wear and tear on the car), and they are time-consuming and difficult to set-up alone. On the other hand, they are already paid for. *sigh*On the plus side, it's Friday, I am not working this weekend, and I have a NICHE piece design!"},

I'm not going to tell, you're just going to have to wait. It's ambitious. 'Nuff said.This afternoon, firing of the little pieces I had scheduled and beginning two good-sized orders I got in yesterday. I really thought July would be completely dead, but the orders are just trickling in steadily enough for me to feel good about it. I also have 100 words to write for a woman writing an article for the Crafts Report Octobe issue. She wanted to interview me about what book I would recommend giving to another artist... Is that a loaded question for an October issue (with my book coming out the first of November) or what?! However, I'll be noble. I must mention my own book (author=pimp, that's just the way it is), but I will also recommend some of my other favs for business and just for beauty/inspiration. If I don't have it (or didn't write it), I won't recommend it.Yesterday afternoon I sat in the Sky chair and read a novel for five hours. I didn't move except to swing. I am so energized and motivated today as a reult that I am just overwhelmed! I *highly* recommend doing nothing (or nothing but reading) for an afternoon as a cure for the stress of overwork (not that I'm overworked right now--I wouldn't have taken off the afternoon if I were).

I wonder if George is happy with his life. I see him in concert regularly and he doesn't seem to have changed at all since the first time at the Wilma theater in Missoula Montana over 20 years ago. He seems such a solitary person. I think I'll make it an all-George morning. One last tangent and then glass. Every time I wrote \"George\", I cringed. Isn't it terrible how one person can completely ruin a name for you? Aren't you glad it's not YOUR name being ruined?Yesterday was a fun (used quite loosely) day on the computer. I decided to have another go at getting my artist info cards professionally printed and I had a coupon for Image Media so I said, what the heck, why not! The heck turned out to be the stringent format and color types necessary for professional printing. While my little Word docs are great for knocking off on the home printer, I need CMYK color and 300 dpi for a professional printer. It doesn't matter if you know what these things are or not, just know that you don't have them and can't get them in a Word doc. So I either scrap the whole project or I pay them $35 to do the layout for me. The total cost of the card is still $.11 per (Kinko's wanted $2.16 per--for reference) including shipping and the additional $35. I guess I'm dragging because 2500 seems like an awfully big commitment (what if I want to change them in the next decade?), but the difference in cost between 1000 and 2500 was negligible.I was still ditzing with that project when I got a very nice (and, as it turned out, very necessary) call from Cindy at Hargrove (the exhibitor services people for the Buyer's Market Show (Philadelphia. August.) reminding me to get me order in. I knew the deadline was next Monday (plenty of time!) and I was still trying to find my packet so I could go on-line and order. Turns out that for once it wasn't my fault: the Rosen Group didn't mail a packet this time, they decided to do all materials for this show on-line. Save some trees. I'm all about saving trees. And I'm sure (though I can find no evidence to back up my confidence) that they emailed me my login and password so I could do my order. But nevermind--Cindy gave me my login and password and I decided to get a jump on things and look at my display options. Ho boy, good thing I did. Snarkiness to follow....I am sure there are good reasons why Hargrove chose the software they use for their on-line processing, a software that requires using Internet Explorer as your browser. Just like there are bound to be good reasons why Microsoft decided to stop making, supporting, distributing or even allowing to be distributed Internet Explorer for the Mac. Certainly neither Hargrove nor Microsoft care that I HAVE A MAC. I DON'T HAVE INTERNET EXPLORER*. I AM REQUIRED TO ORDER ONLINE**.I called Hargrove back and asked them if they knew about this problem and the snarky woman on the other end of the conversation said Yep. She'd be happy to fax me the forms--well over 20 pages of them. Or I could call the Rosen Group. maybe they could mail me something (that wouldn't get to me by the Monday deadline). I was pretty steamed by the end of my conversation with her and decided I would call the Rosen Group with the phone number she provided me. Their line was busy... for the next hour and a half. I never did get anyone there. Now, me, I find a problem with an administrative decision I made, I pro actively go after it. I don't just wait for people to notice. Sure, Cindy gave me a call and that was great. But, c'mon, you KNOW people have Macs--especially artists. If you find out that your lame vendor is using some lame software that requires the most virus-prone browser in existence to process orders for your show, you IMMEDIATELY send out a big email alert giving an alternative ordering process.For the record, because I am a bit of an uber geek (and cheap--lots of old Windows software I am not ready to buy again for the Mac), I have Parallels desktop which allows me to run Windows inside my Mac, and  *I do have Internet Explorer running under Windows. Also I think (though I was not told this explicitly by the VERY snaky woman I got the first time I called back to Hargrove) **I could fax the forms in if I had hard copies of them. That's what I've always done for this show. Now one last note now that I have been able to get into their Internet-Explorer-requiring software: it's lame, lame, lame! It is buggy (it throws up error messages and then just continues on while you're going \"what the hell?\"), and very difficult to navigate through all the display options available. As a former software engineer I have to say that it looks like it was designed for a junior high computer science class project in the 90's and never upgraded. C'mon Hargrove: you want to play with the big boys you have got to be better than this! As for the Rosen Group, before deciding to change your process in one swift stroke, make sure it works for everyone. It would have been MUCH better to transition to on-line ordering with incentives for doing it that way for one show (and the regular system as back-up) instead of just hopping to a new train. Yes, ACRE did all-online materials and ordering for their show. And I was nervous and skeptical about it, but it worked. It worked because Champion (the exhibitor services provider) was not two-bit about it.Enough wrist-slapping. I end with a sincere thank-you to Cindy at Hargrove who certainly saved me from a nasty death on Monday (I would have left ordering till then, you know I would). And I thank the nameless person at the Rosen Group who probably asked Hargrove to get everyone moving on their orders as they knew there were problems. I grind my teeth and get on with it."},

I was full-out busy in the studio right up to the minute we went on vacation. Then I was on vacation for a week. I didn't think about ANYTHING work or home related. I took my laptop and only opened it twice--once when we got there out of habit (I looked blankly at the screen for a few minutes and then closed it again) and once mid week when we went to town to check mail to make sure no crises had arisen in our absence.Now we're back, I have nothing large and pressing, and I am a bit... lost. Sure there are plenty of things I SHOULD be doing--I'm still alive therefore my inbox is full, but nothing appeals. What to do when nothing sings to you? Shop! Or in my case, anti-shop! Divest! Time to clear some paths. Maybe a day of hard work and sweat will clear my mind and bring some focus for tomorrow. And maybe the divestiture will enable me to find my Hargrove folder so I can re-evaluate my booth design options (costs) for the BMAC next month. Method. Madness."},

I'm on the front porch in the Sky chair, relaxed and happy to be home. We all have summer colds--Dave is getting over his and J and I are just getting into ours--so I am letting J sleep late this morning. It's summer and she's back at Phoenix School summer camp this week--there's no rush to wake and go.No crises fomented during the week while I was gone. Today--and for the rest of the week--I am mostly going to putter. I have to put out an order that came in from a new gallery over the weekend, send a replacement piece to the Art Institute for the one that broke in shipping, get Ren her piece for winning the drawing back in MARCH, and order supplies. I'm also going to work on websites and marketing materials. The summer BMAC is just around the corner and I still haven't figured out what I'm doing for display, yadda, yadda, ya.For now though, I wouldn't mind a bit of feedback. Part of the branding/marketing that I have been working on recently is the creation of artist/technique/care info cards for galleries to provide to customers who buy my work. Think of it like this: You go into a store and you are see something you would like to buy for yourself or for a gift. If it's for a gift, you would like the receiver to know that it isn't something made in China that cost you $1.99. If it's for you, the information on the card provides you with justification for buying this decorative item--which costs decidedly more than $1.99--instead of something at Target. Finally, there is a bit of technical jargon on the card that explains the process and techniques so the gallery staff doesn't have to be up on every technique by every artist. Below are the front and back of the card I whumped up before going on vacation. If YOU were buying a handcrafted item by an American artist, is this what you would like to get with it? Is there info missing? Other comments? Thanks, as always, for the feedback. (Click on the images to enlarge them so you can read the teeny tiny type.)"},

{"title": "More Website Drama AND A POLL", "date": "Wednesday, June 27, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the New Orleans skyline mug, \"Don't Cross the River\" by America on iTunes. Time to reboot. Reboot the morning, reboot the expectations, reboot the exasperation. Let's start with the website.For the past week I have been hellbent on redoing my website to incorporate all the aspects of who I am (professionally) and what Siyeh Studio is. I envisioned incorporating the daily communication (blog), all the links for the publications--the book (including how to get signed copies, a forum for asking technical questions and posting comments, my own suppliers list, technical corrections and additions, etc.) and articles I write for Glass Patterns, a new area for classes as I formally extend the teaching part of my repertoire, and all the existing material on the glass pieces I produce, the shows I do, etc.However I had dinner with a friend last night, he is something of a web guru in the areas of content and flow, and he frowned at my plan. He thought I should continue to keep the website for its current purpose--promoting my glass work to galleries and other potential clients--and I shouldn't muddy it up with the book and blog which (if I am remembering correctly what he said) might diminish the value of my \"art\" work. It's true that a little of me goes a long way. And maybe it's best if I keep the blog away from the front of my work, the professional face.Maybe a blog--in this case a resource for business and technical info for those in the hand craft industry--shouldn't be easily accessible to potential clients. I was thinking in terms of raising my professional cred, but couldn't it have the opposite effect? I have already managed to offend several people at my publishers with what I've written here about the process of writing the book, and I wrote a long post some time ago dissing another company  that has a blog on their main company website that is not very... professionally... written. Am I falling into the same trap?And how do writing and teaching meld with production art glass? Do they belong on the same site, or do they diminish the work of the art? I have to admit that if I go to a website and one page is selling supplies and another page is the \"art\" produced by the enterprise, I devalue it. Am I setting myself up for being devalued? I value teaching and writing, but does the renaissance aspect of doing more than one thing take away from the one thing that I used to have on the site? Is any of this making sense?Reboot.I attended some session at some conference years ago that addressed the issue of websites and I seem to remember (I have re-purposed so many brain cells!) a strong admonition being to keep separate websites for different aspects of your work for exactly the devaluation reason. To validate this advice I looked at some of the sites of other artists I know who do more than production work--foremost among them Milon Townsend. He does have two separate sites--one for his art work and one for his books and classes. Of course he also has two separate business names (a concept that niggles at my brain as also being recommended at the conference session). Dinah Hulet has a site separate from Hulet & Hulet--but as one site is for the work of one and the other is for the work of two (both Dinah and Patty) this separation seems more driven by the existence of two businesses rather than an intentional distinction solely for type of work for one business. Finally I looked at Elliott Metal Works--truly the most diverse example as they do both metal fabrication and metal art and they manufacture and sell metal parts for the textile industry. Their approach seems to be an amalgam of one site/different sites: There is a primary Elliott Metal Works page and its only function is a gateway to the five different sub sites--each of which has a unique design and layout further distinguishing the different aspects of the business.The Internet is a mysterious and powerful device whose power is only exceeded by its mystery. You only get one chance to make a first impression. What is your Quest? Though they appear to be random statements/question, all of the preceding appertain to the purpose of a website, AND I'M STILL LOOKING FOR MINE.Time to come out of the woodwork and wax eloquent, folks (especially the U of C lurker... I know you're there...). What is the purpose and scope of the modern professional website for a small art business? Should it be one site or two (or more)? If two, what the heck is the other one called? Opinions on pros and cons for both approaches appreciated."},

It's only 9:45 and I have been rockin' this am. Yesterday I made it through the main Dreamweaver tutorials and created a webpage complete with images, flash elements, a nav bar, cascading style sheet (CSS), and tables. Also did three kiln loads and read 2/3 of a novel... sleep is for wimps.This morning I am going to finish up the mouse-over tutorial and designing from a CSS and then I am going to lay out my own tables on paper and start doing my own redo. I thought about just editing the pages I have in Dreamweaver with all the EZNet code, but it looks like it'll be easier and faster to redo the pages, make a template or two along the way, and just re-use the images. With luck I'll have the new site up by the end of the week (at least to the level I already have content on the current site--the first page I make today after the \"Home\" page with be the \"Under Construciton\" page). It's an ambitious plan, but the kiln work is light for the rest of the week (one last fuse today and then all slumping and shipping) and the tutorials are really giving me the grounding and info I need to power through.One last thing before I go off to code. Yesterday I asked JY and JYK about running my own blog,  forum, etc. from my site as opposed to linking to my own page on other sites (Blogger, Google Groups, Flickr, etc.). The main reason for putting it all on my own page is navigation: if I link to an external site then I lose all my site navigation. E.g., there won't be a nav bar on the Google Groups page to get from the forum to the series page on my site or the blog site on blogger... If it's all on my site there is the same nav menu on every page. And isn't the good web credo, \"Don't let them leave your site.\"? So Once More With Feeling: Are there good technologies for running your own blog and forum for your own website? If no, I could always use frames.... (UGH!).PS--The blog title this morning is from the spouse who looked at the new green series last night again, and said (again), \"Lantern, you have to call it Lantern.\" Apparently the greens are the perfect match for the colors used in the late '70's era Green Lantern comics."},

Dave not  only made the coffee, he also picked the mug, filled it and gave it to me. He picked Atlanta. It's a sign: Be Happy Where You Are... and I am. \"The Power of Two\" was randomly chosen by iTunes and couldn't be more appropriate--it was the song our friend Andrea sang at our wedding. Life is finally slowing down and it is Really Good. Dave took Jessie to Zoo Camp this morning so I have a little extra time to sit in the early morning relative cool (it's scary when a Montana Girl thinks 70 degrees is relatively cool) in the sky chair on the front porch to post.All that's definitely on the plate today? Three kiln loads--two of which are already ready to slump just waiting for the kiln to cool and a third fuse that's cut and ready to lay out when that kiln cools. Today I guarantee you I take summer hours. I think Carol is coming this morning, though I haven't heard from her. If she does, I have tasks for her. If she doesn't it may be time to go find the stone for the pond and the boulders for the yard (I can just hear my father laughing at me for buying ROCKS).Sadly, making morceaux hurts Sophie's back so I won't be getting any further ahead on that project. But summer hours I said. Today at 3:00 it's my goal to be back sitting where I am now in a sky chair, but this time I'll have an umbrella drink in my hand.I am so tired this morning I ramble. but it's a good tired. Yesterday I was still exhausted from lack of good sleep since before the wedding in Austin and I was crabby with the world. Last night we saw Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and didn't get home till 11:30 (Jessie and Sophie too) so I still didn't get much sleep, but finally what I got was solid and dreamless. Today I am sluggish, but much happier.I did, indeed, get my artist info cards done yesterday. I did a couple of versions and now I just need to choose one and figure out where to get them printed. Professional printing has not been easy for me so far.My first foray was postcards with a little local printing company. They couldn't read my files, lost my files, didn't answer my email about the receipt of my files, had machine failure that caused a multiple day delay in my order, didn't have the postcards cut when I went to pick them up so I had to wait about half an hour while they cut them... They *were* very nice, but it was stressful and effortful enough that the experience wasn't a success.Then I took the plunge and tried Modern Postcard online. Their required format and layout are *extremely* complicated, and the color came out crappy (they warn that the best way to get correct color is to pay more, have a color sample taken, and mail it back and forth... like I have time for THAT). Besides the difficulty of my last experience, I don't need a postcard this time. Or do I? Maybe a postcard is the best format for the artist info cards.I am tempted to try the local Kinko's or a similar chain this time. Anyone else have any printing wisdom to share? How about what other people put on their info cards for galleries and in what format? C'mon artist lurkers, I know you're there. Come out and play and SHARE. Doug, I know I can count on you..."},

I was listening to it in the studio as I was finishing the last of today's cut list and continued it here. Somehow, in the weird way that time works, I am now so far behind that I am actually ahead! I didn't get my fuse load in yesterday--the polishing of the photos and the article for Glass Patterns took ALL DAY. I didn't have the heart (or the energy) to work last night to get the kiln load in so I pushed my whole schedule back a day. Now I have *no* free days between now and when I lave for the mountains of South Carolina with Jessie. I still consider it a good trade.This morning started--as all the mornings this and next week do--with taking Jessie to Zoo Camp at the Atlanta Zoo. Any morning is a good morning when you get to hear Lenny Kravitz \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\" not once but twice on two different radio stations on the drive. As soon as I got home I headed into the studio to do the cutting so the scrap would be ready for Sophie to turn into morceaux when she starts work at 10:00. Two days in a row with the same routine and I'm liking it. Too bad Sophie goes home next week.Now it's 9:34 and I have already done all the cutting scheduled for today. After I finish this post I am going to make a frit inventory sheet for my 5 lb jars of frit and have Sophie fill it out. I put some thought into the design of this form and instead of writing numbers of jars left, I am going to color in blocks as I use up a jar so I can see at a lightning glance exactly how much I have left.The concept of needing to track *5 lb* jars almost boggles my mind. When I started working with frit I bought 1 lb jars and I had one of each size (fine, medium and coarse) for some of the colors. Then I worked up to one of each size for each cathedral (transparent) color, then one of almost every color in every size. By that time I was also buying 5 lb jars--in all three sizes--of the colors I used the most so I could refill the 1 lb jars and work from them. Now I am at the point where I am buying and keeping on hand multiple 5 lb jars of some colors and sizes. Next up, 40 lb buckets--though that's a pretty big step up. If Bullseye had 20 or 25 lb buckets I would buy them all day long for some colors, but 40 lbs is a lot and takes up one big footprint (I scatter my 5 lb jars around the studio and studio annex there are so many of them).Then I'll get my fuse load in and that should take me up to noon. That's all I had officially scheduled for the *day* so I am going to take advantage of the extra time to get my artist info cards designed and ready to take to the printer. Then if there's more time left before I have to get the J from Zoo Camp I might work on my booth redesign for the BMAC. Yep. Have to redesign (yet again) as I have a 10 X 20 corner for the first time (and after I just bought carpet for a 10 X 15... *sigh*). My show rep called and offered me first shot at the five extra feet and I said sure why not! Bigger *is* better in this case.Now off to see what else I can think of to add to Sophie's plate besides inventory. An intern is a Good Thing (and my assistant/apprentice Carol is back tomorrow too! It'll be a full day in the studio)."},

Two orders to ship today, four loads to fire (in three kilns--uh oh, it's a double-duty day!), a piece to design and fire (one of the firings already listed) for my first article for Glass Patterns Quarterly, two months' worth of bills to pay, five months' worth of paper to shuffle, one month's worth of mail to sort, oh yes, and taking Sophie and the J to the aquarium this afternoon. Does the fun ever end? I think I'll go get some of that coffee now.It's getting time to gear up for the last two shows of the year (The Buyer's Market of American Craft [BMAC] in August and the One of a Kind Show in December). And thinking of the BMAC, the NICHE awards application deadline will also be here before I know it/am ready...You know, I don't want to think ahead right now. There are still so many things that loomed on my plate when summer was still a warm spot on the horizon. Now it's here in its full-blown 90 degree-ness, and they STILL loom! If those damn galleries would just stop ordering pieces... (JUST KIDDING!).And speaking of galleries, I have given Sophie all of my wholesale invoices since I started doing the BMAC in February of 2005. It seems so much longer ago, but I have only been doing wholesale for 2-1/2 years! Anyway, since I haven't got my database done yet so she can enter all the data so I can run reports against it, she is making a set of spreadsheets from the invoices to tell me in concrete numbers how my business is doing. She likes doing this kind of analysis (probably why she's in business college), and she's quick and good at it. Too bad I couldn't get the database all pieced together so she could really go to town.So that's the week. No progress on the web site (a common problem for artists/crafts people), and I have just added two more forums to read The Arts Business Institute Forum and the American Craft Forum. As if I wasn't busy enough? But I just got reinforcement of the validity of a tip I got years ago about calling galleries that stock my work to see how their stock is and if they need a re-order. I am going to try it next week and track my responses. Success/failure of method posted here when I finish.And now off to the kilns. Tote that glass, lift that frit, hyah mule!"},
{"title": "Two For Tuesday!", "date": "Tuesday, June 12, 2007", "text": "Coffee in whatever damn mug is clean. Looks like New York. I hate our dishwasher! \"Jessica\" (the long version) by the Allman Brothers on iTunes. And just how long is it? Long enough to go to the bathroom, wash my hands, find a clean mug, pour coffee and two flavors of coffeemate into it, stir it all, get settled back in the chair with the laptop and type this far with lots of typos and corrections necessary because there has been no coffee yet. It's exactly THIS long.Yesterday's post finally made it to the world this morning so it's a Two For Tuesday! I had another epiphany to add to yesterday's...Don't you just love life? I am just beginning to write about an epiphany and Dave comes in to tell me that the front pond is almost empty. Now that that crisis has been dealt with I am back and completely derailed. Okay, epiphany. Oh yes, what life and schedules SHOULD be.In the past when I have taken time out of my \"work day\" to do something for Jessie, or something around the house--speaking of which, it's Tuesday, garbage day, got to everything out to the curb. BRB...So where was I? Oh yes, taking time out for things. Whenever I have taken an hour in the work day for something \"non-work\" I have felt obliged to make up that hour later. Do the math. There are only so many hours in a day and with this kind of ethos you rapidly run out of hours. Stress happens. The problem comes about by thinking of it as \"non-work\". It isn't non-work, it's just as essential for life as that which is designated as \"work\". Just because there is no monetary remuneration, no revenue generated by the activity doesn't diminish its worth, necessity, importance and shouldn't mean that it's non-work and needs to be \"made up\" later.So I'm going to try something new. In addition to the weekly cycle, I am going to add a daily cycle. There is a portion of the day from, oh say, 9:00 am to 6:00 pm that is designated as work time. Anything I do in that time that is not pure recreation for me (reading a book in the sky chair is a good example) counts as work, and I am allowed to feel good about what I accomplish in a day if I stay on track and \"work\" all day. No more feeling bad because a load didn't get fired because I drove for a school field trip instead. Life isn't about money--everyone who makes a living in the arts and crafts industry knows that already--and work shouldn't be about it either. Work is that which we do to make our lives and the lives of those around us better. If I needed to associate money with every minute of my day I would have been a lawyer and billed by the minute.Yesterday, in addition to firing two kiln loads, Work included taking Sophie and Jessie for pre-wedding pedicures and manicures (I got one of each too). Today, Work is another two kiln loads, a lot of pieces cut and ground, the project for my first magazine article cut and fired, tasking Sophie with an evaluation of sales performance over the past four years, taking Sophie, Jessie and Jessie's friend Rachel to Wendy's for lunch at the mall food court before seeing Shrek 3, and then hosting a wading-pool playdate for Jessie and Rachel this afternoon. Even if I don't get all that done, I can count it as a successful day as long as those are the things I am doing all day. And how cool is it that my \"job\" requires me to see Shrek 3?"},
{"title": "Monday, Monday", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2007", "text": "Coffee burbles in the new Capresso coffee maker, no music, the house is... silent. Friday ended with another order from the Milwaukee Museum of Art. They just opened their Camille Pisarro exhibit and chose my glass to sell in conjunction with the exhibit through the Museum Store. None of my work is on their website yet, but I  am hopeful they will put it up. This has been the spring of the Museum Store for me with the Museum of Fine Art in Boston, The Art Institute in Chicago and the Milwaukee Museum of Art all placing multiple big orders.This is a short week in the studio--short for the the amount of time to do work, not short for what needs to be done. We have a wedding in Austin this weekend so I am only working three days...It is now six hours after I started this post, the day has advanced to the point where I can see what will get done and what will be \"rescheduled\". Rescheduled is a lovely euphemism for \"put off\". Of everything I will get sone today, my unexpected epiphany is the most important. As I was getting the first pieces in the kiln for the big fuse load today I pondered the nature of time and came to a startlingly conclusion: I am happier with a work week schedule.As a small business owner whose business is co-located with my residence, I can work whenever I need. The benefit of this situation is that it allows me to get all the things in my life done in the time that is most appropriate and convenient for them, rather than in the time that has been previously artificially scheduled for them. When I worked in an office, e.g., it wasn't possible to do a load of laundry in the middle of the day even if I really needed the clothes in it that evening. I had to do much more thinking and planning in advance. Now I can be a Mommy, wife, homeowner, business owner all as the need arises: I am much more flexible, efficient and productive... and more stressed. Today I think I figured out why: I need a cycle.This past weekend I didn't work in the studio even though I had some a couple of firings scheduled, and I got a ship-asap-order Friday evening so arguably I should have. But I had life this weekend too. I took Sophie to a bead show Saturday and I went to the water garden store and finalized the pond design and supply list. Sunday I pressure-washed the parking pad, took J to a bowling birthday party (she got three spares in four frames and the highest score in her age group!), and (with help from Dave and the Internet) wrote over 200 fortunes for a friend's birthday (for one of his gifts we gave him a box made from handmade paper--not by me--full of folded fortunes), and then had a dinner birthday party  with fireworks. (Dave, of course, did all the grocery shopping, men planning and cooking.)So the weekend was full, and it could be expected that come Monday--the first work day of a very short week--I would be stressed because I didn't fire and about everything that looms before me. But what I find is that I am more relaxed and rested than I have been on previous Mondays even though I did no less over the weekend. As I pondered why this might be so, I came to the conclusion that I need the work-week cycle. When every day is the same, every bad day has more weight because there is nothing to stop the next day from being exactly the same. All the tomorrows stretch out in front of you just as bleak as the day you're in.Breaking all your tomorrows into a series of weeks changes things. For people accustomed to the working week, if today is Monday and it's a bad day, the tendency is to say, \"Today is bad because it's Monday. Tomorrow will be better because it's no longer Monday, it's Tuesday.\" There's suddenly a psychological predisposition to look forward to tomorrow (and thus not feel so bad about today) because you have a reason--however lame--for it to be better. When there's a new cycle on the horizon there's hope. I wonder if retired people feel the same way?"},
{"title": "Happy Birthday To Me!", "date": "Friday, June 08, 2007", "text": "Coffee long cold in a Kavarna cup, \"One Step At a Time\" by Clifton Chenier off of Bogalusa Boogie on iTunes. The album was a birthday gift from my mad friend Keith (who would make a great B&B chef). As he put it, even though it's the blues, they can't help but make you feel better (I paraphrased badly as I can't find the e-card with the actual words). Okay, it's almost noon and I have spent the entire day so far Putzing. I took J to school--with a stop at Publix for bananas, water and muffins and with a stop at Kavarna for coffee as the coffeemaker is still broken--only to find they had already left for their field trip to the Puppetry Arts Center downtown. It's a good field trip, and it's J's last day at school for four weeks (for one reason and another), so I drove her downtown, got there, got her seated and let her teacher know she was there all right before the show started. Then back to school to take down her Superstar board, then to the mechanic to drop off the Honda.When I finally got home the first thing I had to do was submit a request online to have the tree next door removed. It's a water oak with a 51\" diameter (really, I measured) that is dead and rotting on the side farthest from our house. It has dropped several big limbs in the past couple of years (one right in front of a previous tenant--it crushed her car and would have crushed her had her dog not stopped to pee right before it fell). The property is a rotting rental (vacant for the past year) whose owner's attitude when told that the tree poses a danger to our house and property (by the tenant after the tree limb almost killed her) \"They have insurance...\".For those of you who live in the north and west, trees in the south are different. It is common here after a storm to see many ginormous trees blown over and crushing houses, cars, blocking roads, etc. These big old trees have incredibly shallow root systems and one good wind and they fall over. I have been nervously eying this one ever since the first big limb fell. Right now there is a really big dead limb right over our house that I am sure is going to go soon. It has already shed several little branches off itself that litter our roof.The situation is especially hard for me as I am a tree-hugger and I LOVE this tree. It blocks the view and sound of the busy, ugly street to the south. It shades and cools out house and front lawn. It is home to hundreds of squirrels. If the property owner would have it regularly pruned it could probably last a few more years. But we are in a drought now and she doesn't even water it. It is going downhill fast and we can no longer afford to just let it be. Too bad the rot and slant of the tree aren't such that when it goes it would take the rental house instead of ours. It's empty and full of rats, bugs and who knows what else.Now about glass. Yes glass. It's supposed to be incarnate here. Lately I feel more like mommyincarnate than glassincarnate, and while that is a GOOD thing, it needs to be a planned thing too in order not to cause me stress. One should not have stress on one's b-day. And speaking of b-days, we are celebrating mine tonight by going to see the Braves vs. the Cubs with a bunch of friends including 5 children 6 or under. There will be hotdogs. There will be beer. There will be fireworks and friends. I will celebrate 46 in style. There will be glass... next week. Happy Weekend all!"},
{"title": "Too Darn Hot!", "date": "Thursday, June 07, 2007", "text": "Diet coke in the can, \"Angel\" by Amanda Perez on Sophie's MP3 player in the background. Coffee and any thoughts of breakfast were hours ago--as was the possibility of sketching out a workflow that I could evaluate for my software needs. After I posted yesterday I skimmed the first 55 pages of the Filemaker Pro book and identified the core 120+ pages that I have to read to brush up my database skills. Figuring out what one needs to do is for wimps. Just get in there and DO something! Flail around a bit then scratch your head and try to figure out why everything is still broken... oh wait, that's what I'm already doing. Maybe I should stop to plan.Orders shipped and delivered yesterday. Today, much firing and a meeting with the electrician to plan the new studio annex wiring. As soon as I finish this post I'll water all the flowers on the porch and the deck. It's 82 degrees right now and headed to 91. What the hell?! It's only *spring*!! What's it going to be like when summer really comes? Wasn't I just being all cheerful about how beautiful it is here and maybe not such a bad place to live? Let me begin the retractions now--I just can't take the heat!And speaking of the heat, it has rotted my brain. I have nothing more to post. Got to go slave over a soon-to-be hot kiln."},

I spent the entire damn day yesterday listening to it and the rest of the cd Ren sent me awhile ago. It is entitled \"Melancholy\" for a reason. Another friend used the term \"June Gloom\" to me in a chat midday and it was so appropriate. Yet another another cher ami daydreamed with me about running off to a better place to live (maybe Spain) and opening a *really good* B&B with a restaurant (he'd be the chef). But that was all yesterday. I have shaken it all off and Started My Day Right (thanks, Dave). Now I have afterglow coffee (TMI!), my laptop in the sky chair, and birds twittering and squirrels and chipmunks romping. Does it get better than this?Today deserves a serious post as I slog through business technology and figure out where to drive my glass bus (so to speak) next. Sophie is here (my intern) and she is doing her internship for a business college so, as a responsible intern mentor, I am focusing on the aspects of Siyeh Studio that have to do with business right now. That means instead of living the carefree bohemian glass artist life and making one beautiful thing after another in a kiln all day I am pooping around with a computer.I am designing a Filemaker Pro database for tracking customers, orders and products (and learning Filemaker Pro in the process). I am redesigning my website with Dreamweaver (and learning Dreamweaver in the process). I am creating an online catalog/store at Wholesalecrafts.com (and learning their web-based interface AND learning how to photograph and edit my work with iPhoto in the process). And finally I am trying desperately to create a catalog on cd, one that shows all of my work--something I am having difficulty getting WSC.com to do in a manageable way--to mail to anyone who asks me for information about my products (and downloading, learning and evaluating scores of piss-poor windows-based catalog apps in the process). Can you see why I might be gloomy? With all this learn-the-software crap there is very little finishing-the-project gratification going on. At this rate it's going to take an entire summer of hunching over the computer before I get ANYTHING done... not a pleasant prospect.And it begs the question, how much do I really need to do and how much am I doing in a knee-jerk reaction to what I THINK a successful business needs? I am a pretty smart mammal so I think I am more or less on track, but maybe my (lack of) plan could use some tweaking. First, the database. Clearly my current process is broken because it's too easy for me to make mistakes on my orders. I also have no way to do any kind of analysis of how my business is doing--how much is it growing, am I covering my expenses and making a profit that will appropriately provide for my retirement, any of a thousand questions I might want answered from the data I already collect. The first of the two issues--mistakes on the orders--is paramount to fix. But analysis of data... how necessary is that really to a business my size, a business of one? I have Quickbooks and I use it to track expenses and income. Period. no invoicing, nothing else. Because it doesn't do everything I want, and I because I resent the way it does some things, I refuse to use it any more than my accountant says I must.And the morning has passed and I am still not through the questions and on to the answers--much less on to the filling the kiln, shipping orders, cleaning out the studio, etc. I am going to have to revisit the issue tomorrow. Maybe I'll actually be able to flow out what I do so that I can figure out what I need to fix/get to be able to do what I need to do... capiche?"},
{"title": "A Plea for Software Help!", "date": "Tuesday, June 05, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Washington D.C. skyline mug, \"Summertime\" covered by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes on iTunes. That song covered by that band is the perfect juxtaposition of styles and there could not be a better expression of the structure of my life. Yesterday was the last of the field trips/driving for me for awhile. Maybe it would have been better if I'd taken my laptop, but I doubt it. Last Friday I managed to relax into the experience and enjoy it for the slice out of time that it was. Yesterday I just chomped at the bit to be back at work the whole time.And it's not like I got anything done when I did get back to work. I spent the entire day futzing with software... Again! I waited too long and can't download the version of Dreamweaver for which I have a license anymore. The new version (not a new release--it's still Dreamweaver 8, just with a new name since Adobe acquired Macromedia: CS3) doesn't work with my license key, It took almost an hour to figure this out because the  program is so huge and the download took so long. Now I have to dig around for the installer and license key for the  windows version. Blech.I went back to the catalog software I installed a little over a month ago and my trial version had expired. I wasn't ready to buy without more of a trial than five minutes so I tried to download the freeware version, but the download was broken and customer service never did answer my email. A bit more searching around the web found basically the same site by the same company under three different product names--all for $29.95--so I begin to think they're a fly-by-night company and it's all a scam anyway so I have to start all over again in my search for software to create an electronic catalog! Any suggestions on what others out there use would be GREATLY appreciated. I prefer something for the Mac, but I run Parallels desktop so I can use windows software too.I have made no further progress on my Filemaker Pro database, and Sophie has already entered all the contacts so she languishes with nothing to do. Enough time in front of the computer screen. Time to go take pictures of all my work and then put Sophie to work organizing all of it on shelves and cleaning and straightening the rest of the studio!"},

The democrats debate Iran and immigration, Russia tests and plans to deploy nuclear missiles aimed at Europe... the world was a much simpler place before media became ubiquitous. It's almost too much for the mind to hold and continue to function to KNOW what's happening in Darfur, e.g., and to go on with a normal life here. Yet a normal life is what I have, and I give profound thanks this morning for it.Despite temps in the 80's in the shipping room (studio annex... oh if you must, GARAGE!) orders continue to go out on schedule. Today I champ at the bit to actually finish the photography of all my current inventory and subsequently the wholesalecrafts.com pages and the electronic catalog. Next electronic tasks? My own website (time to move it off EZNettools and into a format where it can be easily and meaningfully edited) and the artist cards I have blathering on about for the past several months.The color lasers went back to the publisher today and they will soon wing their way to China for printing. Yes, even my book will be Made in China. Sad really. As documented here over the past year+, the experience of writing the book has been a real roller coaster. And like roller coasters, it ended with a slow, straight, pull into the station: a gentle, non-hurried re-read over the weekend as part of the last proof stage. Boy is it dense! Due to the error with the page count, there is a lot of information packed into a very tight space with hardly any filler words. When I read it I thought there was almost too much to take in. How do you condense 20 years of doing something, all the little tricks, tips and bits of sage advice you might have into 128 pages--with projects?!? But it is what it is, and it's time to let it go out into the world on its own. Four months and four weeks from today. Another reason to get working on my website so I can make a Book page where I can correct errors, answer questions, sell signed copies..."},

Funny how they can be both happy and frightened at the same time. Why are there children in the studio? Well, there aren't! I am in the gazebo at the Avondale Estates Lake. They needed drivers for the field trip this morning so I decided to take my work on the road. In a burst of serendipity, we had an entire loaf of bread that had given itself up to the goddess of mold when I went to make J's lunch so we had lots of food for the ducks and geese. It was a win-win. We also happened to have Chicken Little in the dvd player in the Honda so there were five very happy little kids in the back all the way to the park. In a minute we're heading to the playground for lunch and I will use the time to pay bills.This afternoon there are two orders going out, two loads going in, and the color lasers for the book arrive! Then there are photos to take, a database to keep creating, the fun never ends. Some of it even has to do with glass!Isn't this a great country? We ate lunch at the park/playground I paid bills, I am still sitting at the picnic table in the park enjoying the breeze, and someone nearby has an open network! I think I'll just post now...

{"title": "Everything, and Nothing At All", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2007", "text": "No coffee yet (ugh), \"Morning Red\" by Mission Mountain Woodband on iTunes. It's summer. I feel it in my bones. Has the world changed so much that summer really does begin in May now? Or is it because I live in the south? I don't think it's the latter--it's clearly summer in the north too when I talk to my parents and my in-laws (Montana and Chicago). I am sleepy in the early morning and lethargic when I do manage to rise. I thought I would have time to post this morning between watering the potted plants and taking the dogs to the groomer, before starting studio work, but my brain is just. too. sluggish. I'll be back.Okay, it's 10:00. The dogs are at the groomer, the coffee in in the Starbucks go-cup, and thoughts of where I want to go next with my business fill my head (and have no business there, really). I passed a great-looking studio/teaching/retail space for lease on my way to the groomer and my mind just started running away with itself. What If...?I have never done a business plan. I have started one or two, but quickly got bored, got up, and did something else. It has always been enough to think, \"What do I want to do THIS year with Siyeh Studio? What do I want to grow now?\" And at the end of four years of full-time, hodge-podge management (preceded by 16 years of really no management at all--business as driven by life rather than driven by business), I am in a pretty good place. However, my success is due more to my ability to think on my feet and react quickly to problems than any real forethought. Should I change strategies now?I have a book coming out in the fall. I am going to be a regular contributor to at least one and now maybe two magazines. I haven't taught regularly up till now because I didn't want to teach either my current studio production work (it is, after all, my bread and butter) or the same thing everyone else teaches in a beginning class. But I am a good teacher--I really LIKE teaching and I communicate well (let's skip all the false modesty crap). Adding regular teaching to my routine would be nice--especially as I am happy with my reduced show schedule and so would have more time for it.I am also still attracted to the idea of retailing glass and supplies. I tested a lot of supplies and new products in the process of writing the book, and I see myself trying more as I write for Glass Patterns. Carrying them in a retail location and teaching classes around them seems a logical extension. Retail does mean hiring someone though, as I certainly can't do all my production work, teach AND staff a retail space full-time (and my poor spouse is probably having heart failure reading that I am even contemplating ANY of this!).Then there is the idea of starting a multi-craft artist co-op organization--gallery, teaching facility, etc.--with a group of other like-minded, federally-funded artists... And I have a friend who asked me about teaching for his university's Continuing Ed campus in Albuquerque...The bottom line is that all of this thought highlights my need (at least for now--we could wait a couple of minutes to see if it goes away) to sit down and evaluate avenues of expansion, their costs (ALL the costs--including time) and benefits, and to think ahead beyond this year to where I would like to be (besides Montana) in five years. Is a five-year plan too much to ask? Hey Bill, there might even be goats in it!"},

Apparently you can't have a catalog without any photos. The printed word just isn't enough for some people, got to have pretty pictures. Note: all software sucks to some extent, all web interface software sucks stoats.Amidst the computer madness must come a full kiln load and those pesky bills which are still languishing in the embarrassingly large piles of paper on the kitchen table (unofficial desk) and on my desk in the office (which is too covered with said paper to actually use).

It was truly random--I started iTunes up and just hit play--but it is appropriate. I spent the weekend (up to 6:30 this morning when the last piece went in to slump) fixing mistakes on orders. I have been plagued for the past few (several) months with little errors in my orders. Paying more attention doesn't seem to be the solution, and my existing firing schedule doesn't work anymore either. Time to get all Filemaker Pro on the problem's ass.In  my current system I take a hand-written or faxed order and I manually enter it into an order form (in a spreadsheet--Excel) on the computer. Then I manually enter all the orders into my firing schedule. Previously, when putting things into the firing schedule, I was also taking into account the stock I had on hand, but that was messing me up as I would mark that I had something and so didn't make it for an order and then when it came time to ship, I no longer had it and was screwed. Whatever. Anyway, I then follow the firing schedule and only refer to the order again when it's time to ship--at which point lately I keep finding myself with the wrong pieces or not all the pieces I need to ship.But I have solution for the problem (I hope), and an intern to implement it. Now I am going to manually enter everything once. Everyone knows that the more times you transcribe data the more chance there is for a mistake. So one entry, one chance. I am going to put them all into the Filemaker Pro database I have been creating and then create reports against the one set of ddata for orders to fill, etc. This way not only will I have a current report of all orders due to ship, but I will also be able to run reports on product popularity and order history by account. With all this data collection, organization and potential for analysis, one might be tempted into thinking I actually run a business!So the morning is dedicated to data, wholesalecrafts.com website organization, and bills both paid and sent. This afternoon--after shipping three large orders and putting in a full kiln load for another--I am going to let work spill into the garden again and pressure wash the concrete pad in front of the studio annex, er, garage.

Maybe next weekend...So it's 9:30 in the morning and I already have three full kiln loads in and am watering the lawn for the first time this year. I'm not much of a grass person normally. I'm against the resource-intensive care most of them require in order to thrive. But I put in zoysia sod three years ago and, in spite of the dogs and my decided lack of interest in fertilizing, weeding (chemically or otherwise), and watering, it has more or less thrived until this year. This year I decided to mow it before it came out of winter dormancy in order to get it down to it's optimum height (we were pretty lax about mowing the last couple of years too). But taking it down so short let the weeds take hold before it greened up this spring. Then our current drought set the cap on its decline so I find myself with sad, patchy little bits of green. As they deserve better care from their steward, I girded my loins and set off to Lowe's yesterday. There, I armed myself with a weed-killing turf-builder (in liquid formula so I re-seed sooner), zoysia seed, starter fertilizer, a hand spreader for dispersal of said fertilizer and seed, a sprinkler and another hose (the current one being use to hand-water the posts of flowers every day. That I manage.)When I got home I staked up the drooping bamboo, used Round-up on the weeds growing in the stone patio, and mowed the lawn. Today I will put together the new pressure washer (also acquired at Lowe's) and clean off the deck and the parking pad outside the studio annex.Even though this is the forum for posts on GLASS WORK, clearly there is a twining of tasks this weekend that no longer allows for clear separation between the studio and the garden. That is the way is should be on the weekends I suppose. Move the hose, grind the edges of some more plates. Water the flowers, load some large display panels into the kiln. Fill the pond, pack an order for shipping. Summer, it's what's happening. Later today I think we're going to see the giant bugs at the Botanical Garden (an exhibit, not a reality)."},
{"title": "Summer Hours!", "date": "Friday, May 25, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Chicago skyline mug, \"Walking In the Air\" by George Winston on iTunes. The kiln load yesterday came out... interesting. I learned something new--or maybe I already knew it and forgot it (I am running into that more and more as I age). What I learned? You should pre-fire your ceramic fiber shelves. They have organic binders in them that can react in interesting ways with, say, Bullseye irid glass. I use a clear irid base on the majority of my Morceaux de Verre pieces and fire it irid side down (so irid against the kiln shelf). In Wednesday's firing the irid changed color all around the edge and pretty much disappeared in the middle (where there was no oxygen) of every piece. Definitely a chemical reaction, and one I have never seen before. I occasionally get a different reaction between Bullseye irid and Thinfire (the ceramic shelf paper distributed by Bullseye), but that's more of a bubbling up, gassing off kind of a reaction which ends up with the underside being pitted. I have never seen a true color change before, and it was impressive!Today is the official First Day of Summer for us. True, real summer doesn't start for another month, but we here in the south are advanced. Or maybe it's just a by-product of global warming. In any case, Jessie \"graduated\" from Pre-K yesterday (and got a certificate and everything) and has no school today (summer camp starts Tuesday). Today is also the first day of \"summer hours\" at CNN/Turner so Dave gets to come home at 3:00 every Friday starting today. What a nice beginning to an already three-day weekend! I might do something commensurate and, oh, take the late afternoon off too! What a radical concept--summer hours in the studio and weekends and holidays off! I'll have to tweak the firing schedule this morning to see if I can swing it and still make my deadlines.And it's official: I am going to be a regular contributing author to Glass Patterns Magazine starting in the fall issue. Lest ye think it's all about stained glass, do a search of their archives on \"fused\" and you will see that they have been publishing how-to articles on kiln-formed glass projects since the mid eighties. Now off to ship, fire, and Mom a playdate."},

Today is Jessie's \"graduation\" ceremony and lunch. Graduation from Pre-K. Oh boy. And I have YEARS of this stuff to look forward to. I also have ikebana this morning and a drive-by delivery/ship this afternoon. Junior, the delivery driver for Elliott Metalworks is meeting me in the Sam's Club parking lot off I-85 to give me a load of stands and to pick up the table I have for EMW. Hey, beats paying for shipping!As soon as it is cool enough, I need to check the kiln to see how the new shelves fired. I did a full load on them... bare. They're the same kind I had before, the distributor claims glass doesn't stick to them, glass never stuck to the old ones--but I used thinfire for the first couple of months of firings on them. Well, the worst that can happen is all the work and one side of the shelves are ruined.Finished the organization of my product catalog last night (Yea!) and now I just need to figure out how to translate it to wholesalecrafts.com. I diddled with it for about a half hour and decided to call Amory today to see if she can help me. I was surprised not to find and help on the site for it.The Buyer's Market is looking for \"stories\" to put in their marketing materials and I want to write something for that. The publisher of Profitable Glass and Glass Patterns contacted me while I was in Vegas and asked me if I would write a column for them so I need to follow up on that, and, oh yes! Over 10,000 people (not different people) have visited (I won't say \"read\") Glass Incarnate. I mentioned this fact to Dave and followed up with a modest, \"Of course I'm not Scalzi.\", to which he replied, \"He gets that many hits in 12 hours.\" Whatever."},

The new shelves are cut and in the kiln. Oooooh, flatness... Sophie is putting away all the new glass and frit and I am going to quick get a load in before beginning the great photographic essay that will be my catalog. I still have to tackle my wholesalecrafts.com site and figure out how to put everything up there as tightly organized as possible--I need drop-down menus for series, style and stand type, and I need the picture of the work to change appropriately... and I haven't figured out to do this yet.

I go back at 2:30 with cupcakes... (The Enjolie perfume song plays in the background again).Yesterday I was a Mommy all day. I did nothing but work on J's Superstar board... for 16 hours. I got up at 4:30 in a panic because I hadn't done anything on it all weekend. The weekend was given over to three birthday parties (with two more coming up this weekend and next) including one at our house with silly string and a pinata and an elaborate dinner cooked by Dave. I swear the end of May is busier for me than Christmas with all the parties and celebrating. But back to J's board: Who know choosing photos, printing photos, cropping photos, taping photos to bulletin board paper, creating captions for photos, printing captions, cropping captions, taping captions to bulletin board paper, outlining groups of photos in ribbon, and writing a \"here's me\" page about J. could take so long! I thought, two hours, tops. Hah.My glass delivery came yesterday too, just had it dropped on the pad outside the studio annex (i.e., on the driveway outside the garage) and I'll unpack it (get Sophie the Intern to unpack it) today. Another order came in over the wonderful Internet yesterday--my first one through Wholesalecrafts.com! It is one of my current customers, but it highlights my continued need for an online catalog and a complete set-up on WC.com. Maybe next week.Today, into the oven--with new shelves so I don't have to worry about the warped shelves curving panels which are supposed to be flat. I have no idea where I am in my firing schedule, but I know it's behind. But I don't regret a second of yesterday, the weekend past or the weekend to come. Some things will wait, some things shouldn't have to. This is J's week to be the class Superstar (the last one of the school year) and a crappy bulletin board would just not do."},

Got very excited this morning about the Neatreceipts software, but then came crashing back to earth upon discovering it's for Windows only. Winblows. Of course the Filemaker Pro I am using is also for Windows--I run it inside the Parallels desktop along with Quickbooks. Don't get me wrong--it's not that I commit to Mac, I am just cheap. I have years worth of software and I can't see buying all new just because I switched computers. I switched before and didn't have to upgrade. It's ludicrous to make me do it now.Some people like to have the latest versions of all their apps. These are probably the self-same people who like new cars every couple of years. Me, I like comfort and stability. Why on earth would I go get new every year when it means having to spend time figuring out the new features and interface and dealing with buggy new software? I really resent that Quicken and Quickbooks make me upgrade every couple of years (the online downloading of bank transactions is phased out for older releases). I understand they have to make a living and there are only so many people buying their product so they need to get them to buy it multiple times to stay in business. It still sucks.But glass. I need to focus on glass. I have been kiln forming (used to be called plain old fusing before it became frufty) for 20 years now. Well, 20 years in August. It was always a part-time thing for me as I couldn't support myself on it alone... I started to fill in the details between then and now, but, really, all that's important is that I put the real birthday of my studio  and business at summer of 2003. That's after we moved to Atlanta and I built the new studio in the lower level of our house. When I decided it was time to either make glass my entire full-time, professional focus or declare it an expensive hobby and get another job.The point of the above info? The other day (yesterday?) I wrote that I didn't have shows till August and that it was a bit scary. But what I missed is that--if my work is good and I have placed it well (in galleries where it matches the taste of the clientele)--the orders will come in by themselves over the summer. Not as many as I would get all at once from a show, but in dribs and drabs, and enough to provide the small bit of income necessary to support the development effort I put in for next year's designs and an entry for the Niche awards (again. third time's a charm?). That's what wholesale is all about--not having to do shows every weekend in order to sell work. It's taken three years to get to point where the theory meets the reality, but it's beginning to now.On the nuts and bolts of glass, by this afternoon I will have cut over 40 sheets into pieces, and I already know I don't have enough for the orders I have going out between now and June 15. I have another 90 sheets coming on Monday and about 500 lbs of frit. That should get me through for awhile.Now off to pick up the new router (wireless computer, not wood router)  and two new shelves for the kiln (time to have new FLAT shelves!)."},

Looking for grounding this morning--though the BNL song might not have been the best choice. Moved on to a \"home\" theme set on iTunes (anything with home in the title or artist name) and the current song is \"My Hometown\" by Bruce Springsteen. For heaven's sake, aren't there any cheerful songs about home?!? As I look over the rest of the titles \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" jumps out at me. Maybe I should just go slit my wrists right now. Getting out of THAT set and heading for the Drive By Truckers \"Shut Up and Get On the Plane\". That's better. Some days you just have to suck in and buck up.The network problems continue today like the plague of locusts they are. Finally narrowed it down to the router has gone bad. (Or the DSL modem doesn't like it anymore and is sabotaging the signal. Whatever.) Why do they do that? You go to all the trouble of reading the reviews, asking friends, etc., so you will get something that is reliable, has good coverage and doesn't cost an arm and a leg and then it DIES for no reason out of the blue after only a year of use. Heck, I keep FISH longer than I can keep a wireless router! And forget warranties. Like I would want another one like this if it goes bad. The frustration of the downtime is worse than the cost of the new router. Right now I am hardwired directly to the DSL modem so I can post.But it's not like I have a lot of computer time today. Parent-teacher conference at 10:20 and then GLASS to make.Yesterday I took my intern out for a spin, and wow do I like the mileage! I could get used to having an assistant/employee/whatever. I cut half of the pieces I need to ship in the next 30 days and Sophie made all the morceaux for them. She also refilled my frit jars (I work from 1 lb jars and store the bulk in 5 lb ones) and brought me sheets of glass to cut as I needed them. I was so ahead of my game that I even fired six dragonfly tiles I have had languishing dusty for over a year.  If I had someone half-time I could actually see getting Siyeh Home off the ground and retailing kitchen and bath tiles and the Architectural Clear series from my website. If I had someone full-time I could even retail glass and frit  in small quantities and specialty supplies (like my ring molds) though my website. I could really get used to this!Back to earth. I have an intern for another month and a half. I will get done what I can get done in that time. Today I will start her entering business cards into the contacts table of the Filemaker Pro database I am creating. We will finish cutting and making morceaux this afternoon, and I will make my artist cards to have them printed up. Next, we'll photograph all of my current work now that I have a permanent photography area set-up. (Oh technological joy: Now I have no internet connection at all, and no phone either. I might as well live in Paso Robles.)...The net is back going to post before it goes away again!"},

Another sick day for Jessie, another juggling day for me--though I won't be obsessing over weekends away today. Yesterday, in the midst of everything, I managed to ship the wrong piece to a new gallery. I wasn't too far off--they ordered an Ocean round in a Nouveau stand and I sent them an Ocean rectangle in a Nouveau stand, but it highlights my continued state of mental disarray. Yesterday--after a really wonderful weekend away--I added emotional disarray to the mix. But that is yet another topic for time and Stranded in the South.Today, today. I have to futz with my network. I began losing wireless and wired connections yesterday, and I am wondering if it was either some weird glitch running Windows inside Mac (with network access) for several days, or a hacker attack--also against the Windows. For the time being I have disabled the desktop machine but Sophie (my live-in intern and goddaughter) will revolt if I remove her internet access permanently. Unfortunately she uses Windows Messenger (installed on the Win 2K parallels desktop on my iMac... that's just sick) and my outages coincided with her furious messenging. I blame Bill Gates.Then there is the glass portion of the day. I have eleven orders to go out in the next 30 days then... nothing. I don't have another show till the Buyer's Market Summer Show the beginning of August. Normally I would be heading to Chicago and would need to get a bunch of work done for it, and then I would have a few commissions to do after the show. But now I have nothing between June 15 and August 4. It's a bit scary. Maybe I'll use the time to put in a pond... or put up the cruise pics!"},

Jessie caught a cold on the beach and is home today with a fever of 102 so work in the studio has been delayed. I am starting a sore throat as I write. I can't even remember what I was going to write today. The day is a jumble of glass artist, Mommy, summer vacation manager, human being. I talk with another artist about collaborative work and advertising for half an hour, then I look at cabin rentals on Hunting Island for future weekend getaways, then I give my child aspirin and wipe her face to help soothe her fever, then I diddle with the network which keeps dropping my connection... Days like this make me wonder how people actually manage to work at home. It is so hard to keep the separation of activity and mindset when the living and working spaces are so closely aligned. I crave a solid block of time doing one thing--preferably a glass thing (though I find myself obsessed with booking cabins in South Carolina state parks today...).Now it is mid-afternoon, I still haven't posted--nor have I been down to the studio yet and I have an order to pack and ship and another one to deliver before the day is out.

This morning has also had its share of rat holes, but I am giving up in exasperation on the one that has been driving me nuts, and I am settling in to post. Both the irregularity in my posting and the current rat hole dictate the title of the posting. The trip to Vegas, the review of the lasers for the book and having a live-in intern have blown my rituals, routines and rhythm all to kingdom come and I am scrambling to get them back.Missing blogging *without noticing it* is a sign that either I am in the midst of a major life change or I am in worse shape mentally from the over-extension of the past two weeks than I thought. The rat hole just highlights the situation even more. I sold a couple of pieces at ACRE to another artist's husband. He wrote me check. I remembered the check yesterday and went looking for it. It took me an hour to find it, but I did just before I left to get Jessie from school. I went to put it in with today's deposit this morning--and I can't find it again! I looked for well over an hour and it is just nowhere. I have a set place where I keep checks to deposit and a routine of putting them there as soon as I get them. I have a ritual of blogging every morning. What the heck is going on?...And three hours just went by between starting this post and now. Three hours of database creation, gallery order confirmation, other artist collaboration, vendor communication, editor clarification, and other artist order commiseration. Perspiration, irritation, exultation, the day is full. I think I'll just keep getting on with it rather than writing about it.Next week: the trials and tribulations of creating your own data-management tools. The problem with being a former software engineer who specialized in designing and implementing workflow and data management systems is that I have a low tolerance for the off-the-shelf stuff I can afford and am not even really impressed with the stuff I can't afford.

The jury is still out on whether to drive next year or not. I would love it if it were a family trip. It's the easiest drive I have ever done--the route is flat and straight, and there is almost no traffic on it. There isn't even a rush hour anywhere. The closest we came was in Albuquerque, and we were through it in no time. But when I am away from Dave and Jessie I desperately want to get home, and I'm just too old for two back-to-back 1000-mile days at the end of a show (set-up, show, breakdown), after already driving 2000 miles, after loading up...

Saturday was both the Mayweather De La Hoya fight and the Kentucky Derby so Vegas was packed. We managed a last minute limo (well, an Expedition anyway) for the night in spite  of the crowds and headed out at 6:00.Dinner at Delmonico's was fabu and the Thunder From Down Under was beyond good. I understand some (all?) of the group went to the Olympic Gardens (or whatever) last time and it was a bit too much. The TFDU was... just right. Yum.

Thank heaven I have her, because I would never in a million years have caught all the layout, alignment, font size, etc. issues there were on every page. They have a lot to correct in a very short time. And I had my own textual errors that I corrected--even though this was not a time for editorial editing. Given that we are 16 pages short (that's over 10% of the projected length and content...) I wanted to make sure that what remained was as tight, accurate, and readable as possible. And a the end of the day, it's got potential to be a great book.Today is also the end of the ACRE show. We go through 2:30 and then begin breaking down and packing up--my least favorite activity for a show. Well, maybe I like set-up less, but during set-up the potential of the show still exists whereas at breakdown, it's all over but the mess.It has not been a great show, but it is the first year. Unless something goes drastically wrong, I will do it again next year. (But next year I think I will figure out how to ship--or plan to extend the trip and go on to California or down to Arizona.) So far I have picked up three new accounts in three new states and had one small re-order from an existing client. I am also doing a TON of trades with other artists--I have three going right now and am probably going to add to that number today.Right now I am sitting on the balcony of my room a the Courtyard hotel overlooking the pool. I don't know how it happened, but at this moment I am so relaxed, peaceful and happy. I could sit all morning listening to the grackles and watching the ripples in the water against the blue pool. Of course there would have to be coffee. Maybe it's being in the west again. I love it here.However, instead of sitting and dreaming the rest of the day, I am going to pack up and head over to the convention center to hang out with friends.

Yesterday I had a handful of requests for price lists and information. I would be more discouraged if there were throngs of buyers streaming past my booth. There aren't. If buyers in the aisles were salmon swimming upstream to spawn, they would be on the brink of extinction.So I have time to finish the edits of the book. And that project is going extremely well. I worked on it till 10:00 last night and got up and back to it at 4:00 this morning. Now at almost 11:00, I have only about 40 pages of projects (faster reading than basics) left. My analysis?

But I have to say that it doesn't work to treat the mornings as if I were on the east coast and the nights as if I were on the west... There has to be time for sleep. I have been up since then because yesterday I discovered to my GREAT dismay that my book is only 128 pages long. It's supposed to be 144 pages long, I wrote it to be 144 pages long, and I was forced to cut it back in February when I was told it was too long. Turns out it wasn't too long, and it's a mystery how it ended up short. Also turns out that it's now too late to do anything about it without pushing the publication date back to next year. (And for any smart ass out there who feels like saying I can put all the cut information in the NEXT book, I have to remind you that there won't BE a next book!)I cried a lot between yesterday and this morning, but I am finally reconciled to the publisher's decision to go ahead with only 128 pages. And make no mistake, it was their decision. They didn't ask me, write me, call me, apologize for the major screw-up, acknowledge that they made a mistake, zip, zilch, nada. But we move on. I have to hold to the thought that it is still a very good book (whose Amazon sales ranking is on the rise again!), and 8 pieces of paper are not enough to either make or break it.Now for the show. I picked up a great new gallery in Asheville, NC today, the Grovewood. They--and everyone else so far--love the new stands. I am all set-up, I have pricing on the pieces and I only have a couple of documents left to create... oh yes, and an electronic catalog. But if I don't get to that till next week I'm not going to sweat it! I can't believe it's already 2:30 pm--the day has flown. Tonight is the show party, but we are giving it a miss.

I panicked when I remembered that it was 10:00 in Atlanta and I had promised to call Jessie every night at 8:30 to tell her good night. Bill and Elaine lent me their phone to call, but Dave was apparently on the treadmill and didn't hear it. J heard it and went in to tell him it was ringing, but she came up behind him and startled him. Ever tried to turn around on a moving treadmill? All I'll say is it's a good thing they have emergency shut-down cords on those things.One more thing about the drive that I forgot to put yesterday: I can't wait till they have the new alternate route from Phoenix (and also from Interstate 40) up to Las Vegas done that does not include going over Hoover Dam.  It's not actually an alternate route, it's just an incredibly high over pass that goes over the canyon beside the dam. It's enough that there are security check points that all vehicles must exit the road and pass through before crossing the dam now (all of that glass and stuff in the back of the minivan *could* have been plastique, I suppose), and that it's one twisty lane in both directions, but it's really beyond the pale that there are crosswalks filled with dawdling, gawking tourists every 15 feet as you traverse the dam proper.Pedestrians in cities know how to cross streets (quickly), and you would think they would cross a highway that much faster. But there must be an I'm-on-vacation-the-world-must-move-slowly thing that hits them just before they lollygag over to look down at Lake Mead from the top of the dam. I finally bellowed at the woman in the last cross walk to thank her for taking her own sweet time as she finally made it to the other side. She would have made a nice hood ornament. For the return trip I don't care if I am at a bachelorette party ogling the Thunder Down Under the entire previous night; we are leaving at 6:00 am and I am missing the whole tourists-as-potential-road-kill experience.Guess I should close with how the unload and set-up went yesterday, but it was so trivially easy there's almost nothing to say. Today (for other people) will, I'm sure, be another story, as will breakdown and load out. But those are not for me to worry about now. Now it's time to read my book before heading to the show to finish setting up, maybe after hunting down some coffee!!!"},

Forgot to mention earlier that the night before I got on the road I managed to get a Flickr page done for all the new pieces on stands. They're not on my website because I can't figure out how to make a new page using the heinous EZNettools software interface (why the hell can't I just ftp pages there like I can to every other [civilized] hosting company?). I will, however, put a link to them up on my homepage prochainement. That means soon. My good intention to speak nothing but English to Sophie has thus far fallen by the wayside and I find myself thinking more and more--and blogging a bit--in French. That will have to stop.Now off to read through my  book before heading to the Convention Center to unload and begin set-up.Coffee in a little white styrofoam cup, \"Willin' \" by Lowell T. George, covered by Steve Earle, on iTunes. No random choice that--drove through Tucumcarie yesterday and Dave emailed me the song to listen to this morning (he had just ripped the cd). Lyrics here for those unfamiliar with the appropriateness of the song, and a snippet of song on top of the \"Songs iLike\" part of the iLike sidebar on the right. My contribution to the iTunes library for the trip was \"Amarillo By Morning\" by George Strait. It wasn't morning, but it was Amarillo yesterday.Gallup, New Mexico. It's been a journey. Didn't get out the door till 3:30 pm on Saturday. No typo there: PM. And still drove 500 miles. Took Dave helping load the van and utzing me out the door (in a loving, caring way, of course) to get out that early. Stayed in some motel in Arkansas (I think) with cardboard walls and avid tv viewers. Slept little. Woke terse.The highlight of Day 1 was finding myself on a major highway not in the gps. It kept telling me to turn and I finally had to get off to buy a road atlas--only to find I HAD packed the road atlas as soon as I got back in the car. Oh well. Now Sophie and I can each look at one as I drive. In spite of the late start and going in circles for the dingy gps a couple of times, we did 500 miles.Day 2. After little sleep, hit the road at 6:00 am. Drove over 1100 miles to Gallup. It was a pretty easy drive with only one half-hour patch of 10 mph due to road construction. Ate at Denny's and stayed at La Quinta. Didn't turn on the AC so the room got a bit warm, but slept pretty soundly. Sophie wondered if we would hear a train in the middle of the night as one of the main east-west US tracks parallels I-40 and is right in front of our motel and sure enough at 2:30 I woke to the whistle at 2:30. But that was okay; sitting bolt upright at 5:27 because I remembered I forgot to lock the car the night before was a bit more of a shock. Threw on clothes, ran down the elevator (an oxymoron--it was slow as dirt) and checked it. It's fine and now locked.It's now 6:09 am and past time we were on the road. No time to re-read and edit. Post and run day.Vegas here we come (you can guess tomorrow's song, now I just need to download it...)"},

The life of the author continues! This morning at 7:30 UPS delivered the black and white laser prints of my book. Now I have a week to review them for the penultimate edit (the ultimate edit comes with the color lasers). First thing I noticed is that the dedication is missing--gonna have to fix that. And I have to send in the artist statement now that it has been winnowed down to 200 words (thank you Bryon!). This edit is for corrections of errors only, but I am going to beg for a photo to be swapped out: There are three pictures of my work in the introduction, and not one of them is a box. I understood a box would be included and since that's the award-winning work (and my best), it would be nice to have it in.But the book will have to wait. Today two gallery orders ship, one gets hand-delivered, everything gets photographed in the new photo area, and I send pictures to the Milwaukee Museum of Art so they can order early next week. They have an impressionism exhibit this summer and would like to have my work in time for it. I also need to drill the hard walls for my booth and begin the packing process. Oh yes, and I have to collect my new intern (who is also my god daughter Sophie) from the airport this afternoon. She is arriving from Paris and the first thing we are going to do to get ready for the Vegas show is get pedicures. Yum. Great way to end a week and begin a journey.Now I need to get showered and dressed so I am ready when Dee gets here with her stuff. She is another local artist doing ACRE. We were going to share shipping to the show, but since I am driving I am just going to carry it all in the van. She's a jeweler so she doesn't need much room.Next post: On the Road!"},

It was actually Thursday morning 3 Am when I woke to the pitter patter of little feet headed our way down the hall. Someone had a bad dream. Then it was Thursday morning 5:07 Am when I finally gave up trying to sleep sandwiched between two restless bodies and put her, snoring gently, back in her own bed. The following 2.5 hours of sleep were crucial to the success of my day.Now I type furiously before heading out the door... again. I spent all day yesterday in the car driving hither and yon (hence the lack of post) and today is shaping up to be almost as bad. On the plus side, I have hard walls and new lower shelves for my pedestals. I have enough crossbars to support the walls, the lights and the hanging panels. I got pvc  pipe and potting soil, and took 1/2 a personal day to schlep J to a photo shoot for her new modeling gig. Hah. I am the mother of the Talent.Personal days. Most people who work in the corporate world take them for granted. Well I am in the corporate world (my studio is incorporated) and I think they are a pain in the ass. All a personal day means is that I have to work extra some other time to make up for it.Find a happy place, find a happy place, find a happy place... oh yeah! Looks like I am going to pick up another museum store--Milwaukee Museum of Art. that makes three major city art museums carrying my work. Sure, I'm not in their permanent collections (ROFLOL at the thought), but it's a start. Just makes it that much more imperative to get the work photographed and in a catalog. Pics tomorrow. The rework of the Trout series is stunning, the new stands are too.Now to relate a tale of woe. I posted the other day about screwing up the firing schedule and not doing the pieces I needed for the new stands. Well, I did worse. I have two gallery orders going out tomorrow and when I inventoried the pieces the other night to make sure I had them all, I discovered that I had made all the pieces from BOTH galleries' orders from the 2006 BMAC, not the 2007 BMAC.... I had all the wrong work. Was in the studio till 11:30 the night before last frantically trying to clean up after that one. But I think I caught everything and made all the pieces I need. Good thing I had a day of slack in the schedule because now I will be firing right up until I leave--there'll be 150 degree pieces being loaded into the car Saturday morning for sure."},

If you don't know the song, it's a good one. Lightning-fast pace for the morning. Fitting. So how long have I been doing shows? It's a rhetorical question, but the answer is \"too long to be making blunders like this one\". What did I do? Well yesterday afternoon--four and a half days before I leave for Vegas--I discovered that the list of pieces I have been making for the show does not include pieces for the new metal stands that I unpacked yesterday. Which is to say I was 11 large pieces short yesterday afternoon with  pretty full firing schedule between then and Saturday. As Bugs would say, \"What a maroon!\".I re-did the list for the pieces in stands and got the load in the kiln by 10:30 last night. Now I look forward to three more late nights in the studio because it takes 20-22 hours for a firing in Big Bertha so today's load won't go in till late, nor tomorrow's. Thursday is the final slump load and that takes less time so I should be able to get everything out and shipped Friday.In the interests of seeing what else I might have screwed up, after I finish posting I am going to go down and inventory all the pieces I have done the past couple of weeks. I need to make sure I have everything I am supposed to ship for two gallery orders this week. I also have a local consignment delivery (Sabra) to do today, and a door closing and a door opening: Becky Sizemore has closed Creative Spirit in Decatur for good, and my work has been picked up by Alexia, a gallery a couple of doors down. So I pick up from one and deliver to the other. Though there isn't much to pick up from Becky's--she had a sale last week and much of my work went. Alexia may have to wait till I get back from Vegas.I was going to finish today with a pic of one of the new stand pieces--a 12X14 Pacifica rectangular piece in a Nouveau stand. If I had been able to, you would have noticed the clean lines and lack of weld on the front. However, since I am still DITZING around with my photography set-up, you won't see any pics till tomorrow... if I'm lucky."},
{"title": "Monday, Monday", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Don't Cross the River\" by America on iTunes. The morning started with a steaming mug of coffee delivered to the side of the bed by elves (well, by Dave anyway). I awoke to the gentle tickle of roasted beans wafting seductively into my nostrils. I managed to drag myself into a semi-sitting position--just enough so that gravity would work its magic on the coffee in my mouth and direct it to the next step on its journey--and consumed half of the elixir over the course of several minutes before opening my eyes. The first thing said eyes blearily focused on was the inscription on the inside of the Austin mug, and Starbuck's made a mistake: They put \"The Capitol of the Lone Star State\", but what it should read is \"Live Music Capitol of the World\". Now that we have that straight...It's Monday, gentle folk. The final countdown to Vegas has begun and I become aware of the enormity of the undertaking I face. What was I thinking? 1972 miles. 1972 miles. Someone must have put something in my kool-aid for me to contemplate driving, and I'm beginning to think they also spiked my coffee when I decided to do this show at all. Oy. I am still futzing around trying to figure out what to take (I reworked two older Morceaux de Verre series on Saturday and am thinking of making more of both of them to have a pedestal each). Why can't I just do glass chocolates? Oh what freedom there must be in only needing one piece--as opposed to four--and being able to quick photograph it and slap it up.Photography. Another hot topic. There are now SEVERAL galleries waiting for my mythical catalog. It was easier to write a book than it has been to put together a catalog. At least I have the seamless white background to take pictures on now. And the halogen lamps Dave found for me are assembled. Now to black out the back room window, figure out how to do the white balance on the camera (there is a great article in the April  Crafts Report on how to take digital photos of your work), and get photoing.(time passes...)So I spent the last hour re-reading my camera manual and re-doing my price list. Again. My glass costs went up 5% this year and shipping went up too so I finally settled on upping everything 7%. Oy! It's hard enough figuring out how to price your work the first time around. The constant tweaking and updating to stay current with the market AND on top of escalating costs is both time-consuming and annoying.Fortunately I also spent a bit of time this morning grumbling to Bill Elliott of Elliott Metal Works about the necessity of producing a catalog and he offered up that they do theirs on a cd... What a brilliant idea! No trees will be killed to make the gi-normous catalog of all my current work and updating it will be a snap! He even told me the name of the software package he uses to put it together (Vallen Jpegger). I looked for a Mac catalog building application and didn't find one, but I also stumbled upon Vevo! Catalog Builder and am giving it a spin right now.Well, I was giving it a spin but I just looked at the clock and it is almost 1:45 pm! The day is flying and I have to take all my panels in to get them drilled so I will have them back by Friday. Ta ta!"},

Not an accidental song choice this morning there--I decided I wanted to start the morning there. Well, start the morning is a bit of a stretch as I just got back from reading \"Edward Fudwupper Fibbed Big\" by Berkeley Breathed to J's pre-K class. Tough audience. I finished the story, left the book and fled.Preparation for Vegas continues. I took the car in for an oil change and complete go-over this morning. It isn't even a year old yet, but 4,000 miles (more or less) over mountains and fully loaded in a week (more or less) is nothing to sneeze at.The hardwall saga continues... When I picked up the one 3 mm panel of pvc yesterday I was amazed at how big it is. I had the middle row of seats in the back of the minivan (when will Honda make ALL the seats fold into the floor like Dodge and Chrysler?!?) so I couldn't just slide it in, but now I am wondering if 10 sheets will fit. And if they do, the floor is not level; it's all bumpy with latches for seats, rises and dips. Maybe I should build a platform for the rest of the stuff to sit on instead of on the hard walls. Or maybe a sheet of plywood underneath the panels is enough support for them. Or maybe I should consider cutting down the panels from 4X8 to either 2X8 or 4X4. Cut down they would be easier to pack, move, store and hang. But would the extra seams detract significantly form the walls?The main reason for even doing hard walls is how good the hanging panels look against them as compared to how they look hanging in front of curtains. With the hard, flat walls, the light reflects better and makes them really sparkle. It isn't a night and day difference, but it is noticeable. The hard walls also look cleaner and make me look more professional. But they are heavier and more of a pain to store. What to do, what to do!Right now what to do is get down and get another load in the kiln. The new stands from Elliott Metal arrive today and I have to meet the driver off I-85 to get them (free shipping with a little effort beats paying UPS any day!). The day is filling up. Monday I will be Live From Joe's where I will be working on my new catalog and artist cards."},

I succumb yet again to the golden age of rock 'n' roll (16). Although in this case the song was originally released in '73 and I was only 12... so I was precocious. Notice that this isn't my first cup of coffee today. I have already taken J to school, taken the dogs to the groomer, picked up the drycleaning,  weighed in at Weight Watchers, ordered a sheet of extruded pvc that I will pick up this afternoon, and arranged pick-up of my new stands for tomorrow afternoon. Now if I can get a quick couple of kiln loads in I will be caught up!Yesterday I did a mock booth set-up in the driveway and I am definitely taking the plunge and buying the hard walls. Instead of worrying about an exact fit I am planning to overlap the smaller pieces on each side so that I will never find myself in a situation where my space is too small to set-up my booth. Now all I have to figure out is if I can get away with 3 mm sheet pvc or if I need the 6 mm. The 6 mm is twice as heavy and almost twice as expensive so it would be nice to be able to get by with the 3 mm. But it is very floppy sloppy. However the 3 mm will make a great photographic background so I am buying a sheet today and drilling it to test for the walls before setting it up for photography. If it works, I go with 3 mm for the walls. If it doesn't, I get the 6 mm. It's a win-win. And I am buying another sheet of the 6 mm and having it cut up to be the new lower shelves on my pedestals. Now I just need to get more cross bars for bracing the middle of the walls...Amazon finally got their act together and I am now verified as the author of A Beginner's Guide to Kiln-Formed Glass. I have begun my first post for it, but it is harder to write than I thought it would be. Will work on it more later.

I was even more excited to discover I could create an author page and start a blog there. Sensibly, you have to be verified as the actual author of a book, you can't just link to a book and start posting away. I requested verification and provided all the necessary info for Amazon to contact my editor/publisher. I got back an automatic email:\"We have received your verification request for AmazonConnect.

{"title": "Retirement?", "date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2007", "text": "Coffee was hours ago, but there is still music. Currently it's \"Brilliant Disguise\" by Bruce Springsteen. Today, as always, iTunes nails the topic. One of the big topics in the Crafts Report this month (May 2007 issue) is retirement for artists. Can we? Do we? How? In the normal course of things we artists might make enough to get by. But to make enough to actively save for retirement? How does *anyone* do that any more? I am in my mid-forties and I have a couple of piddling retirement accounts from past careers in my journey to now--not nearly enough to cover my golden-year expenses for even a year (assuming I could begin to estimate what my golden-year expenses will be). Social Security sent me a nice letter again last week telling me that if I keep going as I am I will be entitled to about $700 a month when I am 65. Of course that's making the HUGE assumption that there is any money left in Social Security in 20 years when I turn 65.But enough about tomorrow. I'll continue to be a grass-ant or an ant-hopper. It's not that I don't toil, I do toil. I toil almost ceaselessly; I just don't worry about tomorrow as I toil. I toil for toiling's sake.Today I order the hard walls for my display and get the electrical order in to Champion for ACRE. I looked at foam core, Structa board (like foam core but a little more durable--still paper over the foam core though), gator foam (plastic over a foam core) and Sintra or Komatex. The latter two are sheets made from extruded (isn't that a great word?) pvc. There is no \"core\": They are plastic all the way through. You pay for the solidity in the weight: Structa board weighs 5.2 lbs per 4' X 8' sheet. Sintra and Komatex weigh 28 lbs per 4' X 8' sheet. I need nine sheets of whatever I get. That's a big weight difference. But I decided to go with the sheet pvc because it is the most durable--scratches barely show and dirt can be washed off and I can stack everything else in the van on top of it without damaging it. It costs 2.5 times as much as Structa board does right now*, but I should never need to replace it. I am getting around the variable size of exhibitor spaces by overlapping one sheet on each side. I don't think it will diminish the look of the booth and it will provide me with maximum flexibility. I'll drill holes in the top and middle of each sheet and cable tie the sheets to my pipe and drape system.(*If anyone out there is thinking of getting Structa board, now is the time. My distributor is selling it for cost to get it out into the market. That puts it about $6 a sheet more than foam core and $38 a sheet *less* than gater foam.)UPS *finally* authorized my claim for the panel they broke last month--just in time for me to ship out the replacement today!The kilns are on a continual firing cycle from now till ACRE. Today is a Morceaux de Verre fuse in Big Bertha and a Cloudstone melt in the as-yet-unnamed middle kiln and there is supposed to be a box in the little kiln. I even have someone who is interested in carrying the boxes at the ridiculously high price I have to ask for them and I am still dragging my feet. I say I love doing boxes--and I do--but it's hard to get one in.And what would a day be without orders to get in for supplies, a catalog to design, a website to update (let's all have a good laugh about that one), an artist bio to finish, and product cards to create to send to galleries who carry my work. How will I get it all done? It's not a mystery that I won't."},

Twelve days and counting til I leave for Vegas. I believe that I am not alone in freaking out about this show. It's a first year show with a purported 800 artists. This cannot go well. It is going to be more of a zoo, more of a madhouse, more innately insane than any other show... and yet, it will all work out. How? I don't know, it's a mystery (and that makes two movies I quote from regularly now).And speaking of shows and quoting, I got both an email and a postcard from the One of a Kind Show last week. They start with: “This is my biggest show of the year, every year. The people, the culture, the energy of Chicago all come together for a great final show. Can’t wait to do it again next year!” Brenda Griffith, Siyeh Studios. Well, it's only one studio, not multiples, but the rest is true. And it's also true I haven't got my application in for this year's show yet. Very funny that I am being utzed with my own words.And speaking of utzing... I got a packet of articles to read from my Mom last week (last month, whenever; some time recently enough to still be in the \"to do\" pile). One of them was from the Ladies Home Journal, June 2006 (how my mother saves magazines and newspapers until she has read them--no matter how out of date they are--is another story. It's a very funny one, but not for here and now). The article was about how we are all moving so fast in life now that we don't even have time to figure out what we want to be doing, much less do it. We surround ourselves with gadgets to make us more efficient so we can move ever faster, and we seek the holy grail of organization as the cure for all our ills. We can no more use a rotary dial phone (and wait the 11 extra seconds it takes for the numbers to be dialed) than we can walk to the store. I didn't have time to read the whole article, but what I read really hit home and when I have a chance to finish it I know it will change my life. (Yes, the irony in that sentence was intentional.)I have felt for some time that I am over-committed, over-scheduled, and over-extended, and I am over it. My first step to better mental health has been to stop scheduling my weekends. I thought that less would get done if I didn't plan what I would do and be ready to do it, but that hasn't been the case. Now when Saturday comes I get up, sit on the couch, sip coffee and look at the weather. I think what I would like to do and what needs to be done. Then I try to achieve a balance between the two. I have been avoiding putting the word \"must\" before any weekend activity--we all have enough \"musts\" in the week, there is no place for them on the weekend.The result? I fired four kiln loads over the weekend for ACRE, gallery orders and my donations for Jessie's school auction. The house is cleaner (not from lack of dirt but from lack of piles of sh*t everywhere) than it has been in, well, years! Some might say that I have finally gotten settled in from the move from Austin, but I know better. I'm trying to do less and therefore doing more. How? I don't know, it's a mystery.So today. What's on the schedule for today? Making the final decision on hard walls for ACRE and ordering them (or not). Formatting current images of my work to upload to Application for the One of a Kind Show app. Shipping six panels to Jeff to use in his work for ACRE. Finishing an art nouveau stand design for Elliott Metal to make for me for ACRE. Receivables, Payables and other paperwork. And I need to do two full kiln loads. Wow. How will I get it done?

My brain is so full! I don't know whether to post about glass (well, tradeshow display booths for glass) or countable infinite sets vs. uncountable infinite sets and the Penrose tiling theory. Though I have to say Wikipedia is not nearly as fascinating or clear as Dave in its definitions. When Dave was explaining both last night they actually made sense (He is reading The Road to Reality and I asked him about it Who knew what I was starting!). I could see something in my head for which there are no words in English. It felt like my head was cracking open a bit and there were lines and colors and pictures instead of words. I usually see in words.(And as a side note I am thinking that's one of the reasons I have always had such a hard time with math: I am a linguist by education and am very grounded in the relationship of the words in a language to thoughts in my head. If I have a word for it, it is real and I can see it. And the word doesn't have to be English. There are things I can express and understand in French that I can't translate into English. But if there is a concept for which there are no words (like the little Greek squiggles used in math) I have a hard time understanding it.)

When I sat down to write this morning I thought, \"What would be the perfect song title for this morning's post?\", and the answer was Sweet Spot. I didn't know if there was a song called Sweet Spot, but I figured there should be and probably was so I went to the iTunes store, and voila! There were many versions, this was the highest ranked and the only one with vocals I previewed.Today, today, oh today. Some in, some out, but lots, lots, lots to do! I lucked out yesterday and found about 40 more sheets of clear irid glass in the second case from December. Good thing as the 15 I had wouldn't even get me through the first half of the pieces I have scheduled to fire before ACRE.I am thinking about expanding my product line and offering fountains. I love the fountain project for the book, and I have not seen anyone else offer anything like it (I fuse, cast or slump all the parts but the light and the pump). I have seen plenty of fountains with glass incorporated into them, but this piece is unique. Pricing could be problematic though.But now, off to Ikebana and then on to interface flor to order the PURPLE carpet. Whoo hoo. (Lots of whoo hoo this week. It's a Good Thing.)"},

Sales ranking on the book got as high as 33,345 yesterday. Not bad for a book that won't even be out till November (and thanks, in large part I believe, to all of you who went out and pre-ordered!). I am now rolling on the floor laughing at having succumbed to the Amazon Writer's Disease (obsessively checking the sales ranking of one's book). When the book actually comes out I am going to have to put a parental lock on the page so I can't get to it. Otherwise I can just see myself obsessively, compulsively checking the ranking and the reviews all day, every day. Maybe the solution is to quickly start writing ANOTHER book. Maybe fiction this time (more hysterical laughter).Yesterday I cleaned the studio annex (aka the garage). I have a shipping area again and wide, clean aisles. Good thing as I only have 15 sheets of clear irid from the *95* I had the first of December and so will need to order another case... and put it somewhere to languish unpacked. Unless there is more clear irid in the second box of glass from that shipment (which I will unpack today). I had to order in December even though I really didn't need as much as I ordered so I could bump up my quantity discount. I can't believe I went through 80 sheets of glass in the off-season...This morning I already ordered the first round of metal stands from Elliott Metal Works--thank you again to everyone who participated in the poll (and Ren, your piece goes out next week!). I am excited to be debuting them at ACRE. Now I just need to decide whether to buy carpet for the booth now or not. I am seriously tempted. I will need it for the BMAC in August--I have rented carpet there for the last time!--why not have it for both? GO for a whole new look to complement the new stands?And speaking of ACRE, I counted my metal uprights and crossbars yesterday that I will need to hang my lighting and I am several crossbars short. So this morning I have to do a formal (electronic) drawing of my lighting and drapery set-up to figure out how many more crossbars to order. And speaking of drapery... Since I am going to do my own poles I am effectively building a booth within a booth  and not using any of the common elements with my neighbors. So theoretically I *could* do foamcore walls. They are cleaner, sleeker looking than the white drapes, and if I were careful I might even be able to re-use the foamcore for one or two more shows. Of course storing the 25 4X8 sheets of foamcore that come in a case would be a pain. They have to be kept flat as they tend to warp. Maybe I could put them in the loft area of the shed we had built last year to hold everything displaced when I appropriated the garage for a studio annex... Oh Dave will LOVE that!A final note for the day: My father-in-law has knit me a cardigan (which I understand from him is a really, really BIG cardigan. Yummy. I love big sweaters) and he has asked me if I want to make the buttons for it! I am going for dichro glass buttons. Pics posted as soon as they're done."},

We changed things up here a bit this week and I am doing all the Sprout to-school-and-back wrangling for awhile. And Dave is back to making coffee. Sometimes I just need a little shake-up to get moving again. I have been stalled in the studio for the past couple of weeks. Some of it has been recovering from writing the book--and what a long process that is turning out to be!--and some of it is probably seasonal.And speaking of the book... It is available for pre-order on AMAZON! From my conversation with the publisher a couple of weeks ago it is my understanding that the photo used for the cover is just the catalog cover and not the actual cover of the book. I hope that's the case as the current cover has a shot of the birdbath on it and the yellow in it doesn't show up at all against the yellow/tan background... I am going to keep my fingers crossed that this is something that gets updated when the final cover is done. I am also in the process of setting up the Amazon.com author's page (wow, who would have thought?) where I will do the official marketing blog. Good thing I like to blog. And it's nice to have a designated \"happy place\".Now back out of the clouds and in to the studio. I still haven't finished unpacking the Bullseye order I got in December and I think I am going to use it up before I ever get it put away. I did my firing schedule for my three upcoming gallery orders and ACRE yesterday and it looks like I have enough glass to do everything with not much left over.One last note. I am on hold with UPS... again... about the panel they damaged enroute to Chicago. They pierced the box containing three 32 X 16 inch panels with something sharp and it chipped a 1\" X 3\" piece off the back of one of the panels. I put in a claim for replacement of the panel and asked that the piece be examined on-site--the customer needed the packing for the two intact panels to get them home (he had the entire shipment sent to his business). UPS messed up and had the package picked up. It wasn't packed for carrying because it wasn't supposed to be carried and they broke the damaged panel in half. Okay. I got over that. But then they denied the claim! Without ever calling me to ask how I had originally packed it, they looked at the box, the remaining packaging, the one panel and said \"Nope.\" They completely ignored the hole in the box where they pierced it. The hole that just happened to line up exactly with the chip in the back of the panel. This had better end well..."},

I can't do the foam tiles because my boots (I wear them for the February show) have stiletto heels and go right through them. I thought about gluing carpet to foam but that's too much work for not enough pay off, and I also thought about buying the carpet already on the thick foam, but I would have to buy two sets (25% more tiles than I actually need and also 25% more cost) because I always have a 10 X 15 booth and they are configured only for 10 X 10 and 10 X 20.Yesterday I planned the pond (+stream  +second pond... poor Dave!) and started picking the antique climbing roses I will plant--all chosen because they do well in the south as well as having all the characteristics I am looking for in color scent, flower shape and size.

It's called preparing for ACRE. Yesterday, thanks to Dee Janssen, I found the Wholesalecrafts.com artist discussion group for the show and gleaned from it that crossbars are not free (I am spoiled by the Rosen shows which provided free, unlimited metal). I also read much about everyone else's shipping dilemmas.Every show I redo my display to some extent. I start out by saying I am just going to use the same layout and display I did for the last show (unless I have had a configuration change like going from 10 X 15 to 10 X 20 or some such). Then halfway through the process I think I should make some major changes like finally investing in interlocking foam or carpet squares, or renting hardwalls for this particular show, or some other major, expensive thing. Like maybe canceling buying the plastic crate, canceling the airline tickets and just DRIVING 1972 miles to Vegas. See the USA in a... Honda. If the show were later in the year I would drive so I could head up to Montana to visit the parents at the end of it. And I'd take Jessie. Heck, I'd have my Mom meet me there to watch Jessie and help with the show. Or I could get Dave to fly out and we'd all go to California after the show. See how things can spin out? Back to earth.For the One of a Kind Show last December I invested in my own upright and crossbar system to support my lights. I don't bring them to the BMAC, but I am going to have to bring them to ACRE because of the pay-for-your-crossbar thing. And I revisit the carpet issue. Every year I rent carpet at the BMAC and it costs like sin. I should just bite the bullet and buy it. I have resisted because I didn't want to have to manage a large roll, but the 2' interlocking squares are another matter. I can buy foam squares cheaply at Sam's Club, or carpet squares with foam backing specifically for tradeshows expensively from a tradeshow supplier, or I can get flat (no foam) interlocking carpet squares at Home Depot less expensively. Or I can just use the free, grey carpet provided for ACRE and worry about the other carpet issue for the BMAC this summer saving me shipping costs to Vegas for yet one more thing, and saving the hassle of trying to get it by next week--not to mention the anxt of PICKING THE COLOR.

After months of a love-hate relationship (he is... difficult) I find that I have to make my own coffee every morning (Dave used to do it for me) because it is such a pain to clean, and we now go through coffee like, well, water. Is the alleged superiority of the brew worth the sacrifice of having to brew and wait for my own coffee every morning? Or would I have to make it anyway because Dave is tired of making coffee for me every day?What does it say about your day that your first obsession upon waking is about a caffeine-bearing substance? And why is every sentence today a question? Bean juice is in the Montreal skyline mug, back to the real world. \"Choctaw Hayride\" performed by Alison Krauss on iLike. The speed matches my need for the next ten minutes. I have to get the dogs to the vet by 9:15 which means leaving in 10 minutes. Can I say it all in 10? We'll see.Have to switch pre-show gears completely for ACRE. Usually I can make the pieces I am taking right up till the day I leave. I have been known to pull 200 degree bowls out of the kiln, wrap them in towels, toss them in the van and head out. Not this time. Yesterday I slogged through more freight company quotes and the bottom line for everyone is that I have to be ready to ship by 4/17... That's two full weeks before the show. I was already planning on 4/20 and that was already early. 4/17 is like ta kill me. To borrow from yesterday, I will be humping again today to get it all done. Heck, I still haven't had final confirmation of delivery next week for the crate I ordered the other day. And iTunes really has a sense of humor this morning: \"Let It Be\" by the Beatles just came on.

This is called the laser print stage and I am tasked to go over everything with a nit comb as this is the stage where typos MUST be caught. Changes must be minimal--adding or subtracting words in running text can seriously mess up the layout--and I have from whenever the package containing the laser proofs arrives on Tuesday May 1 till Thursday night (absolute latest) to get it all done. This amount of time would be perfect if all I had to do was review the laser proofs. Unfortunately, I will be in Las Vegas for the ACRE show setting up on Tuesday May 1, and then doing the show Wednesday and Thursday. What can't be cured must be endured.Cleaning, organizing and new work areas are the themes of the day. I can't even walk through the garage, uh, studio annex right now. 60 cu ft of Styrofoam peanuts and 250 ft of bubble wrap take up a lot of room and they are splayed higgeldy piggeldy in the former aisles and on top of the work surfaces (in bags, of course). And I can't find ANYTHING. I have lost all three keys to the household drills, the majority of the screwdrivers, and a host of other tools. Mail for the past month can be found in unopened piles throughout the house.I am really good at focusing on one thing and getting it done. I can even juggle two or three mission critical things. But I suck at the day to day. I am confident I could never have managed a conventional marriage--we would have starved or bickered ourselves to death over my lack of ability to cook, clean and do laundry on a regular basis. I am the person you call on to put out a fire. And I am a good manager--I can spreadsheet with the best of them. But frankly, I need someone to manage my life: Shop for groceries, put food on the table, wash the clothes and hang them back in the closet... oh wait, I have that. Dave does all that. And someone comes and cleans the house every so often. So really all I have to manage are the finances (including the mail) and the putting-away-of-things... oh yes, and my own business. But I should be able to do these things without breaking a sweat!Anyone else experience the feast or famine cycle? I am either working full out or basking like a sloth recharging the batteries. It's never a measured pace. I envy the measured-pace people. Today, obviously, is a flat-out day as I have let too many little things slip for too many days (weeks) since finishing the book, the BMAC and the immediate post-show orders.

As the argument was in Spanish I didn't have much to add, but I did round up some 2X4's and a hammer and Wendy, my landscaper, ran off to buy big honking nails. The bat house is now up and the back yard comes together. Next, the pond. But the rest of the yard news will definitely be on Stranded in the South as I am Back To Glass today.The first order of business, picking a winner in the critique-those-stands poll. And the winner is... (I am such a dork: I cut up little pieces of paper, wrote everyone's names on them, mixed them up and then picked one) Ren! She sent a long critique in email and her favorite stand was Ocean. Now, Ren, I need to know your favorite glass colors so I can make the glass for it! Thank you to everyone who participated and gave me valuable feedback!I am happy that I can post the winner with a light heart as Andrea received her Cloudstone bowl yesterday (from the name-that-series contest), and Bridget received her seder set in time to actually use it this year! I don't know if she will--she may ahve already had other plans for tonight--but at least she has the option (unless the boys in brown broke it...). I have been dying to post pictures of it as it is a one-of-a-kind set and I love the colors (sorry for the crappy photography). Bridget was Dave's Best man at our wedding 12 years ago and we pledged to give our attendants glass made by your truly as the attendant gifts. It's been 12 years and Bridget's is the  first to be done. What can I say? I wanted to get them right.Now if I could just get the photography right. I have to figure out the right background and the right lighting to use to get the most consistent results. As it is now, the color of the glass seems to affect the color of the digital image by warming it up or cooling it down, and I am just not good enough at post-processing to fix it. Could be that my camera isn't good enough. Could be an inherent function of digital photography (which is why both my regular photographer and the photographer for the book use 35 mms and shoot slide film). Could be I am just a moron.Last news and then off to the studio: I got a check from the gallery in California whose order shipped the first of November. Where they did not do anything when I contacted them, they sat up and took notice when the Rosen Group sent them a letter saying they would not be able to attend the Buyer's Market shows anymore till they were paid up (I was not the only one they were stiffing).

When I got home from the BMAC I amused myself by looking at another artist's catalog on the web  and creating my own version in Word by dragging and dropping the images from the web straight into Word. We take that kind of functionality for granted. Ho hum. Click here, move there, don't even think about what has to be going on in the software underneath so that the two programs (Word and the web browser) can pass enough information to make a seamless hand-off. Heck, just thinking about it might make most people's eyes cross and brains hurt, but I want more.I was going to write what more I wanted, but in the middle of writing this post I took a phone call and finished with a senior moment: I have no idea where I was going with the whole need for more tech rant. Ah well, guess I better move to glass.No, I know! I want to be able to easily link a snippet of the song of the morning to its title at the beginning of the post! I have done it before, but it was a real pain, I don't remember how I did it, and I don't know how well the snippet played--I work on a Mac these days and I have to use iTunes to preview music. The soaring lifts of AK's voice on \"So Long, So Wrong\" are worth sharing. But I can't 'just do it'. So now I get on to glass and you'll have to experience Alison Krauss' voice somewhere else.One of my many hats as a single business owner/artist is to photograph my work for daily, small-scale updating (on a webpage, for a catalog, etc.). Today I futz around with lighting set-ups, backgrounds and table heights. And I may need to learn how to cut Formica. Dave bought me a nice sheet of black Formica to use as a seamless background for my work, but eight feet is too much to wrangle onto my table set-up. Maybe I need to put it back further away from the work. I am beginning to wish I worked smaller. I envy the Hulets and their obviously marvelous set-up for their teeny-tiny chocolates.

There is nothing anxiety-producing going on in life right now, and yet I am having frequent, severe anxiety attacks. It's to the point that I remark on days when I don't have one. I woke up at 5:00 am the day before yesterday practically hyperventilating from anxiety, and at noon another bout rippled through my system as I was driving to Weight Watchers. I'm getting a bit concerned about both the frequency and the severity of the attacks and am wondering if I might oughta do something about them. A friend just mused through instant messenger that they might be caused by the pollen, some weird kind of allergic reaction. Given the solid blanket of yellow covering everything here right now, that's not as far-fetched as it sounds.

I did, however, have a conversation with my publisher and all of my concerns were addressed and fears were allayed. I am now much relieved and moving on to the next project.The next project is a very annoying one that I am dragging my feet on. A couple of years ago I had a gallery go out of business. Towards the end they gave me a bad check for one month's worth of sales (it was a local gallery and I had work there on consignment). I went back to get another check and ended up pulling the rest of my work on a gut feeling. Good thing as when I went back the next week (the owner wasn't in on the previous visit) the gallery was closed forever and all the work in it was gone--some of it (like mine) there on consignment and not paid for. I never did find the gallery owner, he went to ground with practiced ease and I never got paid the $800+ he owed me for two months worth of sales. Sean Thomas of Hodge Podge, wherever you are, what comes around goes around. And you had better not come around here or we will have a go around.Now I have a gallery that ordered from me at last summer's Buyer's Market Show for delivery the first of November. I shipped on time and they were happy with the work. I gave them Net 30 terms so they should have paid me by the first of December. I have now called, written and faxed requesting payment and still... nothing. So my new project for the day is to research collection/credit reporting options for bad debtors.I mentioned the other day that I moved the pond from the back deck to the front porch. The fountain is also inside right now waiting for the painter to come and stain the deck... that's truly a story for Stranded in the South. Everyone has a contractor story. I am working up to a doozy. Anyway, one of the squirrels who is accustomed to drinking out of the pond or fountain just wandered around the deck and then came to back door, put his paws on it and glared through it accusingly at me. I'm going to tell him it's the painter's fault and sick him on him.Enough nattering. Time to cross things off the list!"},

No kidding.Rules:One entry per person.All entries must contain serious critique of the stands--both positives and negatives of each style (what you like, what you don't like, what would make it more attractive, as applicable)All entries must contain a 1-10 ranking of each stand (one is awful, 10 is stupendous)All entries must contain a comparative ranking all the stands (1 is the favorite, six is the least favorite).The glass is shown with the  stands to give an idea of the size of the pieces in relation to each other, the weight and balance of the glass with the metal, etc. I am not looking for a critique of the glass at this time. The stands are meant to go with all of my color series, but if you feel strongly about which stands go best with which glass, by all means let me know. Lastly, I took all the pictures in front of a light wood wall so the colors in the glass were a bit affected (i.e., this isn't the best photography; don't downgrade the work on it). Thanks for your input!  Japanese Wave or Chinese Dragon  Blades of Grass  Geometric Solid  Lattice  Flame and WaveCoffee is long gone, music is the clacking of the keys as I agitatedly type. Though I would like to be looking forward to new projects and challenges, I am stuck in the rut of The Book. I have shrugged off a lot of little annoyances and realigned my expectations again and again over the past year, but we have reached my line in the sand.One of the projects in the book is a birdbath. It was not shot as a birdbath but on a white tile floor with white artificial pears in it. The editor wants me to rename it as a \"Standing Server\". Not going to happen. I think a project list containing a birdbath is much more likely to be attractive to a reader than a project list with a serving bowl in it. Additionally I designed it for outdoor use and purchased a wrought iron birdbath stand for it. If they want to use the picture with the pears in it and say something like \"In the winter this lovely birdbath makes a great standing bowl indoors\", I am fine with that, but I am not renaming the project.The final project in the book is a fountain, shown above right (shot by my photographer). The little glass leaves at the top conceal the opening where the water comes out, provide a high point to the piece, and control the water flow. The shot done by the publisher has the little leaves scattered along the outer edges of the two plates. When I said it needs to be reshot I was basically told it wouldn't be. So this morning I had to go to the additional annoyance of writing my lawyer (specialty: intellectual property rights--he reviewed the initial contract) for assistance. He provided me with a a nice edit of the email I had prepared but not yet sent to my editor and included references to \"misrepresentation of the Work\" and inability \"to allow their publication in that form\". I love him. Just having someone professional to go to who can take the emotion out of a situation and reduce it to the basic facts is such a relief! He calmly, without heat, laid out my position and stands ready in the wings to pick up any actual legal conversations that might follow. Lines in the sand."},
{"title": "Not a Good Day", "date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2007", "text": "No coffee, no music. Heading to the dentist soon and getting a quick post out before I go. Two days ago I got email copies of the beauty shots (the finished project photography) for my book. I was not there for the shoot--I was not even told when it would be. I was not consulted on, well, anything. I guess this is standard in the publishing industry. I suppose it's also standard for authors to cry when they see what someone else has blithely done to a year's worth of their work. Some pieces were shot flat wrong (pieces upside down, incorrect assembly of the work, etc.) and some poorly thought out. Who hangs wind chimes inside the house? And why would you put a birdbath, again indoors, on the floor with no water in it? Two outdoor projects both shot indoors.But the big problem for me is that all the projects were shot on a white-on-white background with all white props. You might think this would emphasize the color in the glass and make the projects themselves pop. My editor thinks they're stunning and elegant. To me they just look flat, sterile and unappealing.The book on mosaics that the publisher put out a couple of years ago has such lush, vibrant photography that every time I open it I get energized and enthused. I am going to be lucky if all the people do who pick up my book is go to sleep. I might as well work in beige. Do I look like a beige person to you?!?"},

Oh it's good to back in the comfy brown recliner with a laptop in my lap and coffee by my side. It's been a few days. While I wasn't posting, I was off cleaning up the last details on the book, shipping the last orders from the BMAC which were scheduled to go out as soon after the show as possible (the rest of the orders are nicely spaced with scheduled dates between now and September), and doing general clean-off-the-slate activities. Oh yes, and I was recovering as many of my pictures as I could from the Pictures folder I inadvertently deleted last week. *sigh*But the list of things I got through is not what's important this morning. Nope. the most notable thing to come out of the last four days is that for everything I got done on the list I didn't add two more things. I didn't even add one more--my to-do list is actually shrinking! It won't last, but I'm luxuriating in it while it does.Another Creedence song just came on iTunes: \"Lookin' Out My Backdoor\". That's what I'm going to be doing. The pauciflora and the weeping cherry are in bloom back there. The redbuds, spring magnolias, bradford pears and even the dogwoods are gloriously shedding blossoms and pollen all over the city. Even my little flying dragon in the front is bursting with shy, yellow-white flowers. The camellias bow out on either side of the front steps, and soon my shady little witch hazel will cut loose in abundant yellow-orange. I love spring. It happens so early and exuberantly in the south.But back to glass. Now that the book has been put to bed, I am moving forward on another project I was considering last January and had to put on hold for the book: The Siyeh Home line. These are the clear architectural glass slumped pieces I have been playing around with for, oh, 20 years now. The name is from a friend I met with yesterday who is going to create a marketing survey for me to test the glass patterns and piece styles I should initially produce in the line. I still haven't decided whether to exclusively retail them or to do retail and wholesale, but I need to do something more than I am. I have an intern coming at the end of next month and I need to have something for her to do!As I finish up the details of Projects Past (I so love that the book is now in this category--I am just going to revel in that reality for awhile) I also look ahead to finally setting up a photography area in the studio. Dave got me some halogen work lights at Home Depot and a piece of black Formica to use as my seamless background. Now I just need some clamps and a tripod, and voila!_________________I started this post some time ago and got sidetracked ordering packing supplies (peanuts, boxes, tape, etc.) from a new vendor and putting in a claim with UPS for one of the big panels I just shipped to a client in Chicago. I was so happy with my packing of the three 16X32X1/4 inch pieces and they managed to stab completely through the box and all the packaging and chip a big piece off one of them. Those wily guys in brown; can't put anything past them! Now off to fire pieces for the new stands I am having done and a replacement for the panel to ship."},

Let's start with the bad. Last night as I went to send images of my work to the publisher for inclusion in the book, and I found I had accidentally deleted my entire library of pictures for the past year. Jessie, family, vacation and Siyeh Studio all moved to the trash and then deleted. So this morning I post from the desktop computer in the office. I wait to hear from a data recovery service I left a message for. My plate is already full as full can be today, and now I have to add a trek to the data recovery place and trying to work from the desktop. Sigh. There is no point talking about work today because it is grim, grim, grim. On to better topics.This should probably be on Stranded in the South rather than here, but it lightens my mood and improves my morale for the day. Last night lying in bed, in those boneless few seconds right before sleep carried me away, my husband said, \" So there are two muffins in an oven. The first muffin says, \"Hey, it's getting warm in here.\" The second muffin says, \"Holy shit, a talking muffin!\" \" I like to fell out of bed laughing (this is a southern phrase I am trying out since I live in the south. It's right up there with 'fixin' to'--another southernism I am working into my vocabulary). I told Dave that that was one of the funniest things I had ever heard. At which point he told me that many people don't really find this joke funny. I was frankly amazed.Admittedly Dave told the joke when I was the most wide-open and receptive. In that seconds-before-sleep time I had already let go of the day's thoughts and not yet begun to dream. I was poised. When he told the joke, because my brain wasn't cluttered with other things, I immediately transformed it into a rich, complex parody of the human condition: We all go along cocooned in our own personal realities and belief systems and are startled when faced with other people's realities which aren't our own. It wasn't just funny, it was hysterically funny to me.It's good to have a bright spot today."},

This morning nicely follows the rhythm laid out in Stranded in the South. As I quickly posted there last night I noticed how long it's been since I had anything non-work oriented to say and I still haven't rhapsodized about the Best Vacation We Have Ever Had. My excuse for slacking is best summed up by the current song on iTunes: \"I've Been Working\" covered by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band.I remember writing something a few days ago about organizing my work day so that I am doing one thing per day. For example, one day to prepare the firings for the week and putter in the studio, one day for paperwork, web work, book stuff, one day for shipping, invoicing, etc. Today won't be a day like those days.Today is about being a Renaissance woman. As Rabelais put it so eloquently, I will \"break the bone and suck out the substantive marrow of life\".Today I run to a supplier to pick up a drilled panel, I pack and ship two orders, I juggle work and personal time with delivery of large piece of furniture for the home--including rearranging the office to accommodate it. I prepare and fuse this week's orders. I write to the galleries whose orders have been delayed with apologies. I mix more personal STUFF in the day by going to the drugstore and buying a whole bunch of STUFF to use up the rest of last year's medical Flex money before we lose it forever. I write the intro for the book, do a final review of the gallery shots, choose and send pics of my own work for inclusion. I email invoices, and I call a landscaper friend to schedule her crew for a little yard clean-up and help with spring planting and a pond installation...Bill will sneer, but I have GOT to organize this mess into a schedule or I don't stand a chance in a very warm place of getting it all done! And now I am already 20 minutes late for work. Guess I'll skip the teeth and hair brushing today."},
{"title": "Blogging: Sharing or Marketing?", "date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Los Angeles skyline mug in honor of Dr. Bill who helped me thrash out a business expansion question this morning, \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" by the Allman Brothers on iTunes. Thanks to Guitar Hero 2 I own my first Allman brothers album. Next thing you know I'll be listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival...Yesterday followed the seven previous days into a jam-packed, hi-adrenaline frenzy that went until 5:15 when the last shipment went out. (\"Whipping Post\", also by the Allman Brothers, is now on iTunes. How appropriate!) Today will be a little more calm, and I hope less packed, but there will still be no sky-chair time.Far more interesting than my wacky schedule today is the topic of blogging. Yesterday I spent a bit of time over lunch reading the blog of someone else in my industry. This person is a business owner and writes about glass from that perspective. My reaction to the blog was not positive, which surprised me because I was looking forward to reading it. I felt that its tone was distastefully petty and whiny--not at all the way I wanted to think about either the writer or the company. And yet I am pretty free with my own whining here, so why did it bother me on the other blog?After a night of stewing I think I understand what my problem is: The blog in question is prominently linked to the company as much--if not more than--to the person who writes it. And there is a BIG difference between a personal blog and a company blog.Blogging today encompasses everything from virtually sharing one's life, feelings and experiences through the web to producing free, frequent, marketing materials for industry. Lots of businesses (including universities) have people officially designated to write blogs for them. These blogs are intended to more fully communicate  to the outside world the spirit of the institution and the daily experience of being there. These blogs are marketing tools.  The subjects in them are no less real, but I don't expect business blogs to be written in the same style as personal blogs are. Some of the differences I take for granted include stressing the positive and rising above petty back-stabbing--even in response to another's attack--in business blogs. I don't expect to find squabbles and dirty laundry aired in them, and it makes me uncomfortable when I do.So what about Glass Incarnate? It's a personal blog. Yes, it's about my daily, personal experiences as someone who owns a glass business, but it isn't a marketing tool for Siyeh Studio: I do link to there from here so readers can find out more about my work, but I don't link to here from my Siyeh Studio website. This blog isn't intended for my clients or suppliers. It's about me, not about my business. What's written here is not politically correct enough for a company website. There are days I need to reach out through the net with a virtual scream, but I would find it completely unprofessional to do so in a venue linked to and promoted by my business.And there are two more good reasons an institution's blog needs to be squeaky clean: Too many people forget just how public email, group bulletin boards, discussion groups and blogs are. They also ignore how much more the written word is subject to misinterpretation than is the spoken word due to the loss of the additional information carried in tone of voice and body language. Phones introduced new challenges into communication that were exacerbated by email and text messaging. Now with the public longevity of blogs and the like... It's too easy to bitch and moan when the high road would indicate saying something nice or keeping one's mouth shut. Writing something negative is an easy, ubiquitous mistake for an individual, but it is really inexcusable for a company.Now at the end of this post I find myself as guilty as the writer of the other one: I may cloak my criticism in the lofty justification of differentiation, but right now I am just as culpable of publicly criticizing someone in a written venue instead of just keeping my pen shut."},

I love the unintentional symmetry (JmcM lives in Austin.) The last seven days were the longest, hardest, most constantly stress- and adrenaline-filled of any that I can remember. Ever. But I am now caught up.I sent the final copy edits of the book through the ether to my copy editor who incorporated my changes into her version and handed the final (final! final! final!) off to the proof reader. I ship four gallery orders today and one tomorrow when the last piece comes back from being drilled. I crate and ship (if I get paid) a client's order today and ship an order to another artist who incorporates my glass into his metal work. Finally I overnight the last two projects to the publisher in final form for the beauty shots. Yesterday I met with my accountant and got all the business financial papers done and accounts (personal and business) balanced for the first time in almost a year. Yep. Another year where I made so little that we get a refund. The bad news / good news scenario.Today I would love to do nothing more than go back to bed and sleep for a couple of hours. Then I would get up, pull on something comfy and pad downstairs to the sky chair on the front porch where I would curl up and read a trashy book or two until it was time to go get Jessie from school. It's spring here in Atlanta, and it's supposed to be 74 degrees today. The yellow dogwood is blooming in my front yard. The Japanese magnolias show shy flowers peeking around bare branches, and the star magnolias wave their blowsy blossoms in the light breeze like bloomers at a sailor. It is the best time of year in the south. In another week or so the weeping cherries will be in full show and my heart will almost burst from the beauty.Now back to earth. I can neither go back to bed nor take the day off, but if I get my firing schedule for the week done, apologetic letters out to everyone for the late shipments, orders shipped and tracking numbers sent, and pieces delivered to be drilled, I *might* be able to squeeze in an hour (two?) in the sky chair late this afternoon.

It's gonna be a bumpy ride today.I wasn't planning to fire this weekend, but editing the book really put me behind and I lost two full days of kiln time that I now need to make up.

It seems hardly right to have another contest when Andrea still has not collected her prize from the last one, but my brain is fried and I have a deadline of TODAY. So here's the challenge: Each of the projects in the book has one or more tips associated with it. The tips are going into a sidebar on the project page. I just used the heading \"Tips\" for my sidebar, but the publisher wants something jazzier. They suggested \"Hot Tips\". Cindy Jenkins' book on glass bead making (same publisher) also uses the term \"hot tips\", as does Gil Reynolds in his video on kiln forming. I think not. Warm Tips (for \"warm\" or kiln-formed glass) is already used by Brad Walker on warmglass.com (not going there, no way, no how). So I need a name that is a good soundbite for the project sidebar tips. Winner gets... oh, something good before Mother's Day. I need it NOW so get thinking.It's O'Dark Thirty and I am up working on the book, again. Weren't these days supposed to be over? (Remember done, done, done!?). Editing is taking longer than I thought it would, again, and I have bumped fusing and shipping back yet another day. I am now past due on the ship dates for five orders with two more due to go out next week.It's also time to start preparing for the ACRE show in Vegas the first of May--hotel room, airline tickets, shipping plan and shipping cartons. Time is compressing again and I go blithely on committing to more and more projects and deadlines. I think it's congenital.I close with the artist photo I got from the photographer yesterday for the book jacket. Clearly my little I-don't-like-any-of-the-portraits meltdown yesterday was undeserved.

I am losing any vestiges of objectivity I might have had. In this one shining moment of clarity I truly believe they are not out to get me; I am just paranoid. I don't even have any excuse or reason for feeling like this. The answer is probably lithium, but I'm not going to go there.So far in the past 12 hours I have had little breakdowns about the edits by the senior editor to the book, the title given to book (without even running it by me), the portraits of me I had taken by a photographer for the book jacket, and my booth placement at the ACRE show. The copy editor had to hold my hand and pass Kleenex through the phone (metaphorically, of course) to get me through my upset over the edits; she and my husband both reassured me that the title is perfect (The Beginner's Guide to Kiln-formed Glass); I think I look like Ann Richards in two of the portraits--it's the neck darling--and fat in the rest, Dave thinks they are all beautiful; and I was sure the ACRE people had moved me yet further down my row since the  BMAC and Jeff was no longer next to me, and it turns out we are exactly where we were.Now at halfway through the first cup of coffee, lucidity and clarity no longer optional for the day, I take a deep breath and prepare to read the rest of the book with an OPEN MIND. Not so open that everything inside leaks out, but an open mind and some semblance of balance will go a long way to keeping me out of a straight jacket today. My greatest regret is that my husband was in an incredibly relaxed, happy mood this morning and my little neuroses just shredded it.Breathe.

And I am supposed to be slowing down a bit this year!Though I sad I am done with the book that was really wishful thinking as I still have to read the final edits from the senior editor by tomorrow... and I haven't even started yet. I am dragging my feet as already the notes from the copy editor on the changes that were made have my back up. *sigh* This afternoon I really have to grit my teeth and read the whole book again.The in-the-studio work needs to start back up today too. I have an order scheduled to ship today, and I need to fuse a load in preparation for the three orders I have scheduled to go out this week. I had better get making! And speaking of orders, yesterday at the end of the day I got my first order from the Museum of Fine Art in Boston (thankfully not due till mid-April). I Talked to their buyer at the BMAC a couple of weeks ago and gave her a recommended piece list. She was in a rush so she took it to review and finally got back to me yesterday. I love museum shops! The Art Institute in Chicago is going great guns with my work, I continue my work for the Jewish Museum of New York and am now designing for them too, and now the MFAB!Besides the above tasks, somehow I need to fold in creating a photography area so I can shoot all my work as soon as I make it. I need a picture of every size piece in every series and color for an online catalog--both for my website and for wholesalecrafts.com. I have an intern starting the first of May for two months. I wish she were starting now so I could assign photography and organization to her. But I need to have the catalogs and pictures done before May.Marketing also owns a piece of my soul in terms of where I need to put my immediate efforts. The wholesalecrafts.com website and my own website need at least a couple of dedicated weeks of design work asap. But asap after the book goes to finishing the financial papers for last year for the accountant so she can file the business taxes next week.Maybe it's time to try dedicated days for activities. I need two firing prep days per week to prepare for 5-10 firings. I could do one day for studio organization (unpacking glass, setting up the vitrigraph kiln, setting up the photography area, cleaning the shipping area and putting away the new boxes, cleaning the garage--I mean 'studio annex', etc.). One day would do for webpages. And one floating day could be for paperwork or whatever needs it. I think I'll give this schedule a shot next week."},

The book is all over but the shouting, the BMAC is done, and I live!The Saturday we left for vacation I was still frantically copy editing at the Tampa airport while waiting for the bus to take us to the ship. Then I was copy editing on the bus. Then I was copy editing on the ship and getting the wireless internet connection set-up so I could send my edits. Then I was... done.

I get to review it, but I have already been warned that I do not get to make any changes to what she has written unless she has changed the sense of the content so that it is wrong. Apparently her word is law, and the way she wants it to read goes. Whatever. I am so done with this project!

But I do not dread this task. No, this week and all the weeks stretching ahead are not over-stuffed. I have FINALLY come out On The Other Side and am settling nicely back into the work of a studio glass artist. Got some shows to plan, new work to design and price, web pages and Wholesalecrafts.com start-up to do, orders to fill from the BMAC, a mailing to put out to drum up more orders--just the regular day-to-day--and I couldn't be happier! I am also finally looking forward to the book coming out, and I FINALLY feel it will be a good one that I am proud to have my name on.

The answer would be yes, and that was last year. This is this year. It makes all the difference.  I want to wax eloquent about the circularity of time and how something that is really linear is manipulated by our brains into being perceived as something that repeats in circular measurements of years, months, weeks, days, and even 12 hours... but my creativity is subsumed under the weight of my stark panic at the list of what I must get done before 5:30 pm today.There are so many things I won't get done today: I won't get the large panels packed and shipped to Chicago, I won't get a scheduled gallery order out, I won't get the business finances to the accountant so she can file the tax papers... I'm sure there are more things on that list, but those are the highlights. Today I MUST finish the edits on the book, write the Introduction, and review the captions for the pictures written by the copyeditor.I did get the packing mostly done last night (though I don't have a swimsuit that fits or time to get one). And I had good news from the dermatologist: the smallish spot on my upper chest has a 50% chance of being a basal cell carcinoma. I'll know in a week when the results of the biopsy he did yesterday are back. How could that possibly be good news? Well it has a 0% chance of being melanoma, I don't have to cancel the vacation, and if you are going to get cancer, this is the one to get! Not much worse, really,  than a cavity in a tooth.Now I face the day already exhausted from a wretched night's sleep thanks to my own dogs, stressmares, and a neighbor's dog desperately barking until 3:00 am in protest at being left outside. 5:30 am.

Now we sit companionably in our robes in the livingroom, each with our laptops, the only light the glow from the screens. If I weren't so stressed about finishing all this editing I would bask in romantic contentment. As it is, the book is now deemed *seven* pages over (who the hell does the math on these things and why can't they get it right?!) and I am playing snip snip. Checking for stress with polarized filters? Snip. Mini-kilns for vitrigraph? Snip. How to test your new kiln for hot spots and optimal process temperatures? SNIP!When I first started this project the senior editor told me 400-500 words per page. 144 pages. She also said photos on every page. Here seems to be the rub: the 400-500 words on a page DOES NOT take into account the space needed for the photos! They know they want photos, they know how much room the photos take up, why can't they give a real count for the words WITH the photos? They gave me a little spreadsheet and asked me to plug in my word totals as I went. I did. And I plugged in photos. At my last check I was four pages under. But they insist I am seven pages over, snip, snip. I am appalled at the incompetence (they use the same spreadsheet for every book--it's not like I am the first to run into this problem) glaringly highlighted by the inaccuracy of the spreadsheet!

That's right; it's live from Joe's! Today is the last big day on the book--all the copyedits need to be blessed and sent back asap. but before I get any further, congratulations to Bina Donakowski-Jones for winning the Niche award in the fused glass category for her stunning fused glass book. I am sorry I couldn't find a better picture of this piece to link to as it is really gorgeous. I am very happy to report that politics did not win out, and, truly, the best piece won.The drive back was uneventful, the Holiday Inn in downtown Philadelphia was uniformly horrible. I cannot find one single redeeming thing to say about it or the Benson's (Benton's?) restaurant in it. No, that's not quite true. There were one or two staff members who seemed to genuinely care about our room and service difficulties, but there was not a single person who knew what the hell was going on there or could do anything about it. By the third day of six there were Harry and David truffles, a bottle of chardonnay and two bottles of Starbuck's frappucino in our room compliments of the management--along with a very nice handwritten note expressing wishes that the rest of our stay be pleasant and uneventful. Lol. The frustrations and difficulties still did not end. There was not a day when we didn't have to deal with some annoyance--from no hot water in the shower (ever) while having scalding (literally) water in the sink, to dry, grey, overcooked steak in the restaurant, to lost packages, no internet and invisible managers. When I actually wanted to talk to the general manager before leaving she couldn't even be bothered to come out and face me. I got the restaurant manager. I pinned his ears back, but it really wasn't enough. I will review the hotel and my Priceline experience and I will *never* do Priceline in Philadelphia again and risk staying there.A review at the end of the show gives it a solid 6 of 10. Sales were down 30% from last year, I believe mostly due to not seeing most of my customers from last year--including the ones I expected to see. Exposition services had more than their fair share of problems, but everyone I dealt with was friendly, helpful and could actually solve (most of) my problems.Biggest issues for me were loss of electricity, booth space issues with neighbors, and load-out. A bunch of us lost electricity Friday night and it was still out Saturday morning for the first hour and a half of the show. There was no identifiable reason for it--everyone was using their allotted amount of power, but the cables were poorly laid out in the booths and not marked as to who should use what so it is possible that someone was on a 1000 watt service line instead of the 2000 watt line they paid for and it caused the transformer to overheat and blow. Whatever. Better labeling and lay-out would have prevented the problem, but Hargrove (exposition services) was quick to respond and fix it (I think it is fear of Wendy that makes them move so fast and I don't blame them).People are asked to keep their stuff out of the aisles during set-up so that everyone can get their stuff in. Lol. You can barely walk down some aisles for days--much less get a dolly down them. Clearly the rules don't apply to everyone. All the set-up woes in our section can be laid at the door of the guy behind me who set up his immovable hard-walled booth before everyone else arrived and didn't even bother to check to make sure he was fully inside his space and not interfering with anyone else's eventual set-up. Some people just never learned to color in the lines. He put his back wall on the corner of my rented carpet so that the corner was folded and the whole rug was bunched. He moved the pipes of the pipe and drape wall system so his booth would fit right, and made everyone else's walls cock-eyed. But he has been doing the show forever and he just does what he has to do so his show goes well.Participation in the set-up and breakdown of an art show--either wholesale or retail--should be required for the leader of every communist country in the world. They are perfect examples of why communism fails. Artists--the free souls, gentle spirits, last hippies in our society--show at the core how people do not work together for the betterment of all. And yet they are individually, one-on-one, extremely nice people!At the end of the show a bunch of exhibitors were told they could load out using the underground loading area and the freight elevators. These were the same two freight elevators that exposition services had to use to load up all the people who paid to be loaded. I waited 20 minutes for my stuff just to get on the freight elevator to get down to my van. Was that fair? What is it with people?We are almost all in a hurry, but some people think they are just entitled to take whatever they want, cut line, and screw everyone else. This is another sad, common characteristic of this show. Most of the people who have been doing it have been doing it so long they know how to \"get around\" the system, ruthlessly cutting off and delaying everyone else.  Some of it was just selfish human behavior, but some of it was a defense mechanism against a bad system. What bothers me is that after 25 years of having the show there is still such a strong need for a way around the system (continuing the show through Monday? Come on! What a waste of time!!!).I am seriously tempted to research flying and shipping. The big downsides with them are weather delays, breakage and lost freight. but I am going to have to do it for the ACRE show in Vegas in May anyway.Now it's over for another year (the summer BMAC is smaller and easier in so many ways), and it's time to move with the day and the book."},

It is Day 3 of the Buyer's Market of American Craft. Yesterday and Friday were both slow for me--not great news, but not unusual for for me for this show. I was confident that today would bring the orders streaming in. The day is now half over and I have had one order from an existing client and nothing new... Hmmm. Should I be worried? On the other hand the Jewish Museum of New York has asked me to design some menorah for them to carry. And I had a gallery owner from Orange County who might want me to do sugar and creamer boxes (no lids) and a vase (essentially a tall box with no lid) in Pop Art. These projects both have the prospect of being fun, if not necessarily lucrative.This show brings out my tendencies towards reflection and contemplation. I think all the should-I, would-I, could-I thoughts. I am simultaneously humbled and validated by the art around me, and appalled at the callousness of some of the other artists. Clearly their grandmothers were not like my grandmother and the whole \"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\" edict just passed them right by. I can honestly say that I can find something good to say about everyone's boothes or work. maybe not both, but all I need is one nice comment and I'm done. It might be damning with faint praise, but at least I am not slashing bloody strips and leaving viscera to dry on the floor. Why bother with the viscera exposure? There is no need to state the obvious and it is much more rewarding for everyone if you make the effort to find the kernel of good. I wonder about the ego of the of the person able to so cruelly dismiss another's efforts. And I am forced to wonder what they are saying about me behind my back. And I dread the release of the book (and my exposure to the cruel world) , and I stall on the copy-editing review.Part of the problem with the book right now (post copy-editing) is that the edits are so damn perky! No, this *isn't* my voice anymore. It is not darkly sarcastic enough--and as I just got through saying that I don't really see myself as predominantly darkly sarcastic, that's saying a lot! I asked my editor today about the edits she made and did she try to give the projects all the same detail and feel. She said no, she mostly put them in the style of the publisher. Oh dear. I delay reading them again.And tonight are the Niche awards. Part of me says, \"I'll never win. It may be my best piece ever and it may hold up well to all the other pieces in my category for artistic merit and technical excellence... but I'll never win.\" That's the part of me which does not believe that the prizes will be given for merit alone and that there will *always* be additional factors which determine the actual outcome. Which is not to say I think  my piece is the best and I should win. Really. I want to, but that's a different story. Maybe it's just a human failing that looks for easy (and not my fault) reasons for why I didn't win. So I'm a bit petty and not perfect. I can live with that.After the awards I will be joining friends at Morimoto for dinner. The reservation is for 7:30 and  that's when they are all going. I will be at the awards alone, grumbling that I could have been  celebrating life with friends  instead of having my hopes dashed again.I know! I'll think of it as celebrating the achievements of the people who do win! I told you I could always find something good to say...."},

It's the end of Day One of the Buyer's Market of American Craft. I am cranky. We are staying at the Holiday Inn downtown and so far the hotel has been a complete disaster. Let me explain... no, that would take too long. Let me sum up. Smoking king changed to smelly smoking double. Next morning schlepped luggage down to desk so could move to non-smoking double (it should have been moved for us). That night: 9:00 pm, schlepped luggage up to new room after setting up all day at the convention center, no room service, restaurant closed, no internet in new room, 45 minutes on the phone with tech support. Next morning: moved to a new room. Intermittent internet. FedEx package for Teresa delivered to hotel Wednesday morning at 9:30 am, it still hasn't been found or delivered to her._______________________Now it's the next morning (Saturday). I slept long and have woken less crabby... I hope.  The show started yesterday with a bang and I was behind until almost noon (it started at 10:00) when I finally had pricetags up on everything. I thought I would have a little lull at the beginning as buyers tend to start on the sides--of the hall or of the type of work they are interested in--and work in. Duh, I am on the second aisle in, which pretty much counts as on the side, so I got hit right away. Oh, and fun news! As I was setting up, another glass artist I had not previously met came into my booth to tell me how much she and her sister like reading Glass Incarnate every day. Her name is Patty Hulet and she and her sister make the most edible glass you have ever seen. I am going to see if I can get some of them for Dave for Valentine's Day (we are celebrating next week).I had a good show yesterday: Four orders including two from new galleries (and a new state! Connecticut!). That makes six orders so far with the two that I got the week before the show. And people like the boxes, but no one is even close to interested in carrying them where I have them priced. I really may need to offer them retail instead of wholesale.In addition to doing the show I have a deadline of a week from today to finish reviewing and editing my seriously copyedited manuscript. Gulp. But I'm set up now and can cruise on autopilot through Monday when it's time to break down and head home. I should be able to squeeze in editing projects at least.I read back through what I have written and it's a long, disjointed, caffeine-free post. That's a problem I need to fix.

We are arrived in Philadelphia. The sweetgum tree to the right shows it's icy adornment--taken at a freezing rest stop in Virginia where the main building was closed and they had porta-potties set up for the desperate travelers. I don't THINK so.I held it till some godforsaken dumpy little town in  Delaware (Teresa tells me it was Havre de Grace) where the rednecks sat with their butt cracks hanging out of their pants, filling the tanks of their snow plow pick-ups and continuing to block all access to the pumps for the rest of us while they chawed and spat and prepared to to go plow something. I finally asked one of them if he would mind moving as my bladder could not take any more waiting... only to find out that the 7-11 store/gas station didn't have a restroom. We tore out of there to the Shell station across the street... which also didn't have a restroom. What is it with people in Delaware? Don't any of them ever have to pee?! We had to go across the street in another direction to McDonald's--and I was lucky I made it. And every stop required dashing through the salty, wet, cold slush. My poor EnzoAngiolinis.There is much wet slushy snow everywhere. I wore my flimsy little Italian leather shoes (the afore-mentioned Enzos)... with no socks. I have a couple of pair of boots with me, it's true. They are also nice, thin, leather, and meant  for dry, happy times. The hotel is nine blocks from the Convention Center--a good walk for a Weight Watcher... but not one with inappropriate footwear.On the bright side--and I try to always find the bright side--even though I was not scheduled to unload today I went to the docks at the convention center anyway to see if they could squeeze me in. Turned out there was no wait at all and I had all my stuff in my booth in the time it took to get an assistant badge for Teresa. By the way, check out her work. Cool, huh? Tonight we are in a smoking (blech) double (it was almost a smoking king!) at the Holiday Inn downtown Philly, and have consumed a pizza and almost-copious-enough quantities of red wine for me. I am slogging through my review of the edits of the materials and tools sections of my book and preparing for a long day tomorrow setting up in the freezing (no exaggeration there) convention center hall. They won't bother with the heat till the Buyers show up late in the afternoon for the jewelry preview. Brrr.Okay, enough already. I'm here, I'm safe, I'm in a smoking room (did I say blech?), but I'll live. There is supposedly network access from the convention center floor this year so I will stay live. Till tomorrow."},

I feel it roiling from one side of my face to the other, then descending to my arms and squeezing. I cold-worked a new box until 11:00 last night and got up at 6:30 this morning to do the final polish and I just. can't. get. it. I am letting everything else hang in my quest for the perfect box. I have been consumed by this obsession and even the approaching of the goal state does nothing to lessen my tension and stress.Teresa will be here in the next hour ready to go to Philly. She is another artist I know from the One of a Kind Show who lives in Louisville, KY, works in stone (mostly alabaster) and has been considering doing the BMAC herself. I offered her the chance to go to the show for the cost of her meals if she would be my assistant for it. It's a good deal for both of us. And I am about to blow *everything* with this box. I should have left it at a fine matte finish instead of going for the high gloss. Now I am halfway to high gloss--the holy grail of cold-workers--and I realize I am not sure how to get the rest of the way. Other, more sage, kiln-formers tell me it just takes time. But I don't have TIME and I want it done NOW. Now, before it breaks from the heat of the polishing. Now before it flies off the wheel and smashes into a dozen pieces in the sink. Now so I can can get on with all the other things I have to do before going to Philly. Just NOW!!!Got to pack the clothes, got to make the show list of everything I need to take, got to pack the car, got to write notes for Dave of things to take care of while I am gone, got to breathe, got to not cry.... Just want to go back to bed. Maybe plan a pond or perennial beds or...Yesterday all the orders that could be shipped were. I edited most of the first 50 pages of my book and it has come together nicely. All the firings for the BMAC are done (including lids for the boxes which went in last night at 10:00, which are still 500 degrees, and which also need to be ground and polished before leaving for the show).The anxiety rises, the anxiety falls."},
{"title": "I Am the Phoenix", "date": "Monday, February 12, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, no music. For sheer carnage, yesterday was the worst day I have ever had in the studio. I am ostensibly scheduled to leave for the Buyer's Market (BMAC) show in Philadelphia tomorrow. I may not get out till Wednesday morning and then face a hellish long drive and  impossibly quick set-up. But why worry about tomorrow's hell when I can dwell on yesterday's!On the schedule for yesterday: put in the main slump load in the big kiln, slump two more new-style bowls in the small kiln, and take the boxes out of the medium kiln. That should have taken about 1/2 hour total for the day, bright and early in the morning. The rest of the day was devoted to reviewing the edits of the first 50 pages of the book (the Basics). Simple, easy Sunday. Snort.I opened the small kiln to find the violet Cloudstone bowl--the only example of violet Cloudstone I have for the BMAC--thermal shocked, cracked in two and fused drunkenly together again during the slump. I don't panic. I shrug philosophically and get out my firing schedule to see what I can tweak. I should never have put it in the kiln while the kiln was still hot from the piece I had just taken out. These things will happen. I decide to squeeze in another Cloudstone piece in the medium kiln and move the slump of the Seder set to the big kiln in with the BAC pieces and pieces of orders I need to ship. The schedule is a bit higher and longer than a normal slump, but maybe I can adjust the piece heights so that nothing will be ruined. I really need violet Cloudstone.So I take the boxes out of the medium kiln to prepare it for the Cloudstone. They are cool and they look *perfect*. I have apparently solved all technical issues with boxes. I start to prepare the Cloudstone firing, but I can't resist polishing the violet orchid box a little first. It is soooo perfect! I do the bottom and half of one side. I cannot help but marvel at the sheer beauty of the piece. I will triumph at the BMAC with these boxes. I will sneer at anyone who questions their price. The box catches a bit on the lap grinder wheel and flies out of my hands to smash into three pieces in the adjacent sink. I run sobbing to my spouse. That's two.Now I have a dilemma. I need a mass of Cloudstone for the show because it's what I featured in the postcard I sent out, but I also need perfect boxes because I am up for a NICHE award  for a box and the awards are given at the BMAC as part of the show. I pick up the other box that jsut came out of the medium kiln, the orange/yellow/green orchid box... and the bottom has begun to crack from a compatibility shift of one of the primary colors during the original melt. This is the same glass that cracked in half during the bubble fix firing a few days ago so it's not like I didn't already know it was a troubled piece. I now have no violet Cloudstone, no perfect boxes, and almost no time left. That's three. I have another breakdown. The BMAC is *the* big roll-out show for new collections and new products. It is where you either show buyer's that you are a dynamic, creative artist, or a tired, same-old, same-old taker-up-of-booth-space.And then I rise from the ashes. Sure it's the most important show I do a year, but it's just a show. I will salvage it as best I can and move on. It takes until 5:30 pm (so much for the little half hour in the studio in the morning), but I get a bowl slumping in the little kiln, another glorious violet box firing in the medium kiln, and the Seder set, the rest of the BMAC pieces and my outstanding orders slumping in the big kiln. Also in the big kiln are three pieces of violet Cloudstone that I cut the thermal-shocked bowl into with my tile saw. I am slumping them flat to use them as samples of that color at the show.I finished the night by validating the slump in the big kiln (I did need to up the temp and time a bit more because of the Seder set), putting the fiber blanket over the new box at the appropriate point in its firing, and putting another bowl to slump in the small kiln. I also polished the the orange/yellow/green orchid box down to just before the final cerium-oxide-on felt polish. As it turns out, only the new glass I added in the box construction firing on the bottom of the box cracked and it didn't crack through the box. The piece is not salable,  but it is showable as a to-the-naked-eye perfect box. I was then going to read the 50 pages of my book, but my spouse talked me out of it and I collapsed exhausted into my eyelids.This morning I rose, I stretched, and I vowed to conquer and take no prisoners. Che sera sera. It is now 9:00 and I am ready to review the copyeditor's version of my book. There is a lot more on the plate, but I am not going to stress myself out by listing it again. Tomorrow, maybe, the road to Philadelphia."},

That was a difficult commission the first time (details are in the posts from 3/10/06-3/15/06 for the curious kiln former). Got to find that mold, dust it off and whump one up... after I remember what size I made the large plate in the Seder set.... This year instead of using the adjustable mold I made last year, I will go ahead and make one that's the right size so I'll always know how big to make them.The title for this post? A CNN.com news clip this morning reported on complaints to a theater in Florida soon to feature the play the Vagina Monologues. The name of the play was changed on the marquee to the above when a passing motorist, offended at having to explain what a vagina is to her niece, called the theater in outrage. Hoohaa. There were so many opportunities there for some good female-empowering conversation, and all she could think of was embarrassment and smut. I can't wait till Jessie asks me that question. Back to glass (not to be mixed with hoohaas).It took forever yesterday to get two kiln loads in. I just dragged my feet all day about firing. Part of it is that I am nervous about the big hanging panels I am doing from an email commission for a client in Chicago having never seen the space. I have the nagging feeling they are not going to be the right size (the client gave me the dimensions of the opening and asked me to figure out the clearance for the panels) and I am already stressing about shipping them. Or maybe I'm just a lazy whiner. Anyway I won't be able to open either kiln till later this afternoon and J has gymnastics at 4:00 so it looks like I am going to stay behind schedule with late-in-the-day firings for the rest of the week (the rest of the week for me this week is through Monday).I think I used my allotment for philosophical creativeness on Uma (1 and 2) in Stranded in the South earlier in the week so I am just going to go off and finish entering tax data into Quickbooks.

It is also worth noting that you find out some very surprising things when you are paying attention to what you put into your mouth. For instance (I only learned this after the fact) a Caribou Coffee large mocha has exactly half my allowed daily food allowance in it! For you Weight Watchers out there that is 14.5 points--more than either a Big Mac or a large fries at McDonald's. And it's not the whipped cream--whipped cream is essentially free. You would have to eat 3-3/4 cups of whipped cream to get that many points.The moral of the story? I walk to Jupiter coffee for a plain jane coffee with a splash of cream.

Its comfortable weight lives in the back right pocket of my jeans and it literally saves my butt several times a week. Yesterday, for example, I was writing the last of the project re-writes and reviewing the last projects for my copy editor. I needed to know the amounts of each glass I used in the cranberry stone oval melt. I whipped out my Moleskine and looked it up. Then I needed to know the last tweaks I made to the firing schedule I used to fuse the lace to the single-thickness wall sconce. My hand went to my back pocket and produced the Moleskine with a flourish. Prior to Christmas I used whatever notebook or random scrap of paper was at hand to write whatever important credit card, phone number, firing schedule, mileage I needed to track. Now, as long as I wear jeans (whatever am I going to do when spring comes and I move back to my pocketless capri's?), I have the MOLESKINE (and a pen in my right front pocket. A known recipe for disaster, but greatness has its price).Coffee is now in the Los Angeles mug in honor of Jodi (and Eric). Congratulations!

I am writing all this without actually looking anything up because I want to the pass on the news as I got it... from Dave. Dave doesn't even know Jodi and Eric virtually so you can imagine my surprise when he slid into bed last night saying casually \"Your friend Jodi won the bake-off with her spaceship\". I was asleep at the time so the little gnome trudging from my ear to my brain might have garbled the message a bit. I groggily asked him (Dave, not the gnome) how he knew and he said \"The Internet is a mysterious and powerful device whose mystery is only exceeded by its power. It was on Boing-Boing.\" Hoo ha! I (sort of) know someone  famous! (Fame = being mentioned in a blog Dave actually reads, unlike mine.)Now back to glass. I think I am going to skip reading the first big set of edits the copy editor sent me yesterday. She rearranged the Basics and condensed them into two sections. I am reluctant to read them in case my worst fears (brought on by her admonition \"When you read them make sure there is enough of your own voice left.\") are realized. Instead I am going to fire today. And to invent! I need a guide for my lapgrinder which will enable me to make regular, even, true 45 degree mitered corners on the boxes. I am going to dust off the compound miter saw in the studio extension (aka the garage) and go to it. I am inspired by Smasty and her very clever chalkboard towel hangars in their lake house guest bath. Time to dust off my own power tools.I realized last night that I have to make a choice for the BMAC next week. I can either have a lot of Cloudstone or I can have four new boxes. Since I am sending out the postcard (today) with the Cloudstone on it I should probably have several more colors and styles to show and be ready to market them heavily. On the other hand, I am up for a NICHE for a box so it would be nice to have more of them. But realistically I haven't even figured out how to price them yet so maybe I am not ready to splash out several more. Or maybe I could figure out the pricing in the course of making (or failing to make) four more.

I think they're wrong: I think there IS a mountain high enough, and it's called Monday. No, wait, it's called THIS WEEK. At least the studio is back ship shape again. Carol cracked the whip over me till everything was back in its place Friday and I was in production again.Elsewhere in my little glass world... The book is now only 4 pages over the length limit--after the overview was cut... and I am really peeved about it. The editor went out of her way to tell me how many pages, how many words per page, how many photos, yada, yada, ya. I followed the guidelines, and whoops! Somehow I am miraculously almost 10 pages over. I think they need a better page count estimate spreadsheet. So I have some major cutting to do this week and I have no idea what or where. I have a strong feeling this is going to hurt. This morning I still need to wrap up the project re-writes and send them to my other editor... and one of them is *very* long. Of course it is the wall sconce that the main editor threw in on Dec. 5 so I don't feel too badly about that, but I know she is going to insist something else be cut. Something I think should be in. Something like the explanation of compatibility of glasses or coefficient of expansion and viscosity. Something actually important beyond the barest of hobbiest levels. Something... hard and dry and boring to the unscientific (like me), but very important nonetheless.Got another commission yesterday, the last one I was waiting on from the One of a Kind Show. That brings this week's fusing obligations up to three 34\" X 15\" hanging panels, three 3.5\" X 8\" sushi plates, two Cloudstone bowls, and a 20\" round display panel for a wrought iron stand. Oh yes, and all the pieces I need for the BMAC next week that aren't done yet. That aren't even identified yet. Need to identify and schedule them today to so I can squeeze them with the rest.And speaking of firing, I have some Cloudstone and orchid melt pieces that I finished over the weekend and want to turn into boxes. I think I might try four at a time in the medium kiln. Could be spectacular, could be disaster. Could be spectacular disaster, but let's stay optimistic, shall we? Oh yes, and one more necklace project redo for the book to squeeze in somewhere. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.Other than that it will be a light week (snort): Mailing list to update for postcards, postcards to mail, photos for ad in the wholesalecrafts.com buyer's guide to clean and upload, the samples to finish and ship to the Art Institute in Chicago so they can evaluate them for inclusion in the 2007 fall/winter catalogs, and the fine detail of the studio finances for 2006 to enter into the computer and get to the accountant (it took three days to do the broad brushstrokes part...). I had the papers all sorted, organized and stacked neatly, and now they are covered by another three week's worth of paper and detritus. It'll take a dedicated archaeological expedition just o uncover them. Where is  Dr. Mike Adler when you need him? (I like this photo better. Looks more like he did when we were egging cars when we were in high school in Montana...).But back to the mountain... She is high enough, and she is now. (Hey Mike, remember this photo? The first view of the Mission Mountains over the top Ravalli hill and around the big curve?)"},

They just have a little photo-shopping to do: They are going to remove the worst of the \"injuries\" from my fingers. Yes, children, kiln-forming glass can be dangerous, but we don't want to show you just how dangerous in our pretty little how-to book.

This morning I have to finish the rest and then go straighten the house prior to the arrival of the in-laws. My postcard is on schedule and due to arrive Friday, now I just need to get the mailing list together and the mailing labels made. I only had 500 postcards run off this time. I get the super-size ones (if I can't super-size my food anymore, at least I can super-size my postcards!) and they take a regular 39 cent stamp to mail. Going to keep the mailing list tight and meaningful instead of using a scattershot approach this time.Oh and I have to call Carol (my apprentice) and tell her I won't be in the studio Friday!!! I am an idiot. My schedule has been so helter-skelter that first I told her no, and she dutifully write it in her PalmPilot. Then when she double-checked the following week I said yes, and she dutifully erased it in her PalmPilot. Now I have to tell her no again. She is going to think I am a complete flake--and I'm not, really!It is five to nine and dark as a mountain cave outside. Wet and cold too. Dave said two of the native Atlantans on his team have already written to say they will be working from home today because they are afraid of the drive in. Sure, the forecast called for freezing rain and ice, but it's just rain, people! Southern wimps. We northerners, we know how to drive in the winter. Heck, for proof, just check out the story on the news van that fell through the ice in Wisconsin.Hmm. That's two links to weird news this morning. I don't seem to be in the mood to either clean or edit, and yet, that's my day... Maybe I'll make something too. That always perks me up. I know! Andrea's Cloudstone piece. Too bad the people for whom that color was specially blended never got back to me about their sinks. Come to think of it, they still owe me money for their dinnerware. As does a gallery in California. The gallery is 60 days past due at this point and I am beginning to get angry. Having to pursue people for payment is one of the worst jobs of  the small business owner. I could follow some of my colleagues lead and say payment before shipping. Period. No more Net 30, but I don't get quite enough abuses to feel comfortable with that approach.One last off-glass-topic and I go work. See \"Pan's Labyrinth\". And be prepared for a really justified R-rating. There was one scene I just. could. not. watch. Even Dave only watched about half of it. Knife meets flesh. They disagree. Knife wins. Flesh must be... repaired. Ugh.(One last news item: Naked Harry Potter. Nice abs Harry!)"},

Instead of trying to do a bit of everything everyday, for the past couple of weeks I have been trying to do one thing in a set amount of time and then move on to the next thing when the allotted time is over. So far it's working pretty good (no major hysterical breakdowns yet). Today; book. Tomorrow; studio restoration and firing. Friday through Sunday; in-laws. Monday; firing. Tuesday; finances.

Instead I fought with (and am still fighting with) the format on the postcard all day to get it just right for the online printing company (modernpostcard.com). And I was crabby with the J. *sigh* Bad Mommy.I decided not to go with my local firm this year as I am (again) on a tight deadline and they had so many problems last year.

{"title": "The Photoshoot is Over!", "date": "Monday, January 29, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the Alaska skyline mug and \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones on iTunes. It is 19 degrees F here right now and with the wind chill it feels like 7 degrees! I had to break a thick layer of ice off the pond and the hose with the sprayer on it is probably a goner. Oh children, it's cold here today! Fortunately for me I am not leaving the house as I have a sick child home from school.And now the wrap-up on the photoshoot. (\"The Long and Winding Road\" by the Beatles serenades this part of the narrative... how appropriate.) Wednesday my assistant arrived at 7:15 am. I forgot she was coming that early and overslept. She drove up to a dark house and Dave shook me awake to answer the doorbell tousled and in my jammies. I made coffee, pulled myself together, and hit the ground running hard. My contribution to the organization of the process was spreadsheets. Lots and lots of spreadsheets detailing the shots, their order, etc. Every morning I updated the list, and every morning in my exhaustion I accidentally omitted something. *Sigh*We took a break on Wednesday so John, Megan and Carol could cast their own little paperweights in the kiln with the dragonfly I had to do for the book. John did the starfish, Megan the fish, and Carol (my assistant) did the lizard. The studio was filled with a hodge podge of their equipment and mine and we just all worked around it. I think the studio is the perfect size for one person and glass stuff only. John, the photographer, is 6'4\" so he kind of fills up a lot of space all on his own. Then add his assistant Megan and Carol to the mix... We were lucky not to constantly trip all over each other.There were only a few insurmountable snafus, and of course Jessie's accident, which put us off schedule. To save me, I couldn't find the circular level for the kiln-forming tools shot (one of the most important tools for a beginner), I couldn't find one of the cast dragonflies to send back for the beauty shots which will be taken at the publisher in March, and the necklace fell apart during cleaning. Note to self: you cannot tack-fuse to the irid side of glass. Duh. So I have to remake the necklace for the second time and mail it to the publisher along with the lost dragonfly after I find it.By Friday morning we were over the hump and I was too complacent. I scheduled all the tough how-to's requiring a lot of set-up for Wednesday and Thursday leaving only two how-to's and the tools and materials shots for Friday. We should have been fine. But then the photography team also got complacent and was a half hour later arriving than the previous mornings. And I did not work Thursday night in the studio doing all the prep for Friday. I figured Carol was coming so we could whip it out in no time. And I just couldn't face another night in the studio after Wednesday. So when the phone rang at 9:30 am as John and Megan were getting set for the day and Carol and I were cutting and organizing, I was unprepared to have to drop everything and run to J's school to get her after her little \"accident\".An hour and a half later we were back to work, but that was time we couldn't afford to lose. Even with a detailed shot list they hadn't been able to make much headway without me as they had had to find and assemble all the tools for the tool shots. We worked our butts off and I saw them all safely off with bottles of champagne at 7:00 pm. Now I wait for the results. John shot slide film which I did not expect. With digital you can do the equivalent of viewing the dailies to see what turned out and what didn't. With slides, you don't know if you need to reshoot something till it's too late. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best. John shoots a lot of books for my publisher so I just have to trust that his experience will make everything turn out fine.As a side note, I can tell that John is accustomed to dealing with females (he lives with his wife and three daughters). At the end of day three I was exhausted. Beyond exhausted. I was wearing the same shirt I had worn the day before (for continuity in the shots of the bottom of the sleeves in the how-to photos) and it was stained from studio work and lunch. I had no make-up on, I still had the tear stains from the morning's fear over J's accident on my face, and did I mention I was exhausted? And in spite of all that, John managed to get me to pose for a picture--ostensibly for the artist portrait on the book jacket! I didn't even want to let him take it, but there is no way in... any really hot place I am going to let them use it!Today J is home still sick. I am going to write the remaining projects, clean up the old ones, and design and order my postcard for the BMAC. I am not even going to go down in the studio--which looks like a bomb went off in it (and after I did all that cleaning, straightening and organizing!).I'll watch Princess Mononoke with the J, read her some stories, play Chutes and Ladders, and cuddle on the couch. Did I mention it's cold out there today? Tomorrow the latest pics from my photographer of the new Cloudstone pieces and the Pop Art box. Pics shown here: The creation of the cast pieces, John and Megan with their finished pieces, a few shots from the shoot (the ones I wasn't in), and the bordel of the studio in the aftermath."},

Finishing he post I wrote last night by adding the photos.I know tomorrow is going to be insanely busy getting ready for the photoshoot and it's going to be tough to find time to post. So I am getting a jump on it by doing it tonight before I go to bed. First the kudo of the day: the Rosen Group has started a new blog called Wholesale Matters. I noticed someone came to Glass Incarnate from there a couple of days ago and I thought I would see how they were referred. Turns out, there's a big ole link here on the top left of their page under Blogs We Read! Sparked me to update Glass Incarnate with a section of links to useful art/craft and business sites. Enjoy!Now for the conundrum. I have to put my order for my booth into the exposition services for the Buyer's Market by Wednesday in order to get the early submission discount. I have always had drapery walls for that show and used large format photography as my big wall-art pieces. However, I was so pleased with my hardwall display with all the hanging panels at the One of a Kind Show that I am tempted to replicate it somewhat for this show. I say \"somewhat\" because  I have a three-walled 10 X 15 booth for the BMAC instead of the single-walled 10 X 20 I had at the OKSS. And the BMAC only provides two walls in their hardwall set-up. I won't be hanging anything on the side walls anyway (the display pedestals and the work that goes in front of them are too tall). So here are my three choices:1) I could get the two walls and hang drapery on both sides for symmetry--in front of the hard sidewall on one side (the hard side wall is needed for stability). Then I would use the hard wall in the back to hang panels like at the OKSS. This option will cost $1,000, and this is rental only--I wouldn't own the display at the end of the show.2) I could get three hard walls and pay for the third wall--probably $300 or so more than option 1.3) I could use my current drapery set-up and hang one panel from the free-standing display I made from pvc for last year. This wouldn't cost anything.This is the biggest wholesale show I do a year and presence is everything. But is there enough difference in presence to justify the cost? Please vote early and often and let me know what you think, Thanks. The photos shown are 1) the actual configuration of the three-waal booth but shown with foamcore walls (no longer an option), 2) the drapery walls but in the corner summer booth, 3 and 4) the OKSS booth left and right sides."},

I love the weekend. In addition to getting ready for the photo shoot next week I am also preparing work to have it shot by another photographer for marketing uses (postcard, web, wholesalecrafts.com, etc.). I hoped to have several new cloudstone pieces ready and I am being DENIED.Part of the problem is that I am experimenting at the same time I am trying to produce. Friday I tried firing on a sheet of stainless steel on my shelf. Glass sticks badly to metal if it is not prepped so I sandblasted the steel, heated it in the kiln and applied a lot of kiln wash to it. Applying the kiln wash was a pain. the metal was initially too hot and the water in the kiln wash vaporized off and didn't seem to leave much of a residue behind. I started using the spray gun and airbrushing it on, but I went through propellant like corn through a force-fed duck. So I tried brushing it on, and I thought I had applied enough. Well, maybe I had applied enough, but much of it had run off the edge of the shelf or gone who knows where because the glass stuck to the metal in the firing. It wasn't stuck when I opened the kiln at the end, but it was sheared and shattered. Impressive.Now it's Monday:Coffee in the Washington D.C. mug (forever Barbara), \"Thunder Road\" by Bruce Springsteen on iTunes. Today is soooo packed! I have left filing the annual sales tax report with the states of Illinois and Georgia until today--the final due date for Illinois. I have a commission to re-do (she needs teh darker color more in the middle of the piece to cover her wall outlets...) and 12 pieces to ship to the Art Institute. I must cut and fuse a full load of interim-stage projects and then cut some more. Hargrove, the exhibition services company for the Buyer's Market, has a Wednesday deadline for ordering booth services (electricity, display, carpeting, etc.) and I am thinking of changing my display AGAIN. (Hard walls, like I had in Chicago. They worked well.) Tomorrow is my appointment with my local photographer for shooting my work... Ack! Ack! Ack!This is the week of the penultimate big push on the book. All the photography will be done, all the project re-dos will be done and re-written. (Speaking of which, the wall sconce has turned out surprisingly well!) All that will be left for me is writing the intro and acknowledgements and the copyediting. Of course I decided yesterday to redo a project not scheduled for re-do because I didn't have anything in PURPLE, and to use the red, yellow and green Cloudstone for the screen project instead of the soft apricot and cranberry. I know my editor is going to be apoplectic, but I am not writing a book by committee. They are my projects and I will decide what works best for my book. Period. Clearly I am still frosted by being told (twice!) what the review committee wants me to make and what's not acceptable (I can't find the reference right now, but I was told way back in the beginning that \"barrettes\" are so, not cool, and they don't want a barrette project in the book).So now to work.

Instead they are going to taunt me with automatically generated messages telling me what they aren't sending me because my mailbox is full. My mailbox is not full. It is exactly HALF full. I guess Bellsouth has a different interpretation of the mailbox is half full or half empty and I am being DENIED! And I am on the phone with tech support. Again. And I finally get the news that even though I am allowed 250 mg of mail in my mailbox, I am only allowed 200 messages in my inbox... What kind of idiocy is that?Now I have coffee in the Montreal mug, and I decided I needed to expand my collection so I am bidding on four more mugs on eBay. Nothing like a little shopping to reset my mood. \"Turn the Page\" by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band on iTunes. I think I will, and I move on to The Apprentice! I am not sure how much she wants her information bandied about the internet so I will just say that she is a mature (like me ;-) professional woman with her own business. She has taken classes in kiln forming for a number of years and she even has two kilns! She makes far more money in her profession than I could even count so she is not doing this for the money.She wants to learn, and I think she is in a place in life where she is ready for a transition. I am thrilled out of my socks. She is leaving her assistant to manage her business one day a week while she hangs out here. Do I have a fairy godmother somewhere? Did someone wave a wand and say \"Here you go! You deserve the brass ring!\". I don't know. But I have list of things for her to do as long as the Loch Ness Monster's tail. And she will help with The Photo Shoot next week. And Bill, no wizard cap, and no combing my hair across the top of my head and squinting with little pursed lips.The photo shoot looms, but the studio is now up for it, whether or not I am. I also have an appointment scheduled with my photographer on Tuesday to shoot the piece for the this year's postcard and a few other Cloudstone pieces. Next week is the Week Of Photography. And speaking/writing of the new Cloudstone piece, it is at the top of this page! Too pink, not enough green, but I will get it. Now if I could just get the one for the book done again. Yesterday's came out too brown/black from the French Vanilla.

No thank you, I would prefer not to fail to pay back someone else's money than my own. Do I plan to grow my business?

I got a rather frantic call from my copy editor yesterday saying she is going to ask the editor for an extension to the editing deadline... that sounds ominous. She has been all \"what a great book you write so well\" up to now, and now I write poorly enough that she isn't going to be able to edit the chapter on kiln forming and the projects in 3-1/2 weeks? I *really* wanted this done before I leave for Philadelphia. Compartmentalization is good. Finishing one thing and then being able to focus on the next task is good. And maybe it has nothing to do with me or my writing at all. She has a life. Maybe something has happened in it.I started out languorous and happy this morning and now I am crabby, crabby, crabby! What's that all about? Jessie was even up and halfway dressed when I went in to get her for school. Maybe it's because Dave didn't put the slipcovers on after he said he would. Maybe I am just a pissy, cranky person. I know--I am reading-deprived! Until last night it had been a week since I finished my last book (book 5 in Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series for children 9-15). Last night I begged Dave for a boon and he bathed J and put her to bed by himself leaving me to take my own bath. I took Laurel K Hamilton's latest in the Princess Meredith faerie series in with me, \"Mistral's Kiss\". I added more hot water once and left the bath 2-1/2 hours later having read 212 pages--the entire book.Nothing in the previous paragraph is glass small business studio artist related, but how you feel at the start of a day drives your work. I would love to curl up with a book other than my own today and just read and sip tea. Maybe that is what retirement is like. So back to the business, studio, glass, and artist. Tomorrow there will be pics of the studio as it is almost CLEAN. Well, it's almost straightened. There are still dust bunnies the size of small countries lurking under tables and on bottom shelves, but at least I know where all my STUFF is and it is mostly all boxed up in dust-proof bins. Today I clean off the last wild country: The Desk.The Desk came from a previous life when I was at Northwestern University. It was surplus furniture stored in their version of the attic (the unused third-floor classroom) from who-knows-when. I refinished the top of it and have been carting it along on moves ever since. Dave swears it is made of neutronium, and it took two of us to barely carry it up the stairs and into our first apartment. It is solid oak from the early part of the last century (I would guess the 30's) and all one piece except for the drawers. The Postman Could Ring Twice on the top of that desk with the fat lady from the circus and it wouldn't move, if you know what I mean.The suspense is killing me. I did a Tuscan Cloudstone yesterday for the first time since I made the original sample. If it turned out, it will be the bowl for the Art Institute in Chicago. If it didn't turn out, I will try again. I now go look, brb.Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have Tuscan Cloudstone! The original sample is shown at right. Tomorrow, the finished bowl. Tomorrow also, The Apprentice and the Intern."},

Well, I was trying to reconcile a year's worth of expenses into Quickbooks from little scraps of paper in just a few days. I was fretting about my booth design for the Buyer's Market in February. I received and was unpacking a buttload of glass from Bullseye. I was freaking out over having new work shot by my photographer in time for the BMAC postcard.. hmmm, sounds depressingly familiar.Do I really repeat the exact same behaviors over and over again?

Now I get up at 7:45 and need to be really, really organized to get everything not quite done in a day. But I'm happier. At this time last year I had committed to grow my wholesale business, write a book and do my website and I was terrified.

Again. Did I mention I'm happier? And less stressed, let's not forget less stressed.Today, call the photographer and make an appointment to shoot work I haven't made yet from glass I haven't unpacked yet with a mold I haven't prepped yet. And the book photographer comes next Tuesday to shoot all the how-to photos Wednesday-Friday.

I am uninspired. Today I must slog through more studio cleaning. It continues somewhat ameliorated by the purchase of many clear plastic totes yesterday from shoebox size to 15 qt. Maybe if I have somewhere to contain all the \"stuff\" it won't spill out off the shelves and onto the floor. And maybe pigs will fly out of my butt. Gaw. I have to do it, I don't have to write any more about it.By the scientific verdict of the judges (\"Dave, what do you think?\" \"Oh I like that one best.\") The winner of last week's name that series contest is... Andrea Land with \"Cloudstone\". Cloudstone is an excellent, simple, evocative name which is easily extended: I already have Cranberry Cloudstone, Caribbean Cloudstone, Aventurine Cloudstone, Tuscan Cloudstone and Flaming Cloudstone. So Andrea, which color you want? Thank you to everyone who pitched in and participated! (Oh, and Jody, thanks for putting me off the word \"vitreous\" forever with that eyeball thing...)"},

In a spurt of efficiency I also updated my website to reflect the new representation. I am actually in the mood to do more online stuff today, but I have too much to do in the studio. It's ironic.

Today is packed with appointments of a mostly non-professional nature, though I am making a delivery to the new gallery in East Atlanta which has picked up my work, (Sabra).Yesterday I cured the fiber blanket mold for the wall sconce project in the kiln. I don't know what the people who wrote the instructions for rigidizing molds were thinking. They say to air dry the mold for 3-5 days. I tried that this summer and it took weeks. This being winter, cold and damp, I decided to kiln dry. It took  four firings to get it dry! You can only heat it to 175 degrees (don't want to risk it bursting into flame), but even so I thought four hours would be enough. Au contraire. Then I went for eight, then four, and still denied! Did a final eight and got it, if not bone dry, pretty well dry. And release doesn't work too well with it either. The instructions say to use 50/50 dish detergent and water, or non-stick cooking spray. I tried cooking spray in the summer and dish soap this time and got sticking both times... But at least it's done and I can get on with making the glass part.My latest mold order from Bullseye will be here Monday. The mold collection grows. Any piece the Art Institute is interested in I have to be able to produce quickly in large quantities. Can't be doing onesy twosy slumps. I am considering limiting the shapes and sizes I offer--at least for catalog work.Finally, I redid my price list for 2007. I still have to come up with a name for the new series I am doing. So far the prime candidates are Quarried Glass and Vitreous Stone. Some of the pieces in the series are shown here. I need to get this decided by the end of the week, uh, tomorrow... maybe Monday. So here's the deal. If you have an idea for the name, post it in the comments or send it to me in email by Sunday night. If I use your idea for the name, you get an acknowledgment in the book and a piece in the series. Yes, it is a big prize, but I am desperate!"},

There are 13 days till the photo shoot and I still have projects to re-do and all the interim stages to produce.The idea of retail is still rambling around in my head. No storefront--Doug's right and the city would just not allow that. But a mail order/internet business... My goddaughter is coming from France in May and June to do an internship in business with an American company. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find an American company that will fit the bill. But what if Siyeh Studio is it? I may not have employees, but I produce a product, I market it, package it and sell it. And the ACRE show is at the beginning of that time period so she could get experience at an American trade show. And if I expand to retail, she could fill the day's orders and ship them. Would this work? And what would I do after she leaves...Yesterday's accounting has left me with my creative juices sucked dry. Maybe I'll have something interesting to write tomorrow after today in the studio."},

{"title": "The Website is Progressing", "date": "Monday, January 08, 2007", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, iTunes is quiet (the dogs slurp chow in the background and the dishwasher swishes). Friday I redid the first page of my website! It's a start. One little step at a time. Over the weekend the office was cleaned and at 4:45 pm yesterday I actually began entering data into Quickbooks. And that's going to be my day, I'm afraid, apart from making the schedule for the next two weeks. Oh, I'll get a load or two in--maybe slump the current pieces for the Art Institute and redo another book project--but today is all about bookkeeping. And my back is aching already.If I spent more time at the office desk I would invest in a good--rather than a good-looking--chair. Something ergonomic and contoured that doesn't go at all with the Craftsman Mission desk, filing cabinet and credenza. I am not even sure if it is a credenza as I don't have a clear picture in my mind of what a credenza is. It's furniture. It's in the storage family (like dressers) but it seems to me there is also an office component to it. I guess I could look it up in the dictionary, but, really, why spoil the mystique? Right now I have a piece of furniture in my office that I have tagged with a cool name. Why should I have to call it by the name it started out life with which is t.v. cabinet or entertainment center? Where is the romance in that? I added shelving inside and it has morphed into my idea of credenza.OK, enough random chatter. The topic of the morning: retail. I did my inventory last week and I carry an *enormous* quantity of glass and frit. There are plenty of places that sell glass by the sq ft and frit by the lb, but does anybody do it by the sq inch and the oz? It would be trivial for me to sell that way online. I have long wanted a retail outlet but didn't want to be tied down to the set hours. Of course then there is the vacation consideration: I would need to hire someone to process orders while I was gone. Retail is worth more consideration.Then there is the book. After it comes out this fall I am guessing I am going to get more requests to teach. I have always been reluctant to teach in my space because it is designed to be comfortable for me at 6 feet tall and most of my students would be shorter, but the book gives me a pre-done curriculum of up to 19 projects and techniques. Add to that I have enough kiln space to fire everyone's large projects at the same time and, well, it seems logical. Of course most people want to take classes evenings and weekends, and I am reluctant to give up that time (and Dave is more than reluctant).But teaching ties to retail. If I teach, say, a fountain class  I need to have all the supplies for each student to make the fountain. No use sending them all around to find the light and the pump and the fiber paper and the glass. And a screen melt class. If they want to continue making the projects at home it would be good for them to be able to buy a melt mold, screen, a screen frame, etc. easily and economically. Some of those I have made specially for me, and the company that makes them has indicated interest in wholesaling them to me for distribution. Other things--like the screen--are only sold in quantities which are too large for a hobbyist to want to buy them.Hmm. Retail. Teaching. I think the idea of a business plan is not a bad one. Now off to face the finances."},

That girl has more shoe crises than women 7 times her age.The first of the year for me is a time when I pause, look up, see where I've gotten to in life, and make decisions about where I want to go. Yesterday I said to a friend and gallery owner that I wouldn't be doing glass in 10 years... Wow. Where did that come from? Maybe I need to sit down and finally do a business plan. The past year brought a pretty good set of short to mid-term happenstance goals (something happens and I have to take a stance in response--not a carefully chosen goal, a fell-into goal... like the book), but maybe it is time to take charge of the direction I want to go with my glass business rather than just thinking \"Hey, let's try THAT!\" and reacting to what happens as a result.I am definitely in midlife. This isn't a crisis, but boy it sure is time to pee or get off the pot in terms of what I want to be when I grow up.In the meantime, there is still a studio to clean, a load to get in the kiln, a commission to prepare for a client and a new gallery to select work for (Sabra in East Atlanta would like to carry some of my pieces and I am to deliver a selection to them next Tuesday)."},

The house has never been more organized--with the exception of the office which is still a pit. But the studio...Well, let's concentrate on the positive. Started the new wall sconce yesterday by making the mold. Sure hope it works as I am out of the rigidizer and the vendor doesn't ship during the winter as it is harmed by freezing. Did the glass inventory. Wow. We won't be moving any time soon! And I just unpacked and cut six of the *95* sheets of clear irid that came in in December... and that's enough of a task list for the day.Someone asked me yesterday about my blogging. Do I find it a good way to keep in touch with people? It's kind of an online diary, right? Well, no, not really. Sure there may be days when all that gets posted is what's to do, what's not done (ack, ack, ack!), etc. But the real point of blogging for me is to get to the point beneath the lists. It grounds and centers me. It's both a release and a reliever of anxiety. It's venue for exploration of a philosophy which might otherwise remain just a fleeting idea.It's a place to exercise my brain through communication. I don't get out much. There are many days when what I put here is my only interaction (one-sided though it is) with the outside world.And though I write quite a bit, it usually takes me all the way to the end to come out with the kernel at the center of the thought spiral. Blink and you'll miss it.And I blog because, after all this time, I have discovered that I really do like to write. I just don't like being told what to write or how to write.

The month for the artist of rest and rejuvenation. Of preparing for the spring and summer season.... And then there's this damn book. The anxiety attacks have begun again. Little ripples and tremors catch me unawares and I am the deer in the headlights for a moment or two.But the book is written, right? It's being copy edited by a very capable woman as I type, right? Well, yes. But this book isn't just words. Oh no, it is lots and lots of big, pretty, glossy, color pictures. Pictures of projects which aren't done yet. Pictures of stages of projects which aren't prepared yet. Pictures of tools and storage and glass in a pristine studio. The key word there is \"pristine\". My best approximation of the antithesis of pristine is slovenly, which is a step up from the current state of my studio. The photo shoot is scheduled in a tight three days January 24 - January 26. Period. And there is still that pesky wall sconce to mold and make...That's just the book. The Art Institute has 17 pieces due before February 1.

As usual I did almost NOTHING on my list for the week between Christmas and New Year's (those pesky finances, e.g., are still free-roaming and pesky), although I did many things which were NOT on the list but should have been--like winterizing the pond, cleaning the back deck and grill (and, yes, Mom, fixing the sink!).And today we all go back to our jobs after something of a break--if we were lucky enough to have time off for a winter break. How many will go back ready to take on a dozen projects, and how many are going to ease gently back into the stream? I guess your attitude and approach depend a lot on your boss and your job: The former are probably more positive if the latter are more reasonable. My boss is an unrealistic b*tch. But maybe she made some resolutions for the new year too. Maybe she will no longer expect more than any one human can possibly do in a day, showing extreme disappointment  if I fail to achieve.

But my life is so tangled with the parts all inseparable that it feels right to continue here.What will I do today? No, first let's start with what we did for New Year's Eve. It has been Dave's and my tradition ever since we married to spend New Year's Eve attempting to watch six movies. He picks three and I pick three and we never make it through all of them. We also race around the house stark naked, in the dark, playing with sarbacanes and boules de cotillons, screaming and giggling like mad fools. Before any thoughts should wing into the lewd or truly gross, sarbacanes and boules de cotillons are peashooters and spit wads.This year I picked two movies, Dave picked two and Jessie picked two. We kept our clothes on and J threw more cotillons than she blew through her sarbacane, but the screamng and giggling were just as intense. The movies in order of watching (and we made it though all six!) were: \"Barbie in the Nutcracker\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Star Trek First Contact\", and \"The Big Night\". Can you guess who picked which? J collapsed about 11:15 (most unwillingly) and D and I finished the night in the skychairs on the front porch making our resolutions.I have only two resolutions this year and they could almost be combined into one: mental and physical health. I strive for slim and serene. With slim(mer) will come renewed energy, freedom from many of the aches and pains that plague me currently, and flexibility. Walking, yoga and moderation in food and drink will get me there. Yoga, meditation during stretching and slowing down this year will move me towards serene. This is the year of smiling and saying \"No.\"Now today, what for today which is marching toward noon? Clean J's room and put away all the new toys. Take down the tree and all the Christmas decorations and pack them away for another year. Pack in boxes all the things for Goodwill and Craig's list. Then potluck with good friends at their house at 4:00, dressed up to ring in the new year.Peace to all. Peace to all I know and the many more I don't. Peace, safety, and freedom."},

Was I high? The \"week\" is only three days long (at least according to Dave's work schedule thoughtfully provided by Turner Broadcasting).The rest of the days between Christmas and New Year's are for doing similar things for the Griffith family: eight months worth of register reconciliation for the credit cards and bank accounts, sorting all the books in the \"library\" (at the top of the stairs) and getting more bookcases for it, hanging pictures, kites and art, blowing the leaves off the deck and raking the backyard, cleaning the office and filing a year's worth of papers, organizing all our photos in iPhoto, and banishing the last of the VHS tapes to a bookcase upstairs (with all the cd's). I need to figure out how to get all the vhs tapes on dvd... but maybe I shouldn't try to do THAT this week too!

How much harm can rain actually do?I am not by nature a passive-aggressive person. I am flat-out aggressive. If I think something, I say it. If I see a wrong, I stand up against it. I do not play a good long-game. I pay lip service to Grace Murray Hopper and occasionally beg forgiveness instead of asking permission, but more often I demand permission up front. Why does this trait come up today? I observe around me the success and failure rates of those who put \"it\" out and signal their intentions, and those who smile and nod, deftly change the subject when it is raised, and blithely do whatever the heck they please in the end.

She is home from school for the day and right now is riding her bike around the house (inside) wearing a Disney princess nightgown, a polar fleece cap and snow mittens. If you think THAT is surreal...It's time for the update on the book. I found out last week after I asked my editor (nothing is ever told pro actively to me) that the publication date has been moved to November 2007 because they are *busy* with other things. Never mind that I practically had a nervous breakdown meeting *my* deadlines with them. December 5, while I was in Chicago, I got an email with yet another project change *request*. I was guarded about its feasibility, and said I would follow up on it on my return to Atlanta.Since my return we (the various editors and I) have been immersed in getting the illustrations and the shot-list for the photos firmed up. This morning I made a call to the main editor to follow up on the new project request. It was not a pretty conversation. I said there may be technical issues with the December 5 request, and I might need to do another technique. I brought up the technical difficulties *in detail* and presented their options realistically: 1) They may have to either settle on the bowl they already have, or 2) They may need to drop the project entirely, or 3) I might need to do a different technique in different glass for a wall sconce. I was told I was expected to redo the project *exactly*--technique, glass, and color--as decided by them. I finally snapped. I did it calmly, I did it politely, but I did it.I said I had signed on to accept suggestions on color, projects, style, etc., but I never agreed to be told exactly what to do and how to do it. I was asked to have the manuscript have done by November 1--including a write-up of all of the projects--and I did. I went along with a project review on 10/13--two weeks before the manuscript was due and long after all the project write-ups were due. I went along with requested changes to 30% of the projects (and the resultant changes to the write-ups) which came out of the project meeting. But now they have pushed too far and I will not just jump blindlyIronically, I originally wanted to do a ceiling fixture for the project in contention. They asked for  a bowl instead because a ceiling fixture would be too big for a \"beginner\" kiln, so I did a bowl. At the project meeting they decided a bowl was too boring and they wanted a ceiling fixture. Deep breath, okay. December 5 I got an email telling me they found the hardware for the \"wall sconce\". Whiplash. What wall sconce? The one I am to do instead of the ceiling fixture. They had reconsidered and decided the shot of the ceiling fixture would be too boring.I said enough. They trusted me enough to have me write the book and do the projects. They were going to have to trust me to make technique change decisions on my own. This is *MY* book, and ultimately, *I* am responsible for it and will be judged by its quality.The conversation ended politely and frostily. Now I gear up for the photo shoot at the end of January. I hear I have a really great photographer and a super Art Director. The book begins to feel more real. (I also have a GREAT line editor and the editing process is going really well)."},

Yes, today, December 17, I BEGIN my main Christmas shopping. I have never been so late. And I write here and now--before the annual New Year's resolutions are due--I will NOT be so overextended next year! I am cutting back my show schedule and focusing more on my home and family. And I am taking weekends OFF. But I save the resolutions for a couple of weeks. No use getting ahead of myself when I am still behind on posts (I now owe four--two here and two Stranded in the South). Unfortunately the ones I owe all require more thought than I can spare while juggling.Peace on Earth, Goodwill to all."},

I am still in my jammies though I should have received the lost pallet of frit and molds from Bullseye five minutes ago. I did not really believe it would happen, and I was right! I called Roadway, my scheduling rep is out for the day, and the woman who is there doesn't know anything about my delivery--can't even find IF it is scheduled, much less when. And yet, through it all I am serene. I will not be using it before January anyway as I am now DONE FIRING TILL NEXT YEAR.Yep. It's almost a vacation! Of course the flip side of not firing is doing the bookkeeping for, um, this whole past year. I am philosophical and realize there is no way it will take less than a week to pull it all together in Quick Books and find out if I made money, lost money, or broke even this year (door #1, Door #1, please, please, please door #1!).Because of the transition and focus of my energies, I am deferring yet again the promised pertinent posts (show and book) for another day--at this point another week! Instead, this afternoon I have a couple of posts for Stranded in the South, \"A Package! A Package!\" and \"Five Year-Olds and MRI's\". The last of the Caymans posts will have to wait till next week when I get my hands on Final Cut Pro to strip a little from the snorkeling video--it's too big to put up as is and I don't seem to be able to grab stills from it with a Mac."},

Yesterday was a trial from beginning to end, no doubt about it.  I waited all day for my delivery from Bullseye and, as usual, it didn't come till 5:00. Unexpectedly it did not contain the 35 boxes--500 lbs--of frit and molds I ordered. Finally just got word that the missing pallet has been located, now I am just waiting to hear when it can be delivered. I know they are going to try to fob me off with a \"We only do residential deliveries on Saturday\" line, but I am not going to take it. I have a business, this is a business delivery, it is easier than many other small business deliveries (as easy as it can be without a loading dock), and I am bloody well not going to hang around all day on Saturday again waiting for it! I have a Christmas tree to buy and decorations to put up. I am NOT working this Saturday!And I am far too cranky to be relatively newly home from vacation. Now I have to run get a kiln load in of things which need to ship tomorrow. Sometime before I A) die, B) disembowel someone, or C) kill someone, I will do a nice long post about the book experience of the month and the recent show.

Toto, as you can probably guess, we are not in Kansas (or Atlanta for that matter) anymore. Nope. Today I write from my room at the Embassy Suites lakefront in Chicago (Go Priceline!). It's One of a Kind Show time again, and we are off and running. Tomorrow I will put up pics of the booth, but for today, just a few highlights of life for the glass artist on the road.The car was packed so fully that there was bubble wrap crammed up to the ceiling. It lumbered up the interstate making occasional vulgar grinding noises. I know it's not supposed to sound like that, and it only has a couple thousand miles on it (if that) so I am a bit worried. Sell! Sell! Sell! I need to get rid of as much glass as possible so we go home lighter and have room for all the wine I have to carry. Thanks to the arcane tax restrictions on wine, some California vinyards (from whom I purchased wine club memberships) can't or won't ship to Georgia so I have it all shipped to my in-laws in Illinois and pick it up twice a year when I come to town for a show--unless I drink it here. It's nice to have a stash.Today I am tired. The show started last night and I made the mistake of breaking in a new pair of boots. I figured, heck, it was only four hours! I never wear heels anymore and today (and all night) the balls of my feet just ache. Today I am back to sensible flats (still boots). And it's hard to dress for this show. They're only so many layers you can put on. It's 5 degrees ( 5 DEGREES) outside and under the 2400 watts of lights (and additional heating helpfully supplied via the furnaces by the Merchandise Mart facilities people) I need a silk cami, a sarong and a fan! Ah well, I'll survive.This morning I am going to walk the floor and hunt for friends' booths. I think I have schmoozed with everyone but Chrissie and family (Dave are you here?), but I haven't seen all their booths yet. The show opens at 11:00 and I then I am going to sell, sell, sell!

Anything I can triage till the Sunday before I leave for the OKSS, I will.Thanksgiving. I give thanks for my healthy, safe family. I give thanks for an incredible year in the glass studio. It has been a wild ride, but I have grown and learned from it. Finally I give thanks for my friends both near and far. I wish everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving, good food and friends to share it with. This will be the first year since well before J was born that Dave won't be deep-frying a turkey. Tomorrow we will be eating Thanksgiving dinner with my parents in an Irish pub on Grand Cayman. Ought to be interesting.

The burglar alarm went off at 6:30 am when a spider and the wind lifted an unlocked bathroom window a smidge and broke the contact. That was exciting. I figured I might as well get a start on the day and went to the studio to assemble one of my pedestals to check out my current shelf lighting system. I found I am five glass shelves short... This is a serious problem as I can't get in touch with the owners of the gallery where I had them last weekend to see if they are still there and today is the last day Dixie Glasshoppers and I have open in common before I leave for Chicago. If I have to delay my departure by a day for these shelves I am going to be VERY ticked off!Now let's get to some good news. Bullseye Glass is considering using an image of my work in their upcoming catalog! They solicited images of architectural work and mine was one of the finalists from the 300 images submitted. I'll know for sure in December. And Uncommon Goods is featuring my pieces on their homepage right now. Hope that generates some sales for them (and more orders for me--I still have 20 sets here!).Diane Andersen finished her weekend in the studio yesterday and her piece fused beautifully. It slumped last night and I expect it to come out perfectly (the kiln's still too hot to open). She is going to pick it up at the One of a kind Show in Chicago as she flies back today and won't be able to stop by to pick it up before she goes. The full photo chronicle of the Weekend in the Studio can be found here. Okay, lots to do in the penultimate day in the studio. Till tomorrow..."},

Comes a time for everything and the time has come for you to shut your mouth and get your ass on the plane.\" Except for the fact that I am worried about going to a show, not dying, and I am driving, not taking a plane, this song is for me! Three days left in the studio to prepare for the One of a Kind Show, and they are all slump load days--what's made is made, and that's all there is to it.This past weekend saw my first \"Weekend in the Studio\" and it was great fun. Diane Anderson from Chicago spent Saturday from 10:00 am till 8:00 pm in the studio with me learning about the compatibility of glass for kilnforming (coefficient of expansion AND viscosity/surface tension), kiln wash vs. shelf paper, firing schedules--what happens at each stage and why it's important to go slowly where we go slowly. She also learned how to cut glass, layer frit, program a kiln, and she created her own 13 X 15 Morceaux de Verre cheese tray! We skipped yesterday as we got the fuse load in so late the kiln wasn't cool yesterday till 3:00 pm, and she is coming back today to clean her piece, smooth the edges and put it in the kiln to slump. Pics tomorrow, I can't find my camera right now (and she's not done anyway).Yesterday I prepared to dress the part of the artist. I am not a small woman. In fact it might be said I am large on two axes: I am 6 feet tall, and there is no way in hell I will tell you my weight! I am... comfortably padded. So clothes shopping is usually not a joy for me. Even when I was fashionably thin, I had a hard time finding things long enough. Now add the weight... it has been truly dismal... until yesterday. Yesterday I went to Coldwater Creek in an upscale mall. They need to change their slogan (if they have one) to \"Clothes for the  Amazon Artist Who's Not Afraid to Be Seen.\" I bought skirts and pants in plush (machine washable) black velvet, stretch devore velvet tops with beads and sequins and silk fringe... Oh it was a sumptuous banquet of color and texture. If Liz Claiborne is Frank Lloyd Wright, Coldwater Creek is Louis Comfort Tiffany.One might question the relevance of posting about clothes on a glass artist's site. If one does, one might be a twit. One of the first phrases I learned in high school Latin was Vestis Virum Redit, or Clothes Make the Man. As professional craft artists we obsess about our booths and displays for shows, but we often overlook a vital component of the presentation--ourselves. For the past several years I have worn dark, drab conservative clothes to my shows (because that is what I had and I couldn't be bothered to obsess about it). Other artists have actually commented on the inappropriateness of my look. They don't say \"Your clothes are boring, you should dress more like an artist.\" No, instead what I hear is \"Wow, your personality is as colorful as your work, why do you dress so soberly? It isn't you at all.\"So this year (to insert and mangle another metaphor) the butterfly is emerging from the chrysalis (thank heaven for the blogger spell-checker--I am giving it a workout this morning). I will stalk the floor of the One of a Kind Show in my sexy slouchy black leather boots, long swirly velvet skirts and glittery, drapey, peek-a-boo devore tops (ponchos! and shawls!). Instead of fading into the background, I will stand out in my booth. And with 449 other artists at this show, any differentiator is a good thing."},

It has been a busy morning in the studio so far with inventory of the etched and unetched glassware, a load in the medium kiln and a visitor. Another artist who paints wine glasses and fires them in a kiln came and took some of my unetched glassware off my hands today. Unfortunately she didn't want the margarita glasses or most of my wine glass styles so I still have several cases of those left. Anyone need 4 dozen Libby's margarita glasses?And now several more hours have passed and the day is over. Three kiln loads in, and prep work done for a \"Weekend in the Studio\" I have scheduled for tomorrow. I have someone coming from Chicago to spend a weekend in the glass studio. It will be a combination class/project/mini-apprenticeship. She will get to take home something cool she made, and I will work her fingers to the bone helping me get two other kiln loads in. She will fill frit jars, grind circles, wash pieces for slumping, crush glass in a pillowcase with a hammer, and other fun studio chores! There are restaurants (Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, for one) where you can work in the kitchen for a day. I don't remember if you have to pay, or if you just have to be vetted for skills beforehand, but I do know someone who chopped green beans there for an afternoon...I did end up doing a final firing schedule this morning (that's what I was doing instead of posting) and I am much more balanced and relaxed this evening because of it. I even followed it and put in the first packed-to-the-gunwales load in over a week! Now I am downing tools, clearing off the table and getting ready for the pepperoni pizza my family went out to slay for dinner. They should be back soon and I'll have the hot coals waiting."},
{"title": "I Think, Therefore I Am... Not", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, \"Nightswimming\" by R.E.M. on iTunes. Advertising is almost done. All supplies for the One of a Kind Show are identified and ordered. I keep making pieces. Not as many as I planned for any given day, but everyday sees at least one kiln load and for the next few days I will have two. My Bullseye frit order came yesterday so I can do all the series again. And (I feel a whine coming on) everything is blah. I am a worker bee. I have no direction, no detailed goal, nothing more than a vague hand-waving plan. I haven't been able to focus to plan. Some might say I over-plan already. But right now I feel completely rudderless.Maybe it's because almost all of my work is still up at Taylor Kinzel. We extended the trunk show through another weekend. The weather and highway closures between downtown and the gallery limited attendance--though I did extremely well anyway. I know what I took up there, I know what sold, but I don't know what was already there. And I probably shouldn't be thinking about taking it anyway. Need to leave them work for the holidays too.In truth, I think I think I have too much work and display system to fit in my van for the OKSS. I have never done a 10 X 20 booth before. The pipe support system for the lights and the hanging panels is seriously heavy, as is the wire storage rack that I plan to use for inventory storage in my booth. Add all the boxes of work, Me, Jessie, my Mom... whew!I have seven hanging panels for this show! They are 16\" X 24\" and I did them in five different series (cosmos--shown above, ocean, forest, earth, and watermelon delight). Six of them and two of the 20\" round panels (one cosmos, one earth--earth series at right) in steel stands make up the back and only) wall.The plan (back when I had lots of ambition and time) was to make one of each size of the smaller display pieces in stands (16\" round, 10-12\" square on edge and 12X14\" rectangle) in most of the ten series I am taking. But as I think about it, I don't even have enough plastic totes to carry all that glass!I was going to add to that another 9-20 pieces per series--taken from the following: small rectangular plates, small square plates, small round dishes, three sizes of rectangular platters, two sizes of oval platters, three sizes of bowls and two sizes of square platters. Was I nuts? I was planning $22,000 of work for this show! On the other hand I doubled my sales between the year before last and last year, and I did over $10,000 last year in a 10X10 booth...Planning is making me absolutely nuts. And it's moot. There are eight more firing days between now and the show. That's eight more kiln loads and some of them must be slumps. My brain hurts. Maybe it is better today to be a worker bee. I will take all the hanging panels in to be drilled. I will do another fuse load, and another melt load. And that's probably all I have time for. I will not plan. I will not think."},
{"title": "A Rant", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2006", "text": "Coffee (from Jupiter Coffee) in the Chicago skyline mug, \"In Without Knocking\" by Mission Mountain Wood Band on iTunes. Straight to the rant. At the tail end of the Buyer's Market of American Craft last February I had a guy fly into my booth and place a small order for a \"gallery/store\" in Las Vegas. Gallery/store is in quotes because that was my assumption. I sell to galleries and stores, this is a wholesale show for GALLERIES AND STORES, therefore that's what he must have. Some time later I am updating the Locations page on my website and I go to add his \"business\". I google his business name and find \"Your Source for Quality United States Mint Postage Stamps at Reasonable Prices.\" What the hell? So I dig a bit more and find that he he has a store on eBay and is selling all the glass art he buys at wholesale at the BMAC on eBay! If I wanted my work sold on eBay, I would do it myself!Whatever one's personal feelings about eBay, selling your work there is a personal choice and I feel violated that someone has made that choice for me. There are a number of glass bead artists who sell their work on ebay and do very well at it. They have built a following of collectors there to rival any gallery's. And they sell their own work. I find it sleezy in the extreme that someone would set up an eBay store to sell the work of many artists without their knowledge or permission. Just the decision of whether or not to sell online is a big one in my community.So I stewed for several months, resolved not to sell to him again, filed a complaint against him with the BMAC, told other artists work whose work he was selling there about it, and let it go.  He called me *yesterday* about the larger of the pieces he bought from me because there is devitrification on two of the Pop Art circles and he is afraid his \"customers\" won't understand and think it is a defect... Well of course they won't! In a gallery there is someone knowledgeable about the creation process for the piece who can explain how glass changes at high temperatures and some surface variation is to be expected. You go looking for art on ebay and expect perfection at dirt cheap prices. The pieces are *exactly* what he saw at the BMAC, and now he has a problem. And what is he doing just getting around to opening the shipment from me now?!? I sent it in August!I did not say anything about eBay to him. I was not friendly, but I was professional. He is sending the piece back, I am replacing it. I should have just refunded his money. Today I looked at his \"site\" again and he has my bio and picture on it! He is selling my work at retail, but every piece I sent him is also listed on ebay and the photos are truly bad (everything was shot on a wood-grain background).Thinking the day couldn't get any worse, I went to put on the new \"gallery\" I got an order from in October (also from the BMAC, this time July's show) on the Locations page of my website. I google the \"gallery\" name and find \"Experts in Home Automation, Whole-House Audio & Video distribution, Home Theater ...\". What the hell, what the hell, what the hell?!? So I call the guy. I tell him I am trying to update my website with his \"gallery\" information and all I can find is a home theater store. Does he have an alternate website? Uh, no, he and his wife have a \"high-end private gallery in their home\". I sweetly reply, oh, okay then, I will put his phone number and address on my website for contact information.I was completely mystified by his order until this morning. He ordered two 11\"X7\", and five 7.5\"  Morceaux de Verre pieces in different colors. Not something you would purchase (wholesale again!) for a home collection. The lightbulb has already gone  off for you, I'm sure. He bought inexpensive gifts! Employee Christmas, give-aways to customers  for big purchases. Whatever. My work is not the diamond in the Spic 'N Span box!!Would I have sold to these men had they been honest with me from the start? Maybe. Every BMAC I get private shoppers who want to buy from me, but it is usually cash and carry at the end of the show--no extra effort on my part, just less to pack and take home. If the pieces have already been ordered by a legitimate gallery (or requested by another artist), I don't do it. For someone to order from me under false pretenses (especially the tv guy) and cause me to go to extraordinary lengths for what I think is a start-up gallery order just frosts my cookies! Okay, off the rant and on to work.PS--I took the tv guy off my web page."},
{"title": "Out of Glass!", "date": "Tuesday, November 14, 2006", "text": "Coffee (what remains of it) in the Denver skyline mug, \"Corpus Christi Carol\" by Jeff Buckley on iTunes. So I made this intricate schedule of all the pieces I want to have for the One of a Kind show in December and I have been working through the list. Normally I like to cut all the pieces in one or two days and then make them over the following weeks. Right now I am juggling so many things that I haven't had a long stretch of time for nothing but prep. As a result, I have been cutting a day or two's worth at a time just so I have enough done to get a full load in the kiln everyday.Yesterday I figured I was within shooting distance of cutting the rest of the pieces (somewhat further than spitting distance) and I decided to give it a try. I went out to the secondary studio (i.e., the garage) to the reserve glass storage to get some more clear irid (the base for all the Morceaux de Verre pieces). In case the Art Institute needs some more platters I figured I better hold back some sheets (five to ten ought to do). I looked in the case... and I only have 12 sheets left! I looked at the list of work I have planned to do and did a rough count of what it will take, and I need at least 17 sheets just for it! gaack. I just got 65 sheets of clear irid at the end of September bringing my total for the year to 162 sheets and by the end of the week it will all be gone. Wow. That's 765 sq. feet of glass. For the sports-minded, that's more sheets than it would take to lay them end to end all for the full length of a football field. I could go on with relational measurement information, but my mind is already boggled enough.So today I ease back on the firing a bit and wait to hear if the AI needs more pieces before Christmas. I am seriously hosed if they do and will need to trot myself up to the Art Glass House in Suwanee for more glass. And I have a chat scheduled with my editor about the pictures for the book gallery (other artists' images). The rest of the day will be spent futzing with display (I found some battery-operated lighting yesterday and I need to see how long it will last and how bright it is), waiting for frit, sorting papers and planning next year's advertising."},

Dave just left for work and Jessie is still sleeping. I posted on Stranded in the South yesterday about fall sliding into winter, and I reflect again this morning how close I still am to the sun and the seasons. I live in a climate-controlled house with an abundant supply of electricity for light whenever and wherever I want it and I get my food from a supermarket. I do not live in a tent, foraging for my food and and migrating south to warmer climes as winter approaches. But my blood and bones drive my brain right now. They say to hoard and huddle. Prepare for the long sleep and eat everything in sight. Shades of an old Bloom County cartoon where Steve Dallas remarks \"You chicks store fat in your thighs for winter, doncha?\".I am now allowed to write and reflect this morning because I only have one project scheduled between now and the end of the year and I have got it under control. I could be a realist and borrow trouble about all the last minute \"stuff\" that will be dumped on me with a \"Can we have this next week/tomorrow/right now?\" between now and January 1... But I won't. Until the book is in the hands of the Art Department at the Publisher on January 15 I am still on the hook. All the photography is yet to be scheduled (and it is also due 1/15). I *know* the editor is going to call me on December 19 and just blithely assume I have 36 hours a day through Christmas Eve to do it. Or they will start demanding I schlepp everything up to them again for some of the photography. But I said I'm not going to borrow that trouble and I feel myself getting wound up just thinking about it. Breathe.I have a week and a half to make all the rest of the work for my my biggest retail show of the year. It's going well. I also almost have the entire display figured out. I ordered the pipe of pipe and drape last week to hang the lights from and now the only thing I am still futzing with is the lighting for the lower shelves. I found rechargeable LED bases for lighting centerpieces, but they don't work at all on my glass--too intense a light in small areas. I might try attaching them to the underside of the top shelf so they shine down on the piece on the shelf. They are good because they light for 10 hours and only need 6 to recharge. Flashlights and other cordless lights are usually only rated for 3-4 hours. I would need stock in Duracell to afford using them for 4 days.Today I will make some more big hanging pieces--I bumped them to the front of the queue as I have to get the holes drilled in them before the show and Kelly gets cranky if I stroll in and ask him to do them NOW, ship a piece to the Art Institute, chase down a couple of past-due invoices, pay my own bills... all the usual small business stuff. Oh yes, and I will begin to contemplate where I am going with my glass work and if I really need a handbasket to do it. I'm thinking that's an accessory I can do without."},

A funny thing to say in the early middle part of November, but nonetheless that's how it feels today. Yesterday I got word that the Art Institue will be featuring the \"Flame\" Morceaux de Verre in a 12\" platter in their spring marketing. I am not sure if it is just online or if there is a catalog too, but it's good news either way!I canceled my current order to Bullseye yesterday as it can't go out till next week and I am afraid it could get delayed and arrive while we are out on a tiny vacation (vacation! vacation! vacation!). We will have a pet sitter, but not someone I would ask to take delivery of cases of glass, frit and clay molds. Now I'm glad I canceled as I will need to add a bunch more for the flame pieces... I just need to know how many of them!And on the Art Institute front, I got the holiday catalog from them in the mail yesterday, and my piece is on page 16 bottom right corner! I was not expecting it to be featured again in another catalog and am a bit worried that they are going to need more pieces this year. I have 13 more production days between now and 12/13 and they are already pretty booked. (I will be on the road and the studio will be closed from 11/23 to 12/12.)I am also waiting to hear from Uncommon Goods to see if they need more of the Pop Art sets. This is my first year with heavy retail and wholesale in Q4 and I am finding it tough to balance. The One of a Kind Show is my biggest retail show of the year and I need production to go towards it, but catalog  sales are pushing my wholesale too... I think I need another kiln! (And an assistant! And, as Roy Scheider said, a bigger boat!).Today I prepare everything for the Taylor Kinzel Trunk Show tomorrow. I will schlepp the pieces and my pedestals up to Roswell at noon. The hardest part is going to be making the inventory sheet and pricing everything (yet more paperwork). At lest the firing schedule is done. Finished it last night while watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire with J and my parents. And of course it may all go out the window now if I get more wholesale requests. But Bill, I don't care! I feel better when I have a schedule to follow--even if I have to be flexible about changing it. Organization and flexibility--those are the traits of a successful business woman! Having someone manage everything for you is is the trait of a successful artist. I am still self-managing.

So far today I unpacked shipments from suppliers, processed gallery returns (etched glassware that I no longer do), and put in a call to a pipe and drape supplier.As soon as I catch my breath a bit I will confirm my Bullseye order, finish the rest of the One of a Kind Show firing schedule, and do a little more grinding on the two boxes I will take to the Taylor Kinzel Glass Trunk Show this weekend. Notice the last activity listed is the first one of the day that actually has me laying hands on glass. Oh there will be firings today--three undoubtedly, maybe even four. If I am lucky or good (or both) they will be in the kiln early enough that I won't be in the studio after dinner again.Tonight I would like to take my parents to dinner and then watch a  movie with them. They have been here since Tuesday night and I have barely spent any time with them. Tomorrow morning I take them to the airport and they are off to Quito, Ecuador and then the Galapagos Islands.But back to being a studio glass artist. I feel like I am on the cusp of needing to hire someone. I had hoped the new apprentice would work out, but she came for a couple of days and then disappeared. So I am on my own again, naturally. Maybe it would be less work and take less time to plan tasks for one person to do a few hours a week than it would for me to do them myself and it could actually work...Food for thought. In the meantime, off to do more management \"Stuff\"."},

That's today. Except for the cool part. I am some kind of frazzled. And I still have a kiln load to get in.The (lack of) lighting for the lower shelf of my pedestals is seriously harshing my mellow.

I haven't made the lid yet--nor have I finished polishing the box--but I wanted to get the pics up anyway. I am very pleased with the technique. I was not able to get my new little lap grinder to do 45 degree beveling so I had to freehand miter the corners on the big one (wheeee!). I was less successful than I could have been, but it was good enough for this time.Going forward I will make myself a guide for the big lap grinder (or have have my Dad do it tomorrow--got to find things for him to do while the parents are here for the next couple of days on their way to Ecuador). I had the realization yesterday that I don't cook anymore and Dave is leaving for Las Vegas directly from work for a bachelor party so I am on my own with my parents. Take-out pizza tonight, Feast in Decatur tomorrow, and I'll figure something out for Thursday. I used to cook, but anymore the very idea of everyday cooking just stymies me. I guess I could manage a rotisserie chicken, fresh cut green beans in a bag and some Uncle Ben's...But onto more interesting things like glass! I have been so busy with arcana since Friday that I still haven't finished a list of pieces I want to have for the shows I have coming up. That lack has not excused me from firing, instead I feel like I am just haphazardly throwing pieces in the kiln that I hope I will need. And I am running out of glass--out of certain colors of frit anyway. I need to get an order in to Bullseye this morning so they can get part of it in UPS tomorrow and the rest out on a truck by Friday.But back to haphazard firing. It makes me feel completely out of control. I do not feel free or liberated, I feel... haphazard! I don't *like* haphazard. Time to get a plan, a schedule, something--Bill would say to ignore--I like to think of as a guideline to improvise around. Planning for a retial show is always such a crap shoot. What pieces will be hot this year? What will I sell out of and what will die on the shelf? I am planning ten Morceaux de Verre series, some Coulee de Verre pieces, an orchid melt or two, and some boxes. Oh yes, and the obligatory Pop Art \"stuff\". It feels like a hodge podge now that I see it in writing. I hope I can pull it off. Maybe I'll skip the orchid melts this time. Okay, off to spend more money and plan, then the airport to get the aged P's, oh yes, and a firing."},

All the pieces in this series are called Resurrection Boxes as they all come from failed flat pieces. This one has mitered corners. Pics tomorrow.Today I have to fight my way through the final booth design and facilities order for the One of a Kind Show. The advertising deadline for NICHE magazine also looms and I want to put something together for it. I am going to do one in this year because of the whole finalist thing. Credit cards are about maxed, money flows out like water, and business has never been better...?? Maybe today will see the arrival of yet more checks from the orders that went out last month. Bi-directional money flow in a business is a GOOD THING.Ikebana starts back up today. The instructor is back from Japan and the big ikebana conference there so I am expecting high energy in the class. On the book front, I mail the illustrations in and maybe take pictures of the projects for the lin editor. I have so moved on from the projects at this point and I still have several to redo and re-write.For glass I am going to try four boxes at a time in the medium kiln. Also have a fuse load in the big one for the show this weekend. I think I am going to limit my color spectrum for this one. They don't like the bright colors in the conservative northern suburbs.

{"title": "Going to the Show... Again", "date": "Thursday, November 02, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Home\" (again) by Marc Broussard on iTunes. I like starting my day with that song. It's a show planning day. As I have upgraded to a 10 X 20 booth for the One of  a Kind Show in Chicago in December I have to completely redo my booth design.Planning a booth for an upscale indoor retail show is much harder than any other show for me. I always want to put out too many pieces which gives the appearance of \"stuff\" rather than \"art\". And I still do a lot of functional work. In fact my latest, best work is with the the boxes and what are boxes if not functional? \"Art\" and \"functional\" do not usually play well together in many people's minds. What I find most interesting is that people want to pay more for things they can't use. So if I make a 16\" fused disc and stick it in a stand it will sell for more than it will if I slump it into a bowl. It is the same beautiful glass that can be displayed as art, but it is worth more if I put less work into it... Go figureBut invariably when I have a more minimalist look I will get a regular patron who starts talking about a piece he wants and I have just the right piece... stored. Stored can be in plastic totes under the table or on shelving behind a drapery, but wherever it is, it is inconvenient and often entails me getting down on the floor and rummaging around on my hands and knees with my head under a table. Not exactly a professional look. So this time I want to design accessible, unobtrusive, efficient storage for extra pieces and packaging materials.And then there is the whole lighting dilemma. I think I am going to bite the bullet and order pipe systems (for pipe and drape displays) as the basis for my lighting and stands for my hanging panels. I thought about getting the colored pipes, but I think I will go for a more durable, less expensive style in silver. My track lighting can be attached to the pipes with zip ties and I can drape the red organza around the pipes to hide them. I am also still futzing around with battery-operated lightboxes for the pedestal shelves. This ought to be a no-brainer, but I am having more trouble than I thought I would finding the fluorescents (can't be halogen--to hot).Finally I think I will have a four-ft. banner made like the one in the header on this post but without the \"glass incarnate\". I just wish I could have red carpet in my booth. It would be the best little whorehouse look in Illinois! (Bordellos R Us) What can I say, I like red."},

Spent a lot of time catching up on the current happenings at warmglass.com including some back and forthing with Brock on reprehensible vis a vis artists and finally just gave up. Sometimes the effort to communicate an idea other than the obvious black and white one is just too difficult (as evinced by Bert's response). I'm not going to link the thread. Any warmglasser can find it in art & philosophy under 'are you an artist...'.It feels weird not to have to write something. I have the project re-do write-ups, and I really do need to do them, but I am having trouble jump starting. And with the help of all my online time yesterday I didn't get the illustrations and templates (my sketches for the illustrator) done. I was also supposed to have my ad copy and pics to the Crafts report yesterday (OOPS!). Gotta do that right after this post. My order for Hoy's went by the wayside too, and it includes an order for another mold from them for a book project re-do. *sigh* Not to whine unduly, but I feel a bit flat. Big build up culminating in the accomplishment of a serious goal and then... Lots of little piddly stuff to do, but most of it doesn't feel worth the effort. SLAP! Snap out of it! That's better.Okay, Today I'll finish the illo's and ship them off (and take pics of all the projects for my line editor), pack and ship the last three gallery orders from the July BMAC, do a piece list for the Glass show at Taylor Kinzel on 11/11, and schedule the firings (and get a sitter for J--she is having a sleepover that night with Grace for her birthday so I don't want to overload her with a playdate too and Dave will be in Vegas as the best man for a bachelor party...).I also need to start working on the One of a Kind Show inventory (piece list, firing schedule)--including the new boxes and ovals. I've posted pics of both before, but I am so jazzed by them I am doing  it again! I am going to miter the corners on the next boxes so they look less pieced. Since they are one solid fused piece of glass (fired to 1500 degrees as a box) I want the edges to look like it as well as feel like it.Finally I need to get an update on the molds I am having made for the ovals and other coulee pieces, and get the specs together for the free-standing lighting frame so I can have it built. I need to learn to weld. I really want to learn to weld! Yeah, and that's a whole 'nother set of tools I don't have room for in the studio. Now to glass work!Oh yes, and there will be a big fuse load today and maybe a project redo in the medium kiln."},

Oh yes, and a caveat, all but the introduction is written. I am savoring and saving the introduction until I see what the book turns out to be. It's hard to introduce something that isn't finished.Coffee in the Barcelona skyline mug, \"Let Me Leave\"  by Marc Broussard on iTunes, (ready?) 34,939 (original) words written. There have been subsequent edits and I didn't count them. Now if you do the math at 400-500 words per page this is a really tiny book! (87 pages is just not much) But remember, it's supposed to be eye candy, not a text book. I am actually over in page count right now and I am expecting my editor to come down hard today. I have planned 60 photos from other artists in the gallery, there are another 87 demo and how-to photos, 20 full-page beauty shots, 6 illustrations and 6 template pages. Oh yes, and an index, front matter, yah de yah.So why, if the book is DONE (can I say it again? revel just a little in a blissful moment of DONENESS?) did I get up this morning at 6:30 am? What can I say, I am ruled by the sun. The clock springs back, I spring up. What did I do? Well, I harassed an online vendor about the decided lack of new coffee maker at our residence. I pinged iTunes about a double-charge for the Marc Broussard album I gifted to my in-laws. I began this post! Then I got J up and off to school (not tough, it's pajama day for Halloween and I french-braided her hair last night so all I had to do was supervise ablutions, feed her, see her shod and shivvy her out the door).Now it's 8:20 and it's time to be a glass artist again. Going to get the slump load in early this morning and start on the illustrations, templates, and photographs for the line editor (she wants to see pics of all the projects before she edits the text... makes sense to me). I also need to contact the publisher and find out if they really want a hard copy of the book sent to them, and if so, what they want in it as we are already editing and everything is fluid..Got email from Bullseye yesterday. They are soliciting photos of architectural installations for their new catalog coming out in March 2007. I have the perfect project, but I don't have any good photos of it and I don't have time to drive up to Marshall NC to get them. A couple of years ago I did 32 glass bricks for an old building renovation. They are 2-1/2 X 2-1/2 X 6 and solid glass. They go longways through the building so the light from outside comes through them on the inside. You can see the light and the bright colors from the picture, but you don't get that they jut into the room a bit on the inside and provide three-dimensional interest too. I think it would be a great photo for the catalog, but I don't really have a whole day to spend driving up to get the photo. Maybe I can hire a photographer to take the pics for me and send them to me... I need to pursue this possibility. Yet another iron in the fire for 2007!Boxes. I am still obsessed with boxes. Especially now that I got the new lap grinder diamond discs from Centre de Verre and tried them out yesterday. Hoo boy. I'd forgotten what a new disc feels like. I got 60, 100 and 180 grit so I am really ready to grind. And I figured last night that I *might* be able to do 32 boxes in one firing in the big kiln. If I can do 32 at a time it makes them more saleable as I can more easily justify tying up the kiln for 32 for three days than I can for 1 or 3 or even 8. However I am going to be smart and I'm not going to do 32 the first time.  If they all failed it would be a disaster. But I am going to do 8. Eight boxes the day after tomorrow. Tomorrow I will fuse the glass for them. Oh d*mn. I hope I have enough fiber paper for them. I still haven't ordered from Hoy's. *sigh* today. More administrivia, less glass.Now more glass, less writing. To the Kiln and Beyond!"},

I have already been asked for several edits (including the rewrites of all the projects they want re-done), but edits are far and away easier than writing from scratch. Dave asked me last night how much I had left and when I told him three pages he was just shocked. I don't know what he thought, but clearly he thought me much further behind than I am.Today (obviously) I write. I also do a slump load. Beyond that, I don't know. Writing really gets priority. I can tell I'm in the home stretch as yesterday I wrote the dedications and acknowledgments page. I can't imagine anything making me feel more done than that. Of course it will be tweaked: The people from the art department at the publisher will get a nod if they do a good job (and I expect they will) as will my editor if she can improve the book while not making my life hell...Now before I get too complacent here on my laurels I had best heft myself off and lumber away to write!"},

So I took over for her since she was making the change in order to come to Chicago to help me at the One of a Kind Show. I was on the phone with various people at cheap tickets for over an hour and never did get it changed. CheapTickets.com is cheap in service as well as in name. Today I finally go to someone who told me they couldn't change it because even though I don't want to make a change to the originating flight on November 7, they can't make a change to it,a nd because they can't make a change to it, they can't make a change to the return segment either. Are you confused yet? So she had to release the ticket to the airline and let me make the change with them. Caloo Calay! I called Delta, they changed the ticket and it cost less than it would have to change through Cheap Tickets.It wasn't the best way to start my day, but at least the time I spent on it was free because today is my favorite day of the year. Today has 25 hours! I have a whole extra hour to do whatever I want today, and never have I needed it more. I laready fired two kiln loads and did the prep on another two.

I think I had too much to drink yesterday. Too much coffee that is. Excess caffeine is the only reason I can think of that I called Kathleen Hogan of the One of a Kind Show in Chicago and asked if I could increase my booth size at the last minute and took on a 10 X 20 double corner booth with two pillars in the front corners and only one wall in the back. Oh yes, and it's on the \"new\" side of the floor. At least, from what I have heard, it is over by the \"Martini Lounge\". Yes, caffeine is the ONLY likely explanation.I lay awake from 1:30 am to 4:30 am designing the booth in my head from display to lighting, only interrupted by Jessie climbing in with us at 4:00 and Dave's occasional restless murmurings. I think I have come up with a freestanding support system for my track lights and a battery-powered lightbox design for the lower shelf of my pedestals. Hoo boy, and that's all the time I have to spend on the booth (except for making notes this morning on all my ideas) because THE MANUSCRIPT IS DUE TO THE PUBLISHER IN 4 DAYS 8 HOURS SIX MINUTES AND 36 SECONDS. (I keep a timer running on my desktop for it... as if I don't have enough stress.)I think I will be okay. I know I will for the writing part, but I also need to draw all the illustrations, scan them in, print out a copy of everything and snail mail it in. Just the scanning printing and mailing will probably take all day Wednesday, and it's also a big shipping day (three galleries orders scheduled to go out). That leaves today, tomorrow and Monday for writing, and Tuesday for illustrations. All the big kiln loads are slumps and once I get the 3.5 X 8 rectangular plates cut and ground from the fuse, prep time will be very little. Breathe, just breathe.Yesterday's firings were a mixed bag. I made another frit wafer like the one in the original draped vase. I see such potential in this technique for sculptural pieces. The wafer is so delicate I want to pair it with something sturdy like cast blocks, but the whole piece also needs to be able to be packed and moved without breaking.  Of course, this isn't something I have time to think about today either--in spite of the fact I have one show in two weeks and the One of a Kind Show is in a virtual four weeks away. The coulee I did did not turn out so well--too many reactive glasses in the same piece made it dark and muddy. And 4-1/2 lbs is not enough to get a 12-inch square. I either need to weight the corners more heavily or use more glass. Probably the former. The final fuse of gallery pieces looks to be flawless, as expected. Some things I can do (thanks to the computer on the kiln) in my sleep.CRRAAAACCKK!! Gulp. Time's a wasting. Off to write."},

I just took the 8-inch test tile for the sink for the couple in Wisconsin out of the kiln. It is 1/2-inch thick and I think it is *stunning* (shown at top right). I may have to make a sink like this for the bathroom on the ground floor of our house in turquoise, French vanilla, amber and maybe a hint of cobalt. Though I've got to say I am really liking the way the coral/salmon opal and transparent have worked in the two pieces I have done like this so far.

I am doing the last big fuse load in the big kiln till next Tuesday (every day between now and then in slumping, slumping, slumping), I am going to do a box in the little kiln (period. no questions. just do it.), and I should do a rake for the new wavy candle sconce project for the book.

(And I LOVE Target--nothing she is wearing was even $20 and both dress and boots are very well-made.)What does this have to do with Glass Incarnate? This is the start of my day everyday: get her up, get her through her ablutions and dressed, hand her breakfast (for the car) and put two gummy bear vitamins in her mouth. Then send her out the door with her Dad and off to work! I was tickling her this morning to get her moving (I am a mean mother--I get it from MY mother.) and when I said I loved her belly button she covered it and said, \"You can love my bellybutton, but you can't touch my bellybutton.\" in just the intonation Janeane Garofalo used in The Truth About Cats and Dogs when she said \"You can love your pets, just don't LOVE your pets...)Today I have a potential helper-in-the-studio dropping by to meet me. She is the wife of a business associate/friend and I hope it works out. I have another gazillion circles to grind, wash and dry and I am NOT looking forward to it! I am also going to finish the kilnforming section of the book on target for pages and more or less on schedule (I had it scheduled for today, the publisher had it scheduled for last Thursday). And I need to unload the car (all the projects from the trip to the publisher are still in it) and photograph all the done projects so my new editor can see what the heck I'm talking about in the project instructions.Kiln loads are another slump in the big and should include something in each of the other two--book project and box in a perfect world... or maybe I'll do a fuse in the big one. I have three fuses to do this week to get out the last orders from the July Buyer's Market which are scheduled to ship a week from tomorrow. And I really do need to get going on project re-dos and pieces for the upcoming glass show at Taylor Kinzel in November. Now I'm getting anxious. Blogging usually relieves anxiety. Putting everything down here lets me see that it really is manageable. But this morning it's like I was too complacent and putting it all out shows me how FRACKING BEHIND I AM. And speaking of fracking, the satellite dish went out Friday night RIGHT BEFORE Dr. Who and Battlestar Galactica. The ONLY two shows we had to watch all week (the World Series has preempted House, Standoff and Bones.... Damn Fox) and nope, DENIED! Service call this morning.So enough writing here. Off to the studio to reconnoiter and get some loads in, and then finish the kilnforming chapter."},

I got coffee (in the Atlanta skyine mug), had breakfast with my happy family (mini donuts, yum), and put in two kiln loads. Now to finish this post and then shower and write the rest of the day.At right is the new project for the book which will replace the previous screen melt piece. Isn't it scrummy? (Short for scrumptious, not an extra letter for crummy...) I put in little pics today because I don't have much to say and have three photos to squeeze in. At left is the detail from the same piece, which I think I will call \"Scrumptious Pink\".Finally, the last pic is a shot of the load I did in the big kiln yesterday and took out this morning. This morning I took all these pieces out, reloaded others in to slump, washed half of these and did a fuse load of eight in the medium kiln. (I can see Jodi wanting to take a nap already ;-). And firing really is the littlest task of the day. Now for Cleanliness, which is next to Godliness, and quite fitting for a Sunday!Bill posted in a comment earlier today that he was surprised I planned to write 1600 words on Thursday. It seemed quite logical to me. I have 6400 words slotted for this section. They made me do a page (and so by extension a word) count for every part of the book. So since I have 16 pages due and (at that time) had four days to complete it, I scheduled 1600 words for that day. Now I have under one day to finish that section, and 3354 words written (about 3000 left to write today). I am not scared by this number. But I AM scared: I have written about 1/3 of the materials and used over half the words. I am heading for trouble."},

There are coincidentally 16 subtopics and I am on number six. Slumped yesterday instead of fused. I am so tired of Bullseye opal glasses! If I use thinfire I get hazing on the bottom--even with venting. The kilnwash I tried a couple of days ago stuck and I had to use diamond hand pads to clean it off--and even that was only marginally successful. Yesterday did have one rainbow: I slumped the first screen melt oval and it is gorgeous! I took a picture, but it may be too dark to really get a good feel for it.Today, more writing, a fuse load in the big kiln and a project redo in the medium kiln. Also need to redo the fiber blanket mold for the raked candle sconce. Sometime this weekend I need to take pictures of all the projects and send them to my NEW EDITOR! Yep, that's right, I finally got my line editor assigned and actually talked to her. I was very happy at the end of our conversation and think we are going to get along just fine. Talking to her I very much got the feeling of \"equals\". I didn't feel like just another disposable author, lower than the lowliest administrative assistant or a gopher whose time is worth less than everyone else's. This is a nice change."},

And yet it was still a good and productive day and I am satisfied with the output.I didn’t get a pedicure because the laptop battery was dead and I wasn't going to sit there without being able to write. And it’s just as well I didn't as it took most of the day to get the fuse load in (I hate, hate, hate the little Pop Art pieces!) and the Art Institute order signed, packed and shipped. Today I invoice! I also narrowly missed burning down the house last night. *sigh* I have got to get a multi-hour timer that I can wear around, and I have to do it today.Yesterday I left the kiln lid open an inch until the kiln was at 1200 degrees (and had been there on full power for some time). I have to vent the kiln because of the reaction between the binder in the thinfire and the Bullseye opal glass and I forgot that it was vented until 9:45 pm last night--I should have closed the lid at 5:30. The kiln is in the garage and the garage door was closed so it was getting mighty warm in there before I closed the kiln. Got another load like that to do today and I will set the timer on the stove and work in the breakfast room till it goes off.Now off to write. Pics later."},

I'm late posting this morning, but I already have a kiln load in so nyah, nyah. Yesterday when I looked at the oval melt I did the day before I decided it was way to dark for the book--the coral almost all reacted with the French vanilla so it is pretty black. So instead of doing the bubble-fix fuse on it yesterday, I did another melt. It is *gorgeous* and lighter colored (coral tint, clear, a bit of coral opal, a bit of coral, apricot opal, and a smidge of French vanilla for black lines and interest). I ground the edges and both ovals are now in Kiln #2 for a bubble fix.Today is an errand day--Thursday usually is--with a leg wax for me and gymnastics for the J. I may even squeeze in a pedicure (isn't my life tough?). I can justify the pedicure as I will take my laptop to it (and to gymnastics) and sit and write the whole time--no loss of writing time and I will be able to write at least another four pages. Besides writing I need to ship a load to the Art Institute and put in another large fuse load of Pop Art pieces in the big kiln. I also need to start putting together another order for Bullseye and one for Ed Hoy's (my other wholesale supplier in Chicago). I am about out of thinfire and fiber paper, and thanks to the additional orders from the Art Institute I am also low on some of my frit colors. Finally, I need to buy enough stands for the 2-D panel pieces for the show I have at Taylor Kinzel in November and the One of a Kind Show in Chicago.News from the publisher on the whole where-are-we-going-to-photograph-the-projects issue is pretty good. They are letting it drop until there is an art director assigned to my book. I am not sure why they felt they had to get my projects up there asap if there isn't even an art director assigned to work on them yet, but so be it. Other news from them is not so good. Ever since the beginning of this project the editor has been giving me guidelines for number of words and photos per page. I have been following them. In fact, in the beginning I even needed to pad my estimates so that I could show enough words to fill the book.Yesterday I got a n updated copy of the page count spreadsheet they initially gave me to work from. It has a new column called 'rounded page count' (in addition to the 'raw page count' already there). The raw page count says the book is estimated at a total page count of 124.75 pages. I am shooting for 144 so so far, so good. However the rounded page count shows me at 156.5 pages--or already 12 pages over. I would think they have been doing this long enough that the page-planning documents  they provide their authors to track their work would have better than a 25% margin of error... but maybe I would be mistaken. Not sure what they would like me to do about it now so I am going to just keep on writing."},

Geils Band on iTunes (Blogger is sloooow loading this morning!), nothing written yesterday except a letter to the editor. I was right that my saying no was not enough to deter them from pushing me to get all my projects back to them for photography. The reply to my email stating the projects could not be shipped and I do not have the time in my schedule to make another trip up to them was met with a genteel invoking of the C word. Contract, doncha know. I know. I know the word intimately as I negotiated it for several months.I delicately replied that, no, it didn't state in my contract that I had to deliver anything to them other than the manuscript, and I offered a couple of other options including putting their art director up here for a day or so. It's never a good sign when the \"C\" word is invoked. It doesn't necessarily mean everything has gone to hell in a hand basket, but it says you are on that road and it has a slippery slope (any more metaphor thingies I can mangle?). I am expecting a phone call today since the email didn't elicit the desired response.In the meantime... Success! I tried a shaped screen melt and it worked perfectly! I had to charge the kiln once (add more scrap glass to the piece when it is at process temps) and extend the soak a bit, but I should be able to tell the gentle reader how to do it without a charge by the final weight of the piece. I guessed on the initial fill from the weight of another piece that shape, but I knew it was apples and oranges and I might run short a bit because melts are always a bit thicker than regular two-thickness fuses and will weighout higherToday has a slump load scheduled in the big kiln and a surface fix of the melt in the medium kiln. Tomorrow I will slump it and I'll post a picture on Friday. Today is also a writing day. Today I begin for real the monumental task of writing the kilnforming section of the basics. Shelf Prep R Us. Even now I am already in the sky chair on the front porch, but I may have to move inside. Even though it is the perfect temperature out here to sit, it has rained without drying out for the past three days and it smells a bit like the boat house at the lake... Eeuw.

{"title": "A Little Blood in Every Piece (and on the Keyboard Too)", "date": "Tuesday, October 17, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Los Angeles skyline mug, \"Corpus Christi Carol\" by Jeff Buckley on iTunes, nothing new written. So yesterday, lots of blood. I hate the Pop Art pieces. It is inevitable if you have to individually wash, rinse and dry 240 newly cut rectangles of glass that you will cut yourself. Multiple times. The last time was deep enough for stitches, but placed so that I could just close the flap back up and bandage it tightly together and it will heal fine. Didn't even have to use any butterflies. (Is it \"butterflys\" when referring to the closures?). This morning I opened up one of the cuts while taking out the studio trash hence the blood on the keyboard. Luckily it's on my thumb so as long as I blot it before it drips...I am striving for sanguine today. You might think it funny after yesterday, but a little cheerful optimism wouldn't go amiss right now. I ended the day yesterday with a note from the editor. (As opposed to \"my\" editor with whom I have as yet had no dealings. I am not really sure she exists as she blew me off entirely last Friday when I was at the publisher's. Apparently she didn't even come in to work that day.) She wanted to know when the projects will be all done so they can do the beauty shots for the book up there at the publisher's... (beauty shots are the full page pictures of each project). Hello? We have had this conversation already. 1) I can't travel anymore this year. I am booked *solid* through December 12 already and I expect some stuff to still come in. 2) I can't ship the projects, some of them are just too fragile and even for those that I wouldn't normally expect to break, the cost would be too high if they did. 3) This is my book and I want to be there for the photography providing input as appropriate.So I wrote back points 1 and 2 along with \"we can just do them here with the rest of the photography\". As far as Dave is concerned that's it, it's over and done now, that's the way it will be. I am not so... sanguine. I have a feeling it's just beginning and I am going to get bullied into another herculean effort, which will really piss off my husband who is the support behind all effort at this point. Borrowing trouble? Maybe.In the meantime, I need to do a screen melt today and fuse (really, really) the last Art Institute and first back-up Uncommon Goods load I have not done for the past two days. I think part of the reason I have been dragging on doing this fuse is that it is speculative (and I am having deja vu... have I written that already?). I am making 20 platter and plates sets in case UG orders them against their second PO. There is no assurance that they will need them and that I won't get stuck with them. I know, someone will eventually want them and it will be nice to have them already done, but you don't spend the margin at the edges of life force on maybe.And it's about time for some of the money for all this effort to come rolling in. The first Net 30 payment is due Friday with three more due by Monday, 14 in all due by November 9. Now I feel more sanguine. The thought of money coming in always makes me cheerful."},

I blogged, I napped, I lazed, I read to my child, I cuddled with my spouse. Some days you just need to recharge. So that left yesterday pretty full, work not going away and all. Yesterday I washed and sorted all the circles by size and stowed them. Then I cut 212 rectangles for the Pop Art platters and plates, and  unpacked a case of glass from Bullseye (the rest of my order from last month). I was quite dismayed to find I made a mistake on the order and got two sheets of cobalt blue instead of two sheets of sky blue. Oops. I still have two sheets so I can do 40 more Pop Art sets with stock on hand if I have to.Today I have Ikebana at 9:30 and then I get to finish cutting rectangles (21 to go) and  wash and dry them all. Today's big kiln load is the last five platters for the Art Institute and as many opal Pop Arts as I can get in. I am tired of having to deal with the haze from the Thinfire on the opals--even venting to 1000 degrees doesn't eliminate it entirely--so I am going to fuse all the Pop Art pieces on kiln-washed mullite shelves. We'll see how this goes.I would like to do loads in the medium and small kilns too. I *should* be redoing a project every day to get them done. For the most part the changes are small, but the pieces have to be redone entirely anyway.They want the necklace in amber irid instead of teal irid.The blue lace bowl (which was originally proposed as a ceiling fixture or a a lamp but done as a bowl because they wanted it smaller) is being redone as a ceiling fixture (and, of course, larger...).The raked candle sconce mask is going to be a long horizontal wave piece instead of a tall half-circle--and no face (not a mask). Got to remake the fiberblanket mold for this one too so had better get on it--it takes a long time to dry.The harlequin black and black irid candle trays on lava cloth are going to be coral cathedral and either clear, black or amber and black streamer in clear.The paperweight will be a dragonfly instead of sea creatures and will have clear irid or dichro in it.And finally, the S-curve screen melt will be an oval screen melt. I want to do as little cutting as possible on the melted piece so I am going to try to come up with a creative way of damming the glass into an oval as it melts.  And then there is the remaining writing... I still have the kilnforming, finishing and troubleshooting sections to do as well as the complete re-write of the screen melt project and the updating of the  other changed projects. But today is not a writing day. Tomorrow will be for writing (and slumping). Wednesday will be for fusing, shipping and writing. Thursday I will have to drive up to ULine and get a large order of shipping supplies... and fuse. Friday, Saturday and Sunday: writing and fusing. The week looms. I will be glad when the book and the catalog (repetitive) orders are done."},

Given the choice of staying warm and cozy in bed and maybe reading a bit while D and J go to the grocery store for breakfast fixings (the house is 64 degrees this morning) or getting  up and blogging, I chose blogging. No coffee yet, no music, nothing new written. Yet let it not be said there has been no progress--we have moved into a new phase of the book. It is a phase in which it finally feels solid and really happening. I have had my project review, they have seen the pieces and they are not cancelling the book. Was it a possibility? No. But between having now met them face to face, having them accept my work and having all the projects and half the basics text written (except the project that now has to be re-written--see below), it feels much more real to me than it did on, say, Wednesday.I preface this next section with \"It went well from my perspective\". That may seem a surprising statement as I have been asked to redo almost 30% of the projects for one reason or another. But the suggestions were reasonable and they will make a better book. There is only one change which makes me vaguely uncomfortable: They want me to redo the S-Curve I did for the screen melt project (upper left) into an oval platter (same shape as the sea serpent at right). I am uncomfortable with this request as the combination of technique and shape are evocative of Steve Immerman's work. But I will strive for something different. And Steve is known for his beautiful coldworking which I will not be doing as I can't count on the readers having access to the equipment.So what now? Well, there is a post for Stranded in the South coming up on roadtrips, small towns, and freeways in the south (I am going to treat myself on this beautiful fall day). It is a studio day, of course. Every day between now and Thanksgiving is a studio day. I need to wash and dry all the circles and sort them by size (I know I have been saying that for days, but today I really have to do it). I will also redo one of the book projects, put in a fuse load for the Art Institute and Uncommon Goods, and maybe, just maybe, I will put another box in the little kiln."},

And in stunning symbiosis the last project for the book will be finished this morning (the tack fuse on the redo of the pendant project). Psych.Yesterday was a long one. I fired five loads in three kilns. The Art Institute ordered 20 more pieces (15 of which were fused at 9:20 last night). The checkerboard and checkers are *perfect*. No devit, no hazing, just perfect. Too bad they are such a boring pain to make--they are cool and would make nice gifts (make a little box to store the checkers in…). I also got the last of the circles ground. Today I have to wash and sort all 10,000 of them. Yeee, yeee, yeee.The main task of the day today is packing all the projects up to take to the publisher’s in North Carolina tomorrow. I have to leave at 4 am to get there by 8:30 am. Yeee, yeee, yeee.  On the plus side I will be home by dinner and it is Fun Friday at the Y for J so D and I will have a quiet pizza and champagne dinner at home and watch some more Firefly (we are re-watching the whole series… it’s a comfort thing). The champagne will either be to celebrate the day or to drown my tears. Odds are even on which right now.So what else is happening in the studio today… well, going to finally ship the order to the new gallery in PA (had a chip on the bottom I had to grind and firepolish out in one of the pieces yesterday--found it as I was signing to ship), got to cut 20 PopArt platter and plate sets to fire and hold in reserve against the PO for the catalog in NYC. The PO is for 42 sets, but there is no way I am going to make that many without a concrete order--20 is more than enough! Then the last five pieces for the Art Institute and the first of the PopArt sets go in to fuse. Then the prep for slumping tomorrow on the Art Institute pieces that come out today--Just because I have to drive for nine hours tomorrow and hang out for few hours while people evaluate my work (I’ll have my laptop and be writing) doesn’t mean I don’t have to fire a full kiln load. And last and biggest on tap for the day: going to send out the last five projects and the Work Area set-up and Safety sections of the book. Don’t Run With Scissors!So far this morning while waiting for Blogger to be back I have broken one of the little leaves for the fountain and lost one of the silver loops for the necklace. NOT an auspicious beginning to the day. Got to find the glue and make another loop.Ended up casting two more leaves instead of gluing. And two kiln loads are already in. Whoo hoo!"},

The checkers fired perfectly, the board is still too hot to look at. The last slump load for the new gallery in PA is done and will ship today. I just put three small castings in the little kiln and all I have left to do on the projects (if the checkerboard turned out) is redo the necklace, flip and firepolish the checkerboard, glue the mirror and hangers to the mirror frame, and put the hands back on the clock. Everything but the firings can be done tomorrow. I hope I don't have to redo the checkerboard. The only reason I would is a haze from the thinfire on the front (I fired it face down to keep sharp lines between the squares).Today, after I finish all outstanding writing (and it is outstanding, if I do say so myself) I have to finish grinding the circles, wash and them all and sort them by size. Then it is time to begin fusing the back-up PopArt platter and plates sets for the catalog in New York. I had originally planned to start Monday, but it wasn't urgent so I let it slide in favor of supervising yard clean-up. I know a landscaper with a very good crew and she really likes my work so we are doing a trade. For my part, I now have over 40 bags of yard refuse on the curb waiting to be picked up and composted by the county (I don't compost anything with weed seeds in it as my pile isn't big enough to get hot enough to kill them), the beds are almost all mulched (13 cu yds wasn't enough... we have a big yard), and the lawn is trimmed back from the beds and mowed. *sigh* Life is good, even if it wasn't all about glass this week."},

The bubbles are just too random a factor.The gold and silver leaf dish also failed. I could have saved myself some work there by just checking the warmglass archives first, but I had to do it on my own. Much of the leaf vaporized (which I knew could be a problem on the surface, but this was sandwiched) and what was left was too faint to be interesting in the clear glass--except for the black and brown gloppy-looking mess in the middle where air sealed in and oxidized the silver.Now it's 7:30 am and I already have the first two of four kiln loads in. The first is a replacement project (another one) with gold and silver mica, light blue irid and clear irid glasses. If it turns out well it will be the perfect project because it teaches use of contact resist, demonstrates a painting technique (pouncing) and incorporates micas. Fingers are crossed. The other load is the first of two slump loads to get the last gallery order of the week out.Yesterday was shipping hell here. If I could hire someone just to do my shipping I would. I ran out of peanuts halfway through the Art Institute order and had to run out to the UPS store and pay double the usual rate. Then there was a snafu with the UPS driver picking up the packages because I had two different pick-up times scheduled so I had to call customer service and get him back out at 6:30 to get the last shipment. It was stressful and hairy, and I was sweaty and exhausted at the end. I shipped 260 lbs of glass out yesterday in six boxes.

And the medium kiln is tied up until tomorrow morning with the rest of the table firing (it is 1\" thick and going to take a loooong time to cool down). I  just don't know if I'm up for/have time for trying a fourth table. Darn the table base company anyway: such a deep recess requiring a thick table top is just a pain. There is no way I can do another thick tabletop by Friday... but maybe I can do a thinner top and use vinyl bumpers (lots, and lots, and lots of them!) to raise the table level 1/2\".I also still have the checkerboard (and pieces) to do, the necklace to re-do smaller, the paperweights to re-cast in lighter colors, and the mirror frame to glue to the mirror and hang. Oh I just had an idea. If the tabletop falls through (again) maybe I can do a gold and silver leaf holiday candy bowl. A simple project, pretty, flashy even. Lord knows this book needs a bit more flash.On the gallery-order front, as I was unable to squeeze in the slumping of the pieces for the new gallery over the weekend I will be unable to ship it today. And with the current firing configuration, I am not sure when I can get it done. Just one more damn thing to have to work in. On the plus side, the orders for the Art Institute, the catalog in New York and the Chicago gallery are all done. I just need to sign all the pieces (about 130 of them), package them up, enter all the shipping info online for UPS and have them picked up today. Just.But now it's time to get dressed, have another cup of coffee, and get ready for the onslaught of the yard clean-up crew. Our backyard went to hell in the proverbial handbasket over the summer with my schedule and I finally Did Something About It.

Nothing is stirring except me and the moth outside the window drawn by the light of the laptop screen. I feel a kinship with her. We're both beating our heads against something this morning. Sunday mornings are meant to be spent snuggling with a warm, cozy spouse, not writing into the void before writing more projects. But such is life with 24 days left until the book is due.Firings have been a mixed bag over the past few days. One of the pieces for the new gallery cracked yesterday. I either took it out of the kiln too hot (doubtful, but maybe) or (more likely) I can't slump pieces that large in the small side-firing kiln. The mold almost touched the sides and even with the top elements adding surface heat I am just not confident that the piece fired evenly. Unfortunately the bigger kilns are all full for the next few days and I am not sure how I am going to work the new pieces in. *sigh* I'll think about it when I am more awake.Time has passed since I started writing this post. I spent it making a new playlist and buying a bunch of music on iTunes. Now I listen to the playlist (titled \"melancholy\") and I write. But now the sun and the spouse are up (so where's my coffee?!?) so I am going to start REAL writing."},

It's almost like I am on a fall roadtrip as I move westward with my skyline mugs. I can almost feel the crisp air and see the brilliant fall colors of Chicago from my chair in Atlanta. A chair, I might add, I do not plan to leave anytime soon unless it is to get dressed and move to a Sky chair on the front porch. Today is SUCH a writing day! I have started the work-area set-up and safety sections of the book (don't run with scissors! See? I'm a natural) and I am going to move on to the fountain and the table this afternoon.I have run into a bit of difficulty on the firings. Not only did I way over estimate what I could fuse the other night, but I also overestimated what I could slump in any given load. So now instead of firing a book project in the medium kiln today or tomorrow morning, I have to slump gallery work. Maybe I should be really brave and daring and do the table in the little kiln. A 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick piece in a little 14-inch (35.6 cm) kiln. That'll be a treat. Hey I spontaneously converted! I don't think I'll ever be able to write a measurement in non-metric/non-Celsius without at least putting () behind it to hold the conversion.And I am late, late, late again today. Dave thought it was 6:00 am at 2:00 and started snuggling prior to getting up. J came in at 2:15. At 2:30 she started coughing and, afraid she might throw up, we all trooped into the bathroom. False alarm and we all went back to (our) bed to doze fitfully, waking every time J coughed and preparing to dash to the bathroom again. Dave finally got up about 3:00 and went downstairs. J \"wanted to be with Daddy\" and followed him down at 3:05. I heard J finally throw up from coughing and phlegm at about 3:20, and then I fell back to sleep and left the rest of the family to sort themselves out without me. Dave came up to take a bath at 7:00 and told me J had laid down on the couch and fallen asleep next to him and he had eventually tucked her back in bed. After all the ups and downs of the night, I blearily rose at 7:45 and got J moving and ready for school. Now I write. I write here, I write in my metadocument on photography, and maybe, just maybe, I will actually Write In The Book!"},

Forbidden Forest by George Winston on iTunes, no writing yesterday. No studio work at all till 5:00 pm. So what, you might ask did I do all day? Who knows. I was on the computer all day--except for the 2-1/2 hours I took to take Jessie to the dentist for the first time (she did great and wants to be a dentist for Halloween now--she gets off on the rubber gloves. Don't go there.).Oh yeah, I also finally figured out how many circles of what sizes I need to have for the 60 PopArt platter and plate sets I have committed to being able to provide (spreadsheets rule). I will make up 40, ship 20 of those, and have the materials on hand top make another 20 if asked. I hate purchase orders with a \"hold for confirmation\". And I ordered the circles. Another $1,000+. Not an expense I was planning, and one I have to take on against the eventuality of an order rather than against scheduled income. In a way I can see where knowing exactly how many of what size circles I have and having them sorted and stored by size will enable me to manage my inventory and plan my designs better (and manage my production costs). But business growing pains are still pains.Today started really late as I completely lost it and scheduled way more than could possibly fit in the big kiln last night for the fuse load. And the schedule is such that I couldn't just save some and do it today--the kilns are already scheduled for a slump load (the big kiln) and a book project (the medium kiln). I did have the little kiln unscheduled and I do have to use it to fuse the one piece I couldn't fit in last night. So how did I mess up so badly? I tempted the fates, that's how.The day before yesterday I looked at my schedule and thought I was so far ahead I had room to put in a couple of pieces for the November Taylor Kinzel glass show or the One of a Kind Show in Chicago in December. Might as well start squirreling them away now, went my reasoning. Then yesterday morning I pulled an order from a new gallery in PA off the fax. It was a little start-up order and I thought I could just squeeze it in with the last of the PopArt platters and plates for the catalog and the order for the gallery in Chicago. About  9:00 (I took a dinner/family break form 6:15-7:30) I looked in the kiln and, holy sh*t, it was almost full! And I had already made another unscheduled \"extra\" piece! So I finished filling the big kiln, then I filled the medium kiln, then I filled the little kiln and fired them all up. It was 10:30. I went down and shut the kiln lid on the big kiln at 11:45 (it actually started firing at 10:00 and was--I hope--at a high enough temp to have burned off the organic binders in the shelf paper so the PopArts don't get a milky haze on the bottom.When I woke this morning I was singing the chorus of the Monty Python Spam song, only instead of spam, spam, spam, spam I sang beans, beans, beans, beans as what woke me up was the sound of Dave grinding the coffee beans at 7:30. Honest, I woke up and the words were already coming out of my mouth before I was even awake. It's desperate times here. I didn't even start this post till everyone had left for school and work. And now I am dragging.Fortunately, it is a light day in the studio--a slump load in the big kiln and the table project to fuse the medium kiln. The rest of the day is really, truly BOOK. T-27. Twenty-seven days till the book is due at the publisher. Yee Haw."},

I am late, late, late this morning! I didn't sit down to write till 7:41 which means four minutes to blog unless I take my laptop up and write as I keep Jessie company (and exhort her to Hurry UP!) through her morning ablutions. I can hear her up there now whining to Dave that she's still TIRED and can she stay in bed for five more minutes. She's only FOUR for heaven's sake! Why is she a teenager now?The schedule is taking its toll. Of course part of that could be that I am also having the last painting in the house done this week and have to supervise the painter on top of everything else. The color is cantaloupe slice (shown at right). On my screen it looks a little softer and more muted than it really is (a good reason not to pick paint over the internet--I didn't pick it that way, but it is a good reason nonetheless).I have five projects to write up this week and the work-area set-up and safety sections. The five projects are not even all decided yet. That's a problem. This week besides writing and gallery orders I need to do another orchid melt to pick the new colors, another screen melt to check the set-up using mullite supports instead of my metal stand, I need to finish designing and do the table, re-design and re-do the necklace,  make the checkerboard and checkers (ugh, more circles to cut), and try to design and paint a garden stake. That is project 21 right now (I figured it would be a good thing to have an extra in case they hate one of the others at the project review next week).It's a bit freaky that there are still projects for the book I haven't done yet or am still tweaking around for the third or fourth time. I really thought they would be done and tucked away the first of September.Some time in all of this madness I want to do an entire load of boxes in the big kiln. I will have to cut a lot more dams and they will take up the kiln for the better part of a week, but it would be nice to have them for the Taylor Kinzel winter glass show and the One of a Kind Show. (Am I high, you ask... and well you might!).But enough for today. It is already 8:52 and I should be working. Tomorrow, T-27."},

Almost have the next five projects written up. Will definitely finish them this morning and get them sent in (they were due last Thursday...). I managed to follow my schedule yesterday at least in the broad brushstrokes, but things are beginning to crack at the seams. When I went to ship the order I had to go out yesterday I was missing a piece: I had accidentally sent it to another gallery last Friday. So I quickly fired it in the medium kiln, called the gallery and let them know I would be shipping today.I didn't do a firing during the day as almost all the studio time was re-assigned to getting paint (the last large area still in the original beige paint will be painted today. Had to hire it out as it includes the wall next to the stairs and D won't let me up on scaffolding... killjoy) , making a bank deposit and picking up the mirror project and a cosmos hanging panel from Dixie Glasshoppers. But that was okay (I thought) as when I went over my firing schedule for the week it looked like I was so far ahead I had gained a day. What I needed to do was keep scrolling down. Last night at 9:45 when I was updating my schedules I saw that I wouldn't be able to ship the final big order to the Art Institute next Monday without firing today. Fortunately a slump load would do so I quickly (again) prepped and popped in a full slump load.Yesterday I did get one housekeeping task that has been nagging at me done. I mentioned earlier that I am doing the PopArt platter and plate sets for a catalog this fall and they want all the pieces to match. So last night I counted all the circles I use for each one (eight sizes from 3/8\" to 1-1/8\" in six colors for six pieces...) I am putting it all in a spreadsheet this morning to make sure I have enough of each of the color/size combinations on hand. I still have to grind four of the colors and wash all eight colors from the last group of circles. Then I have to sort out all my old circles by size and put them in with the new circles. Boy do I wish I had help right now. This is the kind of project that is going to suck my time right out my ears and could be done by a trained monkey. Not that I would call my help a monkey.Okay, 7:45. Blog time is up for the day. Got to roust a Sprout and get ready for a painter."},

I am behind. There is no getting around it. I can manage the physical requirements of firings and prep work no matter how tired I am--though cutting glass takes on a whole new dimension when you are exhausted. Fortunately the adrenaline rush after the first cut usually wakes me up and keeps anything too serious from happening. But I can't write technical non-fiction when I am crushed by fatigue. Yup, crushed.So today a new regime begins. It is a sad fact of life that there are only so many hours in a day. And it is a happy fact of life that some of those hours need to be shared with loved ones. It is just a fact that I can do some things better at some times of the day than I can at others. So starting today I am optimizing for time and task, and I am further restricting everything that doesn't move me closer to having the book and all my firings done on schedule. What does that mean? Well, no Stranded in the South until November 1 unless I get WAY far ahead again. 15 minutes per morning to blog here (four to go).

{"title": "One Month and Counting", "date": "Sunday, October 01, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet, but it is brewing. No music and nothing written yesterday at all--not even meta-writing. At right and below left, the best piece I have ever made. It is called the Coptic Blue Eye Box. It is 5\" X 4.5\" X 3\" and the glass is about 3/8\" thick. This piece is special because, like the Carnivale box, it is a \"from the ashes\" piece. Someday I will have a show of  pieces that were all made from the failures of other pieces--from the ashes. The glass in this box was the original pass at the raked wall sconce project for the book. But the glass was too opaque--it is French Vanilla and Egyptian Blue opal--and it had two air bubbles from the rake firing. One of the bubbles burst and left a hole, the other made the \"eye\" formation shown on the lid of the box. After I achieved success with the box firing schedule, I decided to use this piece of raked glass for another box for D for his birthday.What you cannot get from the photos is just how silky smooth the glass is. I polished it on the lap grinder to a fine matte finish. And though it looks like the sides are separate pieces of glass, they aren't anymore. When I fused the box, I took it to 1500 degrees for a long soak and now the entire box (except for the lid) is one smooth, seamless piece of glass. Can you tell how infatuated I am with this piece? I could stroke and pet it all day. Of course it is no longer mine and I don't have all day to moon over a box, but if it were and if I did... As it is I am just going to have to make time to make more boxes. Maybe in time for the Taylor Kinzel glass show in November but maybe not until the One of a Kind Show in Chicago. My friend Andrea who is a torchglass artist is going to collaborate with me on handles for the boxes. More on that project as it progresses!Yesterday morning I put together my entry for the  Corning Museum of Glass's New Glass Review and got it to the post office to be postmarked by 10/1 (what sense does it make to have \"postmarked by 10/1\" on the entry requirements when the post office is closed on 10/1 so you can't get anything postmarked that day?). The rest of the day was (almost) all birthday all the time (chronicled in Stranded in the South). I did go from cooking potatoes to cooking glass  when I put 15 ocean platters for the Art Institute in the kiln to fuse.Now for today. Back to earth with a thump. There is exactly one month till the manuscript for the book is due. I am halfway through. I am freaked out. The first half of the book took a month and a half to write and my firing schedule was not as intense. Ah well, all I can do is STOP DITZING AROUND ON BLOGGER AND GET TO IT! Five projects the \"decks\"  for all the projects written so far to write today, and the complete shot and illo list to finish. Also must fire another fuse load for the Art Institute.It's been a slice. Off to work."},

Ended up firing four full loads yesterday, aiming for the same today. But where yesterday's were slump loads (fast prep), today's big one is a fuse. The medium one and the first little one are both slumps and they are already in.This weekend is a big weekend. Tomorrow is Dave's birthday! Our family tradition is that the birthday person gets to pick their birthday dinner. If it is at home (also a choice) each menu item is chosen. Otherwise it is the restaurant that gets picked.

So how could today be anything other than anticlimactic? I had myself so worked up by yesterday morning that I was ready to quit the whole project. And though reason has convinced me that I over reacted, my gut still tells me that I am right--that there is a fundamental mismatch between what the editor wants from me and what I want to do/have been doing. Life being what it is, you go on, make the best of it and Just Get Over It!It's only 9:30 and I already have three kiln loads in and firing. The order that is scheduled to ship to the Art Institute tomorrow is ready to go today. I don't know what wild hair crawled up my nethers (besides the one about the book) but I have just been on fire, uh, firing (yeah, yeah, so I am having trouble writing... isn't that the crux of the issue anyway?).Today is a writing day... again. Since my deadline schedule has been officially been revised at the publishers I am on schedule and not feeling too pressed. I write better when I am pressed. Some kids were able to start their school reports right when they were assigned. And they worked on them diligently, steadily, unhurriedly until they were due and then they calmly handed them in. I have *never* worked that way.I am better with firing glass than I ever was with anything else because the kiln has a hard stop on how much can go in and how long it has to be in there. Math and physics cannot be bought or bribed or hoodwinked. They cannot be coerced or flattered. So if I have to get something done in the kiln by a certain time, there is a simple formula I have to follow to do it: Ship time minus 12 hours equals time to put in for slump. Time to put in for slump minus 12 hours equals time to put in for fuse. Since I usually do only one load a day, the 12-hour buffer spreads to anytime in 24 and gives me the time to prep for fuse and prep for slump.But writing, ah writing. On a normal day (as opposed to an oh-my-gosh-I-am-so-far-behind-I=have-to-write-the-equivalent-of-War-and-Peace-Today day), I sit down with my MacBook on my lap and I open my word document for the current chapter or project. Then I flip to another screen and browse CNN. Then I flip back and open a spreadsheet or two to track my writing. The  I write a sentence or two and have to look something up on Wikipedia. So I flip screens back to my browser, open a tab for Wikipedia and start researching. A side note on flipping screens: I am running desktop manager software and have four desktops with different application groupings open on each one. This configuration keeps me from having to dig through layers of windows on my screen.After a bit of researching--either when I have found what I needed  or feel that I have wasted too much time already on something that is probably going to get cut anyway, I flip back to my document and start writing again. Then I have to pee, or get coffee (the two are inextricably linked), or answer the phone, or call/IM someone. And the day passes. Maybe I get 300-400 words done. On that other kind of day whose name is too long to type again, I squirm till I absolutely MUST pee, Dave brings me coffee, and I leave the chair cramped after 12 straight hours with eyes crossed and reeking of crabbiness. But I have 3000 words written.There must be a middle ground! I am not too old to change! Forty-five is the prime of life! Anything is possible! Blah, blah, blah. Now I have turned my little post for the day into another monument to procrastination and I MUST go write.Thank you again to everyone who posted comments and wrote to me privately about my crise d'esprit yesterday."},
{"title": "Okay, So Maybe I Over-Reacted...", "date": "Wednesday, September 27, 2006", "text": "Second post of the day. After getting three kiln loads in (time, tide and gallery orders wait for no man). I looked at a couple of the best-known, most respected books on kilnforming that I would actually consider primers, and I have waaaaaaayyyyy more info on the topics I have written so far than they do. So maybe, just maybe, my editor is being reasonable. One of the books I looked at had two short paragraphs on glass cutters and pliers. I have a page and a half listing every type made, their advantages and disadvantages and how to choose and use them. That's the only section I looked at as I am reluctant to be influenced on topics I haven't written yet. I would not consider either of these books fluff at all, so maybe I really am writing too much and if I continued on, by the time I finished I would have 650 pages instead of the 144 for which I have been contracted.It's odd to think I may have a 650 page non-fiction book in me. Writing my master's thesis was an excruciatingly painful process and I thought I would never write non-fiction again. But whether or not I have it in me, there is a definite question as to whether there would be a demand for it, and no question at all that my current publisher would not be interested in it for this book.So now that I have settled down a bit and ditched the paranoia, I can get on with the writing I have for the day. If only my husband had wanted to listen to me rant about this last night I might have thought of looking in other books then and saved myself the public exposure from posting this morning. But live and learn. At least I was able to work through it fairly quickly and am MUCH less worried that just because the publisher doesn't want 650 pages does not mean they want fluff. . Thank you Bill, Barbara and Jodi for commenting.This was going to be a post last night, but I left it to sleep. It has not gone away so it is the topic of the morning. I have a problem. I have finished about half of the book on kilnforming I have been contracted to write by a well-known publishing house. I am generally happy with what I have written. There is a lot of material, but I think I have organized it well and presented it in a way that will work for people coming to kilnforming from every degree of familiarity from complete neophyte to intermediate/advanced. The problem is that the feedback I got from my editor today is that I am not writing the book they want. They want me to just cover the tools and techniques necessary to make the projects in the book--and all the projects in the book are limited by kiln size--not everything I would like to share after 20 years of kilnforming. In short, they would like a pretty, fluffy little project book. Being from an academic background and infused with the sense that anything worth doing is worth doing well, I am having trouble adjusting to this... lighter... vision.One of the problems I am having is that I just don't see someone going to Barnes & Noble, seeing this book on the shelf and saying, \"Ooh, I think I'll buy this book, go spend $500 on a kiln and another $300-$400 on miscellaneous tools and learn to fuse glass!\" It seems more likely to me that the people who buy this book will have already taken a class, or have a friend who kilnforms who will share their kiln or something. Unlike mosaic work where I can go out and buy a few tools and I am ready to rock, the equipment needed for kilnforming is expensive and daunting.But the main thing going on here is ego, plain and simple. I've had a night to reflect and my backbrain has beaten my forebrain into submission and I have to admit it. When I started this process I was asked by the publisher if I wanted to include pictures of the work of other artists in the book. Heck yeah, I said. As deadlines even then were short, I approached the first 30 that I could think of. These were people I had met over the years or whose websites I had seen, and all of whose work I had admired. It was an eclectic mix, and I was not concerned with things like, did this person \"originate\" this technique, or who did they learn from, or were there other people I might be unintentionally snubbing by not asking them. All of those conditions are always going to be true in any small list. Unfortunately, my list, as they say in Mission Impossible (and how appropriate is THAT connection) got out in the open. Not too open, but open enough that there was a small bit of furor and flack in my small community. I don't know how much, but the fact that I know at all means it was not inconsiderable.So where am I going with all this history? Well it is a two-parter. First, when I approached the other artists I indicated I was writing a primer on kilnforming. I gave the size and layout guidelines. There would be a Basics section--materials, tools, techniques, work-area set-up and safety--and a Projects section with 20 projects ranging from beginner to advanced. This is all well and fine. But there is (in my mind at least) a major difference between a \"primer\" and a \"fluffy, pretty, little  project book\". What are the other artists going to think? Are they just going to be happy to have images of their work in print? Or are they going to be offended to be associated with \"fluff\"? And I hope you know what I mean by \"fluff\": It looks great, but when you really delve into it there isn't all that much of substance, and there is certainly no \"this probably will be difficult and frustrating, but persevere because it is worth the effort\". I haven't been told specifically NOT to put that kind of info in, but I feel herded in that direction.So that's the first part. The second part comes from a bit of the reaction I DID get on working with this publisher from other members of our geographically diverse, but pretty tight on-line community. (I am a member of warmglass.com. I post and read infrequently, but intensely.) Another book that came out a couple of years ago just got RIPPED on the list (and on amazon.com in the reviews section) because the title the publisher selected when they translated the work was very similar to a well-loved book written by another member of the list. It wasn't even the author's fault but she and the book just got trashed. I don't know if I am thick-skinned enough to deal with deserved literary (technical) criticism from an honest effort. If I have to write fluff...So as I write, I have someone who has already disapprovingly declined to participate in my effort virtually perched on my shoulder reading everything I type. From his whispers in my ear, I constantly check myself to make sure what I write is both complete and accurate. This kind of writing for a specific audience (notice it is NOT the publisher's target audience for the book) is keeping me honest and true and not giving me any slack for laziness, and I think it is making the book better than it otherwise would have been, better than it needs to be.And there is the crux of the matter. I am writing a book that is better than it needs to be. It is taking a huge toll on me emotionally, mentally,  and even physically. And it is not financially responsible from the publisher's point of view. They are in business. They don't care about ego. They care about sales, profits, bottom-line. They don't give a rat's ass about esoterica (which after 20 years I have a lot of). They want a book which will appeal to the great unwashed masses. They want me to be the Bob Villa of glass earnestly helping people make simple little things and feel like they are Really Fusing Glass, even if they are just using the same technique over and over again in their little 14\" kilns.So I don't know if it is good or bad that the publishers do not seem to get how truly advanced some of the projects are and how each and every one teaches a new technique. I didn't go for eye-candy. I went for by the time you have done every project in this book you will have tried most of the different kilnforming techniques (although I am light on painting so far). Is that bad? I don't know. Will it flop? I truly have no idea. Maybe I really can't present some of the higher level stuff because I won't have the space to go into all the could-go-wrongs and the what-to-do-with-the-went-wrongs.What's in other books out there on kilnforming? I honestly don't know. Sure, I have most of them (buying books is a sickness with me--I also have a lot of books on metallurgy). But I only glanced through them when I got them and that was it. By the time anything more recent than Glass Fusing Books 1-3 by Boyce Lundstrom et al came out, I was already comfortable with the hows of kilnforming and I had plenty of ideas of my own so I wasn't interested in the projects. Shar Moorman's book was interesting and had some stuff I remember wanting to try, but I was too lazy to make the conversions from Celsius to Fahrenheit (at least that's how I remember it). So should I look now? Should I try to change course and give the publisher something kinder and gentler--like fool-proof projects? Or should I just keep forging my own path, writing what I need to write, and teaching the projects that will be challenging and not always come out perfectly the first time?Whatever I decide, I have to do it now. Today is a writing day. The big one for the week. Comments really appreciated on this one."},

It was a pretty good-sized one and folding it into my current firing schedule has me firing packed loads every day through October 23. I am a bit nervous about that schedule as I have never had so little slack for such a long time. If something should go wrong with the kiln... (it has been known to happen--until I replaced the lid earlier this year the element wires would burn through about once a month and ruin a firing). While not quite at the \"borrowing trouble\" stage, I am still concerned.I also did not get nearly as far on the prep work as I wanted yesterday. It took until 6:30 just to get my fuse load for the day in. No writing at all, not much prep cutting done either. I think I am going to go down after I finish posting and get some work in before everyone else gets up. J had a nightmare and came in to sleep with us at 4:00 am. I finally gave up on trying to get back to sleep about 4:45.Finally, to completely burst my in-control-of-life bubble, the editor called me yesterday to say they really need a detailed photography shot list for the book *now*. Thinking back on the conversation, she really knew how to do it. Instead of starting with the request for the shot list immediately, she said instead that they are deciding whether to do the photo shoot up by them (they are not in Atlanta). I, of course, immediately freaked out and said there is no way I can travel right now (the photo shoot will take about a week). Just schlepping all the projects up there for one day on (Friday) October 13 for the project review meeting is going to take energy and time I can't spare. I cannot even imagine how I would do projects in various states of completion, tools... Gaaaa! I am breaking out in a rash just thinking about it.As they do not have in-house photographers, they are going to have to shop the job out and take bids so they need a detailed description for the photographer to spec out for time and cost. While this is reasonable for them, it isn't something I can really squeeze into the schedule for this week as I am already behind by five projects. But I was so rattled by the time I had unequivocally asserted that I CANNOT do the photo shoot anywhere but at my studio, that I let myself be nudged into agreeing to get out the shot list. I couldn't be nudged to be more than vague about when, but I was able to be nudged into agreement.OK, it's 5:30 am and I'm getting anxious again. Time to pay some bills and go grind circles..."},

I wrote over 3000 words yesterday, over 6000 for the week. By my reckoning, the book is about half done (whoo hoo!). It is heading towards being too long, but there are worse things--we can always cut. And my husband has provided me with a new signature for my email: \"Please don't make any loud punctuation; I am suffering post-grammatic stress syndrome\". I put it on the email I sent to my editor last night at 10:30 when I finally sent in my pages for the week. Officially, I am behind by five projects. But somehow the schedule is squishy enough that I still feel okay.I feel okay in spite of the fact that I am getting slammed with orders: Last night just before I sent off my pages I got an email from the gallery in Florida that faxed in the order Saturday night. It seems their Chicago location is also doing really well with the Morceaux de Verre work and they are going to call today to place another order for there. Yeee Yeee Yeee. I really need to get that firing schedule done first thing this morning!And now I have a tough choice again. I am scheduled to do another local art fair the weekend after next. That's three weeks before the manuscript is due and in the middle of the firing of all these orders. I have the inventory to do it as I made the inventory for Marietta which I ended up having to cancel. But do I have the time to do it? Can I afford to take two full days out of the studio and off the computer? Right now I feel like, Sure! But I worked hard all weekend this week. Saturday I was in the studio from 9-5, and Sunday I wrote from 10-10. Today is another studio day with maybe some writing thrown in to keep me in practice. It is already the edge of responsibility to cancel two weeks before the show, but waiting any longer would be really wrong. So do I pee, or do I get off the pot?Coffee is ready, the post is done, it's not even 6:30 am. Time to get that firing schedule done."},

Yesterday afternoon was exciting in so many ways.  I was instant messanging with a friend about the catalog work I am doing this winter (Art Institute and Uncommon Goods out of NYC) and I had a brain fart: what if UG is planning to use a picture of the last PopArt Paisley set I sent them for the catalog?I have always done these pieces one-of-a-kind and it's never been a problem. In point of fact, most galleries prefer it (my first order for UG was made up of unmatched sets and they were sold on-line from one photo). But now they are going to be in a catalog so I thought I would make it easy on everyone and do all of them the same--not every pieces the same, but every red piece the same as every red piece, every yellow piece the same as every yellow piece, etc. The pictures from yesterday show the first load  done this way. That's all fine and dandy, but the last set UG got  from me does *not* match all the new sets.So I called them to find out if the mismatch is a problem for them, and, oh boy yes it is! I need to overnight them a complete set today for arrival Monday so they can reshoot the photo. Of course at 4:30 yesterday afternoon when I found out the previous bit of info I only had three of the five colors of plates and the platter fused, and nothing slumped. I am up now because I quickly fused prototypes of the two remaining colors yesterday at 4:30 and just got up now to slump them so I can get them out later today. I also did a full slump load of the pieces which came out yesterday so that I have a platter and the three other plates ready to ship.At the tail end of all that excitement, the Art Institute faxed me a PO for another 50 pieces (this is on top of two more samples that they requested yesterday to evaluate for the spring catalog). I still owe them 20 from the last order. On the plus side, my order from Bullseye came at 5:15 so I have the glass to get going on those 20 (and the next 50!).Finally, just to really get my Saturday morning hopping, when I got up to slump the PopArt pieces I saw an order had come in last night via fax: The gallery I am in at Disneyworld loves the pieces they got last month and has apparently sold most of them as they re-ordered all the big ones for delivery asap! So now before I go back to bed to try to get some more sleep I need to work up an official firing schedule for all the above orders AND the four orders I already have from the July BMAC scheduled to go out between now and November 1. November 1... why does that date sound familiar? Oh yeah I HAVE A BOOK MANUSCRIPT DUE THAT DAY!Coffee? We don't need no stinkin' coffee!"},

Though I am not doing the colors as a set, I am doing the equivalent of 8 sets per fuse load. Last night I had a surprise waiting for me in the kiln when I went down after dinner to finish loading. If she comes back again today I will name her. I had to take her out of the kiln twice. I took her out and she went right back in. I guess the bright lights made for good hunting for her. She is small compared to most of the ones we are seeing around here right now. Jessie has one in her preschool class that devoured a locust the other day. Those were two big bugs. The mantis is still big. The locust is... digested.I was up till midnight last night venting the kiln. The BE opals get a weird milky white coating on the bottom from the burn-out of the organic binders in the shelf paper if you do not vent to almost 1000 degrees. Since I started firing at 10:00 pm and I ramp at 400 degrees/hour... it was a long night. I blearily got everyone out the door this morning and cleaned up all the dog poop on the driveway so the Roadway trucking guy can get my order from Bullseye down to the studio door (it used to be the garage door, but it is official now: we no longer have a garage, we have a two-room studio.A short survey of the rest of the household shows everyone to be pooped this morning. Baxter ate a little breakfast and went back into his crate for a snooze. The deerhounds (big grey rugs that they are) are zonked on the livingroom floor, the cat is curled up in the livingroom chair and the ferret is in his hammock.Gaa. It's a short day. It's Fun Friday for Jessie at the YMCA, aka cheap date night for Mom and Dad. She goes there from 5:30-9:30 and swims, does art projects, has pizza and watches a movie all for $20. We go out to dinner and maybe squeeze in a movie. Bottom line is I have a hard stop of 5:00 on work so that I can pick her up from school and get her ready to go. There's a lot to happen between now and then and I am moving sloooooooooowwwwwwwly.Today I must write until my fingers bleed and I also have another full PopArt load to get in. In a spate of early realism I am going to say that I will not get the load in and fire till tomorrow morning. I am okay on production schedule (20 Art Institute pieces to do and ship next week and the PopArt pieces don't need to ship for another week), it's the book I need to focus on."},

Unfortunately the word choice in that last sentence is indicative of the day's mood for me--everything on tap looms like a chore. Maybe I wouldn't be so melancholy if I started the day listening to the Donnas or something else perky, but I am obsessed with this cd right now. I could listen to Cloudy This Morning and Walking on Air all day. Come to think of it, I probably will.Today, today. Two shipments to go out, the first paisley (maybe I should just rename them Pop Art instead of paisley and be done with it) load to cut and fuse now that all the circles are ground (at least from the first shipment--I haven't even opened the box from the second shipment yet), and a lot of writing to do: I still have the rest of the Tools section--I figure I am about halfway through--and five projects to write up and send in this week. *sigh* And I have the energy of plankton today. There's always tomorrow. Wait a minute, tomorrow is going to be more of the same.... Oh well (or should I say \"Oh hell\"?).

Whoopsie Daisy. The order should have shipped Friday and was going to ship yesterday but when I went to pack it up I found I was short four pieces. Quickly put the load in the medium kiln and fused it yesterday before heading to ikebana. Hope to ship it this afternoon if it is cool enough. Otherwise tomorrow when I ship the order to the Art Institute. Also put one of the AI pieces in the medium kiln to repair a blip on the surface. I'll slump it late tonight so it will be ready to ship tomorrow.Down to one color of circles to grind, but another shipment just came from WaterJet Design (they do my circle cutting for me) so I have another 6,000 or so to do. *sigh* My glass order from Bullseye is scheduled to be delivered Friday so much of the day will be taken up preparing a space and then unloading it. Looks like today will be writing from Joe's, tomorrow will be mostly writing and a little studio time, Thursday will be 50/50 and Friday will be all day studio. This weekend I need to make the last of the book projects so I can write them up for next week. All in all, plugging along, boringly busy. The pic at top right is the final orchid melt that cracked.

Before then I will prepare an order to ship to a new gallery in Maryland and go to ikebana. The bulk of the day will be spent writing. I hope. Tomorrow and Wednesday are both scheduled as Joe's days--off-site writing days so I should be able to get on top of the writing due this week.

It is not only Friday, it is also the middle of September and I am tired. I am more or less on schedule, but I am tired. I flirt with the idea of hiring someone or taking on another apprentice, but it takes too much time and energy to find and train them. The irony of expanding your workforce is that you need to do it when you don't have the work to support it so you have the time do it.I got my pics back from the photographer yesterday and I am very disappointed. I have done my best piece ever (picture to be posted on 9/30) and it came out flat and a bit out of focus. The rest of the pics are also slightly out of focus and they lack tension and energy.These photos are for two competitions where all the judging is done from the slides--the judges never even see the real pieces. So if they lack energy, they get tossed. The box above is a definite entry for Niche and Corning's New Glass Review, but it will not be a book project (needs too much coldworking for a beginner). And I'm not sure which version to use--the light or the dark background. Different characteristics of the piece are highlighted depending on choice of background. The fountain (left and right) was my best hope for a Niche entry in the cast glass category, but neither of the photos do it justice. So I might scrap entering it altogether and just submit the clock below (in the clocks category).I have a beef with the Rosen Group--every year for the past the three they have changed the categories. And every year I have entered a piece into a category that ends up getting cut (the category does) for lack of entries or some other reason. If they didn't change the categories every year, maybe there would be enough entries in all of them because artists would know they would be there and could plan pieces for them! I anticipated all year having an entry in the flat glass category and they don't have it this year.I fired a new project for the book yesterday on lava cloth. It was my first time using it and I had not realized you need to pre-fire the cloth because it shrinks. Both the pieces (two parts of the project) curled up and needlepointed, and need to be redone. *sigh* Fortunately my third attempt a pocket vase (in another kiln) was successful so I can check that project off.Tonight I get a treat: Barbara Muth and her husband are coming into town again and we get to go to dinner. It is the bright shining spot that is going to get me through the day. But before that I have to get my Niche entries in and postmarked, write two more projects, and edit all five written this week before sending them in. I will also fire the lava cloth project again, the necklace project, and the first load of Art Institute pieces, thus beginning the cycle of firing a huge load every day for the rest of the month.

It is amazing I got that much done considering the rest of the day. Unfortunately I was not able to hook up with my photographer so I still don't have pics to post. Tomorrow. I started the day at the dentist. When I got back to the studio I had an email waiting from the Art Institute. They want 50 more platters as soon as possible. The catalog just came out two weeks ago and they originally ordered 70. Yeee, yeee, yeee.I don't have quite enough glass or frit to do them. I had been meaning to get another order in to Bullseye but hadn't gotten around to it yet. So I frantically put together an order and called my rep to see if she could 2-day me a 5-lb jar of one of the colors I am almost out of so I can at least get started while I wait for the bulk of the order to arrive by truck (they don't ship 113 sheets of glass and 250 lbs of frit via UPS...). I had to leave her a message and wait for her to call me back. When the phone rang a few minutes later I thought she was calling me back, but no, my day was about to get even more surreal.The caller was a woman I met at the February Buyer's Market, she's the assistant to some apparently famous chef . At least that's who I think it was as she never identified herself and I was so frazzled trying to pull together the AI order that I never got around to asking. Anyway she wanted to know if I could do *300* of the paisley sushi plates for a new restaurant the chef is opening in NYC or DC or somesuch. They want to use them as little charger plates for the opening reception... in about two weeks. I couldn't commit to schedule without planning everything out and she couldn't commit to purchase without an ok from the chef so we ended the call with no definite plan, but I have become Roy Scheider: I think we need a bigger boat.The Art Institute pieces are going to take 15 sheets of glass, 62 lbs of frit, and 6 days in the kiln (9 firings) including 3 days of 2 firings per day 12 hours apart. The first 30 of the 60 sushi sets are going to take 26 sheets of glass, 5,400 little circles, and 8 days in the kiln including 4 days of 2 firings per day 12 hours apart. The 300 new plates would take 28 sheets of glass, 7500 little circles, and 12 days in the kiln (18 firings) including 6 days of 2 firings per day 12 hours apart to do them. And of course there is nothing in that estimate about the time it takes to cut and prep the pieces for the kiln. Hours without measure there. But for what I can count, by my estimation that takes me through October 10 if I fire every day and NOTHING GOES WRONG. Hmm. That actually leaves me enough time to do the three other gallery orders I have due November 1...But then there is that pesky book. Maybe if I spend an hour in the studio in the morning before the morning blog, then I write for 8 hours, then I get J from school and do another hour in the studio, then dinner with the family and finish up with another 3 hours in the studio. That *might* be enough to get everything done... And I *might* be able to do it IF I WERE A 20 YEAR-OLD ON SPEED. There is only so much caffeine can do for you when you are 45. I find I can either do early morning or night, but not both. And in the early morning I can either work in the studio or write, but at night I can only work in the studio--I don't have enough left to string two coherent sentences together. So my candle is going to stay lit on only one end. I am just going to have to say \"sorry, no can do\". Or maybe I could hire someone..."},

Your body continually creates and stores your energy... somewhere. You have to use energy to do things. There is a spigot on the storage tank that opens to release the energy needed to power you as you do things. Sleeping takes less energy than jogging so the spigot just trickles when you are sleeping. It flows steadily when you are jogging. Anxiety attacks in the middle of the night are caused by the spigot  releasing a geyser of energy and the activity of dreaming is transformed to waking nightmare.My spigot is broken and needs a plumber. It gushed and I jittered from 6:00 am until about 4:00 pm yesterday when it gummed up (and I collapsed) and then it gushed again from 7:00-10:00. You can tell if your spigot is working  because you feel normal--just enough life force is being released to do what you need to do. If you feel like you've had a triple shot of espresso when you haven't had any caffeine at all, that's a sign your spigot is out of whack.The whole spigot metaphor leads to my state today. I barely dragged my sorry butt out of bed at 7:30, grumpily got everyone out the door for work and school, and now I need to collect myself, get the pieces in the studio finished (grinding and polishing) for the photographer at 10:00. This afternoon I need to get at least one project done (written).-------------------It's now 6:15 pm. I spent the entire day at the photographer's. Of the new orchid melt pieces three out of four have cracked--including the one I made into  a 12\" square clock for the Creative Spirit 12\" Squares show. I am convinced I am having a latent compatibility-shift problem--probably with the orange and yellow glasses. Clearly I can't have this problem in a book project so I am going to have to redo this project (again) with different colors.  I think I will do purples, teal, French vanilla and something else.---------------------Now it's 9:20. I ate dinner with my family and watched Bones (downloaded from iTunes).

So much new since yesterday, I reel.The Creative U series of six seminars on starting or promoting your own arts-based business--for which I am slated to do 1-1/2 of the seminars--has been rescheduled to run from 1/29/07 - 3/5/07 instead of starting 10/9/06 Hoo-ray. We had our meeting last night and I still have work to do on it now, but it is eased way back.This morning I got an email from one of my accounts in New York and they want 18 paisley sushi sets by 9/18 with an option on another 42 for 11/6. They have pretty serious default terms (5% deducted from invoice total for each day late shipping, nothing for me if they are late paying...) and 9/18 is a ludicrously short amount of time to give me to produce 18 sushi sets in any style. Got to crunch some more numbers this morning. On the one hand, this is the largest order I have ever had if it all goes through and after the financial loss of Marietta this past weekend I would like the boost. On the other hand, I don't want to be left holding 42 sushi sets if they decide not to confirm the order. And there is the timing issue: I have a manuscript due 11/1 and three other gallery orders to ship 11/1. Maybe if I start doing those gallery orders (which are a sure thing) now and leave the kilns open for the 42 sushi sets towards November... and then there is the photo shoot for the book.... Yeee, yeee, yeee!I also heard from my photographer this morning and he can shoot my Niche entries early next week in time to send the slides in by next Friday. Yep, I got two, maybe three pieces done. I am pretty confident I will have three by Monday in time to shoot.And then there is the book... Three projects to write-up and five to send in today, and a full fuse load scheduled in the big kiln and a small jewelry (for the book) load scheduled in the small kiln. I can't even remember what was supposed to go into the medium kiln, but I'm sure there was something. This is what I get for sleeping in till 7:00. I should have gotten up at 4:00 when I had the anxiety attack and was wide awake. I would have saved myself from the post anxiety attack nightmare and gotten more work done. Yeee, yeee, yeee!PS--And to add insult to the injury of the morning, Tivo and the satellite receiver had a tiff last night and as a result, Tivo did not record \"Bones\". Fortunately for me it will be up on iTunes very soon."},
{"title": "Hump, Hump, Hump (Day)", "date": "Wednesday, September 06, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Los Angeles skyline mug, \"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\" performed by Frank Sinatra is on iTunes, no new words (ack!). Yesterday was a production day and a crisis day.  I had to give up on two of the projects planned for the book due to technical reasons. I had hoped to include Cailleach's Cradle  as a project and just chemically etch it (the original was sandblasted) but it is just not working out. The box is also a no-go for the book. I have one in the small kiln right now and I might have solved the technical problems, but even if I have it is going to be too difficult for a fluff book.Fortunately, I am not alone. Barbara Muth stepped in with a suggestion (several good ones, actually) that led me to a new easy project and I came up with one more on my own--a checker board and pieces. I wanted to do the  checkers on one side, backgammon on the other with a raised outer edge and middle bar, but decided I was getting carried away and that one might be too difficult too.Lots of projects in kilns yesterday--worked 15 hours, most of it in the studio and Still Not Done with the Projects! All three kilns fired and only one is cool enough to open yet. That's okay as it is a Writing Day. I have five project write-ups due tomorrow. Two of them are already written (I am re-using the first two I sent in which were never actually scheduled or counted).I also re-wrote the interim schedule. I haven't heard back from the editor yet but I am expecting major flack. Two of the items on the schedule are determining the final photo count and shooting all the photos. Both of them were scheduled before the text was scheduled to be written. I really thought about it yesterday and it makes absolutely no sense to try to guess where photos are going to need to go in the basics section. I might be able to do it in a pinch in the projects (I could rough outline the steps and go from there) but I can't tell what is going to need a picture for explanation in the basics text until it is written. Whew.So that's my day. Tonight is the second organizational meeting for Creative U (I am presenting a seminar on pricing your work, marketing it and choosing a venue to sell it--galleries, wholesale shows, retail shows, etc.). It's going to be another full one."},
{"title": "Good News, Bad News", "date": "Tuesday, September 05, 2006", "text": "No coffee, no music, no new words... and I just found out that's a problem. Unlike probably everyone else in America, I wish today were Monday following a three-day weekend. I have the write-ups for five projects and ten pages of basics due the day after tomorrow, and I haven't started writing any of it. Add to that I have three firings to do today so it was slated as more of a kiln day than a computer day. (down panic attack, down. Sit, stay.)The weekend was not spent at Marietta Art in the Park. Friday on the way to pick up my hanging panels from the glass driller I almost got into a car accident from not letting an idiot cut in front of me into the left turn lane. He didn't want to wait through the long turn line during rush hour so he thought he would just cut in front of me. Annoyance trumped common sense on my part and I did not let him in even though he turned right next to me from the going straight lane. This action was really, really stupid on my part as I was driving the barely a month-old Odyssey which only has 500 miles on it. Good news, he didn't hit me. Bad news, I was such a wreck when I got home that I had a complete meltdown. At which point my spouse stepped in and suggested that maybe I had too little margin to do a three-day art fair with the accompanying set-up and breakdown. Especially since it would mean three days of no firings with a potential project review this Friday at the Publisher's.So over the weekend I re-grouped. I fired, I assembled wind chimes, I fired some more. Then yesterday I cleaned the studio. Dave and Jessie came downstairs just as I finished and Jessie exclaimed, \"Mommy, all the crap is gone!\", and it was. I finally unpacked all the boxes of stuff I have received over the past few months and put it all away. I also cleaned all the coldworking tools and their table, cleaned the frit area and the worktable. I finished by sweeping the floor and washing off the Morton cutting surfaces. I bet today's firings go much more quickly since I don't have to move a pile of stuff to use a work area and then move it again to use another work area. Let's hope so anyway as I need every minute I can scrounge today.On the good news front I have a re-do of the interim schedule to send back to the Editor. I think it will behoove me to reschedule some of the load due today to another day and the project review to next week at the earliest. There are still projects I have not done, and other projects I have done at least two different working versions of. Today should see the last of the projects into the kiln.And I am going to try one more box. Barbara, were you referring to Amy Buchwald's boxes when you mentioned the schedule Ray Ahlgren did? A couple of years ago Ron Coleman sent me instructions for his method of making boxes. I never got around to trying it out and I haven't been able to find them now (switched computers and moved email twice). If I remember correctly though he does not do the fuse in box shape, he uses powdered glass as a glue which melts and holds the pieces together at higher temps. This method would not obviate any issues with annealing however. But I have a new idea, and it may drastically shorten the firing time and produce a gorgeous box. We shall see.Now off to put pedal to metal, nose to grindstone and fingers to keyboard (interim schedule first)."},
{"title": "On Labor Day Weekend I Labor", "date": "Friday, September 01, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, \"The Way It Is\", by Bruce Hornsby on iTunes, 4695 words written for the book. Late, late, late posting this morning. But on the other hand I already have two kiln loads in (out of the five scheduled for the day). As I have to set up at 6:00 pm for the Marietta Art in the Park Festival and Jessie is home due to no school today, this is  a pretty ambitious schedule.Yesterday's firings were a mixed bag. I made \"blobs\" for the necklace project (I have changed the design again) and at the last second I decided to layer them so the square on top lined up with the square on the bottom (instead of making the two squares look more like a star with points lined up against sides) as a friend told me she always does them lined up and they come out round. I tried it that way because one down side of the star configuration is that a bit of dichro from the points comes up on the outside of the sides and that wouldn't happen with the complete overlap. However mine did not come out round. Either I didn't fire them as high as she does or I am just cursed. And I am annoyed because I used my only piece of CBS clear rainbow dichro in its entirety to make them. So I am firing them higher now hoping they will round out. If they don't I will use my only piece of CBS clear violet dichro in its entirety to make new ones (I know I am not supposed to be using my sample set).The pot melt I did to replace the one I so proudly posted the pic of earlier was too yellow-orange and boring. I had to do a replacement because the first one spontaneously cracked. Might have been a subtle compatibility shift from too long at very high temps, or it could just have been karma. In any case it is a book project that I have to redo before my project review (which could be scheduled as soon as next Friday... LOL).I am crabby, crabby, crabby today, and now I need to shift to planning art fair supplies, shopping for a few tools and materials for the book projects (pure silver wire for the necklace, fountain pump, dremel grinder for ceramics).Just got back from running all the errands and found I hadn't posted this before we left. Duh. At least this way I can add the recent bit of news. Today the Art Institute of Chicago's catalog came out and my piece is on page 5! They also used a partial picture of it on their main web page for the glass category and on every subsequent glass page. Whoo hoo!"},
{"title": "Writing, Writing, Writing", "date": "Thursday, August 31, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Austin skyline mug, \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John on iTunes, Book word count: 4533 words, 1081 of them written this morning. We must be in some kind of weird thunderstorm belt right now. Went to bed early, exhausted and was awakened at 12:30 by the deerhound, the lightning and the thunder. The lightning was really amazing. These have not been your garden variety thunderstorms for the past week or so. Thankfully Jessie slept through this one and I got back to dreamless sleep myself until 6:00 am.Yesterday's box cracked upon removal from the kiln. It is the technique and I am going to modify it a bit to see if I can come up with something faster and non-breaking. Did a slump load in the big kiln including the fountain bowl--it failed in a really weird way, the stone S-Curve piece--I should have done the curve opposite of the way I did it, and assorted pieces for Marietta which all turned out fine.I also did another pot melt in the middle kiln and it did not turn out as hoped either. I tried doing it at 1600 degrees and that was not hot enough to get all the glass to come out of the pot. I must've had some red mixed in with the orange cathedral as there is a lot of red in the piece (didn't want any). And finally either the pot wasn't high enough above the piece or the glass just flowed too slowly at the lower temp, but the design is not as spectacular as it has been on previous attempts. These pots are also only good for one melt--they crack in half around the middle when you take them out of the kiln. But I'll try again today and see what I get this time. TGIT. (If it were Friday I would have to be putting a long-firing load in for the weekend instead of getting to try this one again.)Finally I redesigned the necklace for the book and am going to fire it in the little kiln today. Got another slump load to go into the big kiln and it is a DEADLINE DAY for the book--I turn in my first writing in the basics chapter (the 4533 words or approximately 10 pages). Now off to Ikebana for a bit of break and then back into the studio."},
{"title": "Another Hump Day", "date": "Wednesday, August 30, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Denver skyline mug, \"Had Enough\" by the Who on iTunes, no updated word count, but it will happen today. The words of the day: Sleep Deprivation. Lightning storm at 2:00 am caused deerhound #2 to come up the stairs all a-twitter. By 2:30 neither of us had been able to get back to sleep so Dave got up and coded. At 2:40 J came in to join me. She had nightmares accompanied by teeth gnashing (what a creepy sound THAT is) and flailing until 4:30 or so. I managed to doze between 4:30 and 6:00 when Dave came up and spatulaed her back to bed. He then went to fill my car with gas for me (no, he doesn't usually do this--I am not that spoiled--it was a trader for my not doing it last night and delaying watching the two remaining episodes of House on our Netflix dvd). Of course I was convinced he ran out of gas and I stayed awake tensely waiting for the phone to ring until I finally broke down and called him. He was fine, almost home, and thought I was a sweet twit.What does all this have to do with glass? It is the context for the day to come. Today is primarily a writing day. It has to be. I have four more pages due tomorrow than I have written. Oops. Not a good start for the whole writing part of the book project. Yesterday and Monday I packed the big kiln to the gunwhales (I love that word. I always want to write \"gunnels\" so that it looks like it sounds) with pieces for Marietta this weekend. Last weekend I was within a hair of canceling doing Marietta, and now I am glad I did not. That which doesn't kill us makes us stronger. Sleep deprivation encourages use of cliche and metaphor. Today's writing ought to be... interesting.Overall I am still confident that I will be done with the manuscript by November 1 and no one will have to die. That confidence is especially reasonable if I make a move to take a new apprentice today. I am running a couple of pieces in to be drilled for the weekend and the man who owns the place where I have my glass drilled's wife would like to apprentice with me based on the work she has seen him drill for me. Could be cool, could be a disaster. People are so risky and messy. I try to avoid them on the whole but I might have to make an exception in this case.Today the third attempt at a box comes out of the middle kiln. I have great hopes for it and am not going to rush it in ANY way. I do not understand how they start to crack when they are still a faint bit warm but when they are cool the crack doesn't continue to run and the piece feels rock steady. Anyway, it will be a cold day in the kiln before I touch this piece (see? Another mangled cliche. Oy.)Finally I have what I consider to be the perfect piece for the Art Institute's spring offering and I am sending it off to the buyer today in response to her request for pieces. It is a new departure for me in the Morceaux de Verre style. I have done colored morceaux before, but I have always screened the colors after crushing them and used only one size of the crushed color (the large morceaux). This time I did the crush of each color separately and then used all of each color. I like the look and will be debuting the colors and the style at the Buyer's Market in Philadelphia in February. Now that's thinking ahead.(639 words in half an hour. Why can't the book flow like that?)"},

I can tell how tight my schedule is this morning as I carried the last studio garbage to the curb just in time to put it in the garbage truck myself. I hope it is the 'making it' aspect of the experience and not the hot sweaty sticky part that is the portent for the day.Trying to get over a difficult night's sleep. Got to just slog through it.

The song is completely appropriate, and the word count is better than it looks--it is exactly on target for the materials section. I will probably add more, but I can do that as I have room. Sleep, sleep should be the closing part of the first paragraph of every Glass Incarnate post. This weekend I went back to bad dreams and restless sleep. Last night I endlessly put in the same kiln load and woke certain that I had forgotten to shut both kiln lids (I left them open an inch for venting at the beginning of their firings yesterday.I am obsessed with boxes. I spent the weekend picturing all the cool boxes I want to make. The problem with boxes is that they take a minimum of three days in the kiln which limits the number I can make, and the kiln is also tied up for those three days so I can't do anything else In spite of that I am almost tempted not to put the box project in the book, instead keeping the technique all for myself. Would be more reasonable if I had a replacement project. Box test #3 went in yesterday and I am determined not to crack this one. Time to throw the fiberblanket in the kiln to help it cool evenly.This weekend is the Marietta Art in the Park festival and I am committed to doing it. It lasts all three days (Labor Day) this year. I think it was only two last year. I am freaking out about it. Not only do I not have any work for it which adds to my schedule this week, but it will also take up three days and a lot of energy just to be there all day, all weekend and do it.Today I begin writing the techniques section of the basics chapter and I begin with how to cut glass. Think it will go faster than the materials section did. Hope I have enough to say to fill the target number of pages. I still think fiction would be easier and more fun."},

Music is again \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen covered by Jeff Buckley. Word count: 2077. Again, not great but respectable. Yesterday's section was on the inclusion of metals and required a lot more research than other sections will. While I know a bit about what you can do and what you should never do, there are a lot of metals I have not experimented with and would still like to mention. I have always relied on the kindness of strangers....What's wrong with the picture above? I'll give you a hint, I was tired and didn't check all the dams before it went it and the pattern bars... oozed. It could have been worse. Interestingly, the two bars did not stick together where they touched. Somehow cool enough to flow and cool enough not to stick.Although this box did not turn out either (not fused enough and hairline cracked upon removal from the kiln) I am closer and am very optimistic about having it ready as the ultimate project for the book. My project review is scheduled for sometime around 9/8  and the box firing takes three days so I need to get another one in today. I also need to get the redo of the table in--now that I've written the section on metal inclusions I should get more predictable results on it, as well as the pocket vase, the re-fire of the mask and the S-curve platter and the garden stake.Next weekend I have the Marietta Art in the Park festival and I have No Work. Also got a commission for one or two large pieces from Taylor Kinzel yesterday. So in addition to the book projects listed above I also have retail and wholesale work to do. Going to be a full weekend. Thank heaven for Dave. He is shouldering all Sprout wrangling--at least for today--so I can work."},
{"title": "The Mathematics of Writing", "date": "Friday, August 25, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet, no music either, even though it is relatively late. New item to add to the morning roll call: 1013 words. Not a great day, but respectable and includes the physics of compatibility and coefficient of thermal expansion.So how many words are there in one of these pretty project books? The editor has given me an estimate of 400-500 words per page. The basics section is to be about 54 pages with another 84 pages of projects and 6 of miscellany. And there are at lease 20 pages that only have a photo on them. So I figure I have between 49,600 and 62,000 words to write. There are 67 days until the manuscript is due at the publisher. That means I have to write between 740 and 925 words or an average of 833 words a day. I average just shy of 600 words per post here. (At least that's what Word counted on the ten that were on the main page yesterday. I love word count!)Though the juxtaposition of those two numbers (833 and 600) should comfort me, I am realistic enough to know that I'm writing about apples and oranges. What takes no more than an hour to do here took me the best part of the day to do on the book yesterday. Here what I write is true because I say it is. In the book I am writing about external truths which are agreed-upon by the other members of the kilnforming glass community and I write with the sense that they are all looking over my shoulder ready to pounce and rip me to shreds if I get something wrong. Takes me back to writing my Master's thesis, and boy was that a painful experience. Painful enough I never wrote my dissertation.Ok, enough fear. Today I need to write a lot more than 833 words as I will not get to write much this weekend. So it's time to short myself here and get on to coffee and there."},

As you can see from the title of this post, I have 61 words written in the book. Coincidentally, it is the same number of words that are in this post so far.Now 61 words might not seem like much of an accomplishment. One might think I slept poorly or awoke stressed and anxious in the wee hours of the morn. Those who think that are clearly glass half empty people. My glass, on the other hand, is totally full. The 61 words I wrote are not just any 61 words in the book, they are the first 61 words of the book. Getting started is the hardest part. Finding your voice, setting the tone, tweaking the content; once all these things are done you are ready to rock. So I slept like a rock and woke very late--just in time to help J get ready for school and get the  spaniel to the groomer (it's his first time for a professional bath and trim since we got him--I hope he doesn't come home with a bow on his head...).And let's be fair. Yesterday I didn't sit down at the computer till after 4:00 and only got to write till 5:30. The rest of the day was spent filling all three kilns and letting them rip. Today I am writing all day.

{"title": "An Historic Day", "date": "Wednesday, August 23, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet, but I heard the beans being slain and have hope for imminent caffeine. No music either. Not a single kiln load went in yesterday (though three were scheduled) and results were mixed on the ones that came out. The table is too dark and you can't see the copper leaves and wire swirls I put in it. I am going to have to re-do it in completely clear glass. The fuse of the pieces from the screen melt for the S-curve platter has a couple of areas where the French vanilla did not flow smoothly so the surface is not all even and flat. I am nervous about fuse firing it again--the more you fire glass to fuse temps, the more you risk devitrification and stress from coefficient of expansion (COE) shifts. The mask (picture posted yesterday) has a couple of large popped air bubbles on the surface and one rising from the back which created a dimple on the front. It needs to be fused to full temp again on its front and then slumped/firepolished. The little leaves I cast to make the pieces to over the hole where the water comes out on the fountain lost more volume than I thought they would. I may need to recast some. The draping of the lace lamp did not work--it was too large and heavy and didn't fall in graceful little folds. I may try it one more time with a single thickness base, but in the meantime I fused a base and more lace to make a bowl to replace the lamp as a project.I did get the box cut and loaded to fire and that kiln will go as soon as I set-up the pattern bars (they are also all cut) and cut and set-up the supports for the fountain. Then I get to prep the new paperweight molds I bought, fill and cast them in the little kiln. Finally I will slump the birdbath, the fountain base, and the strip-piece plate (is that all?) in the big kiln.Eventually I am going to have to prep and cast the mold I made from Best Mix. But after the debacle I had over the weekend with the fiber blanket molds I made for the wall sconce and the pate de verre bowl, I am reluctant. When they say \"Don't open the kiln during firing as the burn off of the rigidizer causes acrid smoke\" they really mean it. I used my sandblast cabinet vacuum venting system to try to vent the kiln but it wasn't enough. Next big purchase: a serious vent hood over the medium kiln.Big news of the day was one of my wholesale accounts from New York calling to see if I could fill an order for 50-100 paisley sushi sets (first 30 due October 13) if they decide to feature them in their Christmas catalog. Lucky for me I have 5544 small circles winging towards me via UPS and enough glass on hand for them and the rest of my orders. Time to do them, well that's another thing. I may need to step up getting an apprentice. Other biggish news on the gallery front is that a couple of weeks ago I applied for the new American Craft Retailer's Expo (ACRE) wholesale show in Las Vegas in May. Even though I have not formally been accepted, they have asked me for hi-resolution images of my work to use in their publicity (I anticipate being accepted). That was cool. Part of the deal with doing the show is that you get a one-year membership to wholesalecrafts.com which includes a wholesale commercial website. You don't get that benefit unless you are accepted to the show, but this past weekend I got an inquiry from a gallery in Phoenix generated from the wolesalecrafts.com webpage even though I don't even have a page up yet! Turns out that the jury for the show can solicit from you before you are even accepted and that is what happened. The gallery owner saw the images and pricing of my work and sent me email. But back to today. Getting the kilns loaded is only going to take a a couple of hours and then I get to make history: today I begin to write the basics section of the book and everyday from now until November I will be writing. Enough writing about writing, it's time to write about glass. I'll let you know how that works out for me."},
{"title": "Groan", "date": "Tuesday, August 22, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the New York skyline mug, \"Looking for a U.F.O\" by Adrian Belew on iTunes. I have never heard this song before. It is from a cd Dave had when we married that I ripped to our iTunes library. Perky. Unlike me. Let's talk about yesterday before I whine about today (song is now \"Fell on Black Days\" by Soundgarden segueing into \"Don't You Feel Small\" by the Moody Blues... iTunes has a sense of irony this morning). Did *four*, count them *four* kiln loads yesterday including a combing between 9:30 and 10:00 pm with my trusty spouse and side-kick to hold open the kiln. Pic of said combed project (a mask) at right. Then the night went to hell in a hand basket.Starting about 11:30 pm with two kilns firing, the biggest thunderstorm I have ever seen came rolling through. Seraph (the female deerhound) hates thunderstorms and we decided we would try to let her sleep in the bedroom during it last night but she had no interest in sleep. After the fourth nose in my face (and the same number in Dave's) and a couple of attempts to join us in the bed (90 lbs of deerhound--not going to happen) I put her down in the studio. Then I went back to bed and watched the lightning, waiting tensely for the power to go out while Dave snored gently beside me.The big kiln will pick up where it left off due to power failure when the power comes back on. So as long as it is not out too long, the firing will be fine. The medium kiln, however (the one with the mask in it) just flashes \"error\" after a power failure. Sure enough about 12:30 the power went out for a few minutes. When it came back on I went down to the studio, comforted the woebegone deerhound and reset the kiln. The storm lasted a long time, but I finally fell into a restless sleep until 2:00 when Jessie came in with a tummy ache. She stayed, flailing around the whole time, for about a half an hour and then Dave spatulaed her back to her bed. Then at 3:30 Baxter (the cocker spaniel in his crate in the breakfast room) started whining and barking and fussing. Got up and let him out--it was still raining so he really needed to go badly. Side note--why do we always end up with dogs that hate the water?Jessie came back in from 4:30 to 5:00 (her visit coinciding with another power failure--I'm sure it wasn't her fault) and was sent back to her bead again after pulling the fine little hairs at the nape of my neck. It was an accident, but a very painful one that I was uninterested in chancing repeating. She came back for the third time at 6:30 and the night was declared officially over. I am still not awake and look to remain sluggish for the day, but the sun is shining, and the whining is done. Now on to the conundrum.This is a picture of the necklace I have fused for the book. Dave is over the moon over this piece and doesn't want me to do anything more to it. I think it needs a little something more to give it the final polish. It will be wirewrapped with either gold or silver wire and hung from a gold or silver chain. I had planned to paint squiggly lines of either gold or platinum across the surface of the pieces, but Dave is right--there is no undo function on such an action and I could ruin it. Finished dimension are 4\" X 2-1/2\". Any suggestions?This morning--maybe in the next half hour so I had better finish up and get dressed--another artist with whom I did a trade will be dropping by to pick up her piece. It is a 24\" X 16\" hanging panel in Morceaux de Verre \"Ocean\". It turned out really well and I am thinking of adding it to my catalog.And speaking of catalog, the rep from the Art Institute wrote last week inquiring about new work for their spring web assortment. Dave suggested the necklace, I would like to offer the fountain but it is too much work. I'll see how the screen melt piece turned out today (an S-curve platter from pieces of the original melt) and  maybe I'll be able to work a new series around it. And now off to work--the box, the pattern bars for the mirror, the support posts for the fountain, a bunch of pieces to slump and some paperweights to cast today. All three kilns going again. I hope they fire on more cylinders than I am."},

Already have a lampshade draping in the medium kiln and have three more firings planned for the day. Got to miss Ikebana today due to the early drape--have to watch it fall and turn it off at just the right time.Had a long talk with the Publisher Friday. They sent me an interim schedule on Wednesday that had me turning in 54 pages today and then 15-20 a week through September. I sent them back my revision on Thursday which had the 15-20 a week starting to come in after the first of September and the 54 being done after that. Friday at 5:00 pm after an hour of discussion (\"no, I really can't do that now/have that done by then\" being my main contributions) I was given a list of very reasonable reasons why I need to turn in at least some of the non-project writing asap. I agreed with them and so I am reworking my pass at an interim schedule and sending it back in this morning. I also re-wrote the first two projects based on their edits and am sending them back.As I prepare to set off into the prose (as opposed to step-by-step instructional) parts of the book, I spent the weekend alternating between abject terror and lambent complacency (we're all going to die! I can do it!) and am now numbly docile (or is it docilely numb?). I still have a lot of firing to do this week as I wrestle the last of the projects into submission, or they me. And somehow, some way I have to work in preparing and teaching 1-1/2 sessions of a course on starting your own arts/crafts business as part of the first Creative U this October/November at Creative Spirit Gallery. Oh yes, and four more gallery orders to get out between now and November 1 and an art fair to do Labor Day weekend... And I thought I could get a piece submitted for the Niche awards and Corning's New Glass review this year!"},

Decided to switch the order of my day today so I hit the studio at 6:00 am and had two more pieces in the kiln before 7:00 am. There are currently six projects in there to fuse with another one to two to be squeezed in.Right now I am posting and waiting on hold for Apple. I finally got a live body after 10 minutes, answered a couple of questions and was put right back in the queue and told another 15 minutes... I begin to not like Apple. First the hard drive failed after 20 days in the iMac, now the battery has completely died in the 8-week old MacBook Pro. I wish I had a phone headset as I am getting a crick in my neck.Got email from the publisher yesterday. They would like the basics chapter of the book (the first 54 pages and the toughest part to write) by Monday. I had to regretfully, respectfully, adamantly decline as I am as far as the outline on it. I am good, but not *that* good. The rest of the schedule looked do-able though it still made me hyperventilate a bit when I read it. Mostly I think that's because seeing in writing the amount of time I have left to do everything is, well, scary as hell!Ok, phone call done--Apple is sending me a new battery--so it is time to get back to work. I will finally ship the orders to the two galleries today--had to wait on four more paisley pieces which I thought I had and didn't (doh!), and I will finish the table and garden stake designs. I might also begin entering project notes and specifications into the computer. Stranded in the South tomorrow."},

I am truly spoiled. No music. I woke at 3:00 and then again at 5:00 and then again at 5:30 and then I dozed on and off till 7:15 when I actually got up. It was light and I felt like I slept in. After the hour-long, full-blown, shaking, internally-screaming panic attack I had between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm yesterday, I figured I needed it. There was a trigger but no real cause for the attack, but it wiped me out completely. I will be glad to be done with this book.Yesterday morning after posting I went to pack up my orders to ship them and found four pieces that I was not comfortable sending. I ended up grinding down the edges on three, fixing the surface of one of them and one other and refiring all four in two separate kilns (the big one to slump temp and the middle one to fuse temp). So nothing got shipped and two unplanned loads got fired before we left for Joe's. I painted and fired the platinum luster on two of the necklaces when we got home last evening and I do not know if I am satisfied with the way they turned out--I may have covered too much of the surface.Coffee in the Austin skyline mug (at last!). I feel it course through my veins (I decided to attach an iv direct from the mug this morning to get quickest results). Today could be a very interesting day. After six weeks of no communication from the senior editor on the book there was a message on the machine yesterday asking me to call her. I have been working for the past six weeks, but I fear not so much on things that will interest her.She would like lists of photos and illustrations and word counts and page counts for each section. I understand these needs, but I haven't been able to fulfill them before hammering out the exact details for all the projects--how do I know what techniques need to be covered in basics before knowing which ones are going to be covered in techniques. And how do I know they are going to be covered in techniques (or at all) without validating them? And truth be told, I am still not done with the hammering yet. Even now I might switch out the garden stake project for a mask. I am not happy with the stake hardware--visible, useless holes in the sides, and no way of attaching the glass other than siliconing it in. I just changed the lamp back into a bowl. I can't make the sides steep enough in the size the publisher dictated--under 14\"--to do a lampshade. And the final size on the table is still TBD. I have to decide if I like the new stand I just got from Hoy's--16\" and mission style, but it looked a bit flimsy when I opened the box.--or if I want to stay with the one-piece stand from the mosaic store which is only 12\" and needs painting.I would've liked till next week to finish making everything before talking about it and presenting the projects to the publisher, but you can't always get what you want. I am also still stinging a bit from having the barrette project cancelled by them back in June because \"barrettes are dated\".  When I said I was willing to listen to suggestions I did not mean that I was willing to let them decide what I should make and in what colors. Recommendation, yes. But if you want to tell me what to do and how to do it, you can damn well do it yourself. And we're to the nut of the issue: it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.So today I ship the orders, take the car in for service, find out why a gallery I just loaded with consignment work is closing one of their locations and didn't tell me while I was there, tweak my documentation of the book and projects, and call the editor, all before 1:00 pm. After 1:00 I hope to fire a lot of glass but am resigned to a bunch more writing about writing."},
{"title": "Soon to be Live From Joe's", "date": "Wednesday, August 16, 2006", "text": "No coffee, no music. It's Wednesday, it will be live from Joe's in a few hours. In the meantime I have the order for two galleries to sign (I engrave my signature on all my work), pack, invoice and ship. Out of the four firings I had scheduled for yesterday I did two--the slumps of the gallery pieces in the medium kiln. However it is not the case that I did nothing on the book projects. I am still slogging through loading the big kiln with the eight projects listed yesterday and when it is full, I will turn it on. For a brief moment last night I thought about taking the two hours tonight while Dave is at a cooking class learning to make espumas (foams) and working in the studio, but I am a Mommy and that is just not going to work: Child to feed, cuddle, bathe, read stories to and get to bed.I woke this morning from dreams of Christmas. What does it say that my dreams every night (well, for the past two nights) are now propelling me past the time when the book is due to the publisher? Am I subconsciously trying to escape the pressures of the me in the now? If so, why am I dreaming of other stressful times? Have I forgotten what life without stress is like? Sure, dreaming of Christmas sounds good, but I was running around a big warehouse building with the associate director of J's school assessing which fluorescent lightbulbs needed to be changed while figures from ancient pagan winter solstice rituals cavorted and drank in the falling artificial snow inside the building. Who were they? How should I know. Ask Neil Gaiman. I got it all from primal memory or reading too much weird fiction.And not to be a whiner, but it is still dark! Bill said something yesterday about it worsening for the next four months and then getting better. What I am worried about is what it's going to be like when we do the whole \"falling back\" thing in October. On October 29 it is going to either be a lot darker when I struggle from bed at 5:30, or I am not going to be able to get up at all. It is almost 6:30 right now and I am looking out the window and it is really, really dark! There is only a faint lightening of the sky and I can now make out the neighbor's shed in the next yard which I was unable to do an hour ago. OK, maybe worrying about how dark it is going to be in two months (three days before the book is due to the publisher) is a bit whacked, but it fits with the overall futuristic stress of the day.At least I found 6\" metal rings for the windchime supports yesterday. I was thinking about having part of the project be the construction of glass rings from which to hang the chimes, but this is a beginner project after all. I also thought about offering making the glass ring as an optional design in the project, but it would probably require too many instructions to be able to layout well. Not like the paisley clock where I can offer using squares instead of circles in the design if you want an easier project.I picked up several hanging panels and the fountain plates yesterday from Dixie Glasshoppers where I have them drilled, and I may also have picked up a new apprentice--just in time to grind the tabs off the 5544 circles I am having waterjet cut for paislies. My former apprentice Maggy was only with me a short time before she moved back to Michigan. She is here visiting now but soon to depart again, and my Mom is tired of doing shows with me so I really should be looking for someone else to step in on a regular basis. It might even be a good idea to have an assistant for this winter's One of a Kind Show in Chicago in December. I was toying yesterday with increasing my booth size--people actually couldn't get in last year because it was too full and writing up orders myself I lost a few because I couldn't write up fast enough.Wow. Yet another problem IN THE FUTURE. Yesterday I couldn't focus on anything, today I don't seem to be able to focus on anything immediate. Time to go pack up glass. In keeping with the futuristic theme of the morning I am not going to get paid for this work for 60 days. The other side of that coin says that's just in time to use the payment as a return of the advance to write the book. But as we are not going to go to the place where the book is not finished on time (and we are being very careful here not to go there), we are certainly not going to go to the place where it is not finished at all.PS--The spellchecker for blogger thought \"lightbulbs\" should be \"lustfully\", but that would've been a whole 'nother dream."},

It's dark this morning, darker than it is supposed to be at 6:00 am and the dogs are all grumbly at being woken. I can sympathize as I am grumbly at being awake. But anxiety and schedule leave me no choice so here I am. Here Dave is too. Misery loves company. (It's so dark!) We sit on the couch in the dark with our laptops--isn't it cool that the keys on a Mac Powerbook is automatically backlit in low-light conditions?It is not just my writing that is all over the place this morning. Since yesterday I have been as flitty as a damsel fly when it comes to getting on task. It has taken me 36 minutes to get this far in this post. At this rate I will never have the book in to the publisher in 2 months and 17 days. Zip, zero, zilch, nada done on it yesterday except spending more money ordering more things for it (a lamp base).(Sound of a loud slap) Pull yourself together, man! And yet I don't seem to be able to, I continue to wander hither and yon. The magic beans are ready (all but the last two cups which require the extra double-push of the button). My first choice of mug was the New York Skyline, but it had dishwasher schmutz in it. My second choice was Denver, but it, too, had dishwasher schmutz in it. What the hell! The third time *was* a charm and Los Angeles was clean and is now filled with redolent beans--coffee and vanilla. OK, I cheat. The vanilla comes from the French Vanilla Coffee Mate I mix with the low fat Coffee Mate and no actual vanilla beans died to make it.It's almost 7:00. Posting time is over and I have to go clean off my desk. I missed paying my Siyeh Studio visa bill last month as I am pretty sure it is still in the envelope, unopened on my desk. Whoopsie daisy. On tap for the rest of this fine, no-longer-dark day? A run to a new (for me) retail glass supplier to buy yet more glass for book projects. I have succumbed to using System 96 for a couple of the book projects with the advent of the new Spirit and Opal Art glasses. Then I hope to get my energy and focus back with kiln loads in all three kilns of predominantly book projects: platinum lustre firing on the necklace in the little kiln, the last slump of pieces for the gallery order which ships tomorrow in the medium kiln, and the wind chimes, the fountain bowl, the garden stake, the hanging panel firing #2, the bird bath, the S-Curve platter, the lace for the lamp--which may turn into a bowl, and the pocket vase in the big kiln. Lions and tigers and bears oh my!"},
{"title": "The Antipenultimate Week in August Begins", "date": "Monday, August 14, 2006", "text": "There is no coffee yet, but I just heard the sweet, sweet sound of grinding beans so I do not have long to wait. The music of the morning is the sound of spaniel slurping water and munching chow. Baxter is a noisy eater.The weekend was good. I worked in the studio all day Saturday except for a brief hiatus to see a matinee of Superman with Dave and J. Sunday I didn't do anything Siyeh-Studio-related until 9:00 pm when I worked out my firing schedule for the week. Instead, I posted on Stranded in the South (and I have decided to post there regularly on Saturday and Sunday as I have begun to chafe at the self-imposed rule of posting here only Mon-Fri). Oh yes, and Dave and I girded our loins donned mosquito repellent and eye protection and tried to rid the backyard of long grass and weeds. Dave did get the lawn cut, I was unsuccessful in the attack on the weeds: first the weed whacker ran out of nylon whacking line, then a gallon of Round-Up was not enough to cover everything I had been unable to cut. This problem is going to have to wait for another week.Saturday I fired the clock and the base for the lace lamp (ala Cailleach's Cradle) and cast a glow-in-the-dark starfish and a tropical fish in the commercial casting molds I bought. I haven't done the curing fire for the mold I made from Best Mix so I haven't cast in it yet. Though I was pleasantly surprised with the way the surface texture on it turned out. I had been concerned about big floaty chunks in the mix interfering with the detail of the cast object. But when I unmolded the butterfly I cast, the surface was perfect. In the places where the Best Mix had been against glass (the base) it was a smooth and shiny as the glass itself--the smaller particles in the mix filled in around the larger chunks for a perfectly detailed finish. There might be a few tiny air-bubbles, but that would be my fault as I didn't have a vibrating plate to jiggle the bubbles out as the mix set.But enough on past accomplishments. Can't rest on my laurels, I have other glass to fry. Ikebana starts up again today after a month off for me, and is going to take a two-hour chunk out of a very full day. I have to cut, grind and slump all (prep all, slump most of) the pieces I fused last week for the two gallery orders scheduled to ship Wednesday. I am ready to paint the platinum design on the necklace and fire it, and I *still* have the table and the garden stake to design.One sad casualty of the weekend was the box I cast. I am just too damn impatient. When I took it out of the kiln I started cold-working it immediately. Yeah it was room temperature (more or less) and I used hot water to wash it and on the lap grinder, but that wasn't enough and I cracked it. I probably wouldn't have been able to use it anyway--I lost 50% of the volume so it was a pretty short box and the coloration was not so hot as I had had an accident while filling the mold and ended up with the colors way more mixed than I planned (and maybe a bit of kiln wash in it too). But I am undaunted and have another attempt to try later this week. The good news is that my engineering theory worked and the shape held perfectly and I was able to unmold it easily. Whoo hoo! But I may tweak my annealing schedule just a bit in case the cracking was caused by residual stress in the glass and not just impatience."},

Naw, (she slumps back onto the couch) I am too lazy to be an addict. One of the casualties of the switch from Windows to Mac is the loss of access to the Glass Eye software, a design program targeted for stained glass artists but which I have found very useful when doing detailed geometric designs for fusing. Lucky for me I have found an almost adequate replacement: Microsoft Excel. You can size the cells to be little squares, shape them into larger squares or rectangles and fill them with color. Pretty nifty. Last night I decided to be anal and actually design the layout for the pattern bars instead of letting it fall to random chance. The screen shots of the Excel designs are shown at right.Yesterday's wild, exciting ride got even wilder and more exciting about 11:00 when I heard back from the gallery whose order at the BMAC was a third of my show total. They had already ordered for two of their locations--Disney World and Chinatown in Chicago--and yesterday they added another 13 pieces to the Disney World order and asked that *everything* ship ASAP. My carefully wrought schedule went the way of the dodo, and I scrambled till 6:00 to get the big kiln as loaded as it would go. No progress was made on any of the book projects (except for the pattern bar designs which I finished last night at 10:30 while IMing with Bill who did not believe I was still working...).I smell coffee, it is going to be in the Denver skyline mug today. I hope he made a lot as besides needing to completely fill all three kilns today--gallery orders in the big one, book projects in the middle one and I have to pre-fire the casting mold I made in the little one--I also need to run a bunch of pieces to Dixie Glasshoppers to be drilled. The 24 X 16 hanging panel in Ocean that I did as a trade with another artist is STUNNING. I need to add it to my regular repertoire. And the two plates for the fountain are ready as are the two 16 X 24 Cosmos panels I fired yesterday. Well, they'll be ready as soon as they are cooled. And I have one last run to make to pick up a bunch of Paisley pieces from Taylor Kinzel to ship to Florida. This is known as robbing Peter to pay Paul. But when Peter does consignment and Paul pays cash....I do not like being so over-extended that I keep having to pick up work from one of my consignment galleries in order to have enough pieces to do shows or ship orders. I just re-stocked Taylor Kinzel from my depredations pre Austin Fine Arts Festival (TAFAF is now taking apps for next year's show and I am not even tempted--got a wedding there in June, that's enough for me) and now I have to pull eight pieces today so I can fill the Florida order. The problem there is that the pieces they added yesterday are all Paisley pieces and I do not have enough circles cut to make them all.On tap for fun today: pattern bars and the first box casting I have done--and I'm using completely my own method... I am excited and nervous all at the same time. First dates will do that to you."},

Some days it's just too hot and they hang around the bottom of the pond and pant, oh wait, that's the dogs, or me. August is not a good month to have major production deadlines. August is not a good month for anything but lounging on a beach with a bunch of trashy books and sipping frozen concoctions. I want that life and someday I am going to have it. August is definitely not a month to be trying to fly from London to the US. Poor travelers.Yesterday was full (thank you Ren for your sympathy and good wishes) and I, of course, did not get everything that was scheduled done. So today's list is longer and tomorrow's will doubtless be the longest yet. But I did not get as old as I am without having learned a few things along the way and I didn't schedule anything for Saturday or Sunday. So I will get caught up over the weekend and be back to a normally insane schedule Monday.Today I must, must MUST get the table designed and cut. Today is also the day I am supposed to do the pattern bars for the wall mirror, the cast box and the mold-cast butterfly. I don't think the butterfly mold is dry yet so I am going to use a pre-made mold and do a starfish or fish. I might even do it in the cool glow-in-the-dark frit I bought. It is supposedly compatible with Bullseye glass. Glow-in-the-dark frit, do we live in a great country or what?Tomorrow is supposed to be the pate de verre bowl, but I am pretty sure the rigidized fiberblanket mold I made for it is not dry either so that one will probably also wait till next week. Slip sliding away--that's August and my schedule. I am just going to keep having beach dreams and slogging through it. But Next Year, next year there will be a beach for me."},
{"title": "Life is Full of Weird Sh*t", "date": "Wednesday, August 09, 2006", "text": "No coffee, no music, let's not even go there. I woke suddenly at 5:45 with the thought that I have three versions of the necklace for the book fused and I *could* do the surface decoration firing today and still have time to do the finishing silver work, photograph it and send it in to the eMerge competition. They are the only pieces I have even close to appropriate and finished. I spent the next 45 minutes lying in bed and working out the details, nevermind that spending the entire day chasing this wild hare would completely derail the project schedule that took so much effort to hammer into shape.There's an expression for you, \"chasing a wild hare\". I have never seen it written, and in my mind right up to this minute I have always had it as \"chasing a wild hair\". But I realized as I started to type it that it made no sense to chase a wild hair and that the correct word was probably hare. There you go.And there is a problem beyond mucking with my carefully wrought schedule--I am not a jewelry artist and do not wish to become known as one. Even if I should happen to win (let's pick ourselves up off the floor from the laughing now), the work would not be representative of my work--back to yesterday's post--and furthermore, it wouldn't be representative of work I would like to do. So what's the point?All kinds of things sound 'really' in the pre-dawn morning. They can be either really good or really bad, it doesn't so much matter which. All that matters is that they are really and not just a little. Now that I am awake what sounds really good is coffee. And lucky me, there is a full thermos from yesterday that I did not drink as we went to Joe's. Off to the microwave...It's a morning for odd discoveries. I just found my threshold for feeling obligated to microwave old versus make new. Our coffee maker has an idiosyncrasy where it often shuts off before all the water has passed through. Sometimes it leaves just a little in the reservoir, sometimes--like yesterday--it leaves two cups. When you only make six cups, a loss of two cups is a lot. It's 33% to be precise. And here is the weird thing: I cannot throw out six cups of coffee just because it is old because it is a full pot. But a partial pot... that I can throw. And when I went to the coffeemaker just now and discovered that it still had two cups of water in the reservoir, well it was a no-brainer to throw it all rather than push the button and wait for the last two cups to come through. Here's the weird part (there's more?) the amount of coffee used was the same no matter how much water went through, and it is the coffee waste (expense) that should count. Whatever. The fresh, new coffee is ready.Enough about me, let's talk about glass. I spent hours yesterday working on the application for the new American Craft Retailers Expo (ACRE) in Vegas next May. They are doing an on-line application process and let's just say it's not Zapplication. Today I really need to Back To Work. Tomorrow is the Deep Fuse day. Every project for the book which is really thick and therefore needs a loooong firing schedule is going to be done together tomorrow. It will be interesting, and I hope I have thought the ramifications through thoroughly. One of those projects is a one-piece cast box and I really can't wait to see how it turns out. Now that would have been a good entry for eMerge. But there's always next time.Last night I used the Best Mix for the first time and made the mold around the butterfly that I am going to cast this week. That is one project that may have to wait and be fired on its own instead of in the deep fuse as I don't think the mold will be dry in time. Initial thoughts on Best Mix: It is very sharply chunky and I am concerned that the size of the materials in it are going to interfere with the detail of the object being cast. We shall see. I also have a bag of 50/50 (hydrocal and silica flour) that I bought from Phil Teefy's Rainbow Glass works years (and years) ago and I should be able to use it to whump up a new mold if the Best Mix doesn't work out. That is, I will be able to use it if it is still good. I tend to buy things in expectation of the time I will need them with no or at best the most casual disregard for shelf life. When I was making the rigidized fiber blanket molds last week I found a bag of moist pack (fiber blanket with the rigidizer already applied) from 2001 on the shelf. I know that it probably is no longer any good, but of course I still didn't throw it out.Today, thanks to my sojourn at Joe's yesterday, is really, really full. Three pieces still to design, three pieces to cut, one piece to tack fuse, the ACRE app to finish, and the jewelry piece to get done, photographed and in to eMerge. Just kidding on the last one."},

The satellite radio isn't working so there is no music. Yup, it's Tuesday and I am at Joe's. This Joe's Day is going to be different from the normal Joe's Day as I brought my large sketch pad and sketching tools (compass, rule, pencil, eraser, etc.) and my plate glass modeling clay working surface, extra modeling clay, dental picks and other tools and butterfly-model-in-progress.Before we left I loaded the medium kiln and started the final draped vase project. When I get home today I will cast it in Best Mix. With luck, the mold will be dry and ready to use Thursday and I will make a butterfly paperweight (of course it's another project for the book).This morning I was dismayed to discover that I either lost a large section of my firing log to a file overwrite (saving the wrong version in a merge) or I just didn't bother to log several crucial firings. Whatever the cause, I do not have my schedules for the pot melt, the original drape, and who knows what else.In spite of that, the schedule I used yesterday for the screen melt (pics posted here) worked really well. I lowered my top temp yet again to good result. Detail is shown above right, full front and full back follow. The most striking thing about the back is how clean it is--by not going so high I did not get so much kiln wash sticking to it. I am going to try another pot melt with this new even lower schedule to see what I get. I am betting on more defined areas of color as it will not flow so fast at the lower temp. And I bet I can keep reds from turning brown by not going as high. We shall see.Because of the book I am pushing the boundaries of \"my work\". I brought the screen melt piece upstairs to show Dave this morning and he said, \"That's not you, it's nice but it doesn't look like your work.\" This always seems to be the time of the year I try to expand my scope--though usually it is to a much lesser degree as the cause is a perceived need of work not my own or better than my own to enter into one competition or another. Usually the boundaries get pushed right back into shape at the end of the experiment by the pressures of production work for one gallery or show or another.And there is a vast difference between my production work and work that would be taken seriously in Bullseye's eMerge (deadline tomorrow--I haven't even done a piece for it this year, much less had it photographed) or Corning's New Glass Review (deadline October 1) or even the Rosen Niche Awards (deadline September 5). I expect to make the Niche deadline and even have time to throw my money away on the postage for the New Glass Review (that is the real brass ring), but I am not too sad about missing eMerge this year.Of course there is also a difference in the work I am doing for the projects for this book--aimed at beginners--and the work I would need to do for a competition. But it is the playing with new techniques and no boundaries which is inspiring me right now. I dreamed of a series of boxes last night before I went to bed and am eager to try them out. Fortunately for me, that dream might actually get followed as the jumping off point for it is one of the projects for the book. Memento mori boxes. Ossuary boxes.

The deerhounds are not allowed upstairs. Jester wouldn't come up anyway as he will not walk on the hardwood floors so the hardwood stairs would be just beyond him. Seraph is not allowed up as I do not like a cold deerhound nose shoved in my face when I am sound asleep. Of course deerhounds also do not understand prohibitions so there is a baby gate at the top of the stairs which is kept closed to enforce the rule. The upshot is that Seraph comes to the top of the stairs and wags her tail. If you have never seen a deerhound tail you are probably unaware that it is a mighty weapon. The Scots of old used to take out swathes of British soldiers by sending the deerhounds (the royal dog of Scotland) cavorting through them tails a wagging. So Seraph stands at the top of the stairs and slams her tail against the wall till I get up to let her out. This would be an okay thing if she really wanted out. But as soon as I have struggled into my jammies and blearily stumbled down the stairs (often literally), she goes right back and lays down on the living room rug. I, of course, have none of that and drag her 90 lb carcass over and heave it out the door. I am just a wee bit grumpy this morning.The weekend was productive. I finished the wind chime, necklace and window panel designs for the book and experimented with different ways of ornamenting the surface of the necklace with silver (paint, leaf and mica in suspension). I also tried the fountain with irid glass and used a soup can for a slumping mold for the wind chime support bars. Yet even with all this progress and adherence to a well-defined schedule, I am still not confident in the final product. This is either a flaw in my character, or I am right and there is really something to worry about. Unfortunately I won't know which until the projects are done and turned in to the publisher for final review. I have the singular inability to reliably judge my own work.On tap for today? Model a bas-relief fish in clay and cast it, crush the glass for the birdbath, and do a screen melt for the S-curve platter. I also need to design the table, garden stake and clock. Best get to it!"},
{"title": "Brains, Chemicals, and the Internet", "date": "Friday, August 04, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Washington D.C. skyline mug. It has fireworks on it and anyone who got through yesterday deserves fireworks today. Yesterday was one of the worst days I have had in a long, long time--a statement which leads inexorably into a philosophical discussion of just how bad could it have been as I still have all my limbs, my life, my friends, family and security. That is a discussion for Stranded in the South, but frankly I don't have time to be posting hither and yon right now--one a day is all I can manage--so it is going to have to shoe-horned in here. Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead.Every minute of every day someone is being horribly (by definition) tortured, mutilated, maimed raped and/or killed by someone else on the planet. So how can I even begin to whine about what a lousy day I had yesterday and expect any recognition or sympathy--even from myself? How can I be completely shattered by the one damn thing after another day I had in comparison to what the people living in Israel and Lebanon are going through?Then there is a friend who just spent weeks in the hospital and went through extreme abdominal surgery with pain and tubes and drainage bags... blech. Surely my little trials of dog poop in the car, kilns running at 750 degrees all night, cupcake delivery scheduling woes and web site design companies who take six months after promising three weeks and then don't deliver the crucial piece (password protection) at the end should be taken in stride with the phrase \"Thank God this is the worst of my trials\" reverberating in my head.The words I am looking for here are context and spectrum or range. Our brains like to feel needed. They have a whole bunch of chemicals that they dole out to us to make us feel happy, sad, enraged, suicidal, ecstatic, you name it. They do not take into account anything outside of their own context which is the daily life of the bodies they inhabit and direct. Brains also do not all work together with some of them sending out sorrow chemicals, and some of them sending out joy chemicals based on the comparative life circumstances of their bodies. Each brain pretty much ignores the others and convinces that brain's owner that the only circumstances that count are the ones the owner is personally experiencing.Not only that, but just because things aren't bad doesn't mean the brain won't make you think they are. If everyday is the same--and pretty good so you should be pretty happy--the brain either gets tired of the same old same old or just runs out of the chemicals for joy and so decides to shake things up a bit and send out the chemicals for extreme depression. Maybe it figures we need to experience a constantly shifting range of emotion. And maybe it's just some brains that are like that. Brains like mine. Rationalization? Pathetic excuse? I don't think so.Yesterday did have a bright spot. While I was making my delivery to Creative Spirit I saw an ornament dangling from the mirror in the bathroom. It was a little fairy sitting on a crescent moon with the quote on it  \"Tell me, what is it You plan to do with your one wild & precious life?\". The words resonated in my bruised soul so I asked Becky where she got it and she said down the street at So Rare, a little vintage garden furnishings/antique store in Decatur. When I had to run back to the studio (for the second time) to get the stands I forgot to bring for my delivery I drove past So Rare so I stopped in and bought one for a pick-me-up.This morning I did a web search for a picture to post here and I found so much more that all of my synapses fired at once and are now shorted out for the day. Bruce Sterling (and my husband) can eloquently yet concisely verbalize the explosion that happens in your head when something gets shoved in your face that, in the context of your own life, shows you how much your life and your connection to the world has changed because of the internet. Alas, I can see and feel the idea in my head, but I lack the verbal skills to describe it.Suffice it to say that from my little seach for an image I found first a place to buy the ornaments on-line (and bought five cards with the Precious Life ornament on them to send to friends) complete with a bio and personal information on the Portland Oregon artist Laini Taylor who made them. Then I found her blog. Then I looked up the originator of the quote, Mary Oliver and the poem it comes from, \"The Summer Day\".So what was one little spot of inspiration yesterday now has a rich context full of details on the lives of two more American women artists, all thanks to the internet. And for the first part? I am going to go back to influencing my brain's choice of chemicals with caffeine and alcohol and Just. Get. Over it!"},

I might as well give up on the idea of actually listening to music as I post anymore. It's too early and the J is still sleeping. The J sleeping makes a nice change--for the past two nights she has either been hell to get to sleep (midnight Tuesday) or playing musical beds all night (last night). I'm afraid I finally got a bit cranky and told her to stay in her own bed at 2:30 when she came in after I had just fallen back to sleep after the last move back to her own bed at 1:30.And it's Thursday. This is the worst day of the week for me. Many people hate Monday because they have to go back to work after a weekend of sleeping in, relaxing and doing fun social things. Me, I hate Thursday most (sorry Boomtown Rats). Thursday is the day all the weird non-glass-producing chores get stuck. Today I blog, then I invoice the Art Institute and write the production schedule for the book projects at 7:00 (oops, late already), clean for the cleaning women at 8:00, pick up and deliver cupcakes for J's school at 9:00, get my legs waxed at 10:00 (don't go there), deliver to the gallery next door to the leg wax place at 11:30, and have a training call for the ecommerce catalog on my website at 1:00. That means I get to start firing 2:00. And sometime in there I have to shower, dress and brush my teeth.Thursday is also the day of reckoning for the week. Monday is full-sail optimism on projected productivity, Tuesday the world is still your oyster and even Everest isn't too high. Wednesday you think you can still make it if you really push. But by Thursday it's clear that even if you work all weekend you are going to slip. Again. I hate Thursday.Post script at 7:40: To add insult to idiocy, I just got around to logging yesterday's firing  (the pieces for the fountain) and I realized that I had forgotten to put in the last segment of the firing schedule. So I raced down to the studio and, sure enough, the kiln was off and holding at 750 degrees. This is a feature not a bug, though times like this it is hard to see it that way."},

Dave has taken J to school (we are trying out a new routine) and I am getting ready to start my first day home alone in over a month. I took my Mom to the airport this morning and I already miss her. She might find this surprising as I was very crabby and snarky with her during the entirety of her stay. And as she came out here solely to help me with the BMAC show, how ungrateful is that? I'm sorry Mom. I should rename my blog Snarky Dork. No wait, that name is taken already. I'm sure I deserve it more, but life is sometimes unfair.Enough wallowing, time to work. The heat and the aftermath of the BMAC (for those who went) are affecting everyone I know. We took Mom to the aquarium yesterday and between the heat and the crush of people, I have made a vow not to leave the house till September. The dog days of summer are here and I am going to focus on conserving energy and morale and slogging through the projects for the book.Speaking of projects: in honor of the heat, today's project is the fountain. I have been refining the design for the past few weeks and I think I have finally arrived at one that will be spectacular. I might have post-worthy photos tomorrow. Now, off to work!"},

As usual, the List (of things to do) fluctuated up and down over the weekend with no real down. In spite of the fact that I didn't clear any more major to-do's, I was completely busy all weekend. Go figure. Today, the final day of the month, I take to get organized (again). How much time is spent getting organized and ready to do things and how much is spent actually doing them?August is the home stretch for the projects part of the book. All projects must be completed and in photographable format by September 1. August 1 is also the postmark date for all the artists who are submitting images of their work for the gallery section. And I'm sure it will come as no surprise to anyone, the outline for the book with the photo and illustration count is still not done! Yet I am not concerned that the book will not be written on time. The two projects I already wrote up showed me that the writing (for me anyway) is the least of it.I have taken the first hour of the day to wake up, read email, write this post, and do a little home finance. The second hour will be spent on the firing schedule for orders and book projects and on creating an Other Tasks schedule to get me through more of the essentials on the To Do list. We'll see if that keeps me on track for August. No, wait. It seems a crime to waste the pristine hours of the day--before 8 am when Jessie gets up, reality sets in and the relentless sameness of every day begins--on regular tasks of the day. Instead, a pure hour on the outline. Good idea."},
{"title": "Another Day, Another (Identity) Crisis", "date": "Friday, July 28, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet, no music either--no wait, an ambulance just went by and all the dogs are howling. Since two of them are in the house and one is on the back deck I am getting a full stereo experience. The deerhounds are meant to howl--they are hounds, after all. But have you ever heard a cocker spaniel howl? It's a treat.Yesterday was extremely productive. There is something powerful about the intense focus you get working in a completely neutral environment. Now if I can be half as productive today on the outline I will have it done! But I am back to being a single proprietor again today: got to pick up the piece I inadvertently dropped off at a gallery on Wednesday, need to make up and ship a catalog to a gallery in New Mexico (they saw me at the Buyer's Market and are interested in carrying my work), need to invoice the Art Institute and a commission client, have an order to ship, a piece to fuse for Jeffrey for a sculpture which sold at the Buyer's Market show (to one of the galleries which carries my work), need to write up the firing schedule, follow up on a ship-date for an order and THEN I can work on the book. At least I got my last webpage designed and sent off to the webdesign company.Final news of the morning, I just got email from an artist I asked to participate in the gallery section of the book. He has been working with glass since the mid-seventies, fusing since the early eighties, was one of the original instructors at Bullseye Glass, and has work all over the world including the Corning Museum of Glass. He also has a book coming out in October on Fused Glass Art and Techniques. My first reaction when I read the email was, \"Wow do I feel stupid and I might as well roll up the sidewalk on my little writing project right now.\" I moved onto a more gracious acceptance of my place in the world with the thought that there is room in the space for my crappy little project book too. I have yet to rise much above that thought despite the umbrage that my spouse took to my choice of adjectives when I voiced my feelings to him.Why is it so hard for some people--and I am in that group--to steadily and assuredly believe in themselves and the worth of their work? Why is our immediate response to circumstances like the one described above to be threatened or diminished? My work has never been taken to SOFA. I do not have a piece in the Corning Museum of Glass. I have not had a show at Bullseye--I have not even been a finalist in e-merge. I have not had a piece in the Pilchuck auction (of course on that one I cannot really whine as I have not submitted one for consideration). All of these things are success markers in my field. Okay, I was a NICHE finalist the year before last so my professional life is not completely barren of kudos. And being recognized by NICHE was satisfying for, oh, a nanosecond until I started anxting about something I WASN'T getting. And that's the point.Satisfaction and comfort in oneself do not come from external sources. How many thin women do you know who obsess about their weight and will never see themselves as thin or be happy as they are? What about women of my age who can't see past the newly arrived grey hair, sagging breasts, and wrinkles to the beauty that comes with age, wisdom and confidence? What those of us who tried to hang onto 20 as we marched past 30 and now cling to 30 as we slide towards 50 have never been able to maintain is our self-confidence. I am now mostly over any obsession I might have had with external beauty. Weight is another issue, but I am good with it as I am really quite heavy and physically uncomfortable in my body because of it. Moving right along...My issues now center on professional competitiveness and recognition. If I were a  novelist, I would work towards being Stephen King--New York Times Bestseller, and want to be Michener, Hemingway or Faulkner--Pulitzer. Can it be that I still haven't decided what I want to be when I grow up? Or is it that I just want it all--a financially successful production glass studio with work appealing to and within reach of Everyman and the recognition of my peers, curators and Serious Collectors as a True Artiste? I am having deja vu all over again--this must be a cyclical theme for me. I wish I could just break the cycle, hear the click of who I am snapping together with who I think I am and who I would like to be so I could quit wasting time and emotional energy on a conciliation that isn't happening! (You cannot reconcile that which has never been together in the first place.)I am still frustrated but feel a little better knowing it's Just Me and now I have to get on with all the (no longer crappy) little details of owning a business on a busy Friday. And there is a place for my little craft how-to book. It will be pretty. It will be a bit fluffy (that due to the publisher rather than me--it is what I have been contracted to do). And it will be helpful, inspirational and valuable to some people. And that's really all you can ask as there are no Pulitzers for glass books and they never end up on the best seller lists, even if they're about or by Chihuly."},

Finally got back from Philly last night at 6:00. Construction, accidents and torrential turned it into a 15 hour journey. It was livened at 10:00 pm in the middle of Washington D.C. (why the gps sent me through Washington rather than around it I have no idea) when I realized that although the gas gauge said the tank was half full, I had gone 428 miles on that tank... The Odyssey does not get mileage that good. Clearly when I hit the tire in the middle of the road on the drive up it messed something up. Or it was coincidence. Regardless of the cause, it was late at night and I was somewhere in Washington D.C. desperately needing gas. The gps took me off the freeway and to a gas station, but it couldn't vouch for the neighborhood and I was plenty nervous. All ended well (we did not get mugged, raped or murdered) even though we did pay $3.59 a gallon for gas in the middle of Washington D.C., and we spent the night at Quantico.When all is said and done it was a good show. I took orders from five new clients and two current clients--with one of the currents from Florida also taking a full order for their Chicago store. Guess that means I got six new clients including my first one in the city of Chicago proper (hence the Chicago Skyline mug--I'm celebrating). That repeat order also came 20 minutes after the show closed in the midst of packing and accounted for 30% of my sales so I really ended on a high. Delivery dates are spaced out from now till November and only the last order is really big.Now it is 8:00 am and I still have not decided how the day will play out. I will unload the van and I will enter my last order into the computer and send off the confirmation email. But will I begin to fire pieces, or deliver new and replacement work to my local galleries, or will I spend the entire day on the computer working on web pages and outline? Just thinking of making a list (it is not a coincidence that list is a four-letter word) of everything I have to do is making my head hurt. I am thrilled to be home, but I am physically exhausted. Maybe it is my exhaustion which is making me more flexible than usual, but I am going to run Dave to the train station now, and I am still in my jammies--a black velour/velvet sheath. I am not even going to switch the coffee to a go-mug--I am just going to head out with the ceramic skyline mug._____________________________Back from the train, dressed, back from taking the J to school (couldn't pull that one off in the jammies without worrying about social workers showing up at the door), mail sorted and opened. The day is still amorphous, and I am not going to stress it. I will make the infamous task list, and I then I will get to what I get to.

Day two of the BMAC is done and there has been much grumbling among the artists about the paucity of buyers and orders. I can't complain. While I have only taken six relatively small orders, five of them are from new galleries/stores (new accounts for me). So I have some work, but not enough to overwhelm me as I go into the home stretch on the book, and I get to add new cities and states to my Locations page on my website.And speaking of the website, I got the spreadsheet  catalog of all my products created for the ecommerce portion of my website. All I have left is producing and uploading actual images of the pieces. That will be a big task, but at least I have some of it done. I also worked on the tiny detail outline for the book. The first outline was the broad brush strokes, do-you-want-to-give-me-a-contract outline. Then after the contract was signed I did the here-are-all-the-topics outline. Now I have to do the how-many-pages-photos-illustrations-per-item outline. It almost feels like writing the book without actually writing the book. So how many pages should I have on types of glasscutters?But now I am snoozy, and it is time to collapse into my eyelids.

I am downsizing on the materials I hand out. I have killed enough trees, and I am not getting a good return on them. This year the packet will just have a price list, a basic order packages list for each product line, a postcard for visuals and a business card for contact info (and the booth number, of course).I'm sure the biggest question on everyone's lips is, did I forget anything? The answer: you bet your sweet bippy! Dave ran a box to FedEx for me this afternoon with all the samples of the Architectural Industrial glasses. Hey, I had to forget something for Bill. And the internet cable got lost along the way even though it never got used--but that doesn't really count.Now it's time to head across the street to chili's for another dinner of Boneless Shanghai Wings and the Triple Play appetizer shared with my Mom.

Though I did not post over the weekend I fired three full slump loads a day Friday, Saturday and Sunday (one in Bertha and two in Bella). Today and tomorrow are light days with only one load per kiln per day scheduled. Tomorrow is also the departure day for the Buyer's Market (BMAC) so the loads going in are for a gallery order scheduled to ship the day after we get back and the next project in the book--the final pattern bars for the mirror frame. They take a long cycle so I am glad they will be cooling while I am not here.I got all the new pieces fired for the BMAC too, all the ones I was able to schedule anyway. With 115 going out to galleries tomorrow and the day after I get back, space has been a bit tight. Luckily, Becky at Creative Spirit Gallery in Decatur does not mind (too much) when I have to come in and clean her out so that I have enough work for a show. She will get it all back this time as it is a wholesale orders show so I probably won't have any sales. I might have a piece or two fewer as occasionally another artist will ask if you \"sell your samples\" and I usually do. It's pretty flattering when someone else in your field likes your work enough to buy it--even wholesale.Also over the weekend I got to meet Barbara Muth in person--a glass artist I virtually met through this blog. I hooked her up with my photographer (Bart Kasten of Bart's Art) and he is going to shoot some of her work for her. Between her work and a weekend review of an English translation of an old German glass techniques book by Bettina Eberle, I am inspired to try a new series of work of opal and cathedral glass work with precious metal paints and partial sandblast finishing. When I will get to it is another matter--unless I make it a project for the book.Over the weekend I had a major shift in design for a couple of projects for the book. If I hadn't been so far behind on getting materials to the publisher, it would probably be a problem. But I have (still) not got the final flushed out list with full descriptions and sketches to them so I am probably ok. As soon as I get back from the BMAC my #1 priority has got to be to get all the finished projects done so I can't change my mind anymore. While I am in Philadelphia I hope to get a lot of book and web work done, though I am probably fooling myself. Even though all you do is sit around all day at the show with short adrenaline bursts as you take orders, you are still tired at night. At least we are staying at the Marriott and at most, just have to walk across the connecting bridge to our rooms. I am glad I made that splurge and used my points--one less stress point/effort.So today I finish up, pack up and prepare to head out tomorrow morning. Got to remember to transfer my Audible audio book from the computer to the iPod. And a list, I need to make my list."},

I created a new color series yesterday and am excited about the diversity it brings to the Morceaux de verre styles. I call it \"forest\" and it is juniper spruce tint, pale grey, dark green, silver aventurine and teal. It is a good color coming into the winter season (in July! You gotta love retail.) and should also sell well in the colder northern markets.So it's Friday, but I will be working all weekend getting ready for the BMAC, finishing up the website as much as I can and getting the outline of the book done for the editor. Time is shushing by. Remarkably, I am not stressed. We are into the che sera, sera pre-show phase. It is now down to number of hours before departure and finite number of pieces which can be fired. I have made my peace with not having as much as I would have liked and being happy that I have some new things.One of the new things I am going to have (after I make it between now and Monday) is a display for samples of all the AI patterns (the photo above right is of a couple of AI platters stacked). At last summer's show where I debuted this series, I naively thought that store owners would be content to leave the pattern selection to me and would just say \"mostly organic\" or \"mostly geometric\" or \"your best sellers\". But I guess it is the nature of a small business owner who does his own buying to be a bit of a control freak and want to pick all his own so this year I will make it easy. I will have a good photo of all the patterns to take away for remote ordering, a samples display where tiles can be moved around and grouped for ordering at the show, and a few recommended basic order groupings written up.That last one, the basic order recommendation write-ups, was a suggestion from Mike Shapiro, owner of Shapiro's at Bay Walk at the February show. And rather than do a big catalog this year and waste lots of paper, toner, electricity, and time (let's not forget time), I am going to scale down my handouts and do something simple. Of course I won't be creating these sales and marketing materials until I get to Philadelphia. I won't even be buying the supplies till there. Hope set-up goes well so I have time.And speaking of Philadelphia, for the first time I wasn't able to get a decently priced room on priceline.com. Either it has become the most popular way for cheap artist and store owners to get rooms, or Phillie has a lot of stuff going on next week/weekend. The official rate on the Marriott (attached to the Convention Center where the BMAC takes place) is $312 a night. Like I going to pay that! So after almost 10 years of hoarding them, I used (all) my Marriott rewards points to stay there from Tuesday through Sunday. 80,000 points. Whew!The final news of the day is happy news: Barbara Muth, artiste de verre extraordinaire from Washington DC is coming out for the weekend with her husband. I am so psyched! I might actually get to play a bit! Or we'll just eat and drink a lot. Also a Fine Thing."},

On the plus side, I just looked out the window and the fireflies are still out. A nice sight though not one I am used to seeing when I awake. The pictures scattered throughout this post are from the artist I did collaborative work with for the BMAC a couple of weeks ago. It's my glass and his metal. The glass sizes range from 8\" X 12\" to 12\" X 20\". I can't wait to see them in person at the show next week.The studio this week is a symphony where I am the conductor and all the musicians. I play madly knowing that if I stop, something dark will eat my soul... Well, it's not as bad as all that, but it is pretty hectic. The first fuse load (of two) for the BMAC goes in today along with the last of the Art Institute pieces. The AI seems a bit anxious about their order so I am going to ship it next Tuesday before leaving for the BMAC rather than the following Tuesday when I return.Yesterday with great help from my mother (who fed the postcards into the laser printer so the backs could be printed and who put all the address labels on them) I got 500+ postcards ready to mail this morning for the BMAC. That was more than I planned to send, but the list I used looked pretty good (all the nominees for NICHE magazine top retailer awards this year). For the February show I mailed postcards to the top 100 retailers of 2005 and I got at least three new galleries for my troubles.Also yesterday, as I was putting the finishing touches to the Locations page on my website, I found that one of the people who bought my work at the February show sells the work he buys on eBay. I can't even say I am ambivalent about it; I think it sucks. I do not sell my work on eBay and I don't really want to see work that I thought was ending up at a gallery in Las Vegas show up there. I just shipped his order last week so it has not shown up on either his website or his eBay page, but it is just a matter of time. I have him bookmarked on eBay so that whenever he adds new items, I will get notified. And I will be mentioning this to the Rosen Group when I go out next week. Will I be selling to him again? Nope. Will he come off my website and mailing list? Yepper.I close with a note on the book. I sent two chapters (for two projects) last week. I got them back edited and the comment from the editor was \"fabulous\" and she went on to make a change on every single line of the instructions. Oh this is going to be fun."},

I will not be selling retail on my site, but what I will do is allow the galleries and shops which carry my work to have see the current catalog and order from it on-line.

Having Gramma come is more of a reason to get up early than Christmas morning.My posts are all about sleep these days. Another night when I did not get to bed till after midnight and I am still  awake at 5:00 and up at 6:00. When I look back on writing this book I will remember these as the days of no sleep--I got more and better sleep after Jessie was born . I debated getting up this morning or trying to go back to sleep (the word \"sleep\" alone or encased in another word has appeared six times so far in this post) and ultimately decided that I will write the majority of the day today and that should earn me the reward of sleeping in tomorrow.Kiln work is going really well. The Art Institute pieces are turning out beautifully (30 complete, another 23 fused to slump, and 22 cut and ready to fuse today and tomorrow), technically some of the best work I have done and with magnificent coloring. The production schedule is the one sacrosanct constant in my days. I don't know what I would do without Excel.But the rest of my deliverables are... Where am I going? What is this handbasket? My webdesigner actually called to find out when I was going to get something to him yesterday. Now I am the bottleneck to completion.

It is the final week before the Buyer's Market of American Craft in Philadelphia, and I have the Art Institute order and another order to finish for shipping by the 25th--the day after I get back from the BMAC. Things are actually tight enough that I might have to ask Dave to slump a couple of loads for me while I am gone. And of course there is the website to finish, the postcards for the BMAC to get out (today), and deliverables for the book--more writing about writing the book (more outline and project stuff) and continuing to make the projects.Friday I started a post at the usual time, but then I got sidetracked doing more sys admin work on the computers. Even after an entire weekend spent on the process, I have still not got the new Macs completely configured (syncing and migrating, syncing and migrating), or the printer or the scanner set up. And I am not going to be able to migrate completely from Windows to Mac as I have indispensable software which either does not exist for the Mac (Dragonfly's Glass Eye stained glass design program) or which I already bought for the Windows machine and do not wish to have to buy again for the Macs (Dreamweaver, Quickbooks). I would do without the design program but I find it very useful when I do commissions. Those wacky clients, they actually want to see what you are going to do for them before you do it, and we have not progressed technologically to the point where I can just give them a peek into my brain. The old solution to making Mac and Windows play nice together would have been get PC Anywhere software and run it, but it does not run on the new Intel-based Macs so I have to use Bootcamp and set up a dual boot machine with two full operating systems. Oh joy. Haven't done that since I had to have a a Windows NT server and a Win 98 personal computer on the same laptop. It wasn't fun then either.Over the weekend I also got an offer of help on the book from another artist who I have asked to participate in the gallery. We have never met or corresponded outside the context of his participation in the book and recently he stumbled upon this blog and got a glimpse into the miasma of stress and anxiety surrounding the process of writing the book. I was simultaneously thrilled by his offer (I really really, really like his work and he is also a good writer--he has a series of clear, concise, detailed tutorials for esoteric kilnforming techniques on his website), and dismayed that he may have made it because of a negative impression of my capability gained from this blog.  The blog is both a blessing and a sword of Damocles: Writing it centers and organizes me--and chronicles this journey in case I might feel like downplaying its difficulty later, but it *is* public and people who I might want/need to see me in a completely professional light get to see my knickers, my warts, and who knows what else! I could make it private, or just keep a regular diary in Word, but if I am honest, much of the stimulation of writing here is knowing that anyone could read it and being honest (in a very mature, adult version of the word) and letting it all hang out anyway. Next topic.My Mom comes today from Montana. She is going to drive to Philadelphia with me and help me at the BMAC. This will be her third BMAC--she has done the past two winter shows with me--and I do not know how I would do it without her. My erstwhile apprentice, Maggy stopped by Friday and we played a bit in the kiln. Didn't do anything to further the book projects, but made some cool squigglies which I will use in a piece later. I was trying to show her how to weave and got the fiber paper strips to slump over both to thin and too close together. We ended up with clear glass almost round 1/4\" strips with tight 1/4\" curves. My daughter thinks they look like cool swizzle sticks. She isn't even 5 yet, how does she know about swizzle sticks?"},

So I had to futz around finding the seller's email and letting her know it was broken. I could go on for another paragraph about how late I now am for a packed day, but why bother? Same sh*t, different day. At least today I started with a shower, brushing and flossing my teeth and getting dressed. Better able to face the disasters that way.The pic at right is the second load (first full load) of pieces for the Art Institute in Chicago pre-fire yesterday--15 15 X 7 platters.

But firing will come after feeding CW (he gets his own entry and photos in Stranded in the South soon), taking J to school, going to ikebana class and lunch with another artist friend. I need to squeeze in some time for my erstwhile apprentice Maggy today or tomorrow, and the electrician comes to put the ceiling fans up on the porch this afternoon.

I did write the first beginner project. It is smooth, complete and concise at 435 words (target is 400-500). Now I need to whip up the intermediate project and finish the projects spreadsheet. I can't believe the spreadsheet is taking so long. No matter how much I tweak it and diddle with it, it is still not done. I also have to do two sketches of planned pieces so the publisher can get a better idea what I am proposing, and to design a complex necklace--the little fused necklace and earrings I initially proposed are too \"simple\". It is a beginner book, but I guess I am supposed to be taking projects no beginner would ever do on his own (either because of lack of technical knowledge or lack of design skills), and holding his hand through doing them. It feels a bit like cheating.Finally I have my July firing schedule to write up and two kiln loads to do (one galleries and BMAC and one a project). It is now 6:00 am, better get to it!"},

This piece is the basis for one of the book projects and I am so psyched!Every melt I have done so far has been by someone else's schedule and with a standard unmodified pot. But yesterday I just said what the hell, I don't care if it fails. Better to fail on my own than to succeed on someone else. And it worked! Best melt I have done so far  in terms of glass flow, color preservation and kiln wash adherence.The final project review with the editor yesterday went equally well. It was again two hours long, but we got a lot of things cleared up and I made myself comfortable saying \"No\", \"I don't know, I'll have to get back to you on that\" and \"I'm not prepared to make that decision right now\". All are phrases which have historically caused me great anxiety.So I ride the high of self-assertion and firing success to another day in the studio.

The main collection is now complete with the acquisition of the Denver Skyline mug this week. What to collect next?Started the post and then got J off to school (field trip to Stone Mountain today) and Dave off to the train station (he forgot he drove to work yesterday and took the train home... oops). Summer hours start at Turner today so he gets off at 3:00. I want some summer hours. Me, I finish this post and prepare for yet another  telephone project meeting with my interim editor. I have high hopes that it will be short, maybe sweet, and I can Get On With It! We have so far talked for three hours this week and are still not done.Woke up exhausted this morning again (big surprise) and didn't get up till 7:30. The good news is that I have regained my equilibrium. As a very good friend and another glass (bead) artist said to me yesterday just before my second project interview, it is very hard to have a professional discussion with someone with whom you have such a gross disparity of power in the relationship.I think the main reason I felt so bad at the end of Wednesday (and into yesterday) is that I did not feel on an even footing with the editor: the book contract leaves me with absolutely no power in making decisions about content. I am not used to be in a position where I do not have at least an equal amount if not the majority of the power. It has been years since I have been in that kind of professional relationship.And I am only in one now if I believe I am. Nothing and no one is making me write this book except me. I can walk away at any time, and if I am made uncomfortable by the way it is being handled and it does not meet my professional expectations, I will cut them a check (for the portion of the advance I have already received and spent) and walk away. And I am sure I won't be the first.So I am at peace and ready for this morning's final discussion. I still have an obscene amount of work to do between now and Tuesday night, but now I am looking forward to much of it. Yesterday after posting I found some great flower pots at the hardware store for pot melts. They not only have holes in the bottom center, they also have several large rectangular slits around the bottom edge. This design opens up all kinds of possibilities for the flow of glass. I hope I get to try one this weekend (for a book project, of course).Then at the day spa where I get my legs waxed I saw the perfect fountain design to do in glass. The one I saw was stone, and it will be stunning (and relatively easy) to do in glass and will give me a chance to do tinting with Bullseye powders and clear frit. I badly want to do it this weekend too, but it will tie up the medium kiln for too long (there is a stack block component that, like the pattern bars, takes two days to fire and cool). Now I just need to find a small light to put in it...The long weekend begins. If the house is a rockin', baby, don't bother knockin'."},

I knew writing a book would be a difficult project and I would need to learn and stretch and grow a lot to succeed at it. Though I have sometimes wondered if I wanted to do it, I have only  doubted that I could do it a couple of times and both of them were after talking to the publisher. One of those times is now.I am struggling. After being left to twiddle my thumbs and get on as best I could with the projects  for a couple of weeks, I had a two hour project review by phone with my interim editor yesterday and came out of it with an incredible to-do list due next Wednesday (after the upcoming four-day weekend for everyone NOT writing this book). I also have the strong feeling that I cannot do what they want in it: chic, current, beautiful, professional work that a beginner hobbyist can do with a small kiln. What I do not have is any end in sight for the materials I need to be creating to get an actual sign-off on the projects list. A lot of the work I have to do this weekend is writing more documents to show them what the projects are and how to do them without actually showing or doing them. And sketching. they want me to sketch the projects.While I appreciate that they have a review process, I am not happy with the way their requirements of me keep growing, they take their sweet time getting back to me about them, and my final deadline never moves. I tried to gently introduce the subject of their diddling and my deadlines into the conversation yesterday and the response was defensively frosty (frostily defensive?) so I just dropped it. Getting into an acrimonious debate over anything at this stage does not seem a wise idea. Wise might be to see this as a sign to gracefully withdraw from the project entirely and reclaim my life before it is too late.Add to all the above that I am tired to my marrow and, Houston, we have a problem. I did unpack the Bullseye order and the van yesterday, but I did not fire anything in either kiln. Today is packed to the gunwhales with outside the studio stuff till 1:30 when I get to have the rest of my project review meeting (oh goody).

Someone accidentally used my email address to set up her health insurance and now I am getting all kinds of email for her. The latest was a copy of the application including the last four digits of her SSN, date of birth, checking routing #, last four digits of the checking account, full name and address... if I were into identity theft, this would be a great start!I got a very late start today (I slept in till 7:30) after a very early scare. I woke with a start from a sound sleep at 3:00 to the realization that I had left the kiln lid vented open for the entire firing--not just to 1000 degrees. This did not bode well for the current loftspace occupants of the garage, or the firing for that matter.Earlier this spring a couple of happy little yellow striped songbirds decided that the plastic grocery bag full of used fiber blanket hanging on the corner of a shelving unit in the back of the garage would be an excellent site in which to build a nest. By the time I found it, they had already nested, so to speak. So instead of getting to close the garage door every night now that it is all cleaned out and an official part of the studio, I am still having to leave the door open all the time so the new parents can forage. I also get scolded if I stand in front of the kiln too long prohibiting them from getting food back to the nest as fast as they would like. Fortunately the vented heat and fumes from the kiln do not seem to be bothering them and they survived the night's heat.I cannot say the same for the firing. Some days it does not pay to get out of bed. I didn't get the dinnerware into the load yesterday, but the four paisley plates going to the gallery in Vegas were in it along with the coasters for the 3-4 year olds class at J's school. Even though the kiln lid was closed when I raced down to check on it at 3:00, everything had still way overfired. The coasters will probably be salvageable, but the four gallery plates are not. I will have to redo them today in the with the first Art Institute or BMAC pieces. I just haven't had the energy to get a firing schedule done and stick to it for either the production work or the book project work. Regardless, both kilns need to fire today (I get to take the pattern bars out this afternoon when they are finally cool enough. I could be going with 100% failure today!).More on the coasters: As with the first set I did, I took pictures of all of them on a piece of paper with the artist's name underneath for later identification and assignment. As it turns out, I took the pictures but my camera did not. It skipped about 50% randomly--probably due to a dead battery. So not only are they overfired, I have absolutely no idea whose is whose for half of them.Today I also need to brave the heat and unload the Bullseye order which arrived late yesterday, and to (finally) unload the van with everything from the show at Creative Spirit over a week ago). With temps in the 80's and 90's here for the past week I have lacked the motivation to unload in the afternoon and the mornings have been taken up with other things.At 3:00 I have a phone meeting with my interim editor and I should probably prep for an hour or so for that. I begin to regret not getting up at 6:00 this morning. Heck, I begin to regret getting up at all."},

Two birds, one stone: I get to see how the paints fire (they are tapped for a book project) and I make Jessie's former teachers happy (J was in their class for two years and I never did an art project with them).But that happy activity comes after I write an email to my interim editor. I still await my assigned editor and an interim schedule. At this rate all interim will be over before I get the schedule. I am also going to get the slideshow working on the homepage of my website (all this before breakfast!).

I tried to get back to sleep till 5:30 then gave up in disgust and got up. Since then I have been futzing around trying to figure out iPhoto so I could get this picture up.I tried another combing this weekend with obviously mixed results. Some people say that they never get big bubbles from their mulite shelves. I do with every piece except strip-pieced work unless I follow one rule: never go up faster than 400 degrees/hour above 1250 degrees. In strip pieced work--like the last combing I did--the strips of glass are placed on their sides leaving a surface area only 1/8\" wide for each piece of glass. The air has plenty of room to escape this way. For the firing yesterday I went up at 600 degrees per hour and had three large bubbles by 1569 degrees.Since the piece was already ruined, I decided to trying combing there. The glass wasn't soft enough and the top center dragged down into the piece. Then I decided to really have some fun and do a little temperature experimentation along the way. I went up to 1600 degrees for the next pass. It is possible to comb there, but there is a chance of deforming the shape of the piece and you only get one pass before you have to heat the glass up again. At 1600 degrees I also had a lot more bubbles. Typically I use 1/8\" fiber paper on the shelves in this kiln to avoid bubbles, but that would not work with combing as there is too much risk of pulling the fiber paper into the glass.I combed left, right, up and down intentionally dragging and deforming the glass. The result at the end of the day is that I find 1650 degrees an optimal comb temperature. And I didn't even almost set my combing stick on fire this time!Now I am going to sort through my massive Siyeh Studio To Do folder and pay all the bills. While I am in bill-paying mode I will also do the household bills. Then it will be time to get the Sprout up and off to school and go into the studio for the rest of the day. I cleaned it yesterday for the first time this year. I still can't see the top of the desk or one work cabinet--and forget the shelving unit that holds chemicals, tools and hardware--but the floor is swept and the only things on it really belong there."},

Too much to do and too little time is becoming the motto of life (and Bruce Springsteen's \"Prove It All Night\" sliding into the play slot on iTunes seems to bear this feeling out).Got a call yesterday from a metal artist I met at the BMAC in February. He liked my work and we talked about doing some collaborative pieces and him teaching me to weld when we were in CA in March. I was unable to get to his studio to learn to weld on that trip and we kind of drifted on with other things. Well he is getting ready for the July BMAC now too and he would like to do three pieces for it with my glass incorporated into them. When he proposed this to me yesterday I said \"Sure!\" (\"Slide\" by the Goo Goo Dolls just started on iTunes... the iMac appears to be strongly empathetic to my blogging this am).This morning I take the finished coasters to J's school and help the kids put the little rubber feet on them and sign them so they can take them home today. I still need to go to the hardware store to buy the little rubber feet.The exposition services and exhibitor forms for BMAC are all due today. I haven't even figured out what my display is going to look like yet.I spent three hours last night trying to get my arms and head around the details and schedule for the projects in the book. I was unsuccessful and gave up in exhaustion at 11:00. So today I have to figure out what I can fire that might keep me from backsliding (this is just scary: \"Crossfire\" by Stevie Ray Vaughn on iTunes). Never mind following a schedule that has me getting everything done before August or even getting ahead... I don't think there is anything I can do that is going to keep me from slipping more. Oh and the sacred weekends? The ones that are supposed to be set aside for sanity and family? (\"Badlands\" by Bruce Springsteen just started) They no longer exist. There is no day that will not be spent in the studio, on the road, or at BMAC for the next month +. July might as well not exist for me.It would be really nice if this were just overwrought prose from an overtired artist, but Excel does not lie: the spreadsheet has decreed that the number of firings to do + the number of firings per day + the amount of prep + the hair ripped out in the process = EVERYDAY and slippage anyway. Of course the publisher still hasn't called to set up interim schedules and at this rate there won't BE any interim schedules just, it's due tomorrow, is it done?I end with a deep breath and \"Right Now\" by Van Halen (and goosebumps. Quentin Tarentino could not have matched a better soundtrack to this posting). When I got to bed last night and shared my fears with Dave his sleepy response was \"It'll all work out.\" And he's right, it will. It has to."},
{"title": "Trust Yourself", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet--I have got to start remembering to set it up at night before I go to bed. No music either--Dave and Jessie both still slumber peacefully. I started my morning with the peaceful activity of fiddling with the pond fountain to make it spit more muddy water (I don't think it is ever going to clear) and feeding the fish. Just knowing that they are all still alive is very comforting.At right is the result of yesterday's combing. The colors are Egyptian blue and French vanilla (blue? it looks black! well, now it is black...). I am reminded of a valuable lesson that I had thought long ago learned: do not take the easy way out and follow someone else's directions over your own instincts. For whatever reason, most of the glass community likes to kilnform their glass at very high temps. I don't. I never fuse at the common 1500 degrees--1465 in one kiln and 1440 in the other for full fuse.Yesterday when I decided to comb for the first time in many, many years, I looked in my kilnforming library for a recommended schedule instead of going back through my firing logs. Logs for the past few years are on the computer and, until my time got consumed with blogging, writing and gallery popularity, I was slowly working my way back through the paper logs and getting them online for easier searching. The library was more easily searched.The first schedule I found called for a fuse temp of 1700 degrees--100 degrees higher than I had set the kiln to go. I went with my instincts and programmed the kiln for a soak at 1600, at which point I would turn off the kiln, open it, comb, close and restart. When it was at 1535 degrees I chickened out (if it is in print, it must be true) and set it for 1700. Mistake. I might still have lost the firing, but the problems with it would have been  my own.Why not go to 1700 degrees? Because it is overkill. Yes, at that temp you can rake several passes before the glass cools too much and you have to re-heat it, but the rake has less drag and so moves less glass on either side of the contact point resulting in a smaller pattern. Colors in glass made for kilnforming at lower temperatures can also change--the blue I used went to black and that might be from exposure to the French vanilla, or it might be the high temp. When I do melts from a flower pot my reds always go to muddy brown at that temp. At that high temp you also run a greater risk of air bubbles. An finally, kilnwash is not as effective and you almost always have to scrape, soak and use acid products (or sandblast) to get it off.So I am going to redo this piece, and this time I will start at 1600 degrees. If that is not high enough, I will work my way incrementally up to find the lowest temp I can successfully rake at, and I will verify my belief that I will be able to do it with fewer bubbles and truer colors. I have to decide whether I also want to make wider stripes and use all transparent colors too. Maybe I'll do two sample pieces simultaneously to decide.This would be a wonderfully fun puzzle if I were not under deadline!"},

The first firing of the preschool coasters is done and they look great! This morning I am going to drop off the sample squares I made and let them layer them and talk about how the design changes depending on which one you put on top. A nice introduction to dimension and perspective that would probably be more effective if they weren't still adjusting to a new classroom and new peers. Their little brains can only handle so much new at a time.I still haven't heard from the publisher since I sent my project list in a couple of weeks ago. We were supposed to have a phone conversation, but I think I have fallen through the cracks. It is now firmly in the last half of June and I do not have a schedule of interim deadlines, a final approval of the projects, a complete outline (or the assignment to do an outline)... zip, zilch, nada.I put together a schedule for a clear-glass test firing and have been following it, but I think all it was doing was giving me a false sense of security. I know what the photographer is going to want for the book: a finished piece, one or more mid-state photos (which means one or more copies of the piece finished to that state ready to photograph), and a photograph of me doing a beginning or interim stage. Each photo will more than likely require its own version of the project.So if I really want to get this book done--and since I have not been given any direction from the publisher--today I am not only going to cut the three versions of the wall sconce and fire/comb one of them, I am also going to make a stages list for each of the other projects and begin prepping (cutting, etc.) that number of each of them. This activity will require a substantial amount of storage space, but I still have an unused wire shelving unit that I will dedicate to holding projects.Last night I decided the final colors on all but two of the projects, and I settled on a fountain design. I have had so many ideas for different kinds of glass fountains that I could probably make a book of just glass fountain projects! But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Today I will go to Home depot and buy copper tubing and something to bend and pierce it with--I hope. If not, I will have to switch designs again.I never did get to Creative Spirit to break down my show yesterday so that has to happen today too. It was 93 degrees yesterday afternoon, and I just wasn't up to it. It's supposed to be in the 90's today too. *sigh*Good thing it is the longest day of the year!"},
{"title": "Teaching!", "date": "Tuesday, June 20, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet, no music either. The rest of the household is sleeping in this morning and the only sounds are the hum of the air conditioner, the buzzing of a fly trapped in the office with me and the tapping of my keys.After I posted yesterday I took Jessie to school and was reminded that this is Art Week at Phoenix Summer Camp and I volunteered to teach the project... Whoopsie Daisy. So yesterday there were no firings. I spent the afternoon racking my brain for a fun, NEW project suitable for 19 4-6 years olds. We're going to make coasters! I cut 48 4\" clear squares and ground down all the edges and corners so nothing is sharp. I packed up jars and jars of opal frit (with over 30 jars of opal frit picked, I decided to skip transparent frit and all powders this time) and Dave went to the grocery store last night and bought Elmer's glue all and dixie cups. Today they will put the frit on the glass with glue--two pieces for two layers, one coaster each--and I will flat fuse each piece. Then tomorrow I will stack and fuse the layers (using a digital picture I will take of each child's set to tell me whose is whose, what the orientation is, and which one goes on top). Thursday they are going on a field trip to the High Museum of Art--I will not be able to accompany them, though I think I might have already volunteered. Friday I will take the finished coasters back to school and the children will put the little rubber feet on their coasters and sign their names in black sharpie on the bottom. Sharpie pen fires out so putting their names on in advance would do nothing.The afternoon was taken up with a tutorial on the \"tool\" my web design/hosting company expects me to use to maintain my website. I thought tools were supposed to be useful. It has got to be the least flexible, most cumbersome interface I have ever used. There is no proportional resize of any elements--including jpegs. There is no drag and drop. All sizing is done by typing in the height and width in pixels in for each block on the page, and if you accidentally get one too big, it breaks the look of the page. The sizes are not displayed for the elements so you can't easily tell where it's broken. All this means I am going to have to spend a lot more time and attention to update my pages--and create the ones which are still not done. At least I got the slide show working and know what was  wrong with it. Maybe I'll even have it on the real home page by the end of the week.So this morning I teach, this afternoon I break down the show I had at Creative Spirit last week, and I fuse the children's coaster tiles. I hope I also get a chance to do the combed sconce project scheduled for today. The anxiety attacks are just going to have to wait--I have no time for them today."},

I got up at 6:13 this morning to get a jump on my week and ended up puttering it all away on the little pond (The fish are alive! The fish are alive!), iTunes, email, computer syncing... I begin to think it is just not worth it to get a new computer ever. What I want is to be able to pug one computer into another and say \"duplicate all of this--documents, settings, music, pictures, whatever--just go through a check list and have it magically work. No hardware issues, no OS woes, just WORKS. My weekend was so far from that it was not funny--but I am told I will love the Mac.But today, today, what does it bring? Ikebana for me at 9:30. I am in the Research course now (ooooh). Swimming for Jessie--her summer camp class goes to the Y for swimming Monday and Wednesday mornings--so I need to braid her hair, dress her in her suit and pack clothes and a towel. Then, work for me!My new website went live Thursday night. It took three months to get it to the state it is in (notice I didn't say \"done\"), and there is no end in sight. Trust me to have picked a website design/hosting company which does not allow ftp. You have to use their little tool. I refrained (barely) from saying crappy little tool. The last thing I want to have to do now is learn yet another piece of software! I am getting REALLY TIRED OF COMPUTERS! The web developer said he could not do an image slideshow (a little flash element) for me that I would be able to manage or edit. I need to do it myself, so I did. It works fine in Dreamweaver and in a test browser on my system. As soon as I move it up to their server, it doesn't work anymore...This was not supposed to be a bitch session post. I hadn't realized I was still so frustrated by my recent tech overload. Need to think of something positive... Ah, yes, glass! I will make glass today! Two orders to start producing for the final two gallery orders pre-BMAC (Buyer's Market in Philadelphia in July). Also time to start on the Art Institute order. This week's book projects are:garden stakewall sconce2-D panel in a standwall mirrorcast paperweightOh boy. The garden stake hardware is on backorder from my distributor and I haven't been able to find one retail anywhere. This is not a project I want to drop, but I frankly don't see teaching copper tube bending and soldering. I wonder if Michaels' has anything I could use. The technique effort has ratcheted up too: the wall sconce is combed, the 2-D panel is from an aperture pour, the wall mirror is a pattern bar piece, and the paperweight will involve modeling, mold making and casting.This week the exhibition services order for the BMAC must be submitted (what kind of walls, what color carpet, poles for lights--where and how many, etc.). One might think it would be cake as this is the fourth time I have done this show. Unfortunately, all four have had different booth configurations requiring a different set-up.It's going to be a busy week. Better make a schedule and a list!"},
{"title": "Let the Projects Roll", "date": "Wednesday, June 14, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Washington DC skyline mug (it has fireworks on it--appropriate for the day) (thank you again Barbara!), \"Too Bad About Your Girl\" by the Donnas on iTunes. The drape vase at right was made from the pate de verre wafer that I made when I did the pate de verre bowl (see the picture of it flat just post-fuse in the post below, \"All in but One\"). I really like this technique! The frit I used was #1 (sugar grain), #2 (kosher salt) and #3 (rock salt) all mixed together, but when it is sprinkled onto a flat surface, the smallest grains fall to the bottom. This creates an interesting effect in terms of color and surface texture on the inside of the piece (second picture). I need to work a bit on the draping schedule for this one as the wafer is too fragile and tears apart in the middle if draped too quickly (shown but almost impossible to see in the third picture).This piece was done for fun. It won't be in the book, nor will it make it into my product line. I may, however, work on the technique and combine it with other things into a piece for Corning's New Glass Review or Bullseye's eMerge competitions this year. The only competition I entered last year was Niche, but this year--because of the amount I am having to stretch my repertoire-- I hope to have entries for all three.Second project shown is a quick pocket vase I did out of clear tekta just to test the technique and a firing schedule. It turned out pretty much as expected except for some needlepointing on the topmost edge. The finished piece inspired me enough to see the colors and pattern for it, and to work out a final project which is simple enough for a beginner, and nice enough to be something more than just a learning piece.So what to do today... first off I think I will inventory all the finished pieces I have in the studio. I have let my inventory get completely out of control since, oh, February. I have a solo trunk show Thursday night at Creative Spirit Gallery in Decatur as part of Decatur's Third Thursday Gallery Tours. I have assured Becky I have enough work, but I should inventory today just in case so I can whip up new work to fill in any gaps.I also need to get my materials orders in to Hoy's and Bullseye. On the subject of materials I found a great source for clock parts yesterday.  They have atomic clock mechanisms, reverse clocks,  cuckoo clock parts, and pendulum mechanisms. If I weren't already so over-extended I would consider making a bunch of clocks for fun and product. I did buy five mechanisms as one of the book projects is a clock.Today's book project test is the windchimes/mobile. I want to do the mobile so I think I'll ask Dave to help me with the math. In the book this project will be painted float glass but I don't have the paints or the tin scope yet so I will just use more tekta (Bullseye's machine rolled fusible clear).I will round out the day with some paperwork (mostly bills and billing) and shipping (catalog and commission)."},
{"title": "All in but One", "date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2006", "text": "No coffee, no music. Got to fix that if I am going to continue getting up at 6:00. Maybe I should start setting it up the night before and using the automatic time feature. Spent the first hour of the day reading and responding to (mostly book-related) email. All of the artists I invited to participate in the gallery have responded save one, and all the responses were yes but two. By some odd twist,  I will up with exactly 30 if the lone person I haven't heard from says yes.Then checked the medium kiln to see how yesterday's pate de verre firing went. I made a bowl using scrap frit (crushed glass) and since I still had room in the kiln I decided to do an abstract flat wafer of frit for draping. It is firing now and I will post the results tomorrow. The bowl turned out technically well. I could take it a bit higher in temp and make it fuse together a bit more, but I am happy with it. Artistically it is crap--neither the shape nor the color have any inherent tension to give interest to the work. Fortunately I will neither use this mold nor scrap frit for the piece in the book.Today I get in the materials order I was working on yesterday--and which I must finish this morning--and I write my edits of the techniques portion of the basics section of the book for the publisher. We will talk this week and hammer out the project list. (Which I still have not posted here. I am a slug.)The old Compaq laptop threw two blue screens of death yesterday. I hastily copied all of my documents, application data (email and bookmarks), and templates over to the new iMac. I will also back them all up to the external drive this morning.Finally made contact yesterday with the woman who has a gallery in Michigan and is interested in carrying my work. I will mail her a catalog today.The Art Institute in Chicago received the piece I sent for final color-matching approval and it was a go so I am ready to schedule and begin making 75 of them. It's also time to do my last two orders from the February Buyer's Market show--just in time to start preparing for the summer Buyer's Market in July. And that's a day!"},
{"title": "Let the 6 am Days Begin", "date": "Monday, June 12, 2006", "text": "No coffee yet, which is a crime as it is just after 6 am. No music either. Dave is also up and on his laptop, but the Sprout sleeps on and I am just not awake enough yet. It was a harrowing weekend. I finally got out the solicitation for participation emails to the other glass artists I am inviting to submit images to the gallery section of the book. There are 30 of them, and though this seems a huge number, it was really, really difficult to get my list down to it. I consoled myself with the knowledge that some people will decline and then I will get to invite more people. Think of it less as an alternates list than as the rest of the initial list which I haven't had a chance to get to yet.Unexpectedly but predictably it turned into a repeat of seventh grade. I hated seventh grade. Like any party, some of the kids asked who else is coming and I naively provided a list of the names of the first 30. The list then made the rounds of the Internet both to the invited, the not  and not yet invited. It was a mess. I consoled myself again with the knowledge that we artists have the attention span of mayflies. With no further stirring up, it should all blow over in the next few days. After all, we are all long past seventh grade and we have many other issues pressing for our time and attention.I begin to feel the time squeeze in this first major deadline (hence starting my morning at 6:00 am rather than 8:00 am). I am to have all the projects done and ready to photograph by 8/1. I have not yet ordered/purchased the remaining glass and hardware that I need to do them all. The order for the hardware will go in today, the couple of pieces of non-Bullseye glass I need I may just buy locally at a stained glass store (at full retail, Ugh!). It feels like every time I blink, another week has passed. Time to write up a complete schedule/timeline for now through 8/1. Usually writing up and following a schedule calms me down and allows me to pace through the overwhelming tasks between me and a deadline/goal. Let's hope it works this time."},

As soon as I am don posting I am off to the Phoenix School to drive on a field trip to the Fernbank Science Center. It's a Mom Day. One of those \"I am letting work take over my life and I have to make more time for my family\" things. I do not really have time to do it, but if I breathe deeply and concentrate on relaxing, I will get through.Yesterday was my half-life birthday and I celebrated appropriately. It took a long time to get to yesterday and I am looking forward to another good long time to get to the end. I also took the time to make a few rest-of-my-life resolutions:1) Start being comfortable saying No.2) Be realistic about scheduling even if the schedule might disappoint someone (i.e., don't kill myself to get something done just because it is more convenient for someone else).3) Schedule downtime.4) Obviate seven-day work weeks.5) Stop worrying about my inability to separate business work and life work into their own time slots (e.g., 9-5 and all other times).Now that I have all that settled I just need to get through my current bout of over-committed/over-scheduledness. The bad news is that it runs through November.The image at top right is the first project in the book--a double layer vase drape. This one was done with two layers of glass powders over clear. I haven't decided whether to use pre-colored glass for the project or to make my own. I will probably just use Spectrum Baroque or Bullseye confetti.Today contains a wrap of the work on the trunk show next week, all email going out to the artists being solicited for participation in the gallery section of the book, picking up the panel I had drilled and shipping it off to the client in Chicago, and putting in the order for all the hardware and supplementary materials I need for the projects in the book. I pretty much have the glass, but there is a lot of stuff I don't have and I didn't have time while I was in Chicago to stop by Ed Hoy's and pick it all up.9:00, off to Fernbank!"},

Details on the trip to Chicago (with pictures!) and a follow-up on the neighbors' dogs in Stranded in the South.My new webpage is almost finished (by the web design company). When they finish, then I have to create the remaining pages using the pages they created as templates. The site can be previewed here and I would love feedback.Tomorrow I will post the list of projects I plan for the book.  I would again love feedback--if you know nothing of kilnformed glass, would the chance to learn to make these things make you want to have the book and if you know kilnformed glass, is there anything here that would make you want the book so could learn the techniques? Some of them might be difficult to understand/envision if you are not a kilnformer, but I can't put in any images which are not my work. What I am looking for is a balance in size and complexity. Colors are TBD later.Today, fusing, and slumping and artist solicitations rule. Paperwork is an unfortunate necessity after the big trip and I will try to get to it. I have been approached about teaching a couple of seminars on Selling and Marketing and need to plan a bit for them.

{"title": "Atlanta!", "date": "Tuesday, June 06, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Atlanta Skyline mug (the collection grows), \"A Little Less Conversation\" by Elvis Presley on iTunes. Life for the past couple of weeks has been a fight for everything--nothing has been simple. And yet I am still in good spirits and have kept the breakdowns to infrequent minis. The latest additions to the list of catastrophes associated with the trip to Chicago: the stereo system in the Odyssey, bamboo, carpet, router and neighbors.We picked up the van almost without incident from the dealership in Nashville yesterday morning. It was almost without incident as the battery was dead from one of the dome lights being left on for a week while it sat in their parking lot. A jump later and it was running, but the anti-theft security on the radio had been triggered so we needed to put in the code. Also not too much of a problem, they looked it up for us there. I didn't try to get the iPod and all working until we were on the road, but when I did, I found that power adapter (used to be called a cigarette lighter adapter) and the cd player/radio had no power. It would have been a long silent ride home (the dvd player did not work for the Sprout either), but we made metaphoric lemonade and took turns singing silly old songs (Clementine, Bicycle Built for Two, Yankee Doodle, etc.) and playing counting games. Jessie's favorite that she sang was Yankee Doodle, but she just would not accept that pronunciation/name and sang \"Rankie Doodoo\" all the way home.There was no lemonade for the bamboo. This year for the first year since I put them in, the yellow and green Castillonis bamboo sent up shoots, big shoots, five of them. They were about a foot high (and over an inch around) when I left for Chicago and one of the first things I did yesterday upon my return was run to the backyard to marvel at their glory. But they weren't there towering over the rest of the bamboo. What the hell? So I looked closer and discovered to my horror that bamboo shoots are either tasty to deerhounds or Seraph was really stressed at my departure. All five shoots were about four feet tall and splintered off at the top from being chewed. No leaves at all so they probably are not even going to live. In the case they can't grow from being cut off in the middle, I need to cut them back to the ground so they don't siphon off nutrients from the rest of the plants. *sigh* There's always next year (bamboo shoots once a year and the full growth of the new culms happens in one growing season so these plants will always be as they are this year.The lemonade for the carpet was that it could have been worse. The gate to the upstairs did not get closed before we were all gone so the dogs had free run of the upstairs in our absence and the carpet suffered in a few spots. Enough said on THAT one.I just threw up my hands and out the lemons on the router. Went to get Dave the security key for the router so he could get his laptop connected last night and the lights on the router were all off. I couldn't connect to the router via either the laptop or the iMac and my laptop couldn't connect to the net. I think I am still able to get on via the iMac as a pass through from the DSL modem. The electricity was out while we were gone and the router might have gotten fried by lightning. In any case I foresee a frustrating morning of sys adminning to get the problem resolved and the home network functional again.I wish I had saved the lemons to through at the neighbors. And last, but not least, the crappy neighbors with the yappy dogs moved while I was gone. So how could this be a catastrophe? Guess what they left behind--the yappy dogs. I went over last night and the dogs had no food and no water. I went over this morning and, again, no food and no water. It is going to be 85 degrees today. I do not know these dogs well enough to open their kennel, go in and take care of them. As far as I know, they have never been out of the kennel and though they look friendly, I am not going to risk being bitten. So I called animal services and their response is to put an abandonment notice on the kennel giving the owners 36 hours to take the dogs away. No amount of protesting would convince the operator that the dogs could be dead in 36 hours. Alvin and Belinda have been gone for over a week now, and I have seen no evidence that they are coming by to take care of the dogs. After much aggravation and $7.95, I have found the landlady's name and address (the internet is a truly wonderful thing) and called her. She did not know they had moved and said she would call Alvin (Allen, whatever) at work to find out. She might or might not call me back to let me know what she finds out. And the police should be here in the next hour.Even if the Alvin and Belinda complaint falls through I still need the police. I have finally decided to do something about the dog in the yard next to Alvin and Belinda's. Another set of renters moved in there and they have a young female pit-bull in a prong collar chained 24/7 in their backyard with nothing more than a small airline carrier kennel for shelter. It is illegal in our county to chain animals at all. Even trolley systems can only be used in the day--not from 10 pm to 6 am--and require a back-up containment system. I have not complained before now because I did not have the time to dedicate to the process and was nervous about the fallout from the neighbors. I am still nervous about the fallout from the neighbors (the dog owner is a big guy and if he bangs on my door with temper and ill-intent for making a complaint...) but it is the Right Thing To Do.In tomorrow's post I will get around to all the good things that happened in Chicago and all the fun we had. For now I have to unload the van, fix/replace the router, fire a couple of commissions, review the web pages I have *finally* received for review from the website development company, and write the publisher about their response (I haven't received one yet) to the project outline I sent last week and the week before."},

It took 48 hours to get here with one thing and another. But here we got, I did The Prairie Arts Festival Saturday and Sunday and did quite well even though it was in the 90's both days and patrons were sparse. I even picked up a new gift store locally to carry my work. I love doing this show. It is in a beautiful park and the pond in the park is right in front of my booth. I get to watch the swans and their cygnets all day (thanks to my friend and booth neighbor Sandy Mannix for the great swan photos--I forgot my camera both days). This year I even got the added treat of a great blue heron fishing out in the middle of the pond by the swans' nest. I had the same neighbors on each side as last year--it is just a thoroughly wonderful experience.It took a long time to pack and load last night. My booth was as far from parking as you could get at this show, and it was almost 10:00 pm when I got home. I took it easy today--I haven't even called in my credit card sales yet--and just lounged and read. Jessie spent the weekend with Gramma, Grampa and Aunt Jan perfecting her bike riding skills and showing off her new bike helmet. She even got to ride on the tram with Gramma in the Memorial Day Parade today. Tomorrow I need to get the last part of my project outline off to the Editor, do all the paperwork and record-keeping for the show, and catch up on my email. I am woefully behind on answering both personal and professional mail. I will also send out the first request for submission forms to the artists whose work I would like in the book. I have only spoken to three of the thirty I need. I might need to make some phone calls too... or that could just wait till next week when I am back home. There is much to be said for a little rest, relaxation and vacation!"},
{"title": "The Road to Chicago: Day 2", "date": "Friday, May 26, 2006", "text": "Don't spoil the surprise. Our saga begins here on the Road to Chicago Day 1.Slept fitfully dreaming of Legionnaire’s disease to the badly tuned hum of the wall air conditioning unit and woke with a stuffed nose to the sound of phlegmy coughing from the J. Woke at 6:12 am with a panic attack sure that I had left half my poles for my display tent in Atlanta. Called Dave and caught him with running bathwater and a mouthful of toothpaste. When he called back, he confirmed that I had, indeed, forgotten all the upper and lower supports for the tent. I cannot use the tent without those poles, and I cannot do the show without a tent. IF Heather can find me a Grand Caravan it will cost me $385 base AND I will have to return to Atlanta for my poles (500 miles roundtrip) which gives me 1000 miles left to Chicago. So I sit at 7:00 am reviewing my options. Option A: Stay in Nashville till the transmission is done Friday afternoon and head back home, metaphorical tail between legs obeying the obvious will of the gods. Option 2: Refuse to bow to a conspiracy of unfortunate circumstance and do whatever it takes to forge on.On the one hand, if I go on, I get a mini-vacation with the family and J gets to spend a couple of  weeks with Gramma and Grampa. I get to see the Broadway play “Wicked” (my birthday gift from my in-laws was a ticket for Tuesday 5/30 at the Fox Theater in Aurora). I follow through on my show commitment and maybe get a big commission or two. Dave gets to use his plane ticket and we get a tiny vacation this year (between his schedule at CNN and the book this is the only time we have before November 6). I get to buy more hostas at the grower in Princeton, IL. My batteries fully charge for the work ahead—the book projects are fully percolated and ready to be started on my return. Finally I get to stop by the Art Institute to make sure I have the right color blend for the 75 platters I have to do for them by the end of July.On the other hand, the Prairie Arts Festival is a nice little show that I would not do if I did not bring J and stay with Dave’s parents so that J could have Gramma and Grampa time and vice-versa. There is no way that I can expect it to cover the mounting costs of this expedition. Gas alone right now is making the trip almost cost-prohibitive, and add the cost of the rental car… Then there are the issues of time and energy. Driving back to Atlanta for the poles and then back to Nashville (just because it is on the way) and on to Chicago again is a huge time and energy sink. I could just cut my losses and rechannel that time and energy into meeting my book and production deadlines. Not going to Chicago would put me physically way ahead of the game. I could just mail the platter to the Art Institute to verify the match and skip vacation altogether this year. Of course I might not get into the Prairie Arts Festival again, my ticket to “Wicked” is lost and Dave’s plane ticket has to be repurposed.It’s a lot to think about and really hinges on being able to get a vehicle. Time to gird the loins both figuratively and literally, fuel the belly and the soul, and head across the street to Honda/Enterprise. Oh yes, I also forgot my wireless adapter for the laptop so I cannot even get this up to Glass Incarnate. But if I go back to Atlanta today I’ll be able to get it too!First big news: The trip has been extended again. Dave is going to fly up next Wednesday so we can all have a mini family vacation and he and I are going to spend a day and night downtown celebrating my birthday (a week early). Then he will drive back with us on Sunday, June 3.Now the actual nitty gritty of the journey. Tuesday morning the plan was to get on the road by 6:00 am Wednesday. By 5:15 when I hadn’t even started loading the car, the plan changed to leave by 10:00 am Wednesday after getting up at 5:00 and loading the car. I actually got up at 7:30 and had the car loaded by 1:00 pm so we left then. At the north end of the city I realized I had forgotten to pack all the hanging display stands for the plates and I had to go back. By the time I arrived back home I had also thought of two more things I had forgotten: my tool box with all the tools and cable ties, and the top to my little sales cabinet. Both would have been minor disasters in their own right. Picked up everything and was back on the road by 2:00 pm with a scheduled arrival in Chicago (per the GPS) of 12:32 am. I think it was a bit optimistic.It is now 7:30 pm Wednesday and J and I are in Nashville at the Marriott across the street from the Crest Honda dealership downtown. One might wonder what we are doing in Nashville, stopped for the night not even halfway to Chicago. Well, we are here because just before 5:00 as I was stopping and going in rush hour traffic on I-24 the transmission started going out on the Honda. I didn’t even know where we were when it happened. I was lost in an audiobook on the iPod and cruising to the GPS. There is nothing scarier when you are driving (barring a real accident) than being in evening rush hour on a freeway in a strange town and having your car start jerking and shuddering—especially when you do not even know which strange town it is. I knew I was in Tennessee and I knew I was already past Chattanooga, but then I was drawing a blank.I took the first off ramp into a clearly central downtown area and saw a sign on a building that said “Nashville”. One mystery solved. I had my cell phone so I pulled over to the curb and called directory assistance to see if they could get me to a Honda dealership. Clearly I had my technologies confused as the operators were unable to do more than recite a list of dealerships to me interspersed with apologies and excuses. While they were fumbling and listing, I glanced up at the GPS and on a whim, typed in “Honda”. In seconds I had the name, address, phone number and directions to a dealership two miles away. By then it was 5:00 and I figured their service department would probably be closed, but I hoped someone might be there late and could do a quick diagnostic and get me set up for service tomorrow. I lucked out, they had someone who would wait for me. I pulled cautiously away from the curb and headed for them.When I got there they told me the diagnostic would be $95. It wasn’t like I had a choice. They hooked up their computer and sure enough, my car gave it transmission codes. I told them I had had transmission problems a month and a half ago and had had the solenoid replaced (it was about $700), and they said it shouldn’t have been done: Honda’s service guidelines say to never (their formatting, I saw it on the screen) replace the solenoid if the car has more then 20,000 miles. I have over 80,000. Grrrrr. They said I would probably need a new transmission. Then they looked up my Vin number in their computer and said something which turned my day around—Honda had a problem with the transmissions in some minivans the same year as ours so they extended the warranty to 7 years or 100,000 miles. I get the diagnostics and the new transmission for free!The bad news is that they can’t get the transmission in and do the work till Friday—too late for me to get to Chicago to do my show this weekend. But Honda service did not end there. Josselyn asked if I wanted to rent a car—there is an Enterprise rent-a-car attached to the dealership. And she called over to see what they had. Moving right along on the good news/bad news continuum, there were no cars there or at other Enterprise that would work for me. Josselyn also gave me the names and phone numbers of the two closest hotels—the woman at the dealership who might have been able to get me a special rate was already gone for the day so I didn’t luck out there—so I got a hotel room at the Marriott across the street and tomorrow morning Heather is going to try again to find me a car. Barring that I will probably rent a small U-Haul truck and get to Chicago that way. More tomorrow…."},

Yep, the Mac is back and the song choice is not random. I wanted music today that was really fast and that I would not be ashamed of. And Guitar Hero rules our lives right now. I had a 333 note streak the other night... and what does any of this have to do with glass? It's all over the place--and THAT has a lot to do with glass. Glass is all over the place right now too. Here are the highlights:Tomorrow J and I leave for Chicago. I am doing the Prairie Arts Festival up there over Memorial Day weekend. As soon as I finish this I will put the last firepolish load in Big Bertha and get packing. I don't want to have to move the contractors too much and they are squatting with their stuff in the middle of the driveway... that didn't come out quite right. I need to get my van by them and down to the garage so I can load it.Then I need to finish updating my mailing list and print out labels from it to take to Becky (the owner of Creative Spirit Gallery). She is sending out postcards for a solo trunk show I am doing there on June 15. This afternoon I will fuse a plate commission I got yesterday, and pack another commission I finished yesterday for shipping. And finally at 3:00, I have a phone conference to go over the I-hope-final website design I commissioned on March 20. Little things, these are just little things.And there are big things. I finally had a phone meeting with the senior editor at the publisher. She gave me a deadline and it is a doozy. The book has grown. It is now slated for 144 pages and 20 projects. By the end of the day today I am to have a complete list of the proposed projects in detail, in color and preferably with photos so they can review them for scale, interest and visual appeal. The projects need to be completed and ready to photograph by August 1. Besides photographing the finished project, the photographer will also need to do the interim stage photos for the instructions... So I need to have multiples of each project completed to different stages. Twenty of them. By August 1. I am in Chicago for one week of that time and Philadelphia for another. Do the math. I had planned on a week per project. Instead...But I have not given up. I have not yet been able to make a schedule where I can see pulling it off, but I still have hope. Of course my extra week in Chicago with the family and the summer vacation in Montana have been cancelled. I do have the big order to get out for the Art Institute and the penultimate and antipenultimate gallery orders from the February show also due in July. Good thing I have three kilns.So what am I doing on the computer? I need to get working! Next post, Live from Chicago!"},

Too lazy to brew this week. Still no music (I want my Mac back!).I have a laser printer. I bought it last year so I could print out the designs to photoprocess onto sandblast resist so I could etch my own designs easily and quickly. This was when I thought I would be making slumped wine bottle cheese plates. This was before I discovered that doing this kind of crafty little thing for money would suck my soul right out through my ears. But I still have the laser printer. And my printer (an actual guy--the one who did my postcards) uses a laser printer to print the back of my postcards for each show I do and he charges me $.15 each for the privilege. So I thought I could save a little (saving is good) and print them myself for the Prairie Arts Festival. I could also get them done without ever having to leave the house or talk to anyone and I am just enough of a hermit for that scenario to appeal.But I am becoming very frustrated and having little luck printing the postcards on my laser printer: it has a roller so instead of just passing straight through, the paper curves around the roller (under intense heat) which cause the postcards to curve after printing. I also have to send them through the manual feed one at a time and sometimes they go through fine and sometimes they don't. Futzing around with it is taking a lot of time. It might be worth it to go to the printers and pay $15 to have these done. What am I thinking? Of course it is worth it! So that is my afternoon.My morning will be filled with cutting all the blanks for the firings I have to do in the next three days and getting the first two of those loads in. I broke my dry spell yesterday and fused two full loads. It is good to be back in the saddle again."},

But I have a brand spanking new coffee mug that I had to break in this morning and I wanted to share the news. So, coffee in the Washington DC Skyline mug--thank you very much Barbara for the wonderful gift!!!!! iTunes is dark.Thus far this morning I have already dealt with a credit agency (for the 8th time) looking for Brenda J Griffin, filed a complaint with the FTC about said agency and called Bellsouth to see if there is anything further I can do to stop them from calling me. Alas, there is not. Do the people who work for these agencies not attend school? My last name ends in \"th\", not in \"n\". My daughter can spell better than they can and she is only 4 and 1/2.We also freed all the butterflies. There is one chrysallis left un-hatched, and I hope the butterfly breaks free today as I am not into the \"heir and a spare\" philosohy of raising young.Today I really *must* fuse a load for Chicago. Yesterday I did landscaping and landscaping communication all afternoon and got absolutely nothing done in the studio except another shelving unit built. I am not yet panicking about my inventory for the show, but I am really close. No more interruptions!!! And I will also get the postcards ordered as they must hit the mail no later than Monday.On the book front, yesterday I heard from the assistant to my editor and she asked how I want to handle the other artist photo gallery. My choices were they send out a call for submissions or I pick the people whose work I want in the book. That was an easy one. I am a control freak. They want 30 artsists and three photos each. It sounds like a lot, but I have already made a preliminary list of 29, and I know there are people I am forgetting whose work I would like to include. And I already know there are people who are going to be very offended that I don't ask them and there will be all kinds of fall-out from that. But this is not a popularity contest. I am picking people because they produce diverse, unique kiln-formed work. Not because they are the latest Hot Things or because they are (possibly soon to be \"were\") my friends. In case there is a thought I exaggerate, I must remind that one of the reasons artists do what they do is because many of them don't work and play well with others and are better suited to their own solitary, idiosyncratic lives. You should read some of the stuff that flies on the warmglass.com bulletin board. Snits galore. Ok, to fuse! To fuse!"},
{"title": "Mosaic in the Garden", "date": "Monday, May 15, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Jupiter Coffee go cup--ex lg house blend with an extra shot of espresso. No music because the iMac is dead and iTunes on the laptop can't find all the music files. *sigh* Yep the Mac is really dead. It thinks it doesn't have a hard drive. I hope the Mac Tech support people at the Apple Store can convince it otherwise or at least get all my data back. In the meantime I am back on the pc laptop--and have lost my firing schedule for this, the week before I go to Chicago.On other fronts, yesterday was Mother's Day and I was feted to the max. I received wonderful presents--Jessie made me a photo-cup at school and (through Dave) got me an orchid and a book on mosaic projects for the garden--and they made me a French toast, bacon and fresh fruit breakfast. After breakfast we dropped the Mac off at the Apple Store and headed out to the Botanical Gardens. At the Botanical Garden we saw all the incredible mostly mosaic sculpture of Niki de St. Phalle. This is a perfectly timed exhibition for me as I have been planning to do a freeform concrete mosaic wall-bench around half the pond. Dave, knowing this, enabled me with the gift of the book. Now he has neither excuse nor recourse. Construction is imminent.I have long been fascinated with large-scale mosaic. My favorite building anywhere is the Casa Batllo in Barcelona created by Antonio Gaudi. Sadly I took all my pictures of it before I had a digital camera and have not scanned them yet so I will have to fall back on someone else's photo of it and the colors just do not come through. Both it and the benches in Parc Guell (also Gaudi, also Barcelona) have the undulating curves and abstract colors which are driving my design of the pond. And the materials I plan to use? All the old stained glass I been collecting for over 20 years, all the blobs and jewels, shells and agates. We will finally have a piece of my work in our house/garden and it is going to be massive.And it is going to be done at the same time as I am writing the book, doing another Buyer's Market of American Craft Show in Philadelphia (July), and getting out 75 pieces for the Art Institute of Chicago. The cool thing about mosaic is that there is no rush. The big part will be getting the concrete part poured, but then adding the mosaic to it can be done in stages. I am doing a model in clay to start, then the big technical piece I need to master is the steel-reinforced concrete form. But that's ok, if the how-to isn't in the book Dave gave me, it will be in another one!I love Mondays. I feel like I can do anything on Monday. There is no project to big, no commitment too scary, no deadline too close. Too bad it won't last. Now off to Ikebana. It is my last day in the advanced class and I have to do a symmetrical form. I hate symmetrical.And what about fused glass? This afternoon a full fuse load for the Prairie Arts Festival in Chicago (and I have to get the postcards ordered!)."},

I am two days behind the firing schedule I planned out for that work, but there were a couple of days unscheduled so it will all work out.I also heard from the Publisher yesterday.

More forms to fill out and snail mail in and more delay. Tick, tick, tick. I asked about getting an editor and GETTING STARTED.Maybe they think I am already writing? If it were fiction, I could be. But I am not going to risk heading off in a direction they do not want and writing up a a bunch of stuff I can't use. Of course if I get the content done, the format might not matter and I might be delaying for nothing. Maybe I'll start writing this weekend after all.It doesn't help that what I really want to write about right now is the business of being a professional artist/artisan--storage, shipping, consignment, wholesale, marketing and advertising, capital...Hey I know, maybe I'll work on two books this summer!

I wonder what that's all about. Now it says (based on my birthday, gender and personality--I'm an optimist) that I will die on Halloween in 2052, a comfortably far-off date and further evidence that I am celebrating my half-life birthday next month. I have asserted for the past few months that this is my biggest birthday (forget the silly decade b-days--there are lots of them) and the iMac widget supports my contension. And lest an uncharitable soul muse aloud what any of this has to do with GLASS, I respond that puttering for a little bit on the iMac every morning and learning a new bit of functionality (today's lesson: screen shots and partial shots) is a requirement to mastering this new tool.But more about glass. I moved 1500 lbs Bullseye glass in sheets on Saturday. Today I need to move about the same amount in architectural clears. It is a good thing my biorthythm widget indicates I am at a physical peak right now. Then I'll assemble and deploy the six new shelving units and put all the extant scrap glass in the new plastic bins I bought at Target last week and move it all to shleves.

That gives me one more day of putzing and organizing in the studio before serious production begins again next week.Yesterday I shopped. I went to Target, the Container Store and Sam's Club. I bought 15 qt plastic boxes from Target (24 of them) to store scrap glass. Then I went to the Container Store and bought an InterMetro four-shelf rack on sale for $99. Then on a whim I stopped by Sam's Club on the way home.Shopping at Sam's Club is always hit and miss for me. If I go there looking for something, they will not have it or the price will only be okay. However if I go there with an open mind and wallet I can find extraordinary deals. Yesterday by some weird alignment of the stars I found both what I was looking for AND an incredible deal. For those of you familiar with it, the kind of shelving I bought at TCS comes in two grades: Home and Commercial. TCS carries both. The shelving I bought for $99 was home grade--less weight pre shelf and for the unit as a whole. At Sam's Club I found the chrome (more expensive than the black or white) commercial grade *6* shelf unit (as opposed to the 4 from TCS) for $79 (same height and width). It also comes with heavy-duty casters, adjustable leg posts, polypro shelf liners and all the hardware necessary to make 2 3-shelf units instead of 1 6-shelf one.I bought two and I am going to go back today and get another two. These puppies are so heavy I cannot lift them by myself so I had to rip open the boxes in the car when I got home and build them in the drive. But boy oh boy are they beautiful! 600 lbs per shelf, 3600 lbs for the entire unit. I may Craig's list a bunch of old Home Depot shelving and replace it with this stuff: More in less space and prettier! What else could one want? Needless to say I will be going back to TCS to return the other shelf unit. It never even made it out of the car."},

I can dream). I will also turn my Eye on the studio and divine her faults and limitations with the goal of possible rearranging now that I have more space. The additional garage space is no small addition: it is a two-car + garage and I was only using about a third of it prior to now.Now to digress. Part of learning about the new iMac has been experimenting with its components. One of the components of the iMac is the dashboard--a set of widgets that do everything from convert currency, translate from one language to another,and show the time in binary (deeply geeky), to provide a fortune from a digital cookie, tell you your horoscope, show you your biorhythm chart and present the tarot card of the day (based on the date). In doing Mac diligence (aka putzing, ditzing and wasting time) I installed a bunch of new widgets. This is how my life has been: my biorhythms are ALL tanked, the tarot card of the day for the past three days has been death, and my horoscope has been telling me to hide under the bed. Okay, that last one was an exaggeration, but the rest are true.Today the biorhythms are on the rise, the tarot card of the day is The Lovers, and the horoscope says I am in the mood to take on a project and I should do it as I will have fun. Not that I place any stock in the digital presentation of these arcane mystical forecasts... (Did I mention my fortune from the cookie was \"If it's not in the computer it doesn't exist\"?)"},

The floral journeymanpiece at right is this week's Ikebana arrangement of maple, flax and alstroemaria. Ikebana is my Monday guilty pleasure.This post is brought to you via iMac. Yep, we finally broke down and acquired a Mac. It is not the Mac laptop for which I have been lusting, it is the whole family/business Mac which lives in the office. More on it--the whyfors and coolnesses--in the appropriate venue (Stranded in the South).I didn't make it into the studio yesterday. I am now a day behind on shipping one order and firing another. I may be able to make up time this weekend on firing the one and I will definitely ship today on the other.Yesterday I spent all day in the office. I sorted and organized and pseudo-filed. Pseudo-filing is when papers to be filed make it into a basket of the correct category, e.g., Griffith Family or Siyeh Studio. This is one step closer to the ultimate goal of the filing cabinet (or the shredder if they become obsolete before actual filing). The outcome of the day is that I now know the location of every piece of paper which is waiting for action from me, and eventually I will address them all. I did take care of doing, faxing/mailing the urgent must-go-out-yesterday pieces so I am caught up there.Off to kilnform (and unload last week's delivery before it gets rained on... again)!"},

The only glass artsist \"stuff\" I have been on top of recently has been my firing schedule--and that probably only because I had three days of slush built in. Slush, I might add, which has now all melted away. Today I ship, and I ship again Monday. And that takes cares of all gallery orders till July with only two more to complete this year from my Buyer's Market orders from February ( I say \"this year\" because I actually had a gallery place a good sized order on 2/19/06 for delivery 1/10/07). It is good to be done as there is another Buyer's Market coming up mid July and at least one part of me hopes to get many more orders there! Another part of me is lost in landscape design (mine and others) and pond building. No, the construction has not yet begun on the pond, but it is all coming together. When it does happen, it will be over in a weekend and photos will be posted on Stranded in the South.So today I ship (all Cosmos Morceaux de Verre), and I do a huge load of paisley pieces for a gallery in Canada. I also simply MUST get the final art fair apps and other paperwork done and sent off. If there is any time left, I will continue asserting my will on the contents of the garage and the shed. Time and space being what they are I predict they will both be left to gather dust for another day (or five)."},

Today I resolve to Keep Focused. Days when you do not have enough you must do to fill the day are bad because they lead to flailing and dithering (in me at least). Yesterday I had so little I had to get done that I could have done it all by noon and taken the rest of the day off. That's actually what I planned to do, but instead of making a conscious decision of what I wanted to do with the free time and following through, I got my firing in and spent the rest of the day doing a little paper work and ditzing around on the computer reading a bunch of stuff. And so the day got pissed away and I was left feeling very off-center and unsatisfied. If I had decided to spend the day reading, thinking and worrying about what other sentient humans were thinking and worrying about that would have been okay. Instead I got sucked in and lost control of my life. Not going to happen today. Though I am going to have to deal with all the mental fallout from yesterday and that will make up the next few posts on Stranded in the South.Today the glass artist fuses another load of gallery orders, fills out and mails in the last art fair apps (really), makes a lot more progress cleaning out the garage and making it into extended studio, and unpacks the Bullseye delivery. It will be exciting in the early part of the day as I head off in 10 minutes to have my eyes dilated. Last week at my eye appointment they didn't do it as I opted to be fitted for bi-focal contacts. At the end of a week experimenting with them I have decided that my eyes aren't all that bad for either distance or close-in, and I am just a whiner. Nice to know, now on to get a mammogram appointment. Glad there's nothing to test-drive for that."},

It will make getting in today's firing a bit more interesting, but not too. Luckily J is now at the age where she is self-entertaining and essentially independent. That doesn't mean I am going to chuck her out to fend for herself anytime soon, but it means I have a bit more latitude to do my stuff.Today's \"stuff\" is a slump of yesterday's fuse and a lot of paperwork: I have not reconciled the financials since I had to do it for taxes.

This will be the first official use of the new glass storage area in the garage. I am so excited I may even sweep the floor!I don't know how it happened, but I am now three days ahead on my firing schedule: If I keep to the schedule I will have the next two gallery orders ready to ship three days ahead of when they are scheduled to go out. I am pretty excited about this as it means there is now room in the schedule for experimentation... and cleaning and writing... whatever.I may even have a personal use for this time--I have decided to do a mosaic wall along one side of the pond and use up a lot of glass that I otherwise don't use anymore (mostly bought for Tiffany-style lamps which cost more to make than to purchase from Home Depot Expo made in China). Using it there will have the double positive effect of clearing out the studio and providing something beautiful for our home that does not need to be moved when we move.So off to grab a quick lunch and get fusing!

This week things are back to a more traditional work/life time split, and I am back to daily blogging.It's good to be back to a schedule and done with traveling and shows for a month and a half. I have two more gallery orders to get out by the end of the month--one a HUGE one to a gallery in Calgary, Alberta Canada (my first international gallery!). In a week or so I need to start figuring out the customs forms. And I have the art fair apps for the fall shows to get out this week. Other than that, I am just clearing the decks to start on the book (no editor assigned yet so I have not begun). Part of the deck clearing is getting all non-glass STUFF moved to the new shed and the garage cleaned out to officially become a full-size studio extension.It's about time to post more pics here, and I will do so of the new studio layout when it is complete.

The shed is being built as I write and should be done by the end of the day. I am going to christen it tonight with the tent and display materials which are still packed in the minivan awaiting space to get down the drive and unload.Much of real life is spilling into and mixing with glass this week, and the way to look at it is that that is the way life should be. Instead of the artificial schedule imposed by jobs and schools and the institutions of our lives, \"work\" should co-mingle with \"life\" and the priorities of one should be weighed and scheduled along with the priorities of the other. In theory this makes for a more balanced, less stressful life. Now if I can just take a few things out of both and SLOW DOWN I will be set. That's the trick, isn't it?Today sees another fuse load, some cutting, grinding and polishing of yesterday’s pieces before slumping tomorrow, a whole mess of paperwork, cat and ferret litter boxes to clean, dogs to be brushed before their grooming appointments tomorrow, and spring garden clean-up to plan.

{"title": "Closer to Fine", "date": "Tuesday, April 11, 2006", "text": "Coffee in the Austin Skyline mug--yep, read that right: AUSTIN. I finally got one (eBay, of course--and reasonably priced too). \"Closer to Fine\" by the Indigo Girls on the iPod. And by glory I am closer to fine today. It has been a rough three weeks. Yesterday I was so tired and so low. I did fire a load, ship a commission, call in all my credit card charges from the Dogwood, prepare the area for the shed materials delivery, critique the beta layout for my new website, and put in two orders with suppliers. But it took all I had. One ray of sunshine in the day was a package from Bridget in L.A. A gem of a little book called \"The Gift of a Year\". I think the package actually arrived sometime in the past 2-3 weeks and I just got around to opening the mail from that time period yesterday--a strong indicator as to over-extendedness.The Dogwood was a very good show with one of the most hellacious breakdowns I have ever done. By the time I got everything in the van it was full dark and I think I left a couple of my tent bungees there. And I was one of the first ones to get to load thanks to the extraordinary help of a friend here who traded glass for muscles. Next year I will see if we can load out on Monday morning. Most of the artists are not local so there would probably only be a few of us wanting to do it and it would be *much* less painful.Today, today, today is a bright and shiny NEW day. I rose at 7:30 to the doorbell and the builder for the shed. We reconnoitered the area and decided it would be better for him to come back tomorrow after I have the tree branches hanging in the middle of where the shed will go trimmed up. *Blush* I agonized for a week over the placement of the shed and paced and measured and paced and measured. But the one thing I didn't do was look up. I didn't see the tree for the ground... nope. (Hmmm I am not sure that was the idiomatic expression I was looking for...)A little digression about search engines and sponsored results. Every now and again a word or phrase comes to mind that I feel the need to check before I use it (see \"The Princess Bride\": \"Inconceiveable!\" \"You keep using that word. I do not think that word means what you think it means.\") (Ren takes this activity to a new level). I wanted to verify \"idiom\" or \"idiomatic expression\" as an appropriate definition of the phrase \"see the forest for the trees\". It didn't feel like a metaphor, and it isn't an analogy. So I looked on dictionary.com for \"idiom\". Nothing. \"Idiomatic expression\" also brought nothing. But under each there was a 'search the web' button which produced the following:Search results for idiomatic expression.   Sponsored Links:             Idiomatic ExpressionsLooking for Idiomatic Expressions? Find exactly what you want today.www.eBay.com       I had heard you could buy anything on eBay, but I was not expecting Chinese idiomatic expressions...So the day began with a builder and continued with shipping an order and a purchase from the Dogwood, getting J off to school, chatting with the woman who owns the garden rescue service (that's not actually what it is called, but it is an accurate name for us as they are going to do an intervention and stop my cycle of destructive avoidance of garden maintenance tasks) and setting up an appointment for her to evaluate our mess, and begging a new groomer to take on the dogs. I have let EVERYTHING slide in the past few months (years?). I have so many balls in the air right now that I will be lucky if their falling does not cause some poor marginalized species to go extinct. Or maybe they won't fall. I could be that lucky...What does this all have to do with glass? Well, when two straight weeks are taken up with glass--evenings and weekends included--the rest of life has to be slotted in where it can and this slot happens to be TUESDAY. Which is not to say there won't be glass today. There will. The firing schedule is tight with a gallery order a week going out for the next three weeks, and the first order from the Art Institute of Chicago coming in over the weekend at 70 pieces instead of 50. (Whooppee!) And 35 more to be made and held here in case they need them... They don't need to be there till the end of July, but I am already scheduling.And I am being so proactive about my firing because there is a book contract and in the next couple of weeks I expect to have an editor who will be giving me deadlines and cracking a whip over my head about output. I haven't even reviewed the outline I wrote back in January for them. I have no idea what I am going to write.On the plus side, I don't have another festival scheduled until Memorial Day weekend in Chicago. Then a solo gallery trunk show here in June and the next Buyer's Market in Philadelphia in July after which we all flee to Montana for a couple of weeks of R & R (and probably writing for me).Now I'm off to get the load in the kiln, dig up a couple of hostas to move out of the way of the shed, and I will relax this afternoon with garden and pond planning and financial paperwork. It's so good to be home!"},

I woke at 4:17 to the howl of some pretty serious wind.Fortunately yesterday was a good day for me. I should have planned better and already had the postcards printed up for the solo glass show I am doing at Creative Spirit for the Third Thursday Gallery Tour in June. As this is a local show, if I were a savvy marketer, I would have publicity for my next local event with me. But it really was all I could do to get eight additional pieces done for the show. Maybe I will print some up today. I have electricity in the tent, and I will probably have time.OK, off to the show!"},

Random shuffle actually put up Tom Jones doing \"The Green, Green Grass of Home\", but while appropriate, it was not listenable. The next random choice was Marvin and I can live with that--it's also appropriate! I have already dropped the J at school--made her lunch and everything today--and left a panel at Dixie Glass Hoppers to be drilled. I hope I will need it this weekend at the DOGWOOD FESTIVAL. Yup. I got the call yesterday afternoon at 4:20 and immediately went and set up the tent and unloaded everything into it.  It pays to be lazy (the car was still loaded from Austin).When I got home, we had dinner and sangria from Billy Goat Cantina (which has been renamed My Cow Cantina for some inexplicable reason--I keep thinking it's Mad Cow Cantina... not good marketing on someone's part) and piled into the convertible (Sebring with a car seat for Jessie in the backseat) to go to the drive-in for The Inside Man. J watched Ice Age 2 on the next screen over. If we had thought and brought another radio, she could have watched and heard the sound too. The Starlight Six six screen drive-in which shows double-feature first runs five minutes from our house is one of the best things about living here. Next week we will see Ice Age 2 and the following week V for Vendetta.But back to actual glass-related stuff. Since the festival doesn't start till tomorrow at noon I am WAY ahead of the game as far as set-up. Which is good as today I still have to read, sign and send the book contract, send the font and pics to the web developers, measure for and order the shed, fuse a full load of display pieces (so I have some new work for the show), prepare the replacement pieces for the gallery which broke in shipping last week, and firepolish a display piece I sold in Austin which had a couple of rough spots ground out and never polished.The show is noon to 8:00 tomorrow, 10:00-8:00 Saturday and noon-7:00 Sunday. I just read their schedule on the web and the music goes till 8:00 on Sunday so they won't be letting artists' vehicles in to load up until after the people clear--likely well after 8:00 pm. Load-in was a breeze for me yesterday: I was the only one at check-in, there was one other vehicle on the road unloading (which is good as there is no room to pass), and there was plenty of room for my minivan to park in the neighboring as yet unoccupied spaces so I could unload it at my leisure. Load-out is obviously not going to be so nice and I need to be prepared for a late night--maybe even having dinner in midtown after breaking down while waiting for the biggest traffic push to clear out.Whoever thought being an artist and doing art festivals was a relaxing easy life was just dead wrong. At least the weather looks like it will be perfect for the weekend! (I wrote too soon: I just checked the forecast and scattered strong thunderstorms and high winds are predicted for Friday evening through Saturday evening. Great. Going to hunt up the galoshes now.)"},

There is no music as the iPod has been temporarily re-purposed. more on that in a minute.I took two days to drive from Austin back to Atlanta this time. It turns out that four hours of sleep after a two-day festival in the heat (and breaking down at the end of the second day) is not enough anymore to fuel this 44 year-old bod to drive 1000 miles in one day. Today is the first day of set-up for the Dogwood festival here in Atlanta. I am the first glass artist on the wait-list so I gave them a quick call to see if there is a spot for me before I unload the car. I left a message on their machine and now have an excuse to leave the car packed until tomorrow. After the five am anxiety attack about all the things I need to do today, the rest of the morning started very slowly for me. I finally got Jessie to school by 11:00, and now I am preparing for a busy day of electronic paper pushing. I have to phone in all my credit card charges from Austin, sign and mail back the book contract, enter all my sales and expenses for the show into a spreadsheet, update my studio inventory, send font and more pictures to my website developers, update the gallery inventory for the work I left at Taylor Kinzel and send it to them, prepare an order for Bullseye, pay bills, invoice clients, return gallery calls from the past week, and sort through the mound of *stuff* on my desk. My question at the end of all this is, if I am a glass artist, how come I spend so much of my time with my hands on paper?All I really want to do is curl up in the Sky Chair on the front porch and listen to the book from Audible that I downloaded to my iPod. Audio books, I am now hooked. I didn't even notice the drive yesterday--I listened to over five hours of a 10-hour book and could have kept driving to the coast. I feel like I could actually drive to Montana this summer with audio books. And they play through the car's speakers on the iPod. Is this a great century or what?But there are papers to push so I had better get to it. Maybe I will be able to treat myself late this afternoon."},
{"title": "Why do I do Art Fairs?", "date": "Sunday, April 02, 2006", "text": "The answer to the question above: To be exposed to new, cool technology! This festival's  current leader is TiddlyWiki (thank you Bryon Jacob). Okay, I just recently started blogging (an admittedly linear exercise). And now I find out about blogging for the ADHD in 3D: Short and non-linear. I am not sure I buy the premise that \"Human minds are not built to take in long passages of information very well; we're a lot better at taking information in little tiny chunks.\" For me, little chunks are as likely as not to get lost in the white noise of the day to day whereas a large chunk of data that I can visualize is easier to contextualize and remember. However there are places where tiny chunks are perfect, and I am a big fan of non-linear.So what does this have to do with glass? Everything! Artist collaboration possibilities, tutorials, FAQ's help with problems. Think of warmglass.com. Its is a GREAT site and it used to be a great resource (keep the flamethrowers pointed to the ground until I finish this thread and duck). But it is linearly structured and HUGE. The overwhelming winner in the 'most frequent phrase written in posts on warmglass.com' contest is \"Someone has already written a lot about that, look in the archives\".  And as someone who has tried to find useful information in the archives, I can confidently say... no I can't. I don't use words like that in print. There is just too much information there to have to sift through it to find the relevant bits.So what is a wiki and why would this be better? Because instead of having (100 million) individual posts which are not ranked for relevance show up in a search on, say, \"kiln wash\", you can have one editable entry on kiln wash that all members of the community can update or even multiple related entries on kiln wash (like multiple encyclopedia entries for a word).The limitation of discussion groups is that they are too linear and searching the archives of a large one is at best difficult and time-consuming, at worst a complete waste of time. The limitation of a traditional website is that it is designed as a one-way flow of information and keeping it current for an audience like the warmglass group is too time-consuming even for a dedicated team of people. With a wiki, everyone who has a stake in the community shares in the responsibility of keeping the information current, and it is well-organized and accessible to new members.Will I do anything with this new technology? I don't know. My plate is pretty full right now. Maybe the best I can do is offer it up to the new generation of kilnformed glass artists and say \"Hey! You grew up with computers. Why don't you build a cool wiki for us old folks?\""},
{"title": "Live from the Austin Fine Arts Festival!", "date": "Saturday, April 01, 2006", "text": "I love Austin. Free wireless almost anywhere you go. So here I sit in my booth at the Austin Fine Arts Festival and I am connected. Life is good. It should be the end of the first day of the festival, but some genius thought it would be a good idea to have a special patron's event tonight from 7-10. And while evening events can be okay, there are two strikes against this one: 1) the show has already been open to the public all day so the idea of getting a first preview of the art for collectors does not apply, and 2) after being open from 10-5 today we were required to close our booths and cool our heels for two hours till the evening event begins. The idea was that we could go get dinner, but it does not take into account the crash that comes when you stop moving after a big festival day. So I am in my booth, I have already crashed, and I have to open back up again in 15 minutes... Bad plan. It is also quite windy tonight and I am dreading opening the front of the tent for the full gale force.Now that I have the negative comments out of the way I can say that this has been a very good show for me so far. I came a bit light and as I usually overload and schlep far more than I ever sell, it is doubly disconcerting to look in the boxes and see nothing to replace the work which has sold. I am almost to the point where I have to move things around in my display to fill the holes where pieces have sold. That has NEVER happened before: I always have more in the back.And my mother-in-law offered up a genius suggestion for my lighting dilemma: instead of shelling out the big bucks on halogen track lighting, just get some of the aluminum-domed contractor clamp-on lights. I got six and sprang for halogen bulbs for them and they are great (and cheap!).I have also had several inquiries about large panel commissions. This is a first for my Austin market too. I am accustomed to getting good commissions from my Chicago shows, it would be great if I could do the same here. So five minutes to show time. I hope it's worth staying, but even if it isn't I will count the day an overall win.__________________________________So I love Austin and the free wireless, but the electrical sucks: The breaker has blown on our row every five minutes for the past half an hour and it turns out it was my fault! I am pulling 600 watts for my six lights and I have just found out I was only to have 200... A night show with only 200 watts per booth?!? Are they high? The elctrician's recommendation was that I use the same full-spectrum daylight bulbs the artist across the street has. Her booth is as bright as it can be and each bulb only pulls 27 watts. They cost $18 per light and she has 12 of them. Hmmm, my math says that is still more than the 300 watts I am currently pulling having turned off three of my 100 watt lights... and $18 a bulb? I don't think so.On the plus side, I am no longer tired!"},

Thank you Lize Burr for inviting us over for dinner tomorrow so that I actually needed to read my artist info packet to see when we finish tomorrow. I did glance at it when I got it, but I did this festival last year so I thought I knew what to expect. I ass-u-me-d. Picture me a donkey.Turns out I had to pay for electricity (which I did because I want my laptop) because the festival has a special event from 7-10 tomorrow night! I am required to be there, required to be open, and required to have lights which I did not bring. I am loathe to go to Home Depot and buy a bunch more lights because I already have lights in Atlanta--I bought more lights for the BMAC so I have lots and lots of lights in Atlanta right now. I also will need to buy some kind of support system for them as I left that in Atlanta too. Oh joy. If I really wanted to piss off the festival organizers and never get invited back again I could just not be open tomorrow night and save myself a couple hundred bucks. Sadly I am not that kind of a professional.So a day which was going to include nothing more than a little clothes shopping, a pedicure and a leisurely stroll through the Apple Store (we did Fry's yesterday--what a treat) with a quick set-up at the end followed by the Midgetmen at the Flamingo Cantina now has the extra added joy of a lighting emergency. Oh yes, and a nice dinner tomorrow night with Lize and the girls is shot to hell. Oh well, there's always Sunday night... late... after breaking down the show... maybe not."},
{"title": "Austin Texas!", "date": "Thursday, March 30, 2006", "text": "Austin Texas, we are here and it is fine! The Austin Fine Arts Festival is this weekend, and we have a few days to chill with friends and relatives beforehand. Details about the journey can be found shortly on Stranded in the South.Coffee is Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve in an elegant black mug. Most importantly it is coffee from a Keurig coffee maker. Oh my. This is technology at its finest--exactly what I would expect to find in Austin. A fresh, hot cup of coffee in five seconds with no clean-up. For the ecologically and fiscally conscious there is a MY K-CUP reusable K-Cup filter assembly which allows you to use your own coffee (some clean-up there). The default is little individual packs of coffee that look like creamer containers that you put in the coffee maker and throw away after brewing. Music is from the dvd Aladdin which Jessie is watching on the Big tv.It is only bested by the wireless access I have from the Linksys WUSB adapter I borrowed from my friend Bryon. (He and Vanessa are also the owners of the coffee maker and our hosts for the next few days.) So for those who need to know, there is a wireless network adapter that plugs into a USB port on your computer and it can be as fast as a regular network card. It is also a lot cheaper and easier to install--as a USB device it is plug and play--than the internal solution. So I am off to Fry's today to shop. Heh. Like I needed an excuse.On the glass front, because I am in Austin I am obviously not in the studio today. However that does not mean I am not working! I got a call from two galleries yesterday whose orders I shipped before I left. One called to report four pieces broken in shipment, bummer. So I call UPS today to get the breakage investigated and reimbursed. Fortunately the pieces were all Archetype Industrials so I can easily replace them when I get back. The other gallery wants me to send them a sink on commission. They carry two other artists' fused glass sinks and when I met the owner at the BMAC she was very interested in having one in Morceaux de Verre. I have been wanting to do another one and now I have a reason!Finally, I begin work with my new web designer today. Time to get that website up and going and boy am I ready! In fact, I think I will post this and call to talk to him right now."},

The show was great. All three of us sold a good bit of work and I took on a small commission too.Tomorrow J and I leave for Austin. Got to ship orders, pack everything for the show (glass, tent, pedestals, etc.,), and pack for J and me (and the song is over so I let it go to random, I can't quit here. Oh goodie, random play brought \"Black\" by Sarah McLachlan to the top of the stack. Just what I need to get moving and motivated (not).I leave with some pics from the show Saturday. I'll have better ones soon and will post them in News & Events on the (new!) website. I was busy talking to people when there were people there so I didn't get pics of that and have to get them from Mary (one of the gallery owners). The guy in the one photo is Patrick--the other owner of the gallery. He is giving me attitude because I am not leaving my best series with them next but taking them to Texas.And on the subject of the new website: Friday I got a thank-you-for-your-business letter from the company that is going to develop it for me and in it was a little box of chocolates! The chocolate was from another little company in the same town as the website developers (Rexburg Idaho). I was very impressed and the chocolate was very good (Dave, Jessie and I scarfed it down Friday night). Last night I got them the navigation diagram and all the content for the first eight pages. I am eager to see what they come up with (and very relieved that it is not me doing it!)."},

Actually, I was so tired this morning that I had an extra large Jupiter coffee dark roast with an extra shot of espresso, and I barely even felt it. Last night (and the night before) the last kiln load went in at 1:00 am. Until 1:00 am when the kiln was cool enough to unload and re-load, I worked on organizing the content for my new web site.Today I sorted all of the work I have done in the past two weeks into piles for two of the three gallery orders I need to ship Monday, for the glass trunk show I am doing at Taylor Kinzel Gallery tomorrow,  for the Austin Fine Arts Festival next week, and for the gallery in Dallas where I am going to drop off a delivery on my way to Austin. Tonight I need to fuse the pieces for the third order which is scheduled to ship Monday...I am so exhausted right now I cannot even see straight. I spent two hours this afternoon at Taylor Kinzel setting up for the show. I will go back tomorrow morning at 10:00 and stay until 5:00 when I break down my display and pack everything up to come home. Tomorrow I also have to slump the load I am fusing tonight. And I think I have either one or two loads of Archetype Industrials scheduled to slump Sunday. Frankly I do not have the morale to look that far into the future to see.Now for the good news since I got all the whining out of the way. Today I received notification that the Museum Shop of the Art Institute of Chicago will be carrying one of my pieces in their fall catalog this year! And this is an art glass piece--not the Archetype Industrials. Now if I can just remember the formula I used to make it so I can replicate it 50 times for the initial order...The champagne is chilling in the fridge, Dave has gone to pick up dinner, and I am going to allow myself to relax and celebrate my week... at least for the next 37 minutes."},
{"title": "A Technical Advance", "date": "Thursday, March 23, 2006", "text": "Coffee has come and gone (literally). The iPod is still down in the studio and all is quiet here. Yesterday I was still so discombobulated by the (in)famous people browsing my site that I forgot to post the most important news of the day: I have broken my dependence on Thinfire! I hear the tiny cheers from other fusers across the country and can see them doing the wave in the distance--and well they should!Don't get me wrong--Thinfire is a wonderful product. But to have to use it for every firing, and to have cut enough to cover the entire shelf area in Big Bertha (almost 6' X 3')--because I always plan to fill her all the way up, but sometimes I run out of time and have to fire with gaps--is both labor and cost intensive. Then there is the clean-up: After Thinfire has been fired it turns from paper to dust held together with a fragile webbing. If you scoop carefully sometimes you can get it all up in more or less one piece. If you end up having to sweep up bits of it (90+% of the time), it sticks to the shelf and makes a dusty mess.So how did I break this vicious cycle? At the end of 2004 I bought a large ceramic fiber board to use as a kiln shelf (Duraboard HD... I think). I scoured the warm glass posts and archives to see how to prepare it for use as a shelf and to find out if I could fire bare on it or if I needed to use fiber paper (Thinfire) or fiber blanket. The answers I found were mixed enough that I just went ahead and used Thinfire for safety's sake: The last thing I wanted to do was fuse a glass piece to my brand new soft shelf and have huge chunks pull out of it when I lifted the piece up.A couple of weeks ago I broke a corner off of this shelf as I was maneuvering it back into the kiln after a deep slump. So a couple of days ago I figured, what the hell, that corner is already munged up anyway, why not try to fuse on it to see if the glass sticks. It did not! I am going to do more extensive testing, but it looks like I can fire bare with equanimity at my fusing temps. This is going to speed up my production cycle and make my studio less dusty and less harmful to my lungs. And cheaper, did I mention cheaper?"},

Isn't it great that I can be self-confident enough to put my deplorable musical taste out here? (Not that there is anything wrong with Rock Kihn Roll. After my famous visitor yesterday--I am still all aflutter--I have to be careful what I write!).The kiln is cooling from yesterday's firing and I am losing my faith in computers--I mean, it must be the computer in the kiln that is the problem. It's *always* the computer that goes wrong. (Postmodernism. Yep. Dave: \"You keep usin' tha' word. I don' think that word means what you think it means.\") Anyway, I could have used 2-3 more minutes on the high soak. The day before's fuse could have used 1-2 more minutes. This is the same schedule that came out perfectly (with the same piece composition and configuration) just a few days ago. The only thing remotely different--if I were to look for a cause other than the computer--is the quantity of glass I am fusing.Yesterday I was so giddy from my brush with fame (and finally getting the book contract) that my afternoon was completely derailed. I was still putting the kiln load in when Dave got home at 5:30. So instead of packing it to the gunwales (pronounced 'gunnulls'... isn't English great?) with unallocated pieces that I could use for shows and art fairs--and taking an hour or more to do it, I just fired exactly what I had scheduled and it was a smidge emptier. Whatever. I am done fusing for the week so I will just have to note the results in the firing log and come back to the problem when I get back from Texas.Today I cut, grind and begin slumping the umpteen gazillion sushi plates that I fused over the past few days. I have got to buy more of those molds. Right now I can do either 12 plates or 4 platters and four plates at a time and the molds do not take up even half the kiln. So I fire half empty and am filled with guilt at the energy I am squandering to heat the whole kiln--as well as the extra time it takes to get it done. *sigh* I just got an order from Bullseye. I really don't want to order again (come to think of it I haven't even paid for the last order yet) but somehow I am almost out of #2 neo-lavender opal frit, running low on several other colors (what is it going to take to accurately predict how much of which colors I will use?) and I have less clear irid than I thought I did.Today I FINALLY get my accounts receivable updated and my web content materials organized and shipped out. Having someone else with the responsibility of designing and implementing the website is a tremendous weight off my mind. Now I just need to solve the shed and computer problems and I will be set. Mass-marketing efforts are put on hold till after the book is finished. I am stupid but not suicidal.To get me moving, \"Ronnie and Neil\" by the Drive-By Truckers just came on the Pod. Now there is some music I can be proud of."},
{"title": "It's Official!", "date": "Tuesday, March 21, 2006", "text": "I have a final book contract. The book is due out Fall 2007. (sound of sleeves rolling up) We're having fun now!Coffee in the New York Skyline mug, \"Shakin'\" by Eddie Money on the iPod (it's not called the Shame playlist for nothing). It has already been a Morning (see Stranded in the South for details). Now it is time to put on the glass artist hat, hit the ground and mix metaphors.Yesterday was a big day. I virtually met a woman (talked on the phone) who makes natural soaps and body products and supplies one of the galleries I am in. The gallery owner recommended I call her about information on avenues for expansion into the department store/large catalog marketspace. The soap and personal products are her weekend gig (in addition to two small children and a husband). During the week she is a product stylist with--again--her own styling business. She was a font of information and in addition to all the good tips she gave me, she gave me one lightbulb-exploding one. We were talking about tradeshows and she recommended that I do the Atlanta Gift Mart in January--not with all of my work, just the Archetype Industrial pieces which I am ready to take to a new market. We talked a bit about booth design and I said I was really happy with what I did for the Buyer's Market of American Craft. She said it was good I had developed a strong booth design as establishing corporate identity is key in this space.She went on to say that a great e-commerce website is also crucial (and her soap site is gorgeous). I had to admit that my website pretty much, well, no way around it, it sucks. And there is no e-commerce in it at all. Now here is the lightbulb exploder: She recommended giving photos of my booth to whoever does my website so they can see how I present my work and design the site to match. Wow. It is so obvious and makes so much sense. I have struggled (and brought hell to the lives of friends and family who have tried to help me with my website) for the past three years trying to build a site about who *I* am and what I see as the roots of the studio (Siyeh Peak/Pass, Glacier National Park, Montana) and I completely ignored the work. My work is bright, primary, visceral colors, and my websites have been muted, soft earth and nature tones. Maybe that reflects me, but it does NOT reflect my work.We talked a bit more about website design firms and she pointed me to BizAtomic. I filled out their on-line form and Nicholas called me to talk over my needs. After about an hour of his time, he said that maybe their service were of a higher level than I need right now. The only e-commerce I want to be able to do is have galleries with wholesale accounts be able to login, see the current catalog and order on-line. Most of those accounts have Net 30 terms and even those who don't I need to call about scheduling anyway so I can get the credit card info then. So I don't need to be able to process payments on-line.Now here's the kicker from them: Nicholas said that they often recommend another company, EZNetTools, for customers who need fewer features and would like to keep the costs down a bit, but still want excellent quality and service. He gave me their phone number and the name of a person to talk to, told me their monthly e-commerce hosting fees, and said he would call me this afternoon to see how it went and what I decided to do! He said that I can always start there, and if my needs outgrow their ability, I can move to BizAtomic. And it's not even like they are friendly rivals in the same place: BizAtomic is in Florida and EZNetTools is in Idaho.So I called EZNetTools and the long and short of it is I have hired a web development company to create and host an e-commerce site for me with everything I had hoped to have this year for a price I can afford. And the process was so slick! As we finished talking about the costs, etc., my sales rep gave me a url that began with his name, and when I went there, I saw my quote in detail! As I read it over I saw an item that wasn't right and when I brought it to his attention, he corrected it and it disappeared from my screen. I printed it out, signed it and faxed it back, and we start development today!I told Dave this whole story last night and, nerd that he is, he kept going on darkly about how they were all post-modern operators ala Bruce Sterling: constantly looking ahead for the next angle, the next deal, and going to take me for all they could get. I don't think I ever got across to him that at least the woman I talked to first gave me all the information and advice free for nothing--no expectation of future gain.So a great big thank-you goes out to everyone who has helped me, offered to help me and commiserated with me about my website travails. I hope the worst is behind me now.On other topics (because of course that isn't all I have to do right now) I fused a full kiln load yesterday and it came out great. In the load are a 15\" bowl, 2 11X7 sushi platters (fused together) 20 sushi plates (fused in sets of five), 4-8\" plates (fused together), a 7.5\" dish, and a 16X24 hanging panel. Whoo hoo!Even though I was planning to do two slump loads today I am not going to have time so I am going to do the last fuse load of the week. Today I have paisleys and Morceaux de Verre to do--and I get to try out my new Silberscnitt circle cutter for the paisleys. I also need to get my accounts receivable updated in Quickbooks, order plate stands, mail invoices, fax w-2's to the accountant and get the first batch of web content to the website developers. I still haven't decided what to do about the computer thing, and I still haven't heard back from The Publisher about book contract signing and book scheduling, but those and unpacking/sorting my current studio inventory can wait till tomorrow."},

I left the Pod in the studio and am just running shuffle on the shame playlist on iTunes. It doesn't quite suck.Dave is home from Austin and he has wireless so that means it is the internal wireless modem in my laptop that doesn't work. (A break for a rant) This is a two year-old Compaq laptop. The battery lasts 10 minutes when it is unplugged and now it is no longer wireless. To fix these two things will cost me about $250. And fix them I must as I am about to head off to Texas for a show and I will need both battery and network. This is after replacing the power cord in February in Philadelphia ($80). I am reaching critical mass on the amount I wish to spend on this machine. It is slower than dirt and manipulating any image files takes FOREVER.On the other hand, I do not wish to buy another windows machine. I am ready to move back to Mac (my first laptop was a Mac DuoDock in 1992). But I am not financially ready for that move (machine and software), nor do I have the time right now to invest in the OS ramp-up. It is a great quandary. There is also the whole issue of what Mac to buy: After many years in winblows I know the processor speeds and types, the amount of RAM, etc. that I should get. The Mac numbers in comparison seem so... small. The processor speeds in the mid-range are 1.5-1.6 GHz.  Windows machines are in the mid 2's now. Yes, I am more than willing to believe they are less efficient, but it makes comparing difficult.Okay, I found some common numbers with the same processor (the new dual core thingie). I built a Dell system and an Apple system with *exactly* the same options wherever possible (different screen size and battery life) and the Dell came out to be $300 more! Of course either option was over $3,000. Shed, laptop, shed, laptop: Both are necessary business components and the shed is also a necessary personal component to keep my husband sane (stuff is everywhere right now--though not in the cat's bathroom closet! See Stranded in the South for details on the great electronics purge). So I will do what I always do when faced with a technology purchase choice... Help, Johnathon!As it is Monday I am cleaning up details of work left undone on Friday: Orders to place, bills to pay, testimonials to write... and a follow-up call to the Publisher to find out if they still want me to write a book for them! I got the operations manager and she passed the contract on to the publisher (an actual person with that title, as near as I can tell) a few weeks ago and doesn't know what the status is. I said time's a wasting and Neiman Marcus waits for no man so as tempus fugit, what is going on?!? Someone will get back to me. The writing task (not to mention this blogging) has an impact on the laptop issue too. (I do not use \"impact\" as a verb. Alexander Haig was just flat wrong.)I worked all weekend fusing 25 sushi plates, a 16X24\" hanging panel, a sushi platter, 2-8\" dishes, a 12\" bowl and a 16X13 S curve platter on Sunday and slumping 10 sushi plates, the sushi platter, one dish, the bowl and the S-curve piece on Sunday. Now I need to run the hanging panel to Dixie Glasshoppers to be drilled and then I need to fill the kiln with another fuse load.I am in a glass trunk show at Taylor Kinzel Gallery this weekend and need to get a lot more new work done--interspersed with the three gallery orders which need to go out before I leave for Texas next Wednesday.

{"title": "One Damn Thing or Another... and a Good Idea", "date": "Friday, March 17, 2006", "text": "Just finished the dregs of an extra large house blend from Jupiter Coffee with an extra shot of espresso. Dave is, of course, in Austin and I am helpless in the face of the coffee maker. \"Voulez Vous\" by ABBA is on the iPod. However when I sat down to write this post , the song playing was \"Slide\" by the Goo Goo Dolls. But I didn't have an internet connection so I couldn't get to this page to start writing. I went through \"The Key\" by REO Speedwagon, \"You Should be Dancing\" by the Bee Gees, \"Venus\" covered by Bananarama, and \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood during the internet system administration phase of the morning. Now I am in the office with my laptop hardwired to the router listening to \"Bat out of Hell\" by Meatloaf. In my defense, though the music is on shuffle, it is shuffling through my secret shame playlist as I started the morning (after getting Jessie up, dressed, fed and to school) by putting an entire load of Archetype Industrial (AI) pieces for a couple of gallery orders into the kiln and I do that best with the Pod on 'inspirational and fast'.Anyway, back to the internet situation for a moment. Either the router's wireless access is kaput or my laptop wireless network card is fried. I will have to wait till Dave gets home and there is a larger sample of computers to test to determine for sure. In the meantime I have a cord, am not happy about it, and wanted to share that state.What I really wanted to post about today was not the inevitable other s*it that mucks up a small business owner's day (like technology failures--don't ever dare say or even think that you are getting ahead because the demons of technology will strike with a vengeance and put you so far behind you will see your ancestors childhoods before you). No, what I wanted to post about was the idea I had while I was grinding the edges of the AI's before putting them in the kiln (while listening to some really great tuneage including INXS, the Drive by Truckers, Bruce Springsteen and Jeffrey Osborne).\"I Ran\" by a Flock of Seagulls ushers in the idea: I am ready to supply the masses and move into the department store market. Oh not for everything I do. No, I want to get the AI pieces out to the world. I LOVE them. They are all made from machine-cast glass which I cut, grind, slump and combine into sets of functional ware. I make everything from sushi sets (I can now even do the soy cups) to dinnerware. There are sets of tapas plates, rectangular serving trays in a variety of sizes, 8\", 10\" and 12\" square plates... I could even do the Seder sets in them now that I have created the molds.And they are so inexpensive! They are perfect for just starting twenty-somethings who want stuff that is a step up from Target and can't really afford it. They are also great for chic parties for the forty-somethings (like me and my friends). In fact I started doing them again after going to a poker party at a friend's house and he was using an AI piece I made in 1988 to serve sushi. I was struck by how well the design and idea (and the piece!) had held up--they are classic and modern at the same time. They are called Archetype Industrial pieces because they perfectly evoke the feel of the Art Deco period and the dawn of the age of technology. They are perfect for someone who is an artist AND a geek (or an artist married to a geek...) somewhat like Captain America. He would have used these plates. It is the combination and juxtaposition of the different tints, textures and weights of the various glasses combined in a set which make them special. If all the plates were of the same glass it would be, well, machine-made and boring!Even more important than the issues of demographic interest and cost is the production question and part of the reason I am not really making a living as a production glass artist is that I can make far more than I sell. Even though I am now in (or will be in once all the orders I am working on have shipped) 24 galleries and do five retail art fairs a year including the One of a Kind Show in Chicago (a big one) AND get an average of four-six large commissions a year, I am still not producing at full capacity or even close to it.I know, I know, I whine a lot about being behind and not having time to try out new ideas, but a good part of that is that some work takes a lot more mental energy that other work. The AI's can really be done in my sleep--or I could even hire someone to help with them. The steady income that they could generate would go a long way to making the studio self-supporting--even with the cost and hassle of having an employee.Of course I would have to get another kiln for really big production, and I would totally take over the garage for glass and mold storage and new kiln placement. The last time I bought glass for these pieces I got four cases, 2000 lbs of glass. For serious production I would need to double that. And I would want to store it as close to the drop-off point for the shipper as possible. Last time I moved all 2000 lbs one sheet at a time over two days all by myself from the parking pad outside through the garage and into the studio. Boy was I sore! (On the plus side, this kind of a workout obviates the need for a gym membership and is free.)"},

So I clicked on the icon and this is what I found:______________________________ Wednesday, August 24, 2005   An auspicious day to begin a new artist journal. I just ordered two books from A.com on being an artist. This was in response to a post about self-doubt by another glass artist on Warm Glass. In it she talked about the inspiration/motivation for her pieces—their spiritual history if you will. I read it and realized that I don’t have a spiritual history or a motivation for my work. It is beautiful, therefore it is. Does that mean it is not Art because there is no meaning behind it? Should I start trying to make art based on things I feel and care about? If so, I will become an environmental artist, and most of that work I find schlock. It also doesn’t lend itself to what I like to do. Many of the artists on the list don’t like production work—they just want to do inspired art pieces. I like production. Does that mean I’m not an artist?  ______________________________Well, it sounds like me. All except that part about most environmental art being schlock. I have no idea what I was thinking there.Fortunately today I am in a more secure mental state (probably because I have been journaling-for-the-new-milennium, i.e., blogging, for the past few months and production work has been really going well). So I put out there that I wrote this, and now I delete the file, delete the icon, and move on to getting my child ready for school and finishing my firing schedule for my upcoming trunk show (3/25-26), my first retail fair of the season (The Austin Fine Arts Festival in Austin, TX 4/1-2), and the orders for seven new galleries that I have to get out by the end of April.

{"title": "For Barbara", "date": "Wednesday, March 15, 2006", "text": "These are quick pics of a commission I did for a couple here in Decatur last year.

Barbara, you come and hang in my studio for a weekend, and I'll show you how to get these REALLY crisp lines. (Then I'll come to your studio for a weekend and you can show me how you lay out your lovely figurative layerings.)For those interested souls, here are a couple of pics of the dinnerware commission I have been writing about. There are eight 10\" plates, eight 8\" plates and a 15X7 rectangular platter in the set. There are also two spare plates--one 10\" and one 8\" in case of breakage. Looking at the photos, can you tell which of the two 10\" plates and which of the two 8\" plates shown were in the last nearly disastrous firing? Hint: I can't either. :-)Coffee in the Atlanta  Botanical Garden go cup, no music, just the sound of the cat's drinking fountain gurgling because it is low on water. In quick response to Bill, yes, there is a specific set of Starbuck's mugs called the Skyline series. They also have the new City Scenes mugs with pictures of the cities represented, but my particular obsession is the Skyline series.The first news of the day, which is overwhelmingly good, is that the Seder plates are not ruined and neither are the molds. 1425+degrees and no kiln wash. Must be ceramic board and I may start experimenting with fusing directly on it (it has a really smooth finish). The downside is that the board I have is only 1/2\" thick and therefore not sturdy enough to be a shelf. One of the paisleys is definitely ruined, and the other might be. The dinner plates look to be fine (whew!).The bad news of the morning is that I did not get into the 57th Street Art Fair in Chicago in June. I am not too surprised: They have a grandfather system which means that if you get accepted once you get to be in forever without jurying again. This limits the number of new artists accepted to about 50. Last year when I looked, they only had three glass artists total--none of them with kilnformed or functional work. I am also still wait listed for the Dogwood Festival. I understand I am the first person on the waitlist in the glass category so all is not lost, but the deadline for payment of fees has already passed so my chances are slim. And finally, I STILL have not heard back form the Publisher regarding my book contract. I sent them a gentle reminder that I am WAITING earlier this week and they have not yet replied. How swiftly the winds of schedule change from over to under full.I end with my glass all the way full: If a bunch of things drop off my schedule for the year, it leaves me with more time to experiment with new techniques and ideas, work in my yard, and laze in the hammock reading. There is no bad-case scenario there."},
{"title": "Pride Goeth Before a Fall", "date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2006", "text": "This is the story of what happens when I crow about the beauty of something I made. I do not know yet if the ending is happy, I am betting it will not be.So I put the last two plates from my dinnerware commission, the last Seder set and two unassigned 12\" paisley plates in the kiln to slump. I decided to be tricky and put in two top-temp soaks to mimic the extreme effort I went through manually last night. What I *meant* to do was ramp up to 1225 at a moderate rate, soak for 20 minutes and then ramp to 1265--again moderately, and soak for another 20 minutes.I *meant* to set the timer so I could check towards the end of the second soak to make sure it was enough, but I forgot. But it would not have mattered, the damage would already have been done when the timer went off. And as it was, I went down and looked in before the second ramp was done.What I actually programmed into the kiln computer was a ramp up to 1225, soak for 20 and then a ramp to *1465* with a soak for 20... When I went down to check to see how things were going, the kiln was between 1425 and 1445 degrees. I don't know the exact temp because I freaked out when I saw it and immediately turned the kiln off and whipped up the lid (I have asbestos gloves doncha know). Everything was glowing an evil cherry red (pieces slumping are not supposed to glow) and one of the 12\" paislies had begun to puddle towards the middle of the mold. The glass, you see, is *fused* at 1440 degrees. I almost never go as high as 1465 for anything, much less slumping.The best that will happen is that everything will be a bit more slumped (puddled) than I intended, but will not be too noticeable with the organic edges. More likely, if I am really lucky, I will get the additional slumping along with some kiln wash stuck to the bottom of the dinnerware and the paislies. The penultimate worst case has the ceramic board stuck to the bottom of the Seder plates and the molds ruined, but the pieces ok. The ultimate big-time bummer has the pieces all too slumpoed to salvage and the Seder molds ruined. This would be exceptionally bad as I am out of one of the frits (crushed glass) I need to do the dinnerware commission and would have to crush some of my own in order to re-create those pieces. I would also miss my deadline for delivery of the Seder plates to the Jewish Museum of New York.Positive karmic thoughts and prayers would be really nice right about now.I couldn't help post one more picture of the first Seder set. I am so happy with how it turned out!  Coffee from Jupiter Coffee (an extra large with a shot of espresso) in the Chicago Skyline mug, \"I'm a Believer\" covered by Smash Mouth on the iPod. Both are *very* appropriate!Well I wrestled her to the ground and got the pin, Big Bertha that is. It took four schedule modifications and until 10:00 last night, but I got the Seder plates to slump perfectly. Now I just need to be able to replicate it today. My problem (in so many aspects of life) is that I must have it NOW. Good things may come to those who wait, but those of us who need faster than instant gratification will probably never find out.Kilnformer extraordinaire Bill Zweifel counseled me on the benefits of the three-hour top temp hold for the slump at the BMAC this year, and I just.cannot.make.myself do it! Barb, I know you slump the same way, and I should probably have patience and try it, but I just keep thinking that if I don't up the temp a bit, the glass will never fall.Last night I thought I would be tricky and stack the deck in my favor. Instead of slumping onto the 1\" thick ceramic board on the floor of the kiln, I put a 2\" vermiculite board on top of the ceramic board just where the Seder plates would go. This means that the pieces were 2\" closer to the elements which makes them slump better. (I catch myself in the use of the word \"better\" there. Technically it is not necessarily \"better\". It is faster, and as we have determined above, faster is not always better. Faster can cause your edges to pull in and up and your piece to deform.) However the Seder plates were not the only pieces slumping in Bertha last night, and I did not want the others to overslump during this intensive slump cycle: They were in taller molds and therefore initially closer to the elements.I started with a top soak at 1225 degrees for 20 minutes. The plates laughed at me, little silicon chortles emanated from the kiln when I opened it at the end of the soak to find the barest dip in the surfaces of the small plates. So I sent the temp to 1240 for 20 minutes. This was better, but with 4.5 minutes left in the soak, the little plates were still stubbornly holding out and up. I determinedly rolled up my metaphoric sleeves and upped the temp to 1250 for 15 minutes. The little plates struggled, but fell a bit more. With 3 minutes left I made my last bid: I upped the temp to 1465 for 18 minutes (the remaining 3 in the 1250 soak and an additional 15).I did not stay around for the results. I went to bed thinking it would either work and I would do set #2 tomorrow (I ended up making only one set of molds) or it wouldn't and I would have to slump both sets in the medium kiln tomorrow. And, drum roll please, it worked!So today I will slump the second Seder set and a miscellany of other pieces, and I will ship it all out tomorrow. Three new gallery orders down and ten to go."},

My firing this weekend was just about perfect with a top hold of 1440 for 17 minutes. The right side is still cooler than the middle or the left. I am tempted to get a fan for more even heating (and better dispersal of the thinfire burnoff which devits the bottom of Bullseye opals if I fire with the lid tightly sealed). But I do not have the margin right now for any more kiln maintenance.Today I cut the final molds for the seder sets and begin slumping them. And I am in a quandry on this one: I have enough new ceramic board to cut two full mold sets (14 pieces). However this may be a one-off project as they may never order them again (even though I am not charging them for r&d including mold creation these are going to be fairly expensive sets and may not sell). Cutting two full sets takes twice as much time as cutting one (duh)--a not inconsiderable amount of time--and will just about use up my one remaining sheet of ceramic board. However I do not even remember where or when I bought that ceramic board so it's not like I have a lot of demand for it...On the other hand, if I cut two sets I would be able to slump all of the pieces today in Big Bertha instead of over two days in the medium kiln and then I could ship tomorrow--three days early--which would really please the client. Of course if I got up really early tomorrow I could do the second slump (the first being done today) in the medium kiln and get the pieces out by late afternoon tomorrow with just the one set of molds...It's only Monday morning and my brain hurts already. I guess I will just cut the first set, see how long it takes, and if it is a real pain to cut, I will only cut one and do an extra firing. I am cutting one-piece molds for all the pieces this time because even though they are more difficult to cut, they are easier to use as they do not have any seams to fill. Today when I cut I will wear gloves (and a dust mask, of course). That ceramic board really makes me itch after no time at all."},

Yumm. I am culinarily spoiled. Now I have to put a load in Big Bertha, wrestle with her firing schedule and beat it into submission, and deliver to Creative Spirit Gallery here in Decatur. Becky has been patiently waiting for me to bring back all the work I took for the Buyer's Market show in Philadelphia (and she has a big commission check for me--makes a Saturday delivery worthwhile!).So the little plate fully slumped in the medium kiln and surprisingly, it did not pull in or lift up any further. I may just make the rims on the little plates 3/4\" as they will already have organic/unfinished edges and will therefore have thinner uneven edges. A note on timing: I got a not-totally-straight drop but as much as I wanted in 15 minutes at 1265 degrees.Barbara, thanks for the heads up on funky thermal shocking: I have not mixed plaster and mullite before, and these molds are cermaic board fired on ceramic board (and no kiln wash is necessary!)."},
{"title": "A Technical Post for Kilnformers Only", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2006", "text": "This is going to be very technical post (which I have been trying unsuccessfully to publish since this morning...) which will cause the eyes of any non-glass person to glaze over and fall out so skip it unless you are interested in making your own molds with rims for slumping glass.Coffee in the New York Skyline mug, the iPod song WAS Natural Beauty by Neil Young from Harvest Moon, but I decided I would probably slit my own throat if I listened to it any longer and switched (almost purely randomly) to Riding the Storm Out by REO Speedwagon. My husband is fond of saying the golden age of rock 'n' roll is 16 and today I am just proving him right...Yesterday I made my first pass at slumping pieces for seder sets. I have been commissioned to do two of these sets and am finding interesting challenges. The thickness of glass I am using is 1/4\" to 3/8\" (more than two sheets of Bullseye and less than three) as I am using frit and every piece comes out slightly different in thickness. The parameters of the commission are to make a base plate with about a 1-1/2\" rim and six smaller plates--each with a rim--which should fit inside the big plate. The little plates should be about 4\" X 4\" square.I initially figured that the base plate should be 16\" X 12\" and I planned to use mullite (clay) shelf segments as the mold material. Yesterday I was rummaging through my stuff and I found some duraboard (ceramic fiber) pieces from old kiln lids and shelves and decided to try them first. Duraboard is a relatively soft material that can be cut with a utility knife, smoothed with sandpaper and has a fine grain for smooth detail. Mullite is very hard--I cut it with a tile saw and would need to use one of my diamond grinding bits for glass to round the top edges down.For mold assembly, I tried two different approaches. For the big plate--because I saw a possibility for a need to change dimensions and because of the size of the scraps I had on hand--I used four strips 2\" X 18\" X 1\", sanded down one top edge, and laid them out so that each piece would be one side of the plate in the appropriate length. I filled the seams with kiln wash paste.For the small plate, I cut a one-piece mold out of a single piece of 1/2\" thick Duraboard (or it could have been HD board--I have some of both lying around and have no need to tell which is which) and smoothed down the top inside edges with sandpaper.For the glass I used scrap from a large piece that I did last summer and cooled too quickly causing it to break. (It is a sad thing when you have pieces of glass lying around which qualify as \"scrap\" and which are over 16\" X 12\".) However I made a serendipitous error in cutting the scrap: I ignored the measure twice, cut once principle becasue I was in a hurry and ended up cutting the big plate 15\" X 12\". You will see the serendipity of this error in the slumping result.Into Big Bertha they went with two other large pieces and I extended the slump at the top by 10 minutes (1225 degrees for 15 minutes). The results were less than successful. Only one piece fully slumped even with the extended time. As one of the other large pieces (the control group if you will) did not fully slump either it is clearly not just the new molds (more fun with Big Bertha's firing schedules)--though they presented their own issues. It has been almost two years since I made molds like this for a dinnerware commission and for an Ikebana dish and I arrogantly forgot the lessons I learned that time.Most molds for slumping glass have a slope to them--they do not just drop off abruptly as glass does not like to just drop off abruptly. So when you make a mold like I did you have to figure in the width of the slope (key when you are counting on a particular surface area inside the plate to put food or other little plates on). The actual flat surface size in the bottom of the big plate turned out to be just under 7\" X 11\"--Probably not big enough to hold the six 4\" X 4\" plates.There is also a relationship between the width of the rim and the height of the drop that you need to take into account to avoid the edges of the glass pulling in and lifting up as it slumps. Here is where the serendipity came in: The sides of the big plate which I cut cirrectly had 1-1/2\" rims and they pulled in a bit (1/4\" in the corners and 1/2\" in the middle--still too noticeable) but did not lift. But the edges that I cut too short (resulting in only a 1\" rim) pulled in and lifted up.I take away from this experiment a comfortable guess at the ratio between width and height as 2 to 1 for glass of a thickness 1/4\" to 3/8\", and a conservative estimate of 2.5 to 1.The smaller plates were more difficult yet. I only planned on a 1/2\" rim for them with a 1/2\" drop and even though they did not slump nearly all the way they were already pulled in and lifted up. I am currently fully slumping the control plate and the smaller plate in the medium kiln and I am eager (really I am) to see how bad the little plates look at a full slump.Now I have to redo my size calculations completely. The 1\" drop on the large plate did not add to the balance of the piece and adds unnecessary complications so I am going to decrease it to 1/2\". I will leave the rim at 1-1/2\" for that piece. For the little plates I need to increase the rim size to 1\" and I will need to see what this does to the interior flat base of the plate--it might not be balanced anymore at a 4\" total size. If I have to increase the size of the small plates for balance I will also need to increase the size of the big one.Passover is coming. I better get a move on."},

Actually I shouldn't joke about that as my husband is very serious about making me coffee every morning before he leaves for work even though he does not drink it himself.So yesterday's firing was a success. The same slightly-longer-than-usual schedule that I had been using in the kiln prior to the addition of the new lid produced exactly the same results with the new lid. So today I make seder plate molds and slump a bunch of stuff. Tomorrow I ship out a load to Florida and two more will go out Monday to Wisconsin and NYC. Tomorrow I will also deliver the three pieces given away at Jessie's pre-school auction last weekend and *finally* deliver my consignment pieces back to my two local galleries.Of course that means I have to sort through all my work today and divvy it up. I don't know why I have been dragging my feet on that task. I know why I have been recalcitrant about getting the bills out (BORING), but sorting and divvying means touching, stroking, admiring pretty pieces of kiln-formed glass. There is no bad there. There is also no available surface on which to do the divvying either as the studio is a MESS! I need a shed so the garage can officially become Studio 2."},

Well it actually began at 7:40 when I wrangled my sleepy child out of bed and into the bathroom to get ready for (pre)school. I then took my spouse to the train station, my child to school and stayed at school with my power drill to put up a miniblind in her classroom. I am Buildings & Grounds doncha know.Now I blog, get caught up on bills and finances and I wait for the Maytag repairman to get here and Fix My Washer!

The iPod keeps me company as John Mellencamp is introduced by They Might be Giants and followed by the Midgetmen. It doesn't usually take me three songs to write a paragraph, I must be off my game and still in the timeslip from the other day.Monday ended with three impossible tasks crammed into one little hour and as I am not Dr. Who and have no Tardis, they did not get done. Yesterday morning bright and early my new next-door neighbor Shane and his brother-in-law Roy came over and spent almost the entire day putting my new kiln lid on for me. It turned out to be quite a chore as the kiln was missing the four posts for the lid clamps and the electric box on the top middle was too large to fit between the steel framing from the old kiln. The framing is necessary to keep the lid from warping at high temps so I ran it around the corner to my local body shop and paid $75 cash for a piss-poor un and re-weld of two joints. I hope they are better than they actually look as the welds need to hold the weight of the lid on my counterweight system...So far a boring, technical post and it reflects a tedious, boring day. There were two bright spots in it (or one bright spot and one really surreal spot) and they are Stranded in the South today as they are not glass related. For glass related, the Jewish Museum in New York is getting anxious for their Seder sets, I haven't finished the last two pieces of the dinnerware commission yet, I have yet to sort my inventory for shipment to distant and delivery to local galleries, I am at least 30 days past due on paying some bills--due to time and not financial constraints thankfully, my website is still really dismal (untouched), and the book? Well, at least that one is not my fault: I am STILL waiting to hear back on the *contract* edits I sent in before going to California two weeks ago.On the plus side, I am up-to-date on shipping the orders I took at the BMAC and I am not yet behind on fusing upcoming orders. So I wait this morning for Maytag (and get caught up on blogs and bills), and this afternoon I put new fiber blanket in the top of each side of the kiln, drill for and install and the latch posts for the lid, hook up the counter-weight, and do a fuse. I did the burn-in firing last night (and boy did it stink!).I debated doing a test-fuse today, but the controller did not change, nor did the size of the box or the placement of the shelves. All I have done is put in new (and probably more efficient) elements and upped the insulation so I am going to go against safest practices and jump in with a real firing. Worst case, I lose some glass and waste some time, best case, I am on-time for all of my current fusing obligations."},

This activity will clearly extend into tomorrow.

There is no music (unless you count the faint strains of \"Annie\" wafting down from my Mom’s room).It is Friday. I was on vacation Monday and Tuesday. I am a small business owner: Being on vacation means there are two days when things needed to get done and nothing got done. And that is the glass half empty, some would say. I say that yesterday morning it would have been a relief to get up, get dressed and commute into a job. Working for someone else--no matter how responsible the position--never requires as much effort, energy, thought and relentless reinvention of the wheel as working for yourself does. You can (and probably do) fudge a bit to your boss about why you missed a deadline (when the real reason is that you are still in post-vacation mode) but you can't fudge to yourself. Actually, I am sure there are people who can--self-delusion is not uncommon in the population (it is common--as my mother was quick to point out when I read that paragraph to her--in our elected officials... shrubbery comes to mind). It is, however, rare among business owners of businesses which survive.So today I looked in the kiln and the slump... wasn't. A bowl which was scheduled to be shipped to the Art Institute in Chicago today for arrival *and jurying* Tuesday had to go back into the kiln for another slump. I am not hopeful I can fire and ship it today, but I will try to remain optimistic. Worst case, I can probably mail it through the post office tomorrow. (I have to work Saturdays, why can't UPS?!?). That makes the second firing this week that did not complete successfully in Big Bertha. I have the new lid for her (which has been outside still in the crate in the rain sometimes covered by plastic, sometimes not for the past month and a bit) and will probably need to get it unpacked and installed on Saturday--before the birthday parties, school auction and Oscar-filled weekend... I may have to break into some of the wine we schlepped back from California. I knew it wouldn't last.Last night I wrote letters, updated mailing lists, mail-merged and packaged up catalogs and price lists till 11:30. Doing the small business owner marketing thing, I looked up all the galleries which purchased from me last year at the BMAC shows--none of whom I saw this time--and sent them \"hey I missed you at the show\" letters and packets. Yep, that's right, I am soliciting MORE work. I felt like just skipping it, but that would not be the responsible small business owner thing to do. Yes, I have a lot of production work now and through the middle of June, but eventually I will be ready for more (unless I have slit my throat between now and then) and my work has to stay vibrant and exciting in the minds of my clients in the meantime.So I'm off to mail packets, create spreadsheets of work schedules, unpack a shipment from Bullseye, unpack from the BMAC, inventory the finished pieces I have and schedule them for re-delivery to the local galleries I emptied before the BMAC, and prepare for a big week of firing next week."},

Due to mixing up the end date for the BMAC and double-booking my time, I drove eight hours and then worked in the studio for eight hours fusing dinnerware which must ship tomorrow (I will slump it today). My spouse was incredibly supportive throughout (as was my mother who drove 2-3 of the eight hours so I could rest a bit). That kind of a day is already tough, but the day before had already exhausted the reserves: We did the show all day, then broke everything down and carted it a block and a half in multiple dolly-loads and loaded up the car and then drove to Richmond arriving at 11:30 pm. Waiting to bring the car into the dock for load-out would have added at least an hour so we put in the physical effort instead.So, drum roll please, how did I do? I had my first five-figure show! I added 13 new galleries--including the shop of the Jewish Museum in New York--from coast to coast. I can't wait to get a gallery map up on my website.

They were just shy of a full day late. It was a nightmare, I had wine with lunch to get over it.There was not much I could do until the walls got up so Mom and I had to stay and work until 10:30 pm. We got all the glass up, and then we came back to the room and I worked on my catalog till 1:00 am. Then back up at 7:00 am today to print some more pages out (they had to be turned over and sent back through the printer so I couldn't just load it all last night). Some of the buyer's today were a bit cranky that I didn't have my work priced for the first four hours. In fact I ended up redoing my price list entirely and changing some of the prices after I handed out some catalog packets (with price lists in them)... Oh well, if anyone I gave a now obsolete price list to comes back and orders from me tomorrow, I'll give him the lowest price from either price list (some prices went up, some went down--I just needed to simplify!).And I already have two orders! They are not big, but they are new galleries and one of them is in a new state for me--New Jersey! I need to get my gallery map up on my website. Priority, priority, priority (after BMAC orders, commissions and the book...). And Kathleen Hogan from Chicago's One of a Kind Show and Sale stopped by my booth to drop off a few applications postcards that they are sending out for the show. My work is on the front of the postcard!!Friday, February 17, 10:43 pm.So the weary road warrior goes to bed. It was a long day, but a good one and there will be real sleep tonight.

I did not get the dinnerware commission fused, which will make Tuesday and Wednesday after my return from Philly before leaving for LA exciting (the dinnerware must be in Wisconsin by 3/4 and I will be in California drinking heavily from 2/23 -2/28). I made a cool display stand out of PVC and spray painted it black this afternoon. It is a bit wobbly, but I will cable-tie it to a table and it will be fine.So I sit here after a few glasses of sangria and I organize my lists. I have a list of glass pieces to show, a list of tools to take, a list of display materials... a list of everything and anything I might need for seven days away from home At The Show. Andrea, my savior, has offered to help me with my website after The Show and I am going to take her up on it. There are just some things woman was not meant to do alone. She and her husband will also be in LA from Chicago for the long weekend of debauchery (2/23-2/28) and I am so looking forward to seeing her.So back to the show. It is tightly timed, but I think it will all work out. I will take my laptop and printer and finish the catalogs in the hotel and print them all out there. I bought yards and yards of red organza today to drape my booth with. I have white foamcore walls and they have a tacky potential that I hope to mitigate with the red organza. My carpet is also red and my display pieces are black and white. I have a 10 X 15 booth all to myself this time, and I am a bit afraid. But Nancy and Sara will be there, and my Mom is coming with me as my faithful assistant--Igor, Tonto, George AND Bess (get that reference, I dare you), Robin, Toto, Laurel, and Jerry all rolled into one, that's my Mom.And when I get back I will worry about book contracts and kiln lid replacements and how to get all the orders from the BMAC out while writing a book and building a pond and preparing for a busy art fair season. Tonight, I have my tunnel vision on and all I see is the BMAC...and lots of snow.D is for Doom. No mug and music report this morning--no time for either. The new website is up. At least the front page is. 14 hours yesterday and all I have to show for it is a front page which looks great in Firefox, not so great in IE and is untested in Netscape (though I would love feedback from anyone out there who has Netscape and is willing to give it a gander). Hard though I tried, I could not get the pop-up menus to work. Many tears of frustration and despair were expended yesterday... and there are undoubtedly more to come. I keep thinking I will just hire someone to do it, but every time I go down that route the person I interview for the job scares me away. He (no, I have not interviewed any women willing to take on the project) either is too expensive or disparages my design and wants to do it in his own style. Whose website is it anyway?Now off to Ikebana, a gallery pick-up, get new front tires on the van and a snow scraper at Sam's Club, buy the lights from Home Depot and dog food from Petsmart, get frufty flimsy drapery at the fabric store for my display and black fabric for a tablecloth. Then home to pack and ship the pieces to the Art Institute in Chicago, build and paint the hanging panel stand, put in the first fuse load of a dinnerware commission, pay bills and finish my catalog... Sound like a full day?"},

The Starbucks Barista Barcelona mug waits patiently beside the coffeemaker for it to stop gurgling. The music is the morning hum of the furnace on this dark, wet, winter day (my mother is still sleeping upstairs and I am sure does not wish to be woken with \"Marry Me\" by the Drive by Truckers). Dave is off to supervise parent Workday at Jessie's pre-school in my stead. I am the chair of the Buildings & Grounds committee, but I have the Buyer's Market of American Craft next week. Into the breach, Dave. Then he is off to NTB to get new front tires for the van for me. True Love.The coffee steams by my side now, and we officially enter the final leg of the race. The book contract is firmly Pushed To The Back Of My Mind. There is no room for it this coming week.Today I do the last fusing for the show, tomorrow is a client fusing, Monday is the show slumping, and Tuesday I will slump the client pieces. Or I will wait till I get back and slump them then ship them. I have never had a relay go on a kiln, but there have been some really horrific stories on warmglass.com recently that have me nervous. I can just see setting the kiln for a regular slump cycle and heading off to the BMAC only to find a burned out kiln with puddles on the bottom on my return from it having gone to full power and having stayed there all week. And then having to sell my child to pay the electric bill. No thanks, I have enough unlikely things to worry about without adding one more.Also today are postcards up and out, pick up a replacement glass shelf for a display, pick up all relevant work from two local galleries (the best reason to do some consignment work is because you have an emergency back-up supply of pieces for times like now), build and paint the hanging panel stand from pvc pipe, make the catalogs and pay the bills.Tomorrow is the website and I absolutely, positively MUST get it done! I am in a visual business. The majority of people who are in this business--as artisans, buyers, customers, what-have-you--are visual people. If you don't have many visual reinforcements for your work--business card with a picture, color catalog, website with photos, brochures, etc.--to remind the buyers and customers what you do and how much they like it, they will buy from someone else.I believe a website to be a business essential, and a complete website is critical. It is not enough to have a few pics and a bio up. I am at the point where I need to have up a list of the galleries which carry my work. It serves a dual purpose: to show prospective galleries the long list of other galleries which consider my work worth carrying and to show if there are other galleries in their areas which already show my work, avoiding overlap. I also need to keep a list of retail shows up so clients know where they can find me in the upcoming year.This is where DENIAL comes in.The chance that I can get a website almost completely done in a day or two when I haven't been able to get it done in Months is seriously fill-in-your-own-preferred-word-for-completely-insane. But I am flawed. I am not wrong about the need, just about the probablility/possibility. Check back Monday.So off to get through today--the actual making of work--so I can get to the more important task of displaying the work... Is this a skewed world or what?"},
{"title": "Another Day No Response", "date": "Friday, February 10, 2006", "text": "Well this blog is purportedly about the trials and tribulations of writing a book. It is another day of trials. Nothing in the email box from the Publisher. However through another artist friend I found another artist who wrote a book for them. Hers came out last year and she is still waiting to see if she gets a royalty check. They sold out of the first printing and she was told the royalties for the first printing just cover the advance... Maybe she will see royalties in April. I hope so.The postcards are still not back from the printer. I stopped by this morning to see if they were ready and saw one from the run: it was on the wrong cardstock (too light weight and matte) and had the wrong version of the back text on it. *sigh* If they do not go out today there is not much point in them going out at all. I ordered 300 printed both sides for the BMAC--200 to mail and 100 for in the booth, and another 200 with blank backs--just the studio name, my name, return address and the website and email addresses--to have to hand out in case I run out of the printed ones (not too likely). I ordered 2000 in all: the last 1500 initially have blank backs and I will have the backs printed on an as needed basis to use for my summer shows. All 2000 have already been run on the wrong cardstock. They are going to redo the 500 I need for the BMAC on the higher quality paper and they will have them for me tomorrow morning. I went ahead and bought stamps and ran off the labels. Either the ones I mail out will get there just before or just after the show and either way the gallery owner will have two views of my work--one in print, one at the show.I put a load in the kiln last night by 11:00 pm and I am wiped today. Part of that is because I *finally* unloaded the two cases of glass late yesterday afternoon. 1000 lbs of glass all unloaded and moved by hand by me. I am getting too old for this. I was so sore this morning I could barely walk. But before you feel too sorry for me I had an incredible full-body massage from Tim at 11:00 this morning. Talk about a sensual splurge! Dave got me the massage for Valentine's Day last year and I just got around to having it. Now I may make it a regular thing. And Tim really liked my tattoo..."},

And if I am honest, it is not entirely or even primarily due to time constraints. Nor is it all about the fact that last week the instructor never once stopped to peer over my shoulder and evaluate my work as he did for every one else in the class--multiple times for the females 16-24. When I arrived late last week (late but not last so that wasn't it) he asked my name and what I do for a living. When I said glass artist he asked me if I show anywhere. I said yes I will be in Philadelphia in a couple of weeks and I do several other shows a year, and he didn't say anything to me for the rest of the class. Really. I am not making this up.So tonight it came time to get ready to go and I just said no. I am going to watch Tomb Raider, drink cheap red and eat buffalo tenders and fries. Then I am going to work on my website. I have a feeling it will go better after a bit of cheap red.The postcards did not come back from the printer today: The press broke down so the earliest I can get them is tomorrow. So that is one more thing off the list (there won't be time to mail them out to galleries before the show). I will just have them to hand out. That is the postcard at the top of the page. The back is to the left.Finally today, thank you to everyone who posted a \"what would you do\" about the contract from the Publisher. I ended up writing them a short note expressing my confusion and asking for clarification on some points before sending it back. They are \"reviewing them\" and will be back in touch. So we'll see what they say. (Do you have baited breath? Are you waiting with it?)"},
{"title": "The Homestretch", "date": "Tuesday, February 07, 2006", "text": "I sit in the dark again this morning, but in contrast to the gloom and rain of yesterday, a rosy dawn is peeking in through the kitchen windows. I still don't have any coffee--Dave is out of town till tonight so I am On My Own and haven't started it yet. Likewise there is no music as the Sprout lies still sleeping in my bed. She made the morning pilgrimage and came in about 4:00 am. But wait, the music of the morning is birdsong! Somebody out there in the backyard is trilling about the day. A Sign! A Positive Sign of Hope! (The dog at the right comes into the story later... just wait.)As we come into the last week before the BMAC I begin to acknowledge the possibility that some things will not get done again this year. By Friday it will be a probability and by Sunday (maybe Monday if I am really optimistic) it will be a certainty. I acknowledge it, I do not accept it.I got my postcard design finished and to a local printer yesterday so I should be able to send out postcards to galleries by Thursday and have enough left to hand out at the show. Postcards are good as they are big enough to show a lot of visual information and not be easily lost, and small enough not to get tossed aside for later which catalogs and sometimes even brochures are.Yesterday I also chose the pictures I wanted blown up to 24X36 and got them to another printer. They have been run off and mounted on foamcore and are ready for me to pick up this morning.The client that I am doing dinnerware for got his samples in the mail from Friday and picked his colors. I sent him the designs last night late and we are going to finalize today. Then I am going to get those pieces mingled into the firing schedule with the BMAC pieces and pieces for... The Art Institute of Chicago! They have requested a couple of pieces to evaluate for their catalog and need them right away. It is my Quest to be in the Chicago Art Institute catalog.And speaking of catalogs, I need to finish mine today and Get It In The Mail for the galleries that requested it from my January Crafts Report ad. This is the second year in a row I have fallen down here. I like to advertise in the regional showcase of the Crafts Report, and my region comes out in January. I put in the ad \"Catalog available on request\". And I do have a catalog, but I change it every January to include the new designs and series I am doing and to remove things I no longer wish to do (e.g., my horrible but brief flirtation with slumped wine bottles... there are some things that leach the soul, and for me slumping wine bottles is one of those things). So there is always some lag between getting a request for a catalog and actually having a catalog to send. It just isn't possible to get it done in December. Maybe the solution is to move to another region.So what does that leave to get done? Well, actual work for the BMAC would be nice. Finalization for the book contract and a signature on a dotted line. Oh yes and all that damn glass I still haven't unpacked which sat in its crates in the rain all day yesterday because the dog pulled the plastic cover off for a chew toy (big dogs, big chew toys. That's the dog at the top of the page. Not the dog that pulled the cover off the crates. No, that's the She Devil Dog's brother. But the She Devil Dog looks just like him). Then there are a few little things that still need attention (business cards, all the printing for the show, counting and buying new lights, getting a hotel reservation for the show, getting the car tuned, etc.). But the biggest thing yet undone (untouched now for weeks now) is the website. I have one sad little front page on my website which has never had any friends. I have been meaning to add friends for over a year now (at the bottom it has said, \"The top navigation bar is a placeholder, but its pages will come live over coming weeks\" since 2004. I am pathetic). I have a feeling that it is the website that is going to drop off again this year. I hope I am wrong and can pull it off.

{"title": "Fame and Glory or Folly and...?", "date": "Monday, February 06, 2006", "text": "Breaking the whole one-post-per-day rule I have imposed upon my self I post again. If you are just coming in today, read the post below this one first. Trust me. I initially wrote this post as a comment on the last one, but it is so intrinsic to my dilemma that it deserves its own space.In response to my last post my friend Bill wrote: \"That very much depends on whether you want to be able to say on your resume that you are a published author, and that your artistry is on record. It might just be worth it in terms of increased exposure and sales...\"And that is exactly what my husband Dave says, and it comes under the category of \"less tangible\". And if it were a big coffee-table expose of my achievements and artistry LOL), well that would be a nobrainer (and not bloody likely). But let's be honest, this is going to be a little craft \"how-to\" book.Am I really going to gain \"artistic\" cred from having it published? We all know what an effort it will be to do it, will the kind of cred that comes from it (even if it is very well-done) be worth it? And that is a serious question. I will be sinking an incredible amount of time into this endeavor almost to the exclusion of the rest of my business--shows, commissions, new projects and techniques. Of course I will be learning as I validate the techniques I write up, but I won't be intentionally trying anything new.But if not now, when. I know if not me, who (anyone else). Seize my moment and see where it goes, or don't do it because I know the publisher has set this up to entice me and take advantage of me. How long has it been since I was last seduced? I can answer that--last spring when I bought the gutter covers from the guy who promised me that they would keep out the Georgia long-leaf pine needles and water oak leaves and my gutters would run free forever. I was screwed then too. In that scenario there was no upside--unless you count that it is easier to clean the clogged gutter tops than it is to clean the clogged gutters. Both require a ladder. The only upside here really is Fame and Glory.Do you feel lucky, punk? Is there enough Fame and Glory? What would YOU do? If you have time, post a comment and give me your opinion (anonymous posting is allowed, but I would appreciate a name).I sit in the office in the dark, only the glow of the laptop screen and the faint grey dawn creeping in through the windows pierce the gloom. My music is the sound of the furnace doing the morning heat-up. It is the one time of the day when the house is toasty warm, almost too warm. There is no coffee yet, I might microwave some from yesterday if Dave does not make any before he leaves for work, or I might treat myself to one at Jupiter Coffee on the way home from taking the Sprout to school. There are many possibilities. And that is the thread of the day... Possibilities.The contract must go back to the Publisher today and I still have not decided what changes I am going to request, if any. The more I read it, the more I feel that it is written not just allowing but encouraging them to rip me off. And I wonder, should I try to change that or just accept that my benefits from having a book published will be less tangible (fame and glory, fame and glory--and maybe some additional commissions, outright sales, or new gallery connections because I am a Published Author).I tend to take the moral high ground--which can also be called biting one's nose off to spite one's face in the vernacular. Dave is more pragmatic. He is a perfect discussion partner for this issue, and still, I am unresolved! The contract was reviewed by an Intellectual Property lawyer and he put so much red in it it looks like a checkerboard at the beginning of the game. And that is why we have lawyers review things for us--so they can take the existing amount of skew and twist it back into our favor. There is no way in hell the Publisher will agree to even half of what he has proposed, but that is not the point. The point is to highlight the inequity of the deal. And he has. But we knew it would be inequitous. Turns out there is actually no such word inequitous, the word is instead inequitable meaning unfair. Maybe because it would cause confusion with iniquitous, meaning wicked.One of the things that bothers me the most is that it is actually in their best interests to sell the book for under wholesale because then they only owe me pennies in royalties--they more than make up their losses from the distributor by stiffing me. So what checks are there in place to make them not want to cheat me? I mean, they don't know me personally, and if they are just looking at the structure of a deal and how much they can make on it, and they see that they can actually make more money by selling the book at a 54% discount than they can at a 50% discount, why wouldn't they jump at it? Yeah, so I don't make anything, so what? I hear Dave grind the coffee beans and I know that for yet another day I am saved from swill and effort.Then there is the issue of Rights. It used to be that when a book went out of print the author would get all rights to it back--rights for a new edition, a revision, a whatever. But in the electronic age books can be published on-demand and thus never go out of print. This sounds good at first pass, but it also means by the structure of the contract that an author never gets the rights to the book back and the Publisher gets to do all revisions, new editions, anthologies, compilations, etc., at their sole discretion and whim. And the royalty structure is seriously diminished.So what do I, the first time author, really get? The very small advance which does not even begin to cover the time it takes to write the book at a wage made by the grocery baggers at Publix, the knowledge that I will never see another dime in income--there will always be some Publisher's expense which is offset by my royalty (picture the Ebeneezer character from the Simpsons as the Publisher rubbing his hands together cackling with glee), and a book. They get us because we will do anything to see our names in print and they know that if we say no, there are dozens of people lining up behind us who will say yes. They (the iniquitous Publisher) encouraged me to read the contract carefully, take my time, all the while knowing that all I was going to get out of the exercise was a thorough understanding of how I was going to be screwed--there would be no changes. Now the question is, can I manage not to let the knowledge bother me?"},

Then there are samples to fire and fedex to a client, glass to unpack, palpitations to have...I got the contract edits back from the lawyer yesterday. They make me anxious. Instead of feeling incredibly honored and excited about being chosen to write this book I start feeling like the publisher is a greedy Ebeneezer chortling madly, claws extended to rip out the heart and soul of my effort and creativity and sell it for parts on the black literary market...Dave thinks I am insane. He gently reminds me that I am not Stephen King or J. K. Rowling and thus will not get control over the edits and choices the publisher makes on the way to getting the book out the door. I am depressed. I would be much happier not having to think about whether someone is trying to gouge me for every nickel, dime and right. I would rather continue to be a PollyAnna--but then I hark back to having a gallery stiff me for work they sold and never paid me for and how burned I was (and still am). I hold grudges for a long time...And then the coin flips again, it lands tails--for turn tail and run. I think of what a contract really is: basis for legal action. If you have a contract you must enforce it for it to mean anything. Enforcing it means, at best, arbitration, at worst, court and legal fees and more anxiety than a heart can stand without bursting. If you get to the point where you need to worry about the details of a contract, then you have already lost. So why bother? Really shady and unethical people are not going to be stopped by a contract. Do I want to get involved in anything I need a contract for? Maybe I don't even want to do the book. I forget all about Fame and Glory...The coin jumps back in the air for the last time and it lands heads--for full steam ahead. A contract exists between honest people to explicitly spell out their rights and obligations so there are no surprises on either side. They are not written with the intent to litigate, but to guide and provide answers to questions that may arise in the process. I know that the contract the Publisher gives me will be heavily skewed in their favor and I should not be insulted by this fact. The Publisher does not have my best interests at heart--they are a Corporation (part of Barnes and Noble, to be exact). They have Shareholders, and Employees, and Directors who all come before me. It would be criminally naive to think they are looking out for me when they write the contract (or should). It is my responsibility to weigh the allocation of rights and rewards they propose and to counter-propose a contract more in my favor.I also must decide what proposed changes in the contract I cannot live without. I need to do that calmly, alone, not in the midst of the negotiation, and not as a response to their counter to my counter. For heaven's sake, I have bought five houses! If I can get through that--dealing not only with someone who does not have my best interests at heart but who is also not a rational human being--then I should be able to sail through this."},

Random shuffle on the iPod ushers in the day with Martha Reeves and the Vandellas \"Nowhere to Run\". Is it a sign? For whom? On to the day!With any luck at all the new kiln lid for Big Bertha will be delivered this morning between 9 and 11. It was supposed to be here Monday between 1:30 and 5:00. Monday at 3:30 I called to find out the status and after much transferring and hold time was told my delivery was next in the route but 1) the two shipments in front of me had been refused and the driver wouldn't be able to get it off the truck, and 2) the driver didn't have a liftgate or pallet jack (or both) and so wouldn't be able to get it off the truck (my shipment weighs 418 lbs).This is my first time dealing with this particular freight company. I have so far not been impressed. I wondered aloud why I had not been called first thing in the day and notified of the lack of the equipment I requested and paid for to get my stuff off the truck (lift gate and pallet jack) thus freeing me up to Get Something Done instead of having to listen for the door all day (I cannot hear the doorbell from the studio, a flaw, I know). The harried dispatcher asked if they could bring it back Tuesday and I said no, appointment with the photographer. She asked when I want it and I gave her the 9-11 window today.Normally you don't get such tiny windows for delivery but they screwed up, she was grateful for my understanding, and she probably has today off anyway so won't have to hear me scream when it gets Screwed Up Again! (A side note: there was a voice message waiting when I got back from the photographer yesterday afternoon--the driver from the freight company had tried to deliver while I was gone. Is it any wonder I lack confidence in the potential for a smooth hand-off today?)So why the tight window? Because my wondrous spouse has procured tickets for the new aquarium! J is staying home from school today so we can leave as soon as the kiln lid is delivered or at 11:00, whichever comes first. Our tickets for the aquarium are for noon, you see. It is so popular that you don't just buy tickets, or buy tickets for a specific day. No, you get a tiny window--an hour--in which to enter the aquarium. The you can stay as long as you like. I see fish-inspired work in my glass future.But back to my delivery. I am still trying to figure out how the kiln lid weighs 418 lbs even in crating. I have removed the extant lid and repaired it once with the help of another person. I am strong, but I do not think I could do over 200 lbs. And I still haven't unloaded the glass from Bullseye which wouldn't fit into the garage so had to go on the parking pad under plastic. (One might uncharitably wonder why I was in such a hurry to get it last week. The answer: The frit.) So now when the 418 lb kiln lid gets here where am I going to put it? Answer: further back on the parking pad!Martha Stewart moment: Good thing Dave never wanted to park in the garage (it was lost to kilns, molds, display equipment, workshop and crap). Good thing he didn't want to park on the parking pad either. Maybe I could get Home Depot to come out with a shed and just put it together over everything on the parking pad...That would have been the end of the post, but Jessie just came running into the room yelling \"Madagascar!\". I didn't get it. She caught my quizzical look and said, \"Madagascar\" and pointed to the iPod which was playing \"Staying Alive\" by the Bee Gees. \"That song was in Madagascar.\" From now on I will have John Travolta in a white suit morphed into four cartoon zoo animals striding down the streets of New York City whenever I hear that song. Any residual edgy sexiness I might have clung to in my memory of it is just gone. Yet another casualty of Growing Up, Real Life and Kids."},
{"title": "And What did the Glass Artisan do Today?", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2006", "text": "Coffee is a thing of today's far distant past. It was consumed on the run. There has been no music at all--not even the radio or a cd in the car. And it is now almost 6:00 pm and I am just getting around to posting. What did I do all day? Well, first thing this  morning I was a financial manager dealing with a new scam (on which I will post at length on Stranded in the South) as I wrangled the Sprout off to school. Then it was back to the photographer's for the last picture session. I had him shoot a new body of work which is all textured clear plates and platters. It was a real challenge and took two hours longer than either of us thought it would. But throughout I kept internally squealing \"Oh! Those are gorgeous! What pretty sparkly pieces! Did I really make those?\" with all attendant tingly good feelings.Next, I got to deposit money from last week's commission sales and last month's gallery sales and complete one more art fair application (57th Street in Chicago June 3-4). Finally, I delivered a gallery order (the same pieces I slumped yesterday and had shot at the photographer today--now that was planning!) and picked J up from school. Tonight I research postcard companies, design a postcard to use for promotional mailings this year, and maybe work on the catalog a bit. Some time soon I am going to have to decide which pieces to take to the BMAC and make them. And I am going to have to finish (a big task since I don't even have a functioning front page) my website any time now.*Sigh*. Notice the lack of glass in there? January is the big prepare-for-the-year month. Art fair apps to get in, marketing materials to design and produce for the year, planning, planning, planning. There is some fun experimental fusing allowed to help me get through the marketing materials and art fair apps, but it is a studio-light time.The contract should be coming back from the lawyer soon and then I can start writing...

The mug today is New York--the fastest paced city I know and one whose speed I need to emulate--and the song is Madonna's \"True Blue\" from the album of the same name.15 days till I leave for the BMAC. The show is in 18 days but I am giving myself two days to drive me, my stuff and my assistant (my Mom) out, and then there is one day for set-up. A little side note for those of you with kids who think ahead to the days when your children are out on their own and self-sufficient: Get over it. I will be 45 in June and my Mom still comes to my rescue when I get in over my head. She is flying out from Montana next week to do this show with me and then stay with Jessie while Dave and I take a mini vacation to California with some friends.I am not ready for the show yet, but there are so many things which have deadlines between now and then that I am not ready for that I can't even worry about it. All worrying in its own time. That is my motto today. I have scheduled the afternoon of Saturday 2/11 and all day Sunday 2/12 to freak out about the show and finish preparations (booth design, etc.). Today I absolutely, positively MUST get the glass shipment from last week unpacked and put away (the kiln lid arrives this afternoon) and I have a load to slump before meeting with the photographer again tomorrow for the last BMAC pics.But this post was not meant to be about the minutiae. No, the Big Picture right now is the book contract. Boy do they want a lot, in very little time, for even less money. I knew it was about Fame and Glory, but until I read the details, I was unaware of the Whip-the-Serfs aspects of the road to fame and glory and how my role really is defined as \"serf\".I sent a commission off to a client in Chicago on Friday and he happens to be a lawyer who has also had a book published. After giving me his credit card information so I could bill him for the piece he bought, he proceeded to tell me a whole bunch of things I need to watch out for in book contract negotiations. Then he directed me to look on the web for more information (and recommended I get a lawyer). Friday a search in Google produced 29, 900,000 hits for \"book contract\". (Today the same search spit out 28, 500,000 entries. 500,000 attrition seems a bit high for the weekend, but what do I know about the internet?)There are some really good articles out there and one of the best sites is the writer's guild. They even provide you with legal help to negotiate your contract... after you are member. You can only join the guild if 1) you have a book published (and not self-published--thus implying a contract) or 2) you already have a contract. Is anyone else stunned by the irony there? Luckily for me they also provide a page of contract tips.I made lots of notes and shipped the whole thing--contract, web links, list of concerns--off to an intellectual property lawyer to look over. I can sleep at night knowing that I have a pit bull who is at least as good and probably better than their pit bulls (apologies to my lawyer, my uncle--who is also a lawyer--and all the other lawyers out there who might resent being compared to pit bulls. Please do not sue me for libel or slander or whichever one has to do with insulting in print). If I get screwed, I will do so with the knowledge that he did everything he could to prevent it, I chose to proceed with the book anyway, and I will not be surprised. And maybe he can save me and I won't become a first-time author horror story splattered in page five of the Chicago Tribune.I close with a note on the pics scattered through this post: These are the new 2-D pieces I debuted at the One of a Kind show in December and am now moving to the wholesale market at the BMAC. I added four new color series of Morceaux de Verre, and I am really pleased with how this style is maturing for me."},

Today, I am on top of my game. I got the slides back from my photographer this morning and they are *stunning*. Pics posted tomorrow after I scan them in.Yesterday I got a piece back from a gallery at Disney World. It spontaneously broke into three large pieces while in their front window—reportedly not even in hot sun! Some, whose glasses are half empty, would see this as evidence the sky is falling and run for cover. Me, I look at the edges of the breaks and go “Wow! It would be really cool to do this fusing pattern, then cut it up and lay the pieces on their sides—like a pattern bar effect—and make a new piece!\" So I have something new to try. As to why the pece broke—bad anneal: Half the kiln elements shorted out during the firing and the piece was unevenly annealed. At least that's my guess. I have been having a problem with Big Bertha for some time now. It finally came to the point last month where I ordered a new lid for her from the manufacturer and it will be here Monday afternoon. Will I try to get it installed before the BMAC and risk all my firings before I go? Or do I leave it till I get back when I (hope, hope) have orders that need to be filled with DEADLINES? Sometimes there are no good choices.But thinking about lid replacement does not make me chortle with glee. Nor does the rest of my task list for the day: finish unloading glass and unpacking frit, continue with the annual studio cleaning and organizing, etch an order of wine glasses for a local gallery and deliver it, ship a commissioned piece to Chicago (photo posted after fuse yesterday—slumped yesterday after photo and it is PERFECT), and call the publisher to discuss differences of opinion about schedule of deliverables.No, I chortle with glee because I will try a new, more intense Morceaux de Verre layout and firing this morning and then after all the chores (yawn) I will reward myself by getting out my camel hair brushes and experimenting with landscape painting on glass. Two fun firings in one day! I also got some new screen earlier in the week to try another screen drop... Maybe Monday.About my painting... I suck as a painter right now—no formal training. But I signed up for an introductory drawing class at Emory University yesterday (it starts next week). Move over (insert name of famous landscape painter here)! (See, I really am an art barbarian: no formal training, no color theory, no art history courses—at least not in English). And I ordered a couple of books from Amazon and Borders on painting techniques which will come next week. That's how I learn: I read and try. So it's late and I need to get a move on. Time's a wasting!"},
{"title": "The Ugly Green Monster", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2006", "text": "Today's journaling was delayed due to the inaccessibility of blogger.com this morning. At the same time the warmglass.com bulletin board was down. Could it have been a denial of service and not a coincidence? Those pesky hackers! (love this cartoon). So it's getting on time for lunch, the coffee has come and languished, cold in the mug, and the music is remarkably uninspiring. This does not mean, however, that there has not been much activity this morning. Au contraire.Yesterday's firing went beautifully, and I needed that. When I returned the work I had photographed to a gallery yesterday, I had a disturbing experience: As I was leaving I glanced over at a display of my work in a 16-cube shelving unit and I saw a beautiful piece in the center cube which looked a lot like mine, but it wasn't. It was in the same style as all of my work surrounding it--what I call Morceaux de Verre (morsels of glass) and with the same intensity and blend of colors that I favor. It was as technically good as my pieces (smooth glassy surface free of air bubbles, no devitrification) and it was more beautiful--richer, more intense color. It was also considerably more expensive than my pieces.I left the gallery feeling like my work was worthless and why do I even continue making it. (And how can I even consider writing a book about it!). When someone who dabbles in fusing and has no understanding of what happens to glass in a kiln and why (or didn't the last time I talked to her) can make something more beautiful than I can after 18 years of learning, experimenting and practice... well, I might as well just hang it up! And I fretted about the insensitivity of the gallery owners--to carry the work in the first place and to put it in a place surrounded by mine in the second.I knew I was being unreasonable and ungenerous, and I couldn't get over it and let it go. I am ashamed to say I am still struggling a bit because what bothers me is not that she might be imitating me, it's that if she is, *her work is better than mine*.For some of us it is always and ever will be a competition. \"It\" (the work) is good because someone else says it is. Yes, \"it\" may resonate within us, but unless someone else says they value \"it\", \"it\" is ultimately worthless. We may come across as extremely self-confident and self-possessed, but it is just a facade. In reality we have low self-esteem and constantly worry that someone else is better/smarter/thinner/prettier/more talented/more... than we are.Fortunately there is no shortage of people in the world to remind us about what is important and why we do what we do. My wonderful spouse sent me this link about writing and it is so perfect for \"being an artist\" or making a living as any fill-in-the-blank that I had to share it: Even More Long-Winded (But Practical) Writing Advice I read it as I was writing this entry and had the “Moonstruck” epiphany (where Cher walks up to Nicolas Cage and slaps his face, looks to see if it had an effect, slaps him again and says “Snap out of it!”). The tight, unhappy knot in my belly went away and I started planning the next thing I want to try (pastel landscapes on glass…. Yumm!) and ordering the supplies I will need.Life is just too damn short and all the clichés apply: there is also someone better, the only one you have to satisfy with your life is you, it really. doesn’t. matter. what other people think."},
{"title": "Professional Glass Artist, Friend and Mother", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2006", "text": "Supporting my strong belief in the force of intelligent design driving both my choice of coffee mug and the music that comes on (supposedly randomly) the iPod each morning , today I am drinking out of a mug with a picture of Jessie at age one eating Cheerios on it and the song is \"The Storm\" by the Disney Orchestra and Choir from The Little Mermaid. Coincidence? I think not!Writing here has become the anchor of my morning. And like many personal rituals (work, working out, yoga, journaling) it is at the whim of other things going on in life. This morning's quasi-schedule was reset due to a long phone conversation with a friend (and new mother) who has been thrust into a divorce process. I drank from the Cheerios mug and contemplated my luck as we talked.And Jessie slept late this morning--would not be roused for anything--as we watched the extended version of \"The Return of the King\" last night. We started just after 6:00 over pizza, but it was still after 10:00 when it finished and we could not deny her the end. So my work day also begins late. I have a very comfortable rhythm with Dave: He does all the laundry and cooking, and I do the morning Sprout wrangle and off to school. Believe me, it is a fair trade. But she is up now and must be mustered so I need to finish this and get on with the day.What are the glass artist tasks of the day? To return the work to the galleries from the photoshoot yesterday. I mentioned in yesterday's post that the firing the night before had failed, it needed five more minutes. Well that was not a failure but an opportunity! I took the piece to be photographed anyway and when it was in its stand I looked at it and realized how cool the effect of the extra texture was in the design. It was not intentional, it was serendipity!Then I need to get two kiln loads in--one with a commission piece and some samples for the Art Institute in Chicago and the other with some slumped clear architectural work. Then I need to begin unloading all the glass on the parking pad. I will finish by thoroughly reading through the contract from the publisher. I skimmed it yesterday and my first thought was \"Wow, no wonder most of their writers are first-time authors! This is seriously stacked in their favor for money and future rights!\" (Not that I expect them to make a motion picture from my oeuvre.)I did get my BMAC exposition services order in yesterday at 4:45 pm (15 minutes before the deadline for the discount price): walls = white foamcore, carpet = red, electricity = 2000 watts, and I got lots and lots of extra support poles. It was a relief to get that done. Now I just need to finish the rest of the display in my mind (and buy anything I need for it), design the annual catalog and put it together with the rest of the print materials, finish the website and reserve a hotel room. 21 days and counting...."},
{"title": "Good Things Come... Followed by Terror", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2006", "text": "The morning opens with \"Sweet Jane\" by the Velvet Underground thus reinforcing my belief that there is intelligent design driving the music on the iPod. The mug of the day is a new Starbucks Skyline one: Alaska. Dave's initial response upon seeing the mug--which came yesterday courtesy of ebay--was \"But there are no buildings in Alaska, what is it a skyline of? Huts?\". He is an uneducated heathen and got an evil glare for a response and the lovely rendering of Denali on the mug shoved up under his nose. Don't mess with \"The Last Frontier\". (Which is the saying on the inside of the mug--they all have them. Chicago is \"The Windy City\", well, duh. New York is fruit-related.)So the glass came yesterday in the pouring rain. It was wrangled off the truck and reposes in solid splendor under plastic on the parking pad for a dry unpacking--except for the frit which I rooted through for the red #2 and #3. In the midst of preparing places to put it all, I ran across three sheets of lt blue cathedral, one aqua cathedral and three lime green opal, all of which I need for projects in November and December and all of which I thought I was out of--forgetting I had made an overstock bin. The existence of this glass is also a sign and speaks to either my disorganization, pace of work, self-destructive tendancies, or all of the above (the terror is creeping in).I woke at 3:00 am again courtesy of a sleepless Sprout. After getting her tucked back into her bed I couldn't get back to sleep, discourtesy of he neighbors barking dogs and my own small anxiety attack. I know I didn't have anxiety attacks that kept me awake in the middle of the night in my 20's or even early to mid 30's. I don't remember if I had them in my late 30's, but I have to say, my mid 40's are hell for them. The night I started this blog I had been awake for three hours before I finally got up and created the blog.Last night I stayed abed and fretted about today. Did my firing yesterday turn out? No, it needed 5-10 more minutes at top temp for full fuse--the kiln has decided it doesn't want to follow the same firing schedules it has for six years and we have been tussling about its intractability for over a month now. What am I going to use for the walls of my display at the BMAC: my too-short white drapes, their 4' X 8' taped foamcore which is at least white, their carpet-covered pro-panels which are dark grey and so would need to have something else on them to provide the white background I need for my glass? Everything but my drapes costs $300-$500 additional. Where am I going to stay for the BMAC? Do I play it safe and reserve a room through the Rosen Group and pay a premium, or do I wait and get something cheaper on Priceline? Wait=Risk=Anxiety.Now I need to get my daughter out of bed, pottied, washed, teeth brushed, hair brushed and fixed and dressed for school. After I take her to school I am heading up to Roswell to pick up five pieces from a gallery there to have photograped today. Then I am swinging back by Decatur to pick up two pieces from a gallery there. Then the photoshoot. Then the return of all the work. Then the grocery and dog food shopping (with a stop at Home Depot for more screen to try another screen melt). Then home to start unpacking glass and read through the contract from the publisher. And my stomach is completely in knots from stress. I know everything is going to be fine but I am having a hard time letting the fear go. So I am going to close with a poem which I thought of yesterday (Sunday? Who knows!). I am going to hold tight to it today and get through:“Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.”--Shel Silverstein"},

I am terse this morning. Just gave the happy family the bum's rush out the door--Dave having both delivery and pick-up duties for school today as I am CARLESS. Normally I would be chauffeur in his car and drive him to the train station and then drop the Sprout at school on the way home. But today I wait for glass. I sit at my kitchen table looking out at the grey pouring rain and I wait for 1300 lbs of glass: A case and a half of sheet glass and 263 lbs of frit. I have just been down to the garage which is attached to the studio and there is no way in any dimension I am going to get the delivery into there. The only place for it is on the uncovered parking pad. In the aforementioned pouring rain. I have a feeling I am just going to stay terse all day.Why, one might ask would I be terse? Don't I have a slicker and wellies? Well, no, I don't. I am from Montana. This time of year we get snow. I have snow boots and a down coat--spectacularly useless here in Atlanta. But really why I am terse--here is the shameful confession--I have an appointment with my photographer tomorrow morning to shoot my new 2-D panels for the catalog I do for the BMAC and, guess what, I HAVEN'T MADE THEM YET. The sheer arrogance one might say. Another might question my priorities for writing instead of doing. But I haven't done them because I need the glass on the shipment. I need #2 and #3 Bullseye red cathedral frit for three of them. The photo at right is a gallery shot of one of the pieces I am talking about.Oh joy of joys (not). The trucking company just called and my shipment came in late so it missed being loaded on the lift gate truck this morning. They want to deliver tomorrow. My little breakdown on the phone convinced the dispatcher this would not be a good idea. They are going to get it out to me today. Somehow. Maybe send an extra man with the driver to get it off the truck. I tried to gently explain to her that, really, all the manpower in the world isn't going to get a full case of Bullseye glass off a delivery truck without a lift gate. She said she knows the shipment weighs 1300 lbs and they will get it off the truck without breaking it down. I console myself with two thoughts: 1) I was never very good at physics and maybe she is right, and 2) she has taken ownership and made it her problem so I am not responsible for the outcome. When it all falls apart later I will tell myself I should have known better, but I will still be ahead: I could be stressed all day knowing it would fail and then have to deal with the failure, or I could be relaxed all day and then have to deal with the failure.Mood swing: \"Stay with Me Tonight\" by Jeffrey Osborne just came on. In the midst of despair there is salvation. Some music will just take you no matter what. I put it on continuous loop."},

The music is Bruce Springsteen's “Thunder Road” from Live 1975-1985. Piano so beautiful it hurts. I did manage to put on, well, not clothes but at least a full-body cover-up before racing down to the studio this morning to see how the firing turned out. It was wild--and completely unexpected.Kiln: Skutt clamshellkilnposts: Four 1/2\" squares of mulliteShelf: 20 X 20 X 1 mulliteStand: 1” square tube steel legs 7” longConfiguration: The shelf was on the posts 1/2\" off the floor of the kiln, the stand stood on the shelf--not the floor of the kiln--giving a full 7\" drop between the mesh and the shelf. The thermocouple was between the bottom of the stand and the shelf.Mesh: Hi-temp grill screen overlapped in the middle and folded down across the sides of the standShelf Release: Hotline Hi Fire Primer 15-20 coats brushed on with a Haik brushGlass: Bullseye red, orange and yellow opal and cathedral (should have taken a weight here to predict final piece size, but there was so much waste in this project it wouldn’t have mattered!)Schedule: based on Steve Immerman’s aperture pour schedule.600 dph to 1700 hold 90AFAP to 1500 hold 45AFAP to 960 hold 60100 DPH to 650 hold 0Natural coolSo where to begin on the unexpectednesses... Well, the first thing that startled me was how much glass was left on top of the screen. Yes, this is a flat-blade mesh rather than a wire-mesh, but due to the height of the set-up and the closeness of the glass to the elements, I really expected it to melt and pour. But a huge amount stuck to the screen.Given the amount of glass on the top I should have expected all the threads between the mesh and the piece below, and therefore been prepared for the strength of the bond between the mesh and the puddle below. I wasn't and was very surprised when I went to lift the stand away and the whole thing came up in my hands. I asked my spouse to lift it so I could photograph it for posterity here.I blithely ignored the possibility of the metal reacting to the heat and was unpleasantly surprised by the amount of oxidation which flaked off into the glass. I am not sure if it was a one-time thing or not, but the point is moot as I will not try this with a screen gauge this big again. I also got far more popped bubbles in the final surface than I expected.What I really liked about this technique was the number of small whirlpool areas. With aperture pours/pot melts, you get one contact point with rings of color rippling out from it. Here every drop point produces its own ripple and color blend area and is an opporunity for a central design element in a larger piece.So what am I going to change for next time? I am going to use the 1/2\" square wire mesh. It is much more flexible than the mesh I used this time so I will need to wire it to the stand to keep it from collapsing in the middle. I am going to put the stand on the floor of the kiln and raise the shelf up a bit by putting it on 1\" posts. And I am going to weigh my glass. I am also going to use clear in the mix to get more of a \"window\" effect. I close with some random photos from the experiment."},

I know, I know, I am not supposed to be in the studio today, but Jessie is having a play date, Dave is coding and I am in WITHDRAWAL.Yesterday was spent on lunch with another glass artist celebrating my status in December as a One of a Kind Show featured artist and the book deal (for which, as of yet no contract has manifested in the mail... should I be worried?) and then the automatic transmission going out on my 2000 Honda Odyssey mini-van. I made it to the mechanic... barely.So today I finish the scrap-through-a-screen project. I took one of the grill screen pieces I am going to use to hold the glass and bent the sides in a vise so it fits snugly over the sides of the frame and into the kiln. Now I have got to finish bending the other piece of grill, give the shelf one more coat of kiln wash and load it up. I will post the pictures tomorrow!"},

I sat down to write listening to George Winston's \"Thanksgiving\" from the December album (album, I show my age). It reflects my mood. But now after staring into space for a few minutes wondering what the hell to do (and write) Warren Zevon's \"My Ride's Here\" from the cd of the same name comes on and I am ready to go (after this brief side note: The 60 gig iPod with almost our entire cd library on it playing all day on random shuffle is one of the best things to happen to me in a long time. I can listen to Chicago dj's just barely (XRT, you know what I'm saying). But one more Georgia... no, there is no more polite term than \"redneck\" so I'll go with it, would make me rip the stereo wires out. I just can't do it.)So today. I am almost at a complete loss. The finances are DONE for 2005. The sales taxes for Illinois, Georgia and Texas are filed and paid. I still have to futz around with the Texas franchise tax forms for the past three years so I can finally dissolve that corporation... But enough even talking about it! Today I am (more or less) free and I don't have any idea what to do. Sure, there are lots of \"shoulds\" (booth details and exposition services ordering for the BMAC in Philly next month, list of pieces to make for the show, catalog re-write, the ever-present website redesign and completion) but none of them actually entail making anything, and none of them have to be done TODAY. FRIDAY. The last day of the week I have any chance to make glass. (For familial harmony and so that I get to spend some quality time with them, I try to do things with Dave and Jessie on Saturday and Sunday and avoid disappearing into the studio unless I must because of a deadline.)  My big winter glass order from Bullseye is enroute and won't be here till Monday or Tuesday. Over 1300 lbs of glass. I will get a good workout that day! Until it gets here I can't start on the three commissions I have waiting (need that glass) so there is no production work to do. But there is scrap. Glass fusers commonly have MOUNDS of scrap because it is all potentially useful. When you do stained glass you can say \"Well, that sliver is too small to be used in anything\" and you throw it out. With fusing, every single solitary morsel of glass has the potential to be incorporated into a finished piece and I just can't throw any of them out.So I have scrap. I also have flower pots and the two go together like bears and honey, but that technique is not singing to me today. No, today I think I will take the stand I bought from Carol Webb at C3 Studios (her husband welds them up for her) and put it in the kiln with a couple of pieces of hi-temp small-mesh grill screen I got at Home Depot on it and I will load the screen up with scrap. I have been wanting to experiment with effects obtained from different top temps and soak times, and this cold-for-Atlanta winter day is the perfect time.Now the coffee is ready, my sluggish brain has warmed up and \"Anna Begins\" by the Counting Crows from August and Everything After is playing.

{"title": "Fame and Glory", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2006", "text": "Today's mug is Chicago, and I am in a rush to get this out before the acountant comes to go over how much money I lost last year (maybe she will help me find it?). I didn't fire yesterday, I worked on the books to the tune of the neighbor's barking dog till 10:30 last night. The figures were... impressive. And I will say no more (except that I will not be endowing any universities any time soon).As I have been in a business frame of mind for the past week I thought it might be a good idea to get references on my new business partners, the illustrious \"Publisher\". So I looked on their website at other books they have published in my field and in the same format they proposed to me (8.5 X 10, hardcover, project-oriented, 128 pages) and found one that came out two years ago for stained glass. I ordered it from Amazon (authors of the world unite and buy each other's books!) and when it came yesterday, I eagerly went to the author's bio. Lo and behold, she had a website! And the website had a phone number! I called and left her a message. She called me back in the late afternoon and we chatted for a good long while. She gently helped me to set my expectations for this experience. As I was not born yesterday I did not figure this would be a walk in the park with a pot of money at the end. It is about what I figured it would be: an incredible, chaotic lot of hard work with a modest advance being (probably) the only remuneration for years (maybe forever). Why do we do it? Fame and glory, fame and glory. You get to see your name in print with a dedication to your loved ones and you don’t have to pay in money, just sweat, to make it happen. I didn’t even have to ask her, she offered it up: Yes she would do it all over again. Finally, while perusing another friend’s blog (yes Bill, I now have you bookmarked and hang on your every word) I found out that my latest book series find, The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, is going to be a series on the Sci-Fi channel this year. Thank heaven it’s not on Fox! They butchered (no pun intended—really) Firefly badly enough they should *never* get anything heavier than “That 70’s Show” or something else I wouldn’t watch even for a cute butt (to see one, not to have one). The internet being what it is, I followed the links from the blog and ended up  here. It is worthwhile to read down through how he got started in writing and what he had to go through to get published. For everyone out there who has a novel, or a screenplay, or a set of short stories  (or a non-fiction crafts book), it is a very good guide as to who you have to sleep with to get your work out there."},

I do this because I took Jessie to school this morning prepared (as the head of the school’s Buildings and Grounds Committee) to have a long meeting with the Director over school improvements. That is an activity I cannot face without coffee. Especially after I stayed up late last night to finish “The Time Traveler’s Wife”. The more stressed and behind I get, the more I read to escape from my stress. It works in that I have less stress at any given moment in time, but it fails in that I get less done and as a result create more stress overall. But the Director wasn’t in this morning so I came home and will write up this entry, communicate with everyone through email, and get back to the bane of my life: the annual finances.Profitability was a thread in the topic yesterday. And profitability hinges in large part on one’s ability to accurately gauge the amount of time any given task—either revenue-generating or  non revenue-generating—is going to take. A few days ago I optimistically slated the wrangling of the annual financial paperwork to one day, maybe two. I am on day four. The website languishes and the dust bunnies romp happily in the studio. I am grumpy, grumpy, grumpy. Dave casually throws out “Have fun, do much glass today” as he is getting ready to leave for work and I snarl back that I am going to have to spend the entire day on the computer again. He gives me a look and says, “Maybe you should do some glass”. I know what this means. I have the look of a dangerously unstable junkie in need of a fix and he would just as soon I had that fix before he got home tonight.So why have I slipped so badly? I would like to blame it all on the software (stupid Quickbooks: like I should have to care about the difference between a credit and a debit and where did all those sales tax entries for Chicago go?), or the time I spend writing here or reading there, but really, it is that recordkeeping is a completely underestimated task in a business. It is something that must be done regularly, takes a not inconsiderable amount of time, is non revenue-generating, and for most people is about as much fun as a root canal. Why do so many small businesses fail? (And make no mistake about it, being an artisan for a living very much entails running a small business.) They fail because of the high percentage of non revenue-generating activities not covered by the ones that do bring in money. If I have to spend the day futzing around with Quickbooks… again… I will not get any glass done today. Notice the entire preoccupation here with profit and profitability: That is what several days of bookkeeping do to me. Back to yesterday’s post: “Why do we do what we do?” I put up with the recordkeeping in order to be a responsible business owner. I am a responsible business owner so I can keep on generating revenue which allows me to buy more glass. I buy raw glass so I can make it into something else. When I make something and overcome the technical challenges between my vision and the reality of the raw glass, and then I hold the finished piece in my hands, it gives me peace, soothes my soul and satisfies me. I WILL get the paperwork done this morning, and I WILL get into the studio this afternoon, and the dust bunnies be DAMNED. They can romp and gambol at my feet and I will ignore them. I am going to fire up the kiln and MAKE something today."},
{"title": "Profit vs. Dream", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2006", "text": "The Starbucks Barista mugs--of which the Skyline is one series--hold an entire Starbucks grande coffee: 16 oz. of caffeine-laced black gold. Today it is the New York mug which holds the coffee and it does, indeed, hold real Starbucks coffee. While I was in Chicago at the beginning of December for the One of a Kind Show and Sale I bought the Skyline Chicago mug. When I got back to Atlanta I decided to get one for another friend from Chicago who also happens to live here as a Christmas gift. Lo and behold, you can't buy them online! In fact, for the series I like--the Skyline series--you almost can't buy them at all anymore! This series ran from 2002-2003 and the mugs were only sold in their own cities. Of course there is a technological solution to my acquisitional dilemma: eBay. I have avoided eBay just about as well as I have avoided blogging... until now. I am obsessed with the Starbucks mugs--but I digress. Again. About this morning. After finding out that the mugs were only available in their particular cities, I called around to all the Atlanta Starbucks locations in search of an Atlanta Skyline mug. One of the people I talked to was Bill at the Starbucks across from Emory University. He said he was looking for a Chicago mug and he had a Barcelona mug he would trade for it. Well I couldn't pass that opportunity up! So I called around to all the Starbucks close to my in-laws in Aurora, IL and found one. Then I called the in-laws and begged them to pick it up and mail it to me. They did one better: they went to another Starbucks and found me THREE mugs! So this morning I  met Bill at the Starbucks across from Emory and we swapped mugs. So the obvious question here is \"Why am I not drinking out of the brand spanking new Barcelona mug this morning?\" and the answer is because it is for my sweetie in rememberance of our trip to Barcelona four and a half years ago.The next big question is \"Why am I drinking coffee and writing about Starbucks?\". Isn't this blog supposed to be about glass and writing a book? Glass today, sadly, is another day from hell pouring over the tiny scraps of paper and entering them all into the computer to come up with the answer to the question \"Was I profitable last year?\". I am pessimistic about the answer--and thus in no hurry to arrive at it--as being a glass artisan (artist, artiste, craftsperson, WHATEVER) is not about profit. Starving for one's art is not a figure of speech and I am damn lucky to be married to a software genius who keeps the mortgage paid and the Sprout (Jessie) fed and clothed. So I close today with the final question, \"Why do we do what we do?\" Is it for money, out of habit, because we love it, not so easy to say, for responsibility or out of a sense of obligation, or for something else entirely or a combination of all of the above (and how much of each)? What would we be willing to \"give up\" to \"follow our dream\"? (Quotes because those are the standard phrases which stand for a much more complex life choice)."},
{"title": "Time to Unveil the \"News\"", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2006", "text": "Today's mug is the Starbucks Skyline Series Chicago. Chicago is and always will be my favorite because so many great things happened to me in that city: I met my husband, I met my best friends, and I started my own glass studio in 1987. I also spent a not inconsiderable amount of time in the University of Chicago's graduate program in linguistics pursuing a PhD (and catching a Master's), and a much smaller bit of time as faculty and then staff at Northwestern University pursuing a career outside of glass and realizing the futility of trying to work in an office setting from 9-5. So here’s the news… As is my want, I placed an ad in the Regional Showcase in the January edition of the Crafts Report magazine. In it was a picture of my latest sushi set: a red platter with orange, yellow, turquoise, dark blue and green plates in the paisley series. It came out in mid-December and a few days later I got an email from the executive assistant to the president of a well-known publisher of books on crafting. She wanted to know if I, as a professional glass artisan, would be interested in authoring a book in my field. I said sure! Who doesn't want to see her name in print? So she asked me for a resume and some more examples of my work as my website has a beautiful front page (a gift of from a very dear friend) but the rest is non-existent. I sent it all out. She wrote back that it looked good and asked me if I would prepare an outline of said book to make sure my ideas matched what they were looking for. I angsted. I angsted for several days until I woke up one night and from 2:30 am till 4:30 am (some of my best time for thought and anxiety) I figured out what needed to be written. Then I sat down with my Starbucks Skyline Series Chicago mug (see, you knew that intro was going somewhere) and I began to craft an outline. I sat at my kitchen table in the hard wooden chair until my butt was numb and my feet were frozen stiff, and I wrote everything I had thought of the night before. It took literally four hours. And when I saw it was done and sent it out, I was at peace. The publisher’s response was “Wow!” followed by “Can we get a few more examples of your work, please?”. So I Picassaed. Picassa is a wonderful, free, picture management software owned by Google. I allows you to gather together in one viewing all the pictures that are scattered hither and yon across directories, computers and external storage devices. I found pictures of work that I had forgotten I had and I sorted and picked and chose and sent. Five emails with an average of ten pictures each. The response, again, was “Wow!” followed by, “Hope to get back to you at the end of this week or early next week”.So Friday came and so did a phone call. “We would like to offer you a book contract, are you interested? We would like to go to press in Spring 2007 so you would need to have all copy to us in September. We are looking at a hardcover format with glossy color photos about 128 pages long. What do you think?” My turn to go “Wow!”So that was Friday and today is Monday. The contract goes into the mail to me tomorrow and I am to go over it with a fine tooth comb and ask any questions I may have about it. I am not naïve: I am a first-time author writing contracted non-fiction. My chances of altering anything in the contract are slim to none. But will I sign it anyway? Can’t think of any reason right now why not."},
{"title": "What a professional glass artisan REALLY does", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2006", "text": "I have my first cup of coffee in front of me in the ridiculously huge and absolutely necessary New York City Starbucks Skyline Series mug. It is absolutely necessary as today, January 15, I sit in front of my laptop and try to remember/enter into Quickbooks/resolve all of my expenses since June 2005. It is Sunday, a day of rest for some. I must be wicked as there is no rest for me. Every January I spend days trying to find all the wrinkled receipts and little scraps of paper on which I have written mileage and expenses without receipts. Then I enter them all into Quickbooks (which I use to manage my business finances) and balance them against Quicken (which we use for our family finances). I wouldn't have to do this step if I always used the business credit card to pay for business expenses and maintained a real petty cash system. But, duh, \"artisan\", not merchant, not banker, not stock broker, not accountant...The financial management process (and the process of writing this blog) is made more difficult by the background sounds of my husband kicking a dead ladybug under the couch in front of my four year-old daughter who tragically proclaims at the top of her lungs \"Her name is Martha and he killed her!\". So I digress.An obvious question at this point is \"So what does this have to do with the exciting new path in the journey?\" and the answer is \"nothing\". This blog picks up in the middle of my life as a professional glass artisan. A lot has already happened. I hope a lot more will happen. There will soon be some very exciting events that I wish to be ready to chronicle as they happen. Much of this journey I am on is spent on mind-numbing \"other things\" and today is slated for \"finance\". Tomorrow is \"website renovation\" if I get \"finance\" done today (not likely).Tuesday is for \"slippage\", the technical term for \"I have no idea how long this will really take\" + real life. Maybe I will actually make it into the studio and work with glass on Wednesday. Or maybe I will have to spend all Wednesday on cleaning and annual organization (I did inventory last week and one of the things I inventoried was number of dust bunnies. It was impressive).So \"heigh ho, heigh ho\"... or maybe I will pick up where I left off yesterday. I spent the entire day figuring out the html required to change the look of this blog. I picked the nicest template I could find, but a template is not personal. At the end of the day I had it mostly done and then I rolled back all the changes I had spent the day on opting to keep a perfect, pristine look over a not-quite-finished, far-from-polished but personal look. Maybe the colors are not all changed and coordinated and some of the graphics are a bit weird, and who knows if all the links and actions will work right, but the point of this blog is the journey. Now I am meta-blogging. Anything to avoid spreadsheets and Quickbooks!"},
