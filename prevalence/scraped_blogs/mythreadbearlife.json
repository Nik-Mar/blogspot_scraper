{"title": "Two New Angels  ........................................", "date": "Sunday, January 7, 2024", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersTwo newly created Angels flew out of my Sewing Room over the festive season ... both Wendy Briggs of \"Country Friends Designs\" Angels (tho' Wendy is no longer designing patterns unfortunately)It all started when my dear friend Sandy & I were exchanging little snippets of our Christmas decorating with each other via private messaging.  Sandy sent me the photo above, of two of her Angels, both purchased from me when I was running my craft cottage & making & selling dolls.  I drooled over the image & when I saw Angel of Joy I thought to myself \"Oh I do want one!\"   💗So I hunted out my pattern book & began to make my own Joy Angel.  She is from Wendy's book Season of Joy ....As I have forgotten to take a photo I have borrowed this image from ebayI was lucky enough to have everything I used already in my stash but I had to buy a fat quarter of the red felt as mine was too \"purple-ish\" & this was a nice Christmas Red.Yes her hair actually Is whole cloves!!! Hence she smells rather divine.   Painted shoes - I mixed together some red & black paints to get the right brown/reddish shade.The trickiest part (for me) was cutting out the hearts neatly in the bottom of her felt tunic.  I have photographed her out on my deck table as our light is glary today & it's hard to get a decent photo inside the house. After I finished Angel of Joy, a couple of weeks prior to Christmas, I decided I would carry on & make another Wendy Briggs Angel ... this one is from the Homespun Magazine above which is dated July 2005 !! I have only had this pattern 18 & 1/2 years ... waiting to be made!!  She is called \"Berry Christmas Angel\".   I even bought the white Linen back then, second hand from the thrift store - it has almost yellowed with age !!  😲I put the final stitch in her yesterday & I love her.  I have hung her from my old leadlight window frame & think she looks very happy there.  In the pattern Wendy has sprayed her entire Angel with a water/parisienne essence mixture to \"tea-dye\" her ... but I couldn't bear to do this to my pristine white girl. Instead of a felt star on her bodice, as the pattern suggests, I have sewn on this copper heart button - it was high time I used this as I purchased it a VeRy long time ago!  Her plum pudding is calico sewn, stuffed, painted white all over then the brown base painted on & embroidered with black french knots.  My \"pudding\" went missing for an entire day & I found it hidden under the spare room bed ... I am sure Little One had something to do with this tho' he denies it!I used the same felt as I used for Joy Angel to trim her skirt, same colour painted shoes also.  You can see in the pattern above left, that Wendy's version has her eyes looking downwards.  I did this initially but felt she looked too stern, too severe ... so I painted over the whites & then made her look heavenward.    Wendy's dolls are often inclined to have quite serious looking faces & I don't usually mind this, but I like her much more looking upwards.I am in love with my two new Angels & can't quite bear to pack them away just yet so I have told them they can remain out for the rest of the month so long as they behave  😉Beautiful sweet peas, picked this morning.  I am having to move any scented flowers outside when The Mr is home as he has Long Covid & anything fragrant makes him cough terribly.  I thought I would share the Christmas Card Sid made me ... dear boy, he is growing up so very fast & will be 7 soon!Alec & his lovely Mum Sarah are on a 3 day tramp on Mount Taranaki & sent this photo to my phone this morning.                       Look at that stunning mountain in the background - they are having wonderful weather. Earlier this week I made Banana Bread as our banana's ripen fast this hot weather.  I made two loaves & gifted one to my daughter in law.  They tasted delicious - this is such a nice, simple but moist recipe & keeps very well. Little One was most unwell an entire day last week.  I cried, fretted, prayed, & generally aged about 10 years in one day worrying over him.  The next day he'd bounced back right as rain & ran up a tree! He has taken up residence under my Tilda Dolls Cot as he thinks no-one can see him under here.  Little does he know that Ginger furry girl can sniff out anyone !!!  Wishing you a wonderful week ahead dear friends - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,Thank you as always, for your ever-welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},

December rain is always such a blessing & the garden is just drinking it up. Vases of sweetpeas & dahlia's picked this morning between showers.Christmas came & went again for another year.   We had two get-togethers ... firstly on the Saturday as eldest son & family were travelling down the Island for Christmas, & then another one on the 25th.I always enjoy watching my Grandsons open their stockings - it brings me great pleasure  🎄The week prior, I did some baking & packaged it up for friends ... just my usual Gingernut Bites & chocolate Fudge Slice ... a creature of habit I am!My dear friend Sandy posted me The Most Delicious chocolate Christmas cookies, all the way from the South Island.  And look Willie ... I made Scroggin Slice !! I always enjoy \"the twixmas days\" between Christmas & New Year.    After all the hectic-ness that Christmas brings I love the slow, leisurely pace of these days.   I have been drinking Christmas Tea in my new-to-me Mug & eating delicious Christmas Cake.Eldest son & his family gifted me this wonderful book.   The Topp Twins are New Zealand icons ... my dear Mum would've loved this book as she so adored their music & requested their songs be played at her funeral.   I am enjoying reading it a great deal.We live on left-overs this week - so the only cooking I have been doing is harvesting & cooking up beetroot from my garden & blanching broccoli to freeze.  The Mr is growing cucumbers at the farm this year & is having a wonderful crop ... which is great because my plant produced One Single Cucumber before shrivelling up & dying !!I packed All the Christmas decor away!  It took me two entire days but this was largely due to the fact that a certain Ginger Furry Being kept going to sleep in my containers, thus stopping me from using them ... being the soft touch that I am, I waited for her to wake up! 😉GlassHouse Candle \"Dancing Sugar Plums\" gifted by my dear friend Sandy - such a gorgeous fragrance -As the year draws to a close, I light a beautiful Candle & remember all those loved ones we have lost this year.   I include in this a special furry friend - sweet little Poppy Q who left us in July & who we all miss very much here in blogland  💗From Donna Ashworth Words on InstagramThough this verse brings tears to my eyes I LoVe it & think it is very true indeed.  Grief has been a hard thing to navigate this past year.Wishing you a wonderful New Year dear friends.  Hand-on-heart I want to thank you all most sincerely for following along on my little journey here.  Your presence warms my soul more than words can ever express.  For those that comment or email, or even just take a moment to read my ramblings ... thank you all from the bottom of my heart.Sending much love & friendship out to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0 ❤❤❤"},

{"title": "A Green & Gold Christmas Coffee-Table Vignette  ", "date": "Wednesday, December 13, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersFirstly thank you all So very much for your sweet kind comments on my last post.   The general consensus seems to be \"Leave the stand silver & paint the star\" - which I am more than happy with.    The problem here is that the star is currently missing - I blame the youngest four-legged member of the family & live in hope that I can find it again (!!!)  😸Last week I decided to do a Christmas coffee table display in a Green & Gold colourway  💚💛This largely came about because I had these 3 cherished items, bought home when I cleared out Mum's home            back in early March.  Mum always kept the Cherub candle holder & flower frog in her china cabinet & I found the gold Angel wrapped in tissue in a drawer.  I very much wanted to use these items as I especially loved the bronzy gold tonings of the cherub.  I needed a tray for my display but had none apart, from silver ones.  I had bought this mirror home from Mums, actually lifted it off the wall at the last minute & thought I'd bring it home to donate.  It's frame was plain dark brown.  I unscrewed the hooks from the back so it sat flat & then went over the frame with my rub-n-buff ... it came up wonderful & just the right muted gold colour I was after.                     Lights Turned Off                                 Lights Turned On                                                 My only purchase was this gold glass \"tree\" which I bought online from Spotlight in their sale.  It has fairy lights inside & stands 36 cms tall.I knew I had some thrifted candles that would fit in the cherub & found the perfect Christmas green.  All the other items on my tray are from past Christmas's or items I use daily around my home.  I sprinkled some gold stars over the glass when I was happy with everything.The little wire heart tree in a pot also lights up & was purchased * here * back in 2020.The gold baubles were a previous op shop purchase - you can buy bags of these very cheaply.  The bottom ones are actually broken but you just place them in the bottom & no-one knows  😉 The tureens that the baubles are in are from the SPCA Op-shop purchased back * here * in 2021.The wreath has been used for many years - I placed my glass tree inside it & wound some gold strings of beads around it.  Mums gold Angel sits just on the edge of it. The cream brocade tablecloth was a gift from my friend Joyce,  thrifted by her from the Church Op Shop where she works.I LoVed my Green & Gold Vignette & when I sit on the couch at nights it makes me very happy to look at the treasures that were my Mums. Unfortunately I came in last night to close the curtains & what do you think greeted me dear friends .................... ??.................................................................................................................................................................................Go on .....  take a guess .....................................................................................Raise your hand if you guessed right !!!!!!!  😐 And just look at the way her tail is curled so neatly around the flower frog making sure she doesn't stab her precious self !!!!!!!   She is honestly enough to make me give up  ....... & then yesterday I came home from town to this below  .................................................................................Blackie parked up on my new outdoor table runner - Lord give me strength ! 🙏I decided to paint the wooden fruit board that I showed in my last post as I wanted to use this special Christmas transfer.  Unfortunately it turned out too dark - I have photographed it outside today as it's such a dull overcast day - but indoors, in my house, the transfer barely shows up.  I should have used a light coloured background.  But it's okay - its all learning & not everything I paint turns out just magical & wonderful.I have acquired a small selection of Christmas books & wanted something to display them in.  This box (top left) was in my sleepout - it had gotten damp at some stage & had watermarks all through it.  I painted it Vintage White & mod-podged this lovely piece of decoupage paper to the front.  The paint covered over the watermarks really well.I'm really pleased with how this project turned out & Sid sat on the floor yesterday & read through some of the Christmas Children's books (all thrifted of course)The felt elf boots (top left) have been on my Pinterest board for a couple of years.  Last night I decided I wanted to make some so I drew up a pattern, scaled it down somewhat & then sat & stitched a pair of elf boots.  Mine are in pale green felt with pink pom poms because Why Ever Not ? 💚💗Before I close a mention regarding my last post .... the last photo of the $12 thrifted picture is actually Our beloved Late Queen as a young Princess Elizabeth.  Some of you realised this & some did not.  My dear friend Willie very kindly did some research on this & sent me * this link * if any of you are interested in reading about the prints.Thank you so very much dear friends, for your visits here today,I hope to be back in a few days with a Christmas-Home-Tour-of-sorts to share with you,Wishing you a wonderful rest-of-the-week,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Thrifted/Upcycled Kind of Christmas   -  (Part 2)", "date": "Thursday, December 7, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThank you all so much for the kind & encouraging comments you left me on my Part 1 post. I saw this on Instagram on marcandangels post - very true indeed! A couple of months ago, whilst browsing my local St John's Op Shop, I saw this cone below.  This was the same day I purchased the $1.50 wooden angel in my previous post.The cone was plastic & covered tightly in a thick brocade fabric - it measured 17 inches in height so was quite tall.   It has been $8.90, marked down to $3.90, & when I took it to the counter the lady took another dollar off as the tip was slightly broken.   I knew immediately I wanted to make it into a Yo Yo tree, the same as the one I made last year in * this post *I painted it 2 coats of Linen chalk paint - it adhered really well. I also glued cardboard in the base to give it some stability, although the paint did stabilise it rather well.Each evening sitting on my couch, I would make fabric yo yo flowers using fabrics in the French General range - it was quite therapeutic & as I made them I tossed them in a small basket by my chair.  I made larger ones (12cm) for the first 2 rows & then decreased in size to a 9 cm circumference.Finally - just yesterday - I had enough yo yo's to cover my cone.  I used fabric glue to attach them as I could not stitch through the painted surface.  This silver candle holder has been in my stash for years a very long time & I thought it would make a good stand for my cone tree.  I currently have the tree just sitting atop the candle holder as I am unsure whether or not to paint this & I need your help & opinions please.Lots & lots of yo yo flowers ...... 62 in total !! 💗I had thought about painting the base in a dull Christmas red - the same colour I have used * here * on the wooden reindeer.  But I also rather like it left as it is ... sort of a bit vintage looking.  What would You do dear readers?  Please leave me a comment below & let me know ... paint or leave as is ??Also the rusty star is just attached with double sided cellotape currently ... paint this ?? or leave as is ??  Your opinions would be very much appreciated.    If you are unable to comment then just email me & I can copy/paste your comment.  Thanking you in anticipation.(My email address is stitchedbyjulie@hotmail.com)This pair of wooden chopping boards was $4 in Stratford Hospice shop earlier in the year. I decided to paint the round one at the back ... this turned out to be simply a wood round & Not a chopping board & the paint went on so well ... I am using the Forrest Green that I have become rather addicted to this Christmas.Two coats later & I applied a wonderful Iron Orchid Designs transfer that I purchased last Christmas.  I had planned to screw an eye hook into it to hang, but I rather like it just tucked into my display as is.When I bought the red hessian online in Spotlights Black Friday sale (last post) I also bought 2 metres of Minecraft fabric.  I made my Grandsons a pillowcase each using * this * simple tutorial..  As the fabric was extra wide I had enough on the sides to make them each up a drawstring bag as well. They are both right into everything Minecraft at present & I am sure they will love these items which I plan to put in their Christmas stockings.This morning I finished up some wooden tags that I had painted - some I used transfers on & others I mod podged serviettes onto.  These will be tied onto gifts for some special folk.We had a lovely craft group break-up outing last Monday when we visited Cambridge & went to view the Town Hall  all decorated for Christmas.  We also visited a couple of Op Shops & had a nice cafe lunch. Click on the picture to enlarge it should you wish.  While I was waiting for the ladies to be served in the SPCA Op-shop, I happened to look down on the floor & this picture was leaning against a stand, kind of tucked into the corner.  I could not resist buying it & I absolutely love it!       So dear friends ... look around but also look up  & look down when you are thrifting - you never know what bargains you may miss.  $12.00 an absolute bargain!  💙Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you a wonderful rest of the week - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Thrifted/Upcycled Kind of Christmas  -   (Part 1)", "date": "Sunday, December 3, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have lots of Christmas Creations to share with you so I plan to be posting quite often throughout December.Today I wanted to share some thrifted & upcycled Christmas makes to hopefully inspire you that you don't need to spend alot of money - just a bit of imagination & time. Although I have forgotten to take a Before Photo, the wooden Angel above left was picked up in the Stratford Hospice Op-shop for $1.50. She was a pale denim blue in colour. I painted her in 2 coats Antique White chalk paint & then decoupaged a Christmas serviette on to her dress. She makes a sweet display on my table along with a vase of Seafoam roses  💗Remember back in * this post * when I won the breadboard at a Pink Ribbon Breakfast fundraiser.  It had sat in the back of my craft cupboard so I added a pretty poinsettia transfer & gave it 2 coats spray acrylic varnish so that food can still be placed on it.The Reindeer above was white - he was on clearance (50 % off) in a local Variety Store last Christmas.  I painted him in red to fit in with where I planned to display him. The cherubs above right were purchased from my local SPCA store in mid winter.  Although they look plaster they are not & were only $4 each. The poor Angel above was a sorry sight in my local St Johns Oppy.  She was $1.50 & looked most unloved.  I pulled her to bits by holding my hair dryer over the star & wings to loosen the glue - this did not come away as successfully as I hoped.  But a sand, some chalk paint & decoupaged tissue, new hair,  then wire added to hang her with & some pip berries wound around the wire ... a huge improvement don't you think ??!!  💕Frequently in thrift stores they have bins of kitchenware for very cheap as they seem to get so much of it donated.  I found the sifter & the vintage grater in Mums Hospice a couple of years ago.  Looking back through my photos I first attempted this in August 2022!! I filled ziplock bags with cheap toilet cleaner purchased from the $2 shop & left each item in it for a couple of days, turning frequently.  I wanted them to rust really well!!  Once they'd reached my desired rusty-ness, I ran cold water over them to stop the process & there they sat, in my cupboard ...... until last week ...... when I dragged out the Sifter.  I'd seen an idea on Pinterest & wanted to try it.You can see how rusted it got by the photo of the back view.I filled the inside with some wadding to about 3/4's the way up.  Then I hot glued in a variety of different bits & bobs ... rusty birdhouse, a pinecone, some greenery & pip berries.  I wanted some long cinnamon sticks but had none so I hot glued shorter ones together & then tied them up with torn fabric strips.I made a small calico gingerbread man as well as some candy canes which I tea dyed & then painted stripes onto. I packed it really tightly & secured everything, as well as poking some dried moss into the gaps.I also made a tag by tea dying a luggage tag ... I am so thrilled with how this project turned out & look forward to doing something with the grater now. The big mess creative space top left, was how my work table looked last week as I had various wooden bits in the process of being painted.  I decoupaged tissue onto the oval tags & tied up 6 different soaps in cellophane & ribbon - I plan to gift these to the ladies tomorrow at our Christmas Craft Group break-up.Yesterday I did a Christmas display on my outdoor deck table.  I'd purchased 2 metres of red hessian in Spotlight's black friday sale & made this into a runner.  I placed my pots of white & red petunias on this but felt it still \"needed something more\"  ............I had the chalkboard signs in my drawer so I painted them with Forrest Green & then added a transfer & Jute twine to make into a Christmassy sign.The teapot above left was a thrift store find months ago so I also painted this with the green while I had it out.  Once again, a transfer, some greenery & berries & it just finished off my table setting.Incidentally this is what you do when your teapot has a wet bottom as well as wet sides & lid ... you have to be a bit ingenious to dry it all at once  😉The blackboard advent calendars were purchased last year at the same time as the wooden deer (previously mentioned) in a 50% off sale ... I bought 3 so gave one each to my Grandsons.  I'm really delighted with my Christmas Outdoor table & No dear friends .... as I type this .... there is not a cat on it as yet !!! 😲My daughter-in-law Sarah makes me a beautiful calendar each year with photos of Alec in it.   I must admit to a bit of a 😥when I turned it over for December ... missing my dear Mum so very much!Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,I shall be back soon with Part 2 ... I just have to actually finish the item before I can share it with you.Wishing you a wonderful week ahead - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},
{"title": "\" A Jingle In A Pringle   \" 🌲 ", "date": "Thursday, November 30, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersYesterday I needed to wrap a fragile ornament for posting, so I found a cardboard tray in my recycling bin to cut up & use around the ornament.I went to find my packaging tape & upon my return, this is what I found 🐱 ... a certain ginger furry friend curled up in the cardboard tray!     This is especially for you Willie as you commented last week \"no furry friends??\" I might add - she slept for over 2 hours there before I was able to cut up the cardboard box.  You surely cannot tell me that is comfy ??!!Back in early September when I returned from Mum's funeral & crafting was the very last thing on my mind - my dear friend Claire messaged me to ask if I'd like to do \"a christmas challenge\"?                 She'd just had this bright idea for us to do \"A Jingle in a Pringle\".  What might that be I enquired? 😉                                        You take a Pringles tin & make something christmassy that will fit inside it ! Hmmmm .... it certainly got my creative mind whirring ... I hadn't bought Pringles in years but Yes the local supermarket still sold them.  I purchased a can & Sid happily munched his way through them for me.  Then I painted my can 2 coats Forrest Green chalk paint.I had a lovely Christmas transfer that I thought would look just right against the Forrest Green colour ... I also glued some ribbon to the top & lower edges.Although I went back & forth with a few ideas, I came back to my original thought - making Claire the tiny Country Friends Christmas dolls in Wendy Briggs book.  Wendy is no longer designing but I have lots of her older patterns & books.  It was tricky sewing & turning those teeny tiny doll legs & then painting the boots black ... its been awhile since I've done anything like this.The Mr would be in the dining-room working on his laptop in the evenings, & I would be in the Lounge.  He would send me phone photos of Little One who would sneak into my sewing room, take the dolls (or doll body parts) off my desk & then play with them ... this went on for several nights despite how well I hid them  😐I was absolutely delighted how the dolls turned out.  Their names are Joy & Kris Kringle & I managed to make them entirely from fabrics & trims already in my stash.    You can see from the photo above that they are only the size of a pencil - just under 6 & 1/2 inches in height ... so rather tiny & fiddly.A closer view of their handpainted boots & Joy has some stitchery on her skirt.Once they were finished I was looking at them & wondered if perhaps Claire might like to make them into a swag.  So I made a little stuffed heart from homespun fabric ... I didn't stitch them into a swag as they would not have fitted into the Pringles tin but I wrote Claire a note suggesting this when I sent the package down.You can see how they might look stitched into a swag.I also had room (only just!) to add in one of the stockings that I showed in last week's post.  I filled it with some choccies, a candy cane & a small ceramic Christmas tree ornament.Let me tell you dear friends - it was a tight fit getting all those items in that Pringles tin without squashing them up too much!!I bought a Christmas box at the Variety Store, packaged it all up in red tissue,  then added one of the wooden tags that I made in *this post* last year.  I also added in some Choccies, some Relax tea & a bag of my homemade Citrus Potpourri.  The package only took 2 days to arrive at Claires & she was so thrilled upon opening it.  The reason I sent it before December is because Claire is taking part in a Christmas Home Tour this weekend ... opening her home all decorated for Christmas, & I thought she might perhaps like to include the swag in her decorating.I shall be sure & show you my Jingle in a Pringle from Claire when it arrives.This morning was a baking morning whereby I made Caramel Anzac Slice for my eldest son,  a Weetbix Slice for The Mr, & another loaf of Banana Bread as I had banana's turning brown. Image courtesy of @LadySnowAngel on PinterestTomorrow we wave Goodbye to November & welcome in December & the festive season.  It feels like I blinked & November disappeared by.Thank you dear friends, as always, for your welcome visits here today,As we approach a busy time of year, please remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other, With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the 3 furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "All Stocking-ed Out (!!!) ", "date": "Sunday, November 26, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersIt has been a stocking-making kind of week (or fortnight) & I am currently all stocking-ed out ! Our beautiful Cherry Blossom tree (Shimidsu-sakura) in full bloom a couple of weeks ago, before the strong winds came.At the beginning of October my local Patchwork Store Stitchin-stuff put a notice in their online newsletter requesting small christmas stockings to be made to donate to the local Foodbank. I collected the free pattern & instructions & cut out several from my Christmas fabrics.  I managed to sew up 10 before Covid struck me & my sewing abilities disappeared out the window 😐 They are fully lined & padded with wadding, & each one measures just under 8 inches.  This one above was one of my favourites fabrics.  The store were hoping to reach a target of 300 stockings & when I dropped mine in they were up to 279.  (Click on the picture to enlarge & read clearly)So I was delighted to read in my local newspaper this week that they actually reached 350 in the end.  The store fills them with chocolate treats & they go in the Foodbank boxes for families that have younger children.  Next year I will aim to sew up more as I am sure I have 10 already cut out.These sweet little stockings above are a free pattern from the Twig and Tale website.I buy offcuts of linen when I see it in the thrift stores & I hand embroidered these before sewing.  I plan to fill them with some ceramic christmas ornaments for a couple of special people.Last year, after Christmas, I made myself the swag of primitive stockings above.  My dear friend Sandy had shown me a photo on her phone & I made them from memory ... in the softest green & grey striped linen fabrics above.  My friend Sandy has moved away down to the South Island & I miss her immensely. I decided to make her a set in reds & taupes as I knew she loved these colours.  I posted them away & Sandy was delighted when they arrived as she had just begun her Christmas decorating.While hunting for some threads I came across this stitchery that I had stitched last Christmas & never ever made up.  It is a very old design from Mogs Designs whom I am sure no longer designs. It is called \"tis' the season stocking\"Although I'd done the stitchery I still needed to tea-dye my calico & then make up the stocking, stuff it & fill the top with berries & greenery as well as make the 3 candy canes. I also sewed 7 rusty bells down the length of the stocking.  I used to make lots of these & sell in my Craft Cottage & they were always VeRy popular.   🎄I love this little area of hand-mades hanging on my wall.  The Calico Reindeer I made in * this post * back in 2020.And Yes - it was time again to sit & wrap 48 little parcels, & fill my Grandsons advent stockings.  This was a good activity to do while resting from Covid & took me 3 days to complete (!!!) I will be delivering these this coming Thursday. Just prior to going on the Cruise I cleaned out our fireplace, scrubbed the brick surround & then bought all my houseplants back from the \"hospital corner\" down the end of my lounge.  I noticed my ladder fern (2nd from left) had roots coming out the bottom so it needed a re-pot.I found this pot under my house, bought home from Mum's when I cleared out No 44 way back in February.  I thought it was a good size for the fern but needed a paint.  I painted it in Old Linen, the same colour as the other pots, then gave it 2 coats of spray varnish to protect/seal it.  I found an offcut of transfer that I also applied to it.I am sure that my ladder fern breathed a sigh of relief when I repotted it & it's looking much healthier already.  And Yes dear readers - you can see definate signs of Christmas decorating going on here at Threadbear HQ.Thank you - as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x ( a new Header to take us into the festive season)"},
{"title": "Cruise-ing,  Covid ........  &  Orders", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersOctober of last year, while I was lying in a hospital bed recovering from a not-especially-nice surgery, my friend Gail sent me a text ... Would I like to go on a 5-day cruise next year in November?? Why ever not ?! I thought.  Of course it was ages away & anything could happen in between times (& in fact, quite alot did happen in between times)There were a group of 8 ladies going, mostly our craft group ladies plus 2 extra.  Because we shared rooms it kept the cost to a minimum. The first rose blooms of the season - Dublin Bay - picked last weekEventually November rolled around & the day arrived for us to board our ship.  It was a P & O Cruise for those that are familiar with them.  This one was a \"Tribute to the King Cruise\" so lots of Elvis music & rock-n-roll. I must add here, that the tribute acts were just wonderful & of a really high quality.Here is everyone getting ready for the Sail Away Party.  I loved being up high on this deck & looking down on the pools, also there was a flying fox going overhead!  After pouring rain all the way up to Auckland the weather came out beautiful.The was the Atrium where some of the entertainment took place ... I especially loved the Glass Lifts (right).   This was on Level 5 & we were lucky enough to have our rooms on the same level.Here are all 8 of us together ...  left going around table .. Jan, Sharlaine, myself, Joyce, Maureen, Liz 1, Liz 2 & Gail front right.This was the route the ship took, leaving Auckland sailing down the Coast to Picton, a full day in Picton, & then returning again.  5 days - quite long enough for me - who couldn't wait to get home to her furry friends again 😉Where I have put the yellow + is where I live in rural Waikato.Here is the oldest of the group Maureen, with myself, the youngest.  On the right I had just had my hair done & we were getting ready to go to a Neil Diamond Tribute show (which turned out to be so amazing!!)On docking in Picton we had already prepaid for a tour up the Queen Charlotte Sounds (see map above).  We were going on the boat below left with a Company called CougarLine ToursWe sailed all the way up the Queen Charlotte Sounds stopping at all the little bays along the way, dropping off boxes of groceries, trampers, sometimes picking up tourists - it was fascinating & the Captain gave a running commentary along the way.  We saw lots of dolphins, some even followed the boat for awhile.  The stunning crystal clear waters of the Queen Charlotte Sounds.The furthest point was Furneaux Lodge 2 hours out ... & then we headed back to Picton again.Once back in Picton we treated ourselves to a delicious Pub Lunch of the freshest Gurnard, straight out of the sea.  There was a market opposite the wharf which we wandered through for awhile & then it was time to catch the shuttle back to the ship.  Another full day at sea & then early on the Tuesday morning we berthed again in Auckland.Waiting our turn to disembark - you had to vacate your rooms by 8 am so we were up & about early.  It was a wonderful experience & I would certainly cruise again but I would do several things differently next time around. My dear friend Sandy summed it up perfectly when she messaged & said \"Congratulate yourself Julie on having the Cruise experience - especially since you are such a Home body at heart\"  And I unashamedly Am a Homebody. 💗Unfortunately dear friends, I appear to have come home with a rather unwanted souvenir & I am the only one in the group that has so far succumbed to the virus.  Today is day 8 & although I'm not coughing quite so much, I still feel constantly dreadful.  But I know Covid is a process & I just have to be patient, rest & let it run its course.  It has taken me 3 days to write this post as my concentration skills are rather lacking 😐A couple of months ago my dear friend Shirley asked me to make her two items she had some photos of.  The first was a HOME wallhanging, quite primitive in style but Shirley didn't want primitive for her home so we adapted it & I painted a wooden coathanger to tie Shirley's hanger on to (the one in her photo was tied to a twiggy tree branch) Shirley's home is muted pinks & greys so these colours were perfect.The second item Shirley had photographed was a rather dilapidated looking Angel.  As soon as I saw it I knew I had that pattern - thankfully it was an old design from Mums Moment, whom I don't think are designing anymore. The pattern is called Pocket Angel as she has a sweet elasticated pocket on her dress, where the yo-yo flowers are.  I made her up in Tilda fabrics, provided by Shirley & think she turned out delightful.  I used some hand-dyed mohair yarn for her hair.  Her base is weighted with pellets so she sits nice & sturdily.Her wings are embroidered with the words Love is the stitching that holds hearts together 💕 Shirley was thrilled with both her Orders.Thank you dear friends for staying with me through this lengthy post,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Craft Group Challenges,   Book Characters   &  A Little One Update ", "date": "Saturday, October 28, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersYesterday I picked a beautiful bunch of lilacs from my tree - this is only the 2nd year it has flowered but last year was not enough to actually pick any.Their fragrance is gentle & soft ... I have sat a framed photo of Mum underneath as she would be smiling I am sure.Throughout the year my friend Gail & I like to think up random \"challenges\" for the ladies in our craft group.  When I hosted the ladies back in July I had saved & washed up a load of cat food tins.   We go through 2 or 3 of these a day so it doesn't take long to get a good supply.  I'd removed their labels & any stickiness left behind & I held the bag out & told the ladies it was a Lucky Dip - they could take 1,2 or 3 ... or however many they wanted ... & they had to create something with them!(I should add that these challenges are entirely optional to take part in)I chose 3 tins for myself & then found this old broken table leg in my stash that I knew would-come-in-handy-one-day.  I cut it down to size & then painted the tins & the spindle. Then I hot glued the tins to my spindle as I wanted to make A Sewing Caddy.Click on the picture to enlarge for a closer lookI mod-podged some paper serviettes to my tins & spindle to embellish them - I'd originally planned to use transfers but paper serviettes are a lot more cost effective.  Then I mod-podged the whole thing to seal it.(I've forgotten to photograph it step by step hence I am explaining what I did)Tin 1 : I drew a cardboard circle, padded it, covered it with fabric & glued in - this was to hold my quilting clips.Tin 2 : I cut some floral foam to fit & then cut a slit in the middle & covered the entire thing with fabric - this was to be a scissor holder.Tin 3 : I made into a pincushion using a gathered circle of fabric & some wadding, all glued in.I made a little stitched tag to attach to the handle along with a scissor charm & then I filled my tins with their various bits & bobs.Such a sweet, fun project & would make a gorgeous gift for a crafty person 💗I loved what Sharlaine had done ... she had taken a thrifted wooden goblet, turned it upside down, glued her catfood tin onto it & then painted the whole thing & added some transfers.  It was so lovely & would be wonderful with a small candle or tealight in it 💜Maureen had cut hers into the shape of a sunflower, painted it & attached it to a thin dowel, then sprinkled glue + glitter to the centre.  This would look great poking into a potted plant 💛Liz had been thinking of her grandchildren when she created hers & had knitted tiny peas with black eyes as well as worms with tiny felt hats on, then made the cans into houses for them, including using the lids off the tins.These had been such a hit that Liz asked me for some more cans as other family members had ordered some from her - I was happy to oblige. - Before -                                  - During -                                        - After -                A tiny bud vase picked up from the Op-Shop for $1.50 - given the tomato sauce treatment last week.  I originally thought it was brass but I think under all the grime & discolouration it was more silver. Sids school recently held a Book Week.  To celebrate the children got to choose a Book Character & then dress up as that character.  Sid chose Marmaduke Duck from the book above.Posing at Home                           At school with the telescope his Dad made himHis Mum did an amazing job of creating his costume using alot of what Sid already had (orange shorts, socks etc). My contribution was the hot glue gun, some white feathers & the wooden spoon tucked into his belt.  Sid was delighted to win the competition for his classroom & won a book voucher.Many of you have asked after Little One & I have not updated you for awhile.  He is doing well & is living his best life 😉 No Pippi & Blackie have still not accepted that he is here to stay - Pippi is the worst & still hisses & chases him at every opportunity - Blackie not so much.  It is certainly easier now he can go outside during the day & we only have to keep them apart in the evenings when they all come in for the night.He is still kitten-ish in that he wants everything you touch & frequently runs off with my crafty bits.  He must be happy enough though because I have never known a cat to purr so much !!  In my naive way, I still live in hope that they will one day get along but who knows?!  When I do my big monthly grocery shop & buy cat food, the girl on the check-out always asks me ... How many cats do you have??? I usually say 4 as I include Fluffy at the farm 😉Thankyou as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Trike-Trailer,   A Drawer,   & Dishcloth Knitting", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThose that know me well, know my absolute LoVe of old vintage trikes ... I have four of them in varying states of disrepair. This one above is still looking pretty with the last of the pansies blooming, but these will sucumb to mildew soon as it's getting warmer here.This trike above left is probably my \"best one\" as far as condition goes.  It has always stayed up on my covered deck so doesn't get the weather & the Grandkids have ridden it frequently so I keep it oiled & running smoothly.  The trike trailer was purchased from the SPCA Op Shop ($12) late last year.  I had been asking The Mr to weld a loop to my trike so I could hook the trailer through it  .................... but I was still waiting ....................During my deck clean-up in my last post I found an old wire hook & managed to find a gap under the trike tray that I could screw this into quite securely.  I was delighted 😊 - I gave the trike & the trailer a good scrub as they were both looking green after the winter.As I knew I wanted to sit potted flowers in them, I lined each tray with an offcut of oilcloth to help prevent the wet pots sitting against the surfaces & rusting.  I planted some mixed colour petunias into six terracotta pots I already had - 3 for each tray.How happy this little set makes me every time I look at it.   And if the Grandsons want to ride around on it still, then it's simple to lift the pots out & away pedalling they can go  ............This old drawer was found at Mum's Hospice Shop at the same time I bought the Pansy Planter Box.   I thought it might make a handy addition to my craft room.  It had originally been bolted to a desk so I removed the old hardware from the back.  It was actually formica but I thought it should chalk paint up okay.You can see I removed the handle & painted right over it the same colour.I gave it 2 coats of chalk paint in the colour Vintage White.  It went on really grainy - to be honest I think this was more the paint than anything wrong with the surface of the formica.  I tried thinning my paint out but it still went on like this.  I very lightly sanded the roughness out afterwards but still wasn't happy with it.The drawer had a chunk out of one corner but I was able to fill this with some polyfiller.  I came across a large sheet of decoupage tissue that I'd been gifted last Christmas & decided to use this over my paint.  This was my first time using this tissue & it went on really well using mod-podge.  Once dry I coated it again with mod-podge as I find this seals everything & makes it wipeable.The sheet was large enough that I did the top, the drawer front & also managed to line the drawer base. I tied a Tilda swing tag to the handle & soon filled it with crafty bits & bobs.  I was really pleased with the finished result after being not so happy with it originally.And it fits in just perfectly on my sewing bench 💙The last time I delivered an Order of Potpourri to Brandy's Botanicals Deb asked me if she could try some of my knitted cotton dishcloths to sell.  I was more than happy to oblige as I just love knitting these up - here is the free pattern I use.I decided I needed to come up with a nice packaging method that was not too overly fancy but presented them nicely. I tied a brown paper belly band around them & then made up some swing tags that I printed off onto brown paper & cut out.  I was pleased with the simple but effective way they looked.  I had enough cotton in my yarn stash that I was able to knit 10 different ones to send down to Deb.  This way people can pick them up & feel the softness of them but also Deb can package them up with a soap easily enough if she so wishes.Last month Alec had his first ever Grandparents Day at his country school - they have been cancelled in recent years due to various Lockdowns.  He dressed up as a Wizard & I dressed up as a Granny 😉 (!!!)(I promise to have a proper cat update in my next post - Little One is fine & dandy & No - they are still not getting along)Thank you so much as always dear friends, for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Three Things I do each Springtime", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLongtime readers of my blog will know there are three things I like to do each Spring to help to refresh my home & outdoor area. The last of the spring freesia's picked this morning & displayed in Mum's crystal vase Thing One :Each Spring I like to treat myself to a fresh new length of Oilcloth for my dining table.  This table is a workhorse & gets a great deal of use so I really enjoy refreshing it each year.  This gorgeous 1.5 metre length was purchased online from this wonderful store.  I've always been partial to paisley designs & this really caught my eye.I especially loved the Lineny look & feel of it, even though it is fully wipeable.A gorgeous new variety of Gerbera gifted to me from my friend Sharlaine ... sitting on a thrifted silver tray.Thing Two :Every spring I give my old wrought iron table & chair set another coat of paint.  The colour is Hot Chilli & I just use the Resene testpots for this - I had some left over from last spring. This set is so old now that The Mr tells me the only thing holding it all together is the paint I keep applying to it. They are sitting up on my deck at present as everything on the lawn is covered in a fine confetti of blossom flowers that are floating everywhere with the winds we are getting.Thing Three :I always give my large wooden outdoor table a good scrub with sugar soap.  During the winter months I keep an eye on Spotlight & when their Hessian comes on sale I buy a 2 metre length of it to refresh my table.  This year it was $3 a metre on sale so the length only cost me $6.  I like to overlock the ends to stop fraying & I also gave it an iron as it was creased.  No sooner had I gone to get my plants to display on it, than a certain ginger furry being decided it looked rather nice & comfy & plonked her derrier down on it 😐  Usually she sashays down it like a runway - being the Princess that she is !!!I have some potted red petunias in my vintage scales & in the old cooking pot I have planted white petunias.  I didn't plan on a Ginger Cat featuring in my display but it appears that this may be non-negotiable !! 🐱 The pansies in my black planter box had gone mildewy so I replaced them with some red & white Impatiens ... every single thing got a good scrub & a clean & a de-cobweb.I don't particularly enjoy this job but things get really manky during winter & if you want to have all these derelict vintage treasures around then I feel you need to actually care for them.  Otherwise it all ends up resembling Steptoe's Yard. My friend Jane had given me this sweet daisy wall pot so I drilled some holes in the base & planted it with some miniature viola's.  So simple & lovely 💜The 5 red tulip bulbs I planted in Mum's old pedestal pot are flowering & looking so vibrant.This lily bulb has come up & although the flower looks brown in my photo it is actually quite black & reminds me of velvet.  I have no idea who gave me this or when I planted it here.It has been school holidays here in New Zealand & I have had the Grandsons on various days.  Sid's Mum asked me to drop him home a bit earlier last week as he was going for a haircut.  This is the photo I got sent later that day.  This is very \"out there\" for Sid who is usually such a reserved little boy.  It did make me smile.I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your comments on my Eulogy Post last week for my Mum.  I did hesitate when I went to hit Publish but I write this blog as a record for myself & my Grandchildren who may read it all one day & I felt it was important to include it.  Your comments just warmed my sad heart so very much - you are all so kind & thoughtful. 🖤Wishing you all a wonderful weekend dear friends - we are due some rain here in rural Waikato so it might be a sewing weekend.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},
{"title": "My Mum's Circle of Life  🖤", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2023", "text": "Greetings dearest friends & readers 🖤On the 31st of August, the official last day of Winter here at the bottom of the world, my beloved Mum's Circle of Life came to a close.  As she took her final breath, I was there by her side holding her hand, patting her head & playing her favourite song.  I told Mum that it was okay to go & be with Dad now, to be well & happy & healthy again.  That's how I like to think of them now ... together after 22 years apart.When Mum met Dad he was fresh out of the Armed Forces & not ready to settle down.  She loved him & waited patiently ... eventually they got engaged, married & moved up to Taranaki to begin their new life together.They became parents to my brother & I - & built a house at Number 44 where Mum was to live for the next 61 years of her life.Mum loved being a wife, a mother & a homemaker - even during the difficult years, of which there were many. Money was tight & Mum learned to be frugal, to make-do-and-mend  .... qualities that never ever left her.(Mum is on the left in both photos)Born & raised in the Manawatu area, Mum was the 3rd eldest of 11 siblings!  Her favourite always, was her older sister Margaret, gone 6 years now.  They remained close all of their lives.Mum was always neat & immaculate - both in her appearance And especially in her Home.After Dad passed away, 22 years ago now Mum decided she'd like to try travelling, having never ever been out of New Zealand.  Together we were lucky enough to do 4 trips to Australia over the ensuing years - we both thoroughly enjoyed these trips immensely, visiting two of Mum's brothers.Youngest Son Kayne & wife Nicole on left & eldest son Aaron & wife Sarah with Mum on right - taken April 2022 - Mums 93rd birthday !Mum loved being Nan to my 2 sons & was delighted when she was able to attend both their weddings, 8 & 9 years ago now.  Mum would often say to me \"I hope I live long enough to be a Great Grandmother but I don't think that I will\".              It was to her utter delight that she got to become special \"Great Nan\" to Alec & Sid, 6 & 8 years ago now.I absolutely LoVe this photo above & we used this on Mum's service sheet for her funeral 💗Taken at a re-union lunch in the Bay of Plenty almost 7 years ago now - the last remaining siblings of the 11, both Mum & Aunty Marg (seated centre) now passed away.Mum (reluctantly) entered Resthome Care last June (aged 93) & these photos were taken then.  Altogether Mum was in the Resthome for 15 months. When I cleared out No. 44 for sale last February,  I came across this plastic Shampoo Product bag & put it in my brother's Safe.  After Mum's passing we opened it & along with Birth Certificates & Mum's Will, it contained all her requests for her Funeral arrangements ... the Undertaker she wished to use, the Venue, the type of Casket she wanted, the Flowers, the Music/songs played & the Poem to be read out - it was incredible!Tucked into the bag was this envelope with strict instructions to be placed in her casket with her.  The letters were written by my brother & I in 1968 (I was 8!) ... & posted to Mum who was in hospital at the time.  Mum's great Grandsons also made her a card each & these went in with our letters. Mum chose this Poem to be read at her Service & wanted pink & mauve flowers on her casket.  It made everything very simple to just follow out her instructions.  I think Mum would've been very pleased with her Farewell ... I think she may Not have been so pleased at all the cousins that came out of the woodwork, some she had not seen for well over 22 years!  I will never understand why people do this - yet they can't even pick up a phone & say Hello - how are you?!  I had to use my not-so-nice-voice a number of times to bring it all back to the small private service that Mum wanted.Even though I had mentally prepared myself for Mum's passing for quite some time, I still cannot get my head around that she is no longer here.  I jump when my phone rings, thinking it may be the Resthome.  I hear some news & I think Oh I must tell Mum that.  Plus I have been hit by a wave of exhaustion (or maybe grief) since my return home again. The views from my brother's house where I stayed - the sea out the dining room window & out the other side, Mount Taranaki wearing his winter cloak!Anyway dearest friends ... although I have a head full of fluff, I will endeavour to return to blogland again & catch up on all your posts.Thank you sincerely, if you have stayed through this lengthy post - I wanted to write this Eulogy for myself more than anything but in all honesty, how do you cover 94 years - it would take 10 blog posts!  A dear friend sent me this little Verse last week & I thought how perfect.  💙Wishing you a wonderful week ahead dear friends - remember to be kind to yourself & to each other ... & I hope you find those Glimmers in your week,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the Furry Three x0x0x0 🐱😸😺"},
{"title": "A Bird-House Creating Workshop", "date": "Thursday, August 17, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersEvery few days I pick some fresh stems of Daphne - I like to keep a small vaseful on my kitchen bench & each time I'm working there I lean in & have a big sniff 😉💗 ... as far as I'm concerned the daphne season is over way too fast.My dearest friend Sandy moved away down the South Island earlier this year & I miss her dreadfully.Before she left she gave me a big bucketful of bulbs, mainly daffodils. I picked out some large sized ones & planted them in my wheelbarrow as the begonias I had in there were not doing well.  I am so delighted with my daffy display & think of Sandy every time I walk past it, & smile 💛A couple of Saturday's ago I attended a workshop out at The Floral Shed.  Very longtime readers of my blog will remember Nita when she first opened the Hummingbird - I wrote a blog post on it *here*.  Nita has now established a large garden at her rural property, opened a Shop there, as well as supplying Florists & running Workshops.  When I saw a space available in the Birdhouse making one, I put my name down without thinking too hard about it.Driving out there I felt a little anxious as I did not know any of the other ladies doing the workshop. Seeing it all set up around the work table, I felt immediately inspired.  My first attempt came together quite quickly but then I realised I'd put my sides on wrongly ... Nita easily recitified this & gave me a new kit.  It was so much fun banging in nails - you actually had to hit them really hard to go into the wood.The photo above was taken by Ayla who does photography & social media for Nita via her own business fablefolknz I was so totally engrossed in drilling that I did not know it was being taken but I did ask Ayla for permission to use her photo in my post, which she very kindly gave me.   After our birdhouses were assembled we all stopped for a delicious morning tea.  Look at that food - I can attest that it was amazing!After morning tea the fun part (for me) began when we got to decorate & embellish our birdhouses.  Nita had a great array of rustic bits & bobs for us to choose from.  Some ladies kept theirs quite plain, others went over the top - they all looked wonderful.(That is me second from the right for those that don't know me 😉)Although I knew none of the other ladies I think I hit the jackpot because they were all just so lovely & friendly, inspiring & fun to be with.  Here we all are, so proud of our birdhouses - we all agreed that it was indeed a wonderful way to spend a morning & that we don't do this sort of thing for ourselves, often enough. Here is my finished birdhouse - I wanted to add the No 91 to it because - well that is my address! I found some silver numbers that you put on birthday cakes & painted them matt black.  I just adore my birdhouse in all its \"rustic-ness\".  I would do another workshop with Nita in a heartbeat. Currently I have it sitting on my deck area under my vintage Mangle.  My lovely friend Shirley was visiting so I made some banana & white chocolate muffins as I had banana's turning brown.  A few days later I was hunting for a caramel slice recipe online & came across a new-to-me recipe  Caramel Anzac Slice. It sounded divine & as I had all the ingredients, I made it up.  By the amount of pieces that have passed my lips I can certainly attest that it was delicious 😏I would like to be able to say that we have harmonious relations in our furry family but I would not be telling the truth.  Thankfully Little One can go outside now & it's made my life a little easier.  I bring him in about 5 o'clock & he has a rest by the fire before causing havoc for the rest of the evening, then bedtime.  You can see by the blue arrow he hides under this unit, thinking he is invisible. We don't as yet allow him in the lounge as it gives Pippi & Blackie a room to get away from him.  He of course, has other ideas!Pippi is \"milking it for all it's worth\" & knows I will allow her on the things she is not usually allowed on, for example my Mums good mohair throw blanket.  I still live in hope but I must admit - it's wearing thin some days  😖My chocolate addiction consumption continues & this arrived in my inbox yesterday sent from The Mr. I think it was supposed to make me feel better .... it did not  😉Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Enjoy the rest of the week & remember to be kind to yourselves & each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry three x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Hosting The Craft Group Ladies", "date": "Sunday, August 6, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWell it would seem that I blinked & July ended 😕 - the year is slipping by so very fast.It was my turn to host the craft group ladies in July & I just managed this on the very last day.  When I look back at the busloads of Garden Groups that I used to host it is hard to believe how much work it felt like just to get ready for 7 ladies!!!  It felt like a marathon effort. In my attempts to tidy up prettify things a bit round here I went off to the Garden Centre with a birthday gift voucher from my friend Gail.  I could not resist the super healthy looking maidenhair fern above, as my last one was looking rather dead sad.I also used the voucher to buy these lovely cyclamen above - just the pop of colour my outdoor space needed at the moment 💗Mine is the one on the right - an old frame of Mums that I repurposedWe had previously decided to make this craft meeting a Mid-winter Christmas theme so I chose the \"Joy\" frames as our project.  Everyone had to bring along their own painted frame.  We had a lovely time glueing vintage music papers to our frames, stamping the word \"Joy\" & then making the tiny wreaths to go on them.  I love how everyone's turned out slightly different as each of the ladies put their own spin on it.  Our challenge issued last month was from Gail.  She handed everyone a Daphne's Diary magazine & we all had to make a project out of it.  Gail works at the Op Shop & a large pile of almost-new Daphne's Diary magazines had been donated.  This is my copy above.Wanting to try something a bit different, I chose the leaf art above.  I found a tree down the far end of my section with these large green leaves on it so I pressed & dried them for a week.  I was really pleased with how the painting turned out but unfortunately I put them too close to our fire to dry the paint & they burnt & crinkled up quite a bit.  You can see the brown markings above where they burnt.  So I decided to try another project.The patchwork coasters caught my eye so I found my scrap bag of Tilda fabrics - Yes I save every scrap!  These were a fun & simple project to whip up - I used wadding in the middle & a pretty floral backing.  These would look lovely tied up with a scrap of lace & gifted together with a pretty coffee mug. I had originally planned to give the ladies another project after lunch so I trialled the snowflakes made from wooden clothes pegs.  You can find the instructions * Here *.  I found that the wooden pegs were very rough & required lots of sanding once I'd glued them, then when I painted them I wasn't that happy with the end result so I ended up mod-podging a paper serviette over it to hide the faults.Though I was able to show the finished project we did not end up creating it - perhaps another month we may make it as our group project.  This is our lunch tableI know I have said this before, but one thing we always get right at our meetings is the food!  We all bring a shared plate & everyone bought something christmas-themed along.  It was wonderful to have the hot food as it was a cold bleak day here.  Our morning tea table above - Yes Willie, I made Scroggin Slice ! I reached my hand into my christmas decorations box & pulled out a few little bits to decorate our table & make it feel a bit more mid-winter christmassy.I picked Sid up at lunchtime on Tuesday as they had parent-teacher interviews.  He wanted to craft so we made this \"penguin\" above from toilet roll tubes.  Sid has named him \"Frank\" 😉I captured this photo of Pippi last week ... she had been creeping up on Little One on the deck & thought that she was hidden behind The Mr's farm gumboots.  She was Not impressed when he ran away inside & she couldn't stalk him any longer. Wishing you a wonderful week ahead dear friends - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry ones (all 3 of them!) x0x0x"},
{"title": "Arts And Crafts", "date": "Sunday, July 23, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWhenever I ask Sid what he would like to do today he always replies \"Arts & Crafts\".  I save a myriad of boxes, tubes & other containers that I think he might enjoy creating with.The other day he made a \"marble run\" ... a contraption made of tubes etc for his marbles to go down - even including a sharks mouth for the marble to run through. I am always amazed at his imagination & he never needs any prompting. Every Tuesday after school we go to Lego Club which is held in a part of our local Library.  Afterwards we go into the Library & he chooses books to get out.  The Christmas craft book above left caught his eye as he wanted to make the Snow Globe Terrarium in it.  Off to the Op-shop we go to buy a large glass jar for $2.  Thankfully Granny had everything else required to make it.Sid wanted to \"re-enact\" the scene shown in the book so I found my other bottle brush trees & we did a matching display.  The snow globe has fairy lights in it but ours aren't showing up well in my photo.  We had to thread white pompoms onto clear fishing twine to make the effect of the snow falling.  Sid was delighted when Granny found a remnant of green ric-rac for his lid. 😉Also in the book were these Christmas Pinecone Owls.  Luckily I had some pinecones in my woodshed so we made one of these as well but chose not to spray paint our pinecone.  I've covered Connor's face as I don't have his Mums permission to put his photo on the internetSid had been asking for a friend to come so we invited Connor, a boy from his class & such a sweet delightful boy.  Together they made a range of characters using cardboard loo roll tubes.  I googled & found * this * wonderful site for ideas.  When I collected Sid from school this past week Connor came up to me in the playground & said \"Granny - I've been saving my toilet roll tubes for the next time I come to your house\".  What a perfect compliment 💙My lovely friend Kiwikid Sue & her husband have been on a trip over to New Zealand & we arranged to meet up in Tirau for lunch.  I had wanted to give Sue a wee gift for her new (6 month old!!!) Grandson Finn - just a little handmade Kiwiana gift, so I sewed some bibs & a matching teething ring, then made a cat from a wool blanket in my stash. I pulled apart an old toy of Sid's & removed the rattle from inside it - then I stuffed the cat with the rattle inside & it sounded great.My friend Carolyn has been up for 2 weeks dog-sitting for her son while he was overseas.  Carolyn wanted a chalk painting & decoupage lesson so we organised a painting day together last Saturday.  She painted the thrifted tray & bowl above & then I showed her how to decoupage them using paper serviettes.  She plans to gift these two items filled with baking. I had been working on this old saw that had belonged to my Dad - I bought it home in March when I emptied out the family home.  The Saw was rusty so I sanded this off & then coated it with Fishoilene which I found in The Mr's shed. Unfortunately the Fishoilene was still sticky after 5 days of sitting the saw by the fire.  I googled \"fishoilene still tacky\" & it suggested sprinkling talcum powder over it to remove the stickiness.  I figured I had nothing to lose so I sprinkled it liberally with talc & then shook the rest off onto the grass.  This certainly did the trick & took away any sticky residue.  While Carolyn was painting her woodware I painted Dad's Saw - 2 coats of black chalkpaint.I wanted to gift the Saw to my Brother for his birthday - he is right into growing veggies but although I looked hard I could find no transfers or serviettes relating to this theme.  In the end I used offcuts of the Botanical transfer that I used on * this box * & was really pleased with the end result.   I have sprayed the saw with two coats of clear matt finish varnish as I think this will protect it well.  I especially love the detail on the wooden handle & will give this a couple of coats of wax before I gift it to him next month.  Little One is fine & dandy & living his life to the fullest ......He enjoys watching the birds out the dining room window as they eat the bread I toss to them.  We leave the door open for him to venture outside but he is still a little timid as yet & has only gone a handful of steps out.  Mind you, if you could see the face on the Ginger girl who guards the door, hissing, spitting & banging on the glass, you would think twice about venturing out too (!!!)Little One is fixated with the front-loading washing machine & spends a great deal of time watching it agitate round & round.  He is also absolutely obsessed with the toilet ... the above funny appeared in my inbox this morning from The Mr. 😐A funny thing I've noticed that he does ... when I use my grumpy voice to him, shake my finger & say No - he squints his blind eye at me several times as if to say \"Well I am incapacitated you know!\" Dear Pippi & Blackie have not become friends with him as yet.  I live in hope but I think that the website I read that stated \"it can often take 8 to 12 months\" was probably referring to Our Household!  He has been in the household for 9 1/2 weeks now & for those that were wondering - Yes I am counting!!  The photo of Blackie is especially for you Willie my friend ... notice no leg-in-the-air today 😉  Alec picked these few straggly daffodills yesterday when I had him here - we had really strong winds on Friday & these were almost flattened.  They make me feel that hopefully, spring is around the corner.Thank you, as always, for your ever-welcome visits here today dear friends,Wishing you all a Happy Sunday (I started this blog post 3 days ago now!!)With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A June Recap", "date": "Sunday, July 9, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers Even though we are now well into July,  it's time for a bit of a June recap. (warning - rather photo heavy)We had a family day out to \"the big smoke\" of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, about 2 hours north of us.  First we visited Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World.  I last visited here when my 2 sons were aged 4 & 8 years old & my brother took us all as a treat.  I had been wanting to take my 2 Grandsons for awhile now as I felt they were really good ages to enjoy it. The boys both loved it so much & all agreed their favourite of all was the Penguin enclosure.Sid found a new friend 😉Eldest son taking photo is not in picNext we drove into Mission Bay & had an early lunch at the Bald Eagle Diner.  This was fun & then a walk along the beach front back to our vehicles.After lunch we visited the Auckland Museum & saw the Dinosaur Exhibition amongst other wonderful displays.  I took 98 photos of our day out so I have just tried to pick out a few special ones to share with you.I loaned my dear friend Claire a Simply Vintage Magazine - the same copy I used to make this primitive pumpkin..  When she posted it back she included \"extras\"The sweetest fabric pear & a matching miniature quilt in autumnal colours - she had sewn both items for me as a thank you for lending her the magazine.  Needless to say I have offered her several other copies Any Time She Likes!  😉I completed an Order for my lovely friend Shirley for 4 lavender/lace coathangers along with some more Mothball sachets.  When I posted my Mothball sachet recipe on Instagram I received orders for 24 of them.I celebrated another birthday in June - 63 years around the sun! Happy Birthday to Meee!  We had a family tea celebration planned but had to postpone due to Alec developing Whooping Cough, so youngest son Kayne came to visit me after work with Sid.  We managed to have our postponed pizza dinner last night & my daughter-in-law made me the most delicious carrot cake 💝With some birthday money I treated myself to this expensive-but-gorgeous book above.  You can buy it in New Zealand from * Here *.  I drool over the pages & want to make Everything in it!When I cleared out Mum's house in early March I bought this old silver tray home with me - Mum used it to sit her toaster on for as long as I can remember.  I sanded the rust off,  chalk painted it & applied a sweet lavender transfer.  It is school holidays here in New Zealand so I have been on Granny duties. I took both boys to Extreme Edge Rock Climbing last Thursday & they had a wonderful time until it got super busy with other kids.They very much enjoyed the coin operated air hockey game. I let them choose where to go for lunch & of course they choose that old favourite McDonalds.  I didn't mind as I rather enjoy their fillet of fish burgers & fries. A Little One Update:Well I would love to tell you its all going tickety-boo but unfortunately it is Not.  Little One is fine & living his best life but Blackie & Pippi are most unhappy & they have not learnt to get along yet - it's over 6 weeks now.   I tried tough love the other day whereby I shut Little One in the cage above right, & shut Pippi in the same room so that they could get to know each other through the cage but it was traumatic & the most traumatised of all was Me!  Having said all that I did read this online (read the highlighted part) & realise it is still very early days. So I shall persevere & in the meantime, continue to eat chocolate (!!!) 😐Thankyou as always dear friends for stopping by today,Wishing you a wonderful week ahead - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the (3) furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "L.B.L.O.  (Life Before Little One) 😉 ......  & an Update ", "date": "Saturday, June 24, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLife is still very chaotic here at Cat Central Threadbear HQ but I realised I had not shared some projects that I'd finished before Little One came into our lives & tipped everything on its head !! The Mr sent this through to my inbox yesterday morning ... I did not laugh like once I would have 😉😐Before Little One I found an old wooden frame in my stash & chalk painted it off white.  I then framed the wonderful Certificate that Sid gave me in * this Post *. It hangs on my sewing room wall 💗Before Little One I called to visit my friend Jane whom I hadn't seen in many months.  Jane was just about to list this gorgeous vintage needlework picture on Trademe, an auction site here in New Zealand.  As luck would have it I was able to purchase it off her & I absolutely adore it! My photo is not really doing justice to the beautiful colours in this handwork piece. Before Little One I hauled this old wooden stool out of my sleepout. It was a $2 purchase from the Paws Animal Care op-shop.  I was originally going to just paint over the old vinyl top but in the end I removed all the staples & took it off. This was fortunate because the original foam padding had completely disintegrated & turned to dust.  I cleaned all this off with a scraper & gave the stool a good scrub with sugar soap. I gave the legs 3 coats of chalk paint in the colour Sage - the same colour I used on this small table.  I gave the top 3 coats chalk paint - Vintage White which is really more of a cream.  Then I applied this White Cloud transfer.   I lightly sanded the whole thing as I wanted it to have a time worn appearance.  I will use this either as a plant stand or just a stool to put a cuppa on - these are always handy as little side tables.  While still on the \"$2 theme\" I saw this wooden box on my last trip down to Mum's, in the Hospice Shop, sitting forlornly in the corner.  The first thing that popped into my head was \"pansies\" ...  I could visualise it planted with pansies.Once again, a good scrub & then two coats of a matt black testpot that I had in my stash. You can see I painted the inside well too.  Miss Pip used it in the interim as a sleeping box - then I added some of the leftover Botanical Transfers from * this * chest of drawers..  I waxed it really well both inside & out before lining it with a folded up black rubbish sack.   I forgot to add that I drilled 6 holes in the base for drainage.As originally planned, I planted it with a selection of 6 gorgeous flowering pansies - they are so pretty here in New Zealand this time of year.  The reason I used the Botanical transfer was because I wanted to sit in on the chest of drawers that I'd previously upcycled out on my deck.  Many things that I sit on here blow off & I knew this was solid & weighty enough to withstand some wind.  I am so pleased with how this turned out. I've put a piece of oilcloth underneath so that when I water it, it doesn't run over onto the wooden drawers. An Update on Rascal Little One ........Physically he is doing very well. On a trip to the Vet last Friday he was pronounced well enough to have his surgery (neutering). I don't know what they gave him but he came home bouncing off the walls & has not really stopped since.  He has finished all his antibiotics & even his blind eye is looking alot better.  He is living The Life of RileyHe is most fascinated with the fire & cannot understand it - our fire makes a noise as it has a fan fitted in it to blow the heat aroundNow that he has some confidence he is venturing further than the spare room ... there is much to explore in this house & different smells.  This is not always a good thing as I have to be vigilant with my other two cats.  Blackie takes not alot of notice but then he is gone most of the day to his favourite sleeping spots outdoors.  Miss Pip, being an indoor cat, has her nose most out of joint & I can't leave them alone as yet at all! This means not alot gets done. She is currently allowed to do things she would normally NOT be allowed to do ... such as sleeping in my underwear drawer (!!) 😟  (You may notice I managed to quickly tuck a cuddly rug down to save on cat hairs)Oh dearie me .... & on it goes . . . . . . . . . .My friend Elaine popped by for a visit last week & gifted me this beautiful bowl of Viola's - perfect colours for my deck table, & such a lovely surprise.Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - its mid winter here in New Zealand now & a bit gloomy,Sending much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones (3) x0x0x"},
{"title": "The Tale of \"Little One\"", "date": "Wednesday, June 14, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI captured this stunning sunset last night from our deck area.Well my dear friends ... it would seem that - without even trying ... we appear to have become a three-cat-family 😉Let me tell you the tale of \"Little One\"(Yes named by The Mr - can't you tell !!)You can clearly see the glassy eye in this photo above - this is the one he is blind inHis pregnant Mum was dumped at the metal pit beside the farm that The Mr runs ... this is a frequent occurrence (cats being dumped) as the farm is at the end of a dead-end road, not very far from town - so they don't have to use much petrol to abandon their animals. 😠  This infuriates me but that's not why we're here today.  Pregnant Mum (black & white) made her way to the cowshed where The Mr feeds a motley crew of assorted previously-dumped cats.  The Mr always maintains \"you either shoot them ... or you feed them but you never starve them\".  I am inclined to agree with him.  Our small rural town no longer has an SPCA so there is nowhere to take these dumped cats & nobody wants them.  Pregnant Mum gave birth to Little One & a black/white female kitten around Christmas time if my memory serves me correctly.  The Mr would sometimes send me photos of Little One & I remember saying I thought he had Siamese in him.  Always one eye was runny.  As time went on & he became very friendly The Mr decided he needed to get him neutered so off to the Vet they go.  The Vet checked him out thoroughly & informed The Mr they would not be doing the surgery as he had a nasty lung infection & an eye infection, as well as being born blind in one eye.  She also said he needed to be kept inside & given antibiotics & eye drops in order to recover properly or the lungs would never clear up.The first I knew of this was when The Mr arrived home & plonked the cat cage on my table ... what should we do??!! What a dilema ... we both shook our heads.  So The Mr said we'll try it for one night & see how it goes. It's a very stressful life here at Threadbear & sometimes we get tired from playing with the toys!!!Now let me be 100% honest here dear friends.   Do I want a 3rd cat? No I most certainly do not!! Somedays - I don't even want the two I've got !!!! (sorry Pip, sorry Blackie) But can I bear the thought of him living in the tractor shed in the cold & the damp with a lung infection?? No I cannot.  And so we do the best that we can.He has certainly made himself right at Home in the spare bedroom & Yours Truly (myself) even found herself in a weak moment at the Variety Store last week - purchasing cat toys (!!!!) 😖Back again to the Vets last Thursday for another check up (we're up to $397 currently) ... & although he is much better, he's still not well enough for an anaesthetic, so another weeks antibiotics.  Oh my goodness ... how on earth did this happen I ask myself?! Unfortunately along the journey of caring for him - he has well & truly crept into my heart & I just adore him.  The Mr informed me that several people had been to the farm to look at taking him but they all either wanted a female so they could breed from her ... or the weepy eye put them off.  Our new milkers took him home & he lasted one night before he escaped through a window & back up to the hay barn to his family.  The minute I walk into the spare bedroom he gives a tiny squeak & starts to purr 💙And so - for now - Little One appears to be living here at Threadbear HQ - & what the future holds I am not too sure. I always said introducing another cat would upset the balance but we shall see what unfolds.  And while I am being honest here my friends ... No it is Not all cuteness & playing with toys - it is VeRy stressful & I find I feel anxious alot of the time & get very little achieved with endeavouring to keep everyone (3 cats) happy !! And what's a girl to do when her Mother does this despicable thing ... bringing in a strange-looking creature to the house?  Why take to her bed of course & while she's at it - sleep on one of the Good Cushions that she's usually Not allowed on 😉😖I found some time over the weekend for a couple of creative pursuits ... my friend Sally had given me this gorgeous vintage fine lawn nightie in a toile pattern & asked me to make her some lavender bags from it.  I had enough of it to make a lavender sleep pillow too.  The sewing room smelt heavenly with the lavender fragrance  💜I made up another batch of Laundry Liquid over the weekend. I find a batch usually lasts me about a year ... I used the recipe in Rhonda's book below, which I refer back to all the time.  The vintage decanters have been thrifted over the years & I love filling them with the liquid but I keep a plastic milk bottle under my laundry sink to use daily so I can give it a really good shake first as the liquid can tend to gel.  Thank you so very much for staying to the end dear friends,I am off to fill the wood basket again - a heavy frost here this morning & its taking some work to get the house warmed up.Wishing you all a wonderful rest-of-the-week,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones (all 3 of them !!!)"},
{"title": "Welcome to June 💗", "date": "Saturday, June 3, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers & Welcome to June 💗Officially the first month of Winter here in the Southern hemisphere.May it be a wonderful month for us all ! I bought Mum this \"Welcome Trough\" many years ago from a delightful home-based business just south of me - Tomo Pots.  I bought it home with me when I cleared out her house & yesterday I filled it with water & floated some Camellia flowers in it - just like Mum used to do.I have been looking for a new rug to go in front of my fire for many months now.  The previous one came out of the Farm Owners house & was in tatty condition when I received it several years ago.   All the ones I looked at cost many hundreds of $$ but I was able to find one online that I liked (for only $85) & it arrived on Tuesday.  I absolutely LoVe it & when my eldest son saw it he commented \"it looks like it's a hundred years old\".  How perfect!!!  Even Miss Pip gave it her seal of approval & she almost blended right in with the new rug! As I had two Orders for mothball sachets I made up another batch earlier this week.  These are wonderful to put in your yarn or your woolen clothing & keep the moths away without leaving that nasty lingering camphor smell.  I'll put the recipe at the end of my post today in case you would like to make some yourself.I had a baking day on Monday.  I made fruity cereal slice & a new-to-me banana bread recipe as I had a large bunch of bananas turning black.  This is the new recipe I used.  You can see from the photo above that my eldest son & Alec quickly demolished half of it, still warm from the oven.Dear Alec won Player of the Day for Soccer last Saturday & he was Oh so proud of his Cup & Certificate.My dear friend Sandy gave me some plants she no longer wanted & when I had planted them all I discovered this wooden cat under the layers of newspaper in the bottom of the banana box that the plants came in.I've forgotten to take a \"before photo\" but it was faded & chipped in a couple of places on the paw.  I had the matt black chalk paint out so I gave it a generous coat of paint & it came up beautifully.  Well what else could I write on it ... it IS their house & they very generously allow us to reside here too 😉I used to have a subscription to the Simply Vintage Magazine (4 issues per year) until I could no longer fit them in my bookcase & I cancelled it.  I still enjoy pulling them out to re-read from time to time.  This Issue No 8 is from 2013 & when I spotted this primitive pumpkin in it, I thought perhaps I could use up some of my autumn toned wool fabrics.It was simple & fun to make ... I used 8 different fabrics for the wedges in muted autumn tones.  I stamped a tea-dyed tag & made some \"curls\" from a length of rusty wire.  Just wind the wire around a thick knitting needle & slip off. I had a pair of these silver plated candleholders ($1.50 for the pair) in my stash so I painted one with matt black chalk paint & it was just perfect for the base.  You are supposed to use the pumpkin as a scissor holder but I like mine just fine without scissors poked in the top.  ✂I have been continuing on with my dishcloth knitting - at nights when my eyes are tired. I am using up all my small oddments of cotton yarn & making scrappy ones.  This free pattern is still my preference as I like a small sized dishcloth that I can squeeze out in one hand. Every now & again something happens that tugs right at your heartstrings.  This was the case yesterday when I attended my Grandson Sid's school Grandparents Day.  He very proudly presented me with this below & it bought big tears to my eyes.How fortuitous dear friends, that I just happened to be wearing my pink shirt & black pants that very day!  Please take note of my curly hair, my eye make-up & my slim body (!!!)  I shall be putting this in a frame in a special place. Thank you so very much dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you a wonderful (long) weekend - its King's Birthday Weekend here in New Zealand & the sun is actually out!Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0xHerbal Moth Ball Sachets:  50 grams dried Rosemary, 50 grams dried Mint, 50 grams dried Thyme, 25 grams Ginseng (tea), 200 grams whole Cloves.  Combine mixture & add to muslin bags.  I also add a large handful of dried lavender to mine."},

This makes removing your new piece of fabric from underneath VeRy TricKy!When your helper wakes up again you have sewn your casing, simply thread your elastic through & pop it on your ironing board.  It is amazing how much pleasure that 60 cms of fabric brings & makes me want to actually DO the ironing!! That very same evening we had a Birthday Party to attend as Alec was turning 8!!The far right photo is just Alec pretending he has fallen to the groundThis year (for a change) his parents decided to hold his party at this venue in Hamilton Extreme Edge Rockclimbing Gym & it was the most perfect place for 10 rowdy, energetic boys to run around & use up energy!Even Sid enjoyed it after his initial hesitation.  There are just so many wonderful themed climbing boards for children & they are harnessed in so it is very safe.  If you have more than 8 children they give you a room to hold your party in ... which worked out so well.  We had pizzas followed by Chocolate Mud Birthday Cake ... then back to the climbing.  Some readers may remember back in early March when I won this Anthurium Plant in a Competition.  I loved it & it seemed to really thrive sitting on my table.  However I read online that the flowers are very toxic to cats & as mine are frequently on the table 😕 I thought I should move it & not risk anything.  I didn't think they'd eat the flowers but simply brushing against them could cause a nasty reaction.  This pink stool above was in my woodshed (!!) - an old thrifted find. I sanded the marks on the top, washed it down well & then painted it with two coats of chalk paint \"antique white\".  I kept the wood showing on the legs & gave these a generous coat of wax ... I was delighted with how it turned out & now its well out of any furry friends reach.When I was down packing up Mum's house in early March, my dear friend Claire invited me to her home for a Stitching Evening.  There were 6 of us there - just a nice number.  One of the girls, Joy, had bought along a box full of these vintage fabric packs.  Joy had purchased these from French Pear Vintage & as she had so many we were each able to buy a bundle if we wished.  They are called \"lucky dip bundles\" - you don't know what you are getting but they are antique french fabrics & linens that the lady imports.  The girls issued a challenge that we had \"to do something with our packs of fabrics\".Mine came home with me & when I looked at them all I decided I wanted to make a project using ALL of them in one hit.I laid them out in a pleasing design, changing my mind over a couple of days regarding placement.  I decided to attach them to a piece of pre-washed calico which I cut to shape.  I machine stitched around some to fasten them & also dabbed a fabric glue pen under some.  Then I began to hand stitch across them, changing my direction as I worked my way across the rectangle - some horizontal, some vertical.I drew some of my lines with a Frixion Pen as I am inclined to be wonkyI think it would be fair to say I enjoyed this mindless slow stitching so very much that I found myself driving to pick Sid up from school half an hour earlier so I could sit & stitch some lines in the car while waiting.  I just used a roll of thickish embroidery thread that I had thrifted once-upon-a-time & really liked the effect of this thread.  I had 3 pieces left over from my bundle, 2 green & one white ... so I stitched these to a square of calico that I planned to use as my backing.My original plan had been to make this piece into a table runner but somewhere along the way it became a cushion.  A sort of French Country looking cushion.  I finished putting it together at the weekend & made a large inner for it from an old pillow I had bought home from Mum's.  I like my cushions stuffed nice & tightly.  I am really thrilled with my new cushion & I think I might be rather addicted to this slow stitching as I'd now like to make a table runner.  I wasn't sure about leaving my raw edges but now I really like this effect on my cushion.Thank you all so very much for your visits here today dear friends,It feels like its going to be a cold night here at Threadbear HQ so I am off to fill the wood basket,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Before,  During & After ........................................", "date": "Sunday, May 14, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWelcome to another shiny new month ... May !!Image from \"scraps of us\" blogI have been away down to see my Mum again & returned just in time last week as the road was closed due to another big slip.- Before - Thank you all for your sweet kind comments in my last post about my new seating area with Mum's mohair blanket/new cushions.  I had hardly hit Publish on my post when I walked into the room to discover a certain 4-legged Princess had tossed the cushions on the floor & decided the mohair rug was quite cosy for Her Royal Highness thank you very much!!I usually try not to light our fire until the month of May.  This year however (in late April) I came inside from gardening one afternoon & decided it was jolly well freezing in my house ... so I pulled my pinecones out & lit it promptly.  It never takes the ginger one long to find the heat.  It will burn now until October as our seasons have changed so much & our springs can be very cold & wet.Before I headed down to see Mum I had some birthday gifts to make.  I wanted to make candles for my friend Carolyn & also my sister in law.  The crystal glassware was out of Mum's china cabinet so I thought it would be special to make candles to gift to my sister in law in these.  The fragrances are Orange, cinnamon & clove, & smelt wonderful.In our first Lockdown of 2020 I purchased a punnet of Zinnia Dahlia plants that were not much bigger than my smallest fingernail.  I lovingly nurtured them along until they grew large enough to plant out in my garden.  They grew into the most stunning flowers & each year I remember to collect the heads so I can save the seeds for the following year.  I had pressed some of the flower heads under heavy books so I made up some fancy seed packets to gift to my friend Carolyn, whom I visited on the way down to see Mum.  Prior to my trip away The Mr came home with this wooden mirror he had picked up in his travels for $20.  It had obviously come off a stand as it had brackets on each side.  Before painting I glued on some efex rubber mouldings to try & tizzy it up a bit.As you can see I originally started off painting it my usual Vintage White colour but then changed my mind & decided to try a new-to-me colour ... \"Linen\".  I loved the finished colour but decided the scrolls needed something to make them \"pop\".  After the numerous YouTube videos I watch I thought some white wax might be the answer ... problem was I had No white wax.I decided to make my own version simply by mixing a tablespoon of clear wax with some white chalk paint & stirring well.  It did the trick wonderfully for the small area I wanted it for.  I find if you clear wax the scrolls first, then whatever you apply afterwards will always wipe off easily if you don't like it.  Love, love my new (old) mirror & the colour is a gorgeous mix of brown & grey undertones, just like the raw linen I am stitching on at present.  - During -My brother & sister in law decided to go away for a few days to celebrate her 65th birthday.  I offered to house sit for them & look after their animals as it gave me a chance to visit Mum & also free accomodation now Mum's house has sold.  I had planned to take lots of photos but my time away was just so busy that I barely picked up my phone. Each evening I lit the fire & their elderly (deaf) dog Bella comes in at night & sleeps by it.  I had hoped to stitch but the cat in my lap was originally Mum's cat Bubby & she rather liked my lap.  View from the bottom of the driveway ... & then from the top - out to an oil rig at sea.My brother owns 40 acres & their house sits way up on the top of a hill with amazing views in every direction (but also lots of wind). Longtime readers of my blog will remember the fence my brother built by hand in this post & also in this post - my brother only has one arm after a motorbike accident when he was young. He has now built himself a Hothouse - it had to be built really strong to withstand the winds that they get up on the hill.  It was incredible & filled with a large variety of plants already even though he is just getting it underway.    While I was away my lovely friend Claire invited me to a Pink Ribbon morning tea - this is a fundraiser for Breast Cancer that they hold each May.  We had the most delicious cooked breakfast ... & while at the Venue I took some raffle tickets & managed to win a prize.This lovely wooden bread board & a set of 4 wooden coasters.  - After - Once home again I got Sid to decorate 2 of the coasters - one each for his parents.  He did a lovely job of them & I sprayed each one with 3 coats of clear matt varnish to make them wipeable.  I'll get Alec to decorate the other 2 for his parents.  While Sid was in hospital I took him an Easter colouring competition that I'd cut out of our local newspaper.  He coloured this in & upon his return home I dropped it in to the venue running the competition - a local Real Estate Agency.  Sid was delighted when they rang to say he had won his age group so I was able to take him in to collect his prize - a $50 gift voucher from a local bookstore/toy shop!!  The fragrance is Baked Pear - just divine !I called into Brandy's Botanicals while away as I needed to drop in some dried lavender ... I purchased this beautiful set of fragrant tealite candles & am burning one today in my crystal candle jar.Phew - well done if you've made it all the way to the end!!Thank you so very much dear friends, for visiting here today,I hope the coming week is good & kind to all of you,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Cottontail Esquire & he is designed by Lyn Hosford.For his tailored Jacket I used the wool fabric from a man's blazer that was purchased from the Op Shop quite sometime ago.  I often pick these up when I see them going cheaply as the wool fabric is wonderful to use in projects.His personalised wooden key is purchased from * here *Though the pattern states to dunk his body in a \"dye bath mix\" to stain it, I could not bear to do this ... I much preferred my Gentleman rabbit in pristine condition. Here he is besides Miss Maggie Rabbit which I made way back in 2019!The pattern is from the book Meadow Threads by The Need'l Love CompanyI hauled a comfy lounge chair over closer to my French doors for the winter time.  It gets lovely afternoon sun here & is a nice spot to sit & look outside in the wintery months.  Amongst Mum's treasures I had bought back this soft pink mohair throw & I draped this over the chair.  My friend Jane had gifted me a beautiful Cath Kidston tea-towel last birthday, commemorating our late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.  I decided to make it up into a rectangular cushion for my chair.  Jane had also gifted me the beautiful piece of Sanderson Linen & this became a cushion also.   I thought they looked so pretty on the pink throw & they only took a couple of hours to sew up.  Often I pick up cushion inners when I am thrifting & tuck them away for projects like this.  An inviting spot to sit with a cuppa ... I just need to make sure I actually do this!There is a round occasional table next to my chair & I displayed Mum's glass cake stand on it along with some pretty floral china my friend Sandy had gifted me.  When I do new little vignettes like this, it encourages me to pull everything out & it all gets a good clean & a vaccum & I like to oil/polish my wooden furniture.    A small ribbon-rose embroidered cushion that I gifted to Mum many years ago now 💝I was with Mum when she purchased this sweet little Oak table way back in 2014.  She needed something to display photographs on & this was perfect.  I've always loved the heart shaped legs on it so home it came with me.  Mum's Crown Lynn Swan displayed on the lower shelf. (would you believe dear readers - Mum used the Swan to hold her toilet cleaner & loo brush !!!)This Oak Canteen holds Mum's silver cutlery set.  She had always said she wanted me to have this so I have sat it on top of the Oak table & popped a small display on top.  Looking at the brass tray in this photo - I really must try the tomato-sauce method on this!!!The sweet lace cloth cames from Mum's alsoJust a little corner of my home ... & makes me think of Mum when I look at her treasures around me.  There are still lots more to sort through yet dear friends, but I am trying to deal with a few things each week.  Sid came twice last week & wanted to do \"arts & crafts\".  I save loo roll tubes for him but he also goes through my Recycling bin & pulls out any cardboard boxes etc that he wants.  He happily crafts & builds junk contraptions for hours! He LoVeS cellotape & goes through rather-a-lot !!! 😉I got up early this morning & cleaned out my Fridge.  I then tossed all the left over veggies into a Fridge Drawer stew.  This will hopefully feed us for 3 nights & smells very comforting cooking away in the Crock Pot.  There is a cold Southerly wind blowing here today & Madam Pip has her banana box inside the house with a fresh wool blanket.  Blackie is tucked up in the hallway cupboard sitting on the ironing pile (!!!) 😐.  The Mr informs me we are in for cold temps tonight.I hope you are warm & cosy where-ever you are dear friends,Thank you as always, for your welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship to you All,Love Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Easter Decorating Threadbear Style   .............................", "date": "Sunday, April 16, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersAs I began packing away my Easter decorations this morning I realised I had not yet shared them on here.I really LoVe Easter decorating - I love all the soft pastels & I really enjoy that it can all be bought out in a day & then packed away again in a couple of hours, unlike Christmas decor that seems to take me days & days. I have a vintage Singer Sewing table in the corner of my dining room that I like to decorate for the seasons.  This is my display on here - nothing new this year, just re-using the same decor from previous Easters.   Raggedy Rabbit made * here * Same table - different endThis is the small nest of tables that I decorated * here * . New items are the Girl Statue that I painted * here * & a pink Easter sign gifted from my friend Sally last year. I bought this little shelf in from my Cottage - I have a new piece here ... the china rabbit plate purchased on sale from * here * about a month ago. Raggedy Heirloom Rabbit made by me * here * & knitted rabbit from Mum'sMy mantlepiece is decorated pretty much the same as last Easter with no new items.                                              A small occasional table with some Easter items from last yearThe rabbit trinket box is new - again purchased on sale from * here * but turned out much larger than I imagined - one of the downfalls of online buying I guess.   The moss rabbits are both op-shop finds.A small primitive display on another table - nothing new here ... wool rabbit made * here * ... cross stitch cushion made * here *This wooden egg was a 50 cents op-shop purchase sometime last year. I found it when I unpacked my Easter decor & decided to give it a coat of white chalk paint.  It had some tatty lace glued around the middle which I pulled off first & sanded lightly.  I had purchased the decoupaged wooden rabbit from my friend Joy when I was last down at Mum's.  I found the very same serviette Joy had used in my stash, so I decoupaged the egg with it.  I just love how this turned out & would never have thought to use browns & greys in my Easter decor had I not seen Joy's rabbit.  🤎🖤This one is especially for you dear Willie ...... when Blackie got wind of the idea that I was Easter decorating he decided to bring me my very Own Easter Bunny!!!   He was not at all impressed when I shooed him away with it. I sewed a baby gift over Easter - 2 bibs & a wool blanket rabbit.  My dear friend Sandy is flying to Canada to visit her new grandaughter so I wanted to send a little Kiwiana gift as Sandy's son & my youngest son were very good friends during their schooling years.  I spent a couple of days with Alec this past week.  The first day we went to the Variety Store (Pokemon cards!!), Cafe for morning tea, the Space Centre & then the Movies in the afternoon.  On day 2, I decided we should drive over to Raglan & we had a delicious fresh fish lunch at the Wharf Cafe. After lunch we went to the beach & Alec found a trowel so he dug for crabs.  He found 8 which he played with for awhile before Granny made him put them back in the water & we had an icecream before heading home.  It was a wonderful couple of days but I was rather shattered at the end.  Next week I'll be having Sid as it's school holidays here in New Zealand.Thank you dear friends, as always, for your welcome visits here today,Wishing you a wonderful week ahead - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Sid's Sixth Birthday (!!) 💗", "date": "Saturday, April 8, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersSid's 6th birthday is one we will all remember for a very long time ... & for all the wrong kinds of reasons.After I made the Pokemon Mew toys for Sid & Alec in * this post *, Sid requested a Gengar character to be made.  I managed to finish it just in time to wrap up for his 6th birthday.  These toys are a free download available from * this * amazing site! Sid's birthday gifts were all wrapped up ready & waiting for his party of which he was So excited about!   Unfortunately the very day before his birthday he became most unwell & ended up being admitted to hospital & having to undergo many tests & scans to determine why he had so much pain in his neck & body. The photo above left is poor Sid on his 6th birthday - in alot of pain & not happy at all.  The following day the Dr's decided that the antibiotics they were giving him intravenously were not working & they needed to do surgery to drain the large cyst that was appearing inside his neck.  The photo above right is dear Sid, trying to manage a smile right after a very long surgery.  He was such a trooper - the Dr's said it was a large cyst to drain but they were confident they got it all cleaned & flushed out.The following week passed by in a blur of travelling to the hospital each day to visit Sid, keep him entertained & also try to offer some support to his parents who were having a very difficult time of it all.  I did colouring in with him & read him stories - just whatever it took to pass the hours away & distract him from all the IV lines in him.  Several days after surgery when he was showing some improvement we were allowed to go upstairs to the craft room!  This Granny thought that was just wonderful & Sid created the \"tower\" above right.  Look at all those dollies on the windowsill (left hand pic) - I badly wanted us to dress/decorate one but Sid was not interested. Finally - the day of Sid's Mum's birthday - he was allowed home again.  The day we thought would never come!!!  It was so good to see him happy to be back in his familiar surroundings again. Though I had grand plans for some Easter creations, this was all I managed this year.  The felt bunnies are a free pattern from * here *.  I made the chocolate & banana muffins to use up bananas that were turning brown & added some frosting to them with a small Lindor Egg in the top - these were a big hit  🐰As my Grandsons mainly wanted Pokemon cards this Easter, I packaged up a bag of small treats for them each including the felt bunnies & some other fun bits & bobs.  Does my Bum look big in this ??? I decided to make up a gift basket for my daughter in law's birthday. I knew I had a nice wooden crate in my cottage so I bought it inside & popped some tissue paper in the bottom while I sorted out my gifts to go in it.  No sooner had I gone to do this than a certain ginger furry being decided to try to fit her rather ample proportions in the crate!!!  Finally I removed both cat & ginger hairs & made up my gift basket.I also made Nicole a chocolate cake & decorated it with candles as I remembered Sid had not gotten to blow out any candles for his birthday.  I managed to rescue the last of my pom-pom dahlias to go with the cake.And then this very morning I got to spend some time here with Sid while his parents caught up on some things. The first thing he wanted to do was \"arts & crafts\" so we had a wonderful morning making things at my table .................... until a certain black T-Rex decided to plonk himself down in the middle of all our craft supplies !!Speaking of contrary cats ... I bought out the banana boxes a couple of weeks ago as it's turned chilly here now. I lined each one with an old flannelette sheet.  Blackie wasted no time in curling up in one & then I noticed Madam Pip had joined him, so I dragged out the 2nd box.                                            This was the scenario that followed .........  For two days they both slept in the back box & since then they've both been in the front box together.  I am not even going to try to figure them out !!!! 😐Wishing you all a wonderful Easter break dear friends,  💕Thank you so much for your ever-welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Catching up Post (Part 3) .... Clearing out No 44", "date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThis post is written mainly as a record for myself, my sons & grandsons ... & I acknowledge it may be of no interest to anyone else.  But I wanted to keep a record of clearing out my family home,  as I have a tendency to forget 😉Winter Pansies planted in my old trike just yesterday  🖤I was down at Mum's house for 2 weeks emptying it out & cleaning it ready for settlement on March 10th.  The new Owner was purchasing it as a rental property & I wanted it presented as \"move in ready\".     I first came to live at No 44 when I was aged 1 so I had 61 years of memories tied up in the house & large section.  I expected to feel all sorts of emotions the day I drove away for the final time but I did not feel one iota of sadness whatsoever.  Which surprised me to be honest.   I felt incredible sadness for my Mum who was lying in bed in a Resthome, just 6 doors away from the house she had lived in for the bulk of her 93 years of life.  The morning of settlement I had walked up to visit Mum as I did twice daily, & she had been very frail & incoherant.  So I felt a deep sadness over my Mum but certainly not over leaving the property. My brother had sold quite a bit of Mum's furniture on Facebook Marketplace prior to my arrival so this was my little set-up in Mum's lounge, where I sat for my meals & to do a bit of knitting or reading in the evenings.  A cane chair borrowed from my sister in law & a banana box for a side-table. There was nothing else left in the lounge room but this worked just fine.My brother & I had to be ruthless when it came to Mum's furniture & possessions.  We both have small homes & each have houses full of furniture already.  So many, many loads went to the 2 Charity Shops that Mum liked - SPCA & Hospice.  I kept some things that had sentimental value but even then I was ruthless.  Some things I bought home were simply because I could not bear the thought of them going to an Op-shop.  Like Mums wedding dress for example - like I would ever fit into it in a zillion years !!! But I kept it.I certainly do Not need more sewing supplies but I kept Mum's sewing basket (which she made herself) & needlecase, which my Dad sewed himself when he went into the armed services & they all had to make one.   This mohair bear was made by myself a year after Dad died - the pattern is \"Old Boy\" & that's what Mum used to call Dad.  The Granny bear I made for Mum after she fell in love with the pattern - I did not knit the cabled twinset - this was knitted by Mum in very fine wool.  Before her eyesight deteriorated Mum was an exquisite knitter.I have been working on a few revamps of some things I bought home & you can expect to see more over the coming months as I slowly sort my way through things.  This table above was \"donated to a mate\" by my brother, & I promptly undonated it & hid it in my car.  It was made from an offcut of formica many years ago & used as a bedside table in Mum's spare bedroom.I chalk-painted it with cream & then used a lovely green on the top called \"Pale Sage\".  Just to take the plain-ness off a bit, I added a stencil in the same colour as the legs.  I gave it a light distress & a wax & it is just THE perfect size. This concrete statue had sat in Mum's laundry for many years.  She had a broken neck as you can see above (cracked right through).   She was also a dirty pale lemon in colour.  I filled the cracked neck with some strong adhesive, left it to harden & then chalk painted her in cream.  I love how she has come out & you would never know she'd had a broken neck!The two silver trays above had Australian maps etched into them.  Mum used to feed her neighbors cat whenever she went to Australia & these were bought back as thank-you gifts.  The larger one had rust spots on it which I sanded off.  I cleaned them well & then chalk painted them in cream - I really loved the floral edging on them both. Then I applied a couple of the left-over transfers from Juno's rabbit suitcase in my last post.  I added hangers to the backs & these are now part of my Easter displays.  This cutting board had seen alot of use but I loved the shape of it.  Once again painted in cream & then transfers applied.  I really like how this turned out too.I hope to share some of my Easter decorating in my next post. 🐰🐇Last week I dug an entire tray of worm castings into my raised veggie gardens along with lawn clippings & some compost.  I dug them over well & then planted 6 punnets of winter veggies - silverbeet, spinach, broccoli x 2, cauliflower & baby cabbage. I saw cauli's in my supermarket last week for nearly $10 each !!!While I was outdoors working I picked my gourd harvest.  These are one of my most favourite things to grow as it's always a lucky dip what shapes & colours you get.  I decided to do some autumn decorating on my deck table as I'd given it a good clean out there.I washed my gourds & displayed them in my vintage scales .. I am not usually an orange-&-yellow-fan but I just loved these rich warm colours for autumn.  💛🧡While at the Garden Centre buying my veggie punnets I noticed these celosia plants in autumnal colours so a punnet of those went in my trolley & the Kalanchloe plants were on special so I grabbed one of those too.Love, love my new display .... & not a cat in sight (Yet!!) 😉🐱Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,I am all caught-up now & hope to continue blogging more regularly.Wishing you a wonderful rest of the week - be kind to yourselves & to each other,Sending much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Catching Up Post  (Part 2)   -  a Rabbit Suitcase for Juno & a Pattern Request", "date": "Wednesday, March 22, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersSometime last year my lovely friend Leeanne gifted me 2 of these suitcases covered in cat paper.  She said I might like to \"Julie-afy\" them at some stage.Thinking about my step-grandaughter Juno & her rabbit obsession I decided to re-vamp one into a rabbit suitcase for her.  Her birthday is just after Easter so I thought it could be an Easter/birthday gift combined. Firstly I painted it using my left-over chalk paint in the colour Soft Duck Egg.  I love this particular shade. I embellished it with some rabbit transfers purchased from * here *These are the same range of transfers that I used on Juno's table & chair set way back here & then the chair I did for her new baby sister in * this post *I added some to the inside of the lid also.  Then I sprayed it all in clear laquer to make it wipeable. Originally I had planned to just re-vamp the suitcase for her but then I thought \"why not make a rabbit to go inside ?\"So this little girl came to life using a free Tilda pattern from * here *.  I even dressed her in some vintage Tilda rabbit print fabric from my stash. Then I thought to myself \"all good rabbits need some food\" ... so I made a couple of felt carrots that made The Mr laugh rather too loudly when I showed him 😉 ...  & a bag to carry her carrots in. Just right ! 💙 🥕🥕When I sat my rabbit in her suitcase, she kind of rattled around a bit ... so I thought perhaps she needs a little bed?  I found some sweet rabbit-print flannel fabric in my stash & fashioned her a mattress & a pillow to fit in her suitcase - nice & comfy & squishy, just how good rabbits like it!  🐰🐇I sewed a simple sheet for her & tucked her in all snug 💕Then I thought \"every good rabbit needs a quilt for her bed\"... so I made her a quilt using this gorgeous Peter Rabbit fabric.  I made it reversible so the print is on both sides.  Juno's rabbit looked so cute tucked up in her bed ........ but perhaps a teeny bit lonely ???  She needs a wee friend I thought ........I knew exactly what pattern I would use! I receive an online newsletter from Swoodson Says & she has a free felt rabbit download if you subscribe to her newsletter.  This is only 2.5 cms tall & Soo sweet.Finally I was happy with my suitcase, my rabbit ... & her friend.Then just last week this cute wooden swing tag arrived from * here * - just the perfect finishing touch.  I need to gift this to Juno asap as I cannot stop myself from playing with it & every time I show it to a friend the first thing they say is  Oh I want one too !!I have a pattern request please dear readers ... if anyone has this book could they please contact me at stitchedbyjulie@hotmail.com  I am actually only after the cushion pattern & will happily pay postage & photocopying costs.  Thank you so much & thanks, as always - for stopping by here today.I think I have one more catch-up post & then I am all caught up!!! 😊Wishing you a wonderful rest-of-the-week & sending love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Catching Up Post (Part 1) - Back From Mum's", "date": "Wednesday, March 15, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have returned from packing up my Mum's home for sale, & settlement went through last Friday.  To say it felt like a marathon would Not be exaggerating.  I think I ran on adrenalin the whole time & now that I am home again I have somewhat folded in a heap.  But time to catch up on some blogging as I have lots I have not shared over the past couple of months & I want to visit you all & catch up on your posts. Somewhere along the way, summer disappeared & Autumn crept on the scene ... here in the Waikato we have been having the most stunning autumn days & I just LoVe them.  I subscribe to a free online gardening newsletter & every week they run a competition.  I mostly always enter as the prizes are all garden-related items.  I completely forgot I'd entered one for Valentines Day to win a stunning Anthurium Plant ... often called the Flamingo Flower with its heart shaped leaves. I got such a surprise when my post lady delivered this tall box to my door.  Just delightful 💗 Prior to my trip south I managed to complete a large Order which I hand-delivered to Brandys Botanicals ... 6 embroidered Lavender-&-Linen hearts, 12 bags Cottage Garden Potpourri, Citrus potpourri filled teapots & wire hearts, & 8 Vintage Teacup Birdfeeders.  My car smelt rather lovely on the long drive down. On one of my past trips down I came across the sweetest little tray in a Gift Shop in Stratford.  It was glass with the daintiest rose gold feet & I adored it but I did not adore the price tag of $90.00!!Try as I might I could not justify spending that amount on something just to sit things upon. This vintage brass tray above was $3 in the SPCA Op-shop - I originally thought it was a frame.  I decided to get a piece of glass cut to fit & the Glass framers were able to straighten the wonkiness of it a teeny bit for me which was wonderful.  When I tried to polish it with Brasso nothing happened.  I googled how to clean brass & it said to use Tomato Sauce!  Surely they were dreaming?? But it was worth a try so away I went with my sauce bottle ... believe me dear friends - It Works!! I took the above photo because I thought you would surely Not believe me!  Apparently the acid in the tomatoes reacts with the metal & cleans it.  I am so in love with the dainty brass bows on each end of the trayI was delighted how shiny it came out & hardly any elbow grease required.  I told The Mr if all else failed we can always dip our hot chips in it !!! 😉I have used it to display some vintage crystal on my bedroom chest of drawers - some of these items came from Mum's & I just love this little display so much.  Very pretty & I am now eyeing up other brassware around my house with my tomato sauce bottle in my hand 😉😊these are the items you start with above - a flattened tin, & a paper serviette Early last year I won a draw on Instagram for a chalk-painting class with my friend Joy from The Joy Within.  I had booked in for a class 4 times but had to keep cancelling due to Mum-related issues that kept popping up.  Finally 2 Saturday's ago, I was able to actually attend.  I wanted to make one of Joy's famous squished tins.I painted my tin a pale cream colour & then decoupaged on this delightful Easter Rabbit serviette using mod-podge.  Joy also gets you to decorate a tag to match your tin.  Upon my return home, I styled my tin with some faux Easter eggs ... I scrunched up tissue in the bottom to prop them up a bit more.  Joy encouraged me to try decorating the base that gets cut out of the tin ... I chose a different serviette for this piece.  Each class participant goes in the draw to win a decoupaged heart & my name was drawn out.  I won the beautiful blue heart above right. The \"rules\"  are that you must gift the heart to someone so it was perfect to gift to my dear friend Carolyn who drove an hour to help me clean Mum's house & worked like a Trojan. Oh how I missed these two during the fortnight I was gone.  And Yes here they are asleep on the good quilt & the good cushions - I have made a pathetic attempt to cover the quilt with a cotton sheet but not succeeded especially well 😕Thank you all so very much for your visits here today,I hope to get back to blogging a bit more regularly ... more than once a month hopefully 😊I hope the week is treating you kindly dear friends,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Struggling to Blog  ..................................", "date": "Monday, February 20, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have been away down to my Mum's for quite sometime & upon my return I've been struggling to blog.    I received a phone call from the Resthome to say Mum had deteriorated (again) so I drove immediately down there.  Mum has slightly improved but she will not get properly well again now & is very frail.  I knew I needed to sell the family home this year in order to continue paying for Mum's Care so when the neighbours approached me about their daughter buying it, I didn't hesitate.Thus began the looooong process of sorting & clearing out 60 plus years of stuff.  I have been home a couple of weeks now but will return next week to finish up & stay on for settlement.  Every time I would sit at my computer to write a blog post - the words just wouldn't come - so I would walk away.  Since my return I have not been idle & have found some creative moments in amongst catching up on everything around here.  While at Mum's I took 5 bootloads to the Hospice Op-Shop.  I have a large vehicle so they were certainly NOT small loads.  Even so, I still bought some treasures home with me ... my Dad's old paintbrush was one of them.  It was hanging on the hook in his shed where he always hung it.  I can still see myself, probably aged about 5 or 6 looking up at it & asking him why he hung that one there?  \"Because it's my favourite brush\" he said.   I'm sure I've mentioned before that my Dad was a Painter & Paperhanger for all the years that he was my Father.The \"before\" on the left ... I stripped it using the Oven Cleaner method that I have seen on YouTube.  It took a couple of applications but eventually got rid of the layers of old paint. I had to sand it a little bit & then I just wiped it with furniture oil.  I used a wire brush to clean the bristles out as much as I could.I love vintage tools hanging on the wall so I've hung it in my dining room where I can enjoy looking at it.  Another couple of \"before pics\".  These wall sconces were in my sleepout ... they were Op-shop purchases from awhile ago, & I decided it was high time to do something with them!!I cleaned them both before giving each a couple of coats of chalk paint in the colour Pumice.  I also stripped all the wiring out as both of them no longer worked.I've hung the single one on my dining room wall where it matches some frames I've painted.  I purchased 3 plain candles from The Warehouse & glued lace around the bottoms to \"tizzy them up a bit\". These sit quite sturdily on the sconce bases although I'm not sure I will be lighting them.The double one is hanging in my lounge room.  I also rubbed each one with a tiny bit of silver gilding wax just to bring out the detailing in them.  So happy with my wall sconces 💕If you had told me that I would spend 2 solid days sitting at my work-table making Pokemon toys, I would've told you that you were quite insane!!!  However, that is what I did last week as Cyclone Gabrielle raged around us here.  Fortunately we didn't lose power although the Mr had no power at the farm to milk the cows.  This is a free pattern from this amazing website.  I showed Sid these free patterns last year & he asked for a black Mew Plush.  When I showed Alec he asked for the same.  I'd like to say they were enjoyable to make but they certainly did \"test my sewing skills\".  😉I used plush fur for the bodies & felt for all the eye details.  Some hand embroidery in parts also.  The feet & hands were all needle sculpted.  I think the trickiest part was probably the long curly tail ... wiring & stuffing that very nearly sent me over the edge.  But Mew is famous for his long curly tail so I persevered.  Luckily I had Blackie to talk me through the trickiest bits. My two grandsons were absolutely thrilled with their Pokemon toys & Sid has now requested a Gengar Plush 😐While I was down at Mum's I worried that my veggie garden would dry out but luckily we had plenty of rain.  I am picking courgettes & tomatoes each day & giving lots away.  This is yesterday's pick above.  And the dishcloth knitting continues as I work my way through all my oddments of cotton yarn. I know * this dishcloth pattern * off by heart now so I can sit & knit it without thinking too much.  I find working on these quite therapeutic in the evenings at Mums when it is so quiet.  Well there you go - I actually managed a blog post.And if you stopped by for a visit then Thank You So Much!I hope to get back to regular blogging soon dear friends, & also to visiting you all over at your blogs again too.Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry Ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": " Some Post-Christmas Finishes  ..................................", "date": "Friday, January 13, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersAlthough I had the best of intentions, December seemed to go by so very fast & I did not manage to complete all that I had hoped.        But that's okay - that's what these slow after-Christmas-early-New-Year-days are for. This cloth doll has sat, unclothed, on my Sewing Room floor for two years now - under a pile of fabric & other unfinished items.  It was high time I dressed the poor girl !! She is a Very Old Pattern by Wendy Briggs of Country Friends, who stopped designing several years ago now.  She is called Christmas Angel & I adore her. 💗I had purchased a gorgeous Lynette Anderson fabric a couple of years ago so finally I made her skirt. The wings are from a scrap of Sandcastle fabric that I had just enough of. I had left some greenery out when I packed away my Christmas decor so I made her a twig wreath & then a garland for her hair.  I embellished her with some wooden buttons from Theodora Cleave                      Painted shoes & torn strips for bows.  Once finished I decided she needed a frame to hang in - like the one in the pattern.  I had the perfect size frame with chicken mesh on it but it was too olive-y green in colour so I painted it with my pale duck egg chalk paint. Yes - of course - I had the usual ginger assistant who is currently sporting several smudges of Pale Duck Egg on her ginger fur 😉😐(I have left my Angel out for awhile longer to enjoy, before I pack her away til next Christmas)I wanted to make some new cushion covers for the old cane chairs on my back deck area - this is a nice place to sit out in the afternoons with a cuppa & the old chairs are very comfy.  I removed the old covers & found the inners to be still in very good condition.  I wanted something Vintagey looking so I hunted in my stash & found an old table cloth with big blowsy roses on it - just perfect 🌹I sewed an envelope closure for the back & tied it together with a big red bow, also found in my ribbon stash.  The cushions are wonderful to sit against - especially now the sun has decided to grace us with its presence at long last.  On my last trip to Mums I took some stitchery work to do but completely forgot to include my embroidery threads.  Luckily I had tossed quite alot of fabric scraps into my bag so I was able to sit in the evenings & make yo yo flowers ... simply cutting a circle of fabric & drawing it up.  I find this quite therapeutic.  On my return home I decided I needed to actually do something with all these yo yo's!!  I'd purchased a polystyrene cone from the $2 shop prior to Christmas - I painted it Pale duck egg.  Also the red candleholders were a 50 cent bargain from one of my Op Shop trips. I painted one of these too as I wanted to tone down the brightness of the red.I simply glued all my yo yo's over the cone, slightly overlapping the edges - you will notice the lower ones are a medium size & the top section I have made a bit smaller in size.  No two fabrics are the same & they are all made using Tilda & Liberty scraps.  I hadn't intended to have a red & blue theme but this is how it has turned out.  I glued the cone to my candlestick base & then tied a snowflake charm to this, & tied a bell & heart to the top.  I love this & would rather like to make more in other colour-ways.  💙💗I thought you might enjoy this little Cat Collage I put together & hopefully it will make you smile .... if I don't smile at these two's antics then dear friends, they will surely drive me bonkers!! 😊My 3 pots of  Rhodohypoxis were late to flower this year due to our wet spring so they were still looking pretty after Christmas. I found a certain Furry Ginger Fairy curled up asleep in the middle pot just last week.A glance out the window shortly after & this is what I spy .........Fat Blackie must've wandered by & thought Oh what a nice comfy spot that looks ........... I ran & grabbed my camera ...........  she is trying really hard to look innocent but is not fooling me !!!Shortly after ......... just like a couple of nesting hens.  I wonder if I look underneath, if there'll be any eggs laid there ??!! 😉😐Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the naughty furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": " HaPPy NeW YeaR  !!!  💗  ............... & The Tale Of The Little Red Car  🚩", "date": "Tuesday, January 3, 2023", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWelcome to another bright shiny New Year  💗Lets hope 2023 is a happy & healthy one for All of Us.I saw this verse on Instagram & thought how VeRy true & how it certainly does sum things up!  Sometimes the Awful bits go on a bit longer than the Amazing bits but I don't think any of us get to miss those bits out.  Personally I rather like the Ordinary & Mundane bits - the routine parts of life suit me just fine. We had a lovely Christmas with Mum in her room at the Resthome. My eldest son joined me, along with my Brother & his wife.  We were amazed the staff had gone to the effort of setting a proper Christmas table for us in Mum's room - just wonderful.  Mum is looking very frail & hardly ate anything but did enjoy the company. My eldest son's wife Sarah arrived late Christmas Day from visiting her family further down the Island.  Sarah & Alec were able to visit with Mum on Boxing Day & Alec read Mum a story. I took home an old Orange pot on my previous visit to Mum's.  Though I forgot to take a \"before pic\" I painted it black & then stenciled a Bee onto the side of it.  My sister in law just LoVes black & white pots on her deck area, so I planted a lovely white Impatien into it before gifting it to her.  She was delighted.  🖤A couple of months back I purchased this wooden blue car from the St Johns Op-shop for $1.50.  When I went up to pay for it the lady said to me \"Oh I guess you're buying this for your grandson\".    No I was not .. it was for Me!    I had a plan for this little blue car. You can faintly see in the right hand pic, I've traced a black square in the back panel - I got my son Kayne to cut this square out for me as I wanted to make another \"window\".  I painted the entire car with red chalk paint in the colour Raspberry Beret.  I had not used this colour before but it was the perfect Christmas Red that I was after.  Then I applied some Iron Orchid design transfers that I'd had for a couple of years.  I wanted to make it look Christmassy. 🎄I poked some greenery & berries in the rear window & then a small size bottlebrush tree in the \"new window\" in the back.  Originally I painted the wheels black but didn't like them so I painted over them in red.  Having worked in a Gift Shop for almost 20 years, I do have a tendency to turn every thing into a display.    I could not help myself with the little red car.  I found some miniature rusty tools & then decided to make a sign . . . .I glued a piece of dowel into an old wooden cotton reel & painted it red, then glued on a wooden disk which I'd painted black ... a couple of cut-up transfers added & then I could write on my sign with chalk.This little red car prompted an entire new Christmas display.  I used the table that I revamped in * this post * & then added vintage books, bottle brush trees, greenery & berries.  The beautiful Christmas book was a gift from my dear friend Sandy & blended perfectly on my table. The tiny red car had lights that came on after I added batteriesEverything was already in my stash apart from the small red car with a tree on top, which I purchased from my local Variety Store. A strand of Christmas lights & it looked just like a winter village/ Christmas tree farm.You see, once upon a time there was a girl named Julie 😉 who drove a little red car for many, many years.   And many a December she actually drove Home with a real Christmas tree sticking out the rear window!! (& two sons in the back!!)    Even after she met The Mr & he eventually purchased an artificial Christmas tree - she still drove that little red car for many years to come. 😊After fluffing for ages I was finally happy with my Christmas Coffee Table display.  I dragged out my op-shopped silver trays (polished them) & filled with freshly made citrus potpourri.During the year I collected old amber coloured glassware whenever I saw it in the Op-shops, & I made some of these up into soy candles & displayed on another vintage tray.  I have yet to burn these - I like to let my candles harden for at least a month as they burn much better.And YES dear friends ... I had the usual scenario  ... hadn't left enough space for a certain 4-legged fairy to plonk herself down on the table !!! How Dare I Indeed ???This is Her Not Impressed Christmas Face !!!                                              Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Re-Purposed/Thrifted Kind of Christmas .....................................", "date": "Thursday, December 22, 2022", "text": "💗  Greetings lovely friends & readers   🎄 On my last trip down to Mum's when I bought home the Chest of Drawers ... I also bought some other oddments that no doubt would have ended up in the bin.  I decided to use a few of them for some Christmas decorating projects. I bought Mums last 2 houseplants home with me & the silver tray (above left) was sitting under one of the plants.  It was \"toss-able\" as The Mr would say.  I sanded the rusty parts lightly & then gave it 2 coats of chalk paint in the colour Pumice.  I mod-podged on a scrap of music paper, stamped the word JOY & then fashioned a wreath from a branch off a Christmas tree.  My friend Gail gave me the tree branch as the Op Shop were going to bin it.  I added some berries & a ribbon & lightly sanded the tray edges ... I really LoVe how this turned out 💗I've hung it on the wall above a small display using one of the Op-shopped plates from this post * Here *.  And YeS I really did make Santa hats for my miniature teddies !!!! 😉 (Click to enlarge for a closer view)Mum had a large stack of books in the spare room wardrobe - these had belonged to my Dad & he has now been gone for 22 years so I decided it was high time they got donated!!  I bought 6 home with me - glued 3 together, painted with Forest Green chalk paint & then glued on a small decal that I've had FOR ever.I painted over the entire thing again,  then tied it up with a scrap of ribbon, tucked in some greenery & berries & added a wee tag to the bow.  A book bundle for the princely sum of $0 !!I forgot to take a \"before pic\" but this tatty tray was in Mums wardrobe too.  I painted it with Linen chalk paint, then decided this was entirely the wrong colour for the transfer I wanted to apply.  So I painted it with black & then added red to the edges, lightly sanding for a more vintage look. I've had this transfer for 2 Christmas's now  ...  I first used it on the mirror in * this post * & absolutely love it.  It is no longer in stock so I wanted to use it for something special. I applied some of it to the frame & am so pleased with how it looks.(The transfer is by Iron Orchid designs)This rusty saw was $5 at the SPCA Op-shop in Mum's town. I painted it black, oiled the handle & then added another section of the transfer to it.  This old aluminum cooking pot was in Mum's shed.  I painted it with chalk paint - Country Clay - & then added yet more of the transfer to it.  It is just perfect to sit my wee artificial tree in with a block of wood inside to prop it up a bit higher.  🎄My entire thrifted/upcycled/repurposed display arranged together on an old trunk.  The only purchased item was the Woodland Scene Teatowel which I have used as a table runner.  I had really wanted a Reindeer to complete the scene but at $90 + in the stores it was way out of my budget.  Then I remembered this leather one I had gifted to The Mr many years ago. I found it in his shed, the leather had gone mildewy but I was able to clean it & give it a good oil.  This will be staying inside once Christmas is all packed away.  I encourage you dear friends ... to think outside the square.  You do not have to spend big money on Christmas decorating.  I have a couple more items that I would love to share but I feel this post is waayyy long enough so I will share those after Christmas. I am a creature of habit - I bake the same items each year,  those that I know & are simple.  Mars Bar Slice, Chocolate Fudge Cake & Gingernut bites.  These have been all packaged up & gifted to local friends, whom I share baking with.  The black/white striped boxes were again in Mum's wardrobe so I tizzied them up with paper doilies & a tag to present the baking in. I keep my eye out in Op Shops for little Christmas tins also - these are often 50 cents each & perfect for presenting baking in. This is my last post before I head to Mum's tomorrow dear friends,I am hoping to be back next week with a final post before the New Year.I would like to wish you All a most wonderful, safe & happy festive season & to thank you all with all my heart for your visits to my little corner of cyberspace & the lovely comments you take the time to leave me ... it truly warms my heart more than you will ever know.Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Christmas Prep  ........................................", "date": "Wednesday, December 14, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers          Well the 1st December came & went in the blink of an eye.  I got my Grandson's advent calendars filled for another year & delivered to them in time.   It is getting trickier as they get older, to find things small enough to fit in those tiny stockings. I have had to be a bit inventive & found I could tie the larger size packages to the peg with some string &                                                                then clip the stocking over the top.   I keep a written sheet for myself, so I know each day what they will be opening.  It would seem - from checking in with his parents - that Alec has done a bit of a re-shuffle with some of his 😉A couple of weeks ago, Spotlight had huge reductions on all their Hessian so I treated myself to another length for my decking table.  Every time I walk outside that $6 length of fabric just brings me so much pleasure.  I tizzied up the table a bit for Christmas & the red petunias just set everything off nicely.  💗While I was placing my online Order I thought I would re-cover my outdoor cushions as well - they were looking quite a bit \"worse for wear\".   I decided to purchase the doiley print this time round & had great difficulty getting to actually Sew it  ... due to a certain Ginger Miss who thought it made a lovely soft sleeping spot when I was down on the floor cutting it all out !!Finally I got them both done & am so pleased with the end result.  Yes of Course she had to test it out for comfort &                                              snugability !! Look at her there with her ample proportions lovely furry tummy!!I received another order for my potpourri from Brandy's Botanicals - it seems to be very popular this Christmas.  I have been experimenting with drying some Calendula flowers in my Dehydrator - they don't take long so you have to keep an eye on them or they shrivel too much.  They add such a nice pop of colour to my citrus potpourri.I've been re-doing my coffee table display for Christmas & filled a lovely silver plated dish with some of my fresh potpourri.  I will show my festive coffee table in my next post. Our craft group had our end of year Outing.  We went to Cambridge to view the Christmas display in the town hall which was wonderful.  I wanted to gift the ladies a little treat each - last year I did the Soaps wrapped in Dishcloths.   I had some peat pots that I'd recently painted roughly with white chalk paint so I stood at my kitchen bench & decoupaged paper serviettes onto them using mod-podge.  It was a fun, simple craft & looked effective.I had planned to fill the pots with baked treats but simply ran out of time & energy.  The Warehouse had large boxes of Ferrero Rocher choccies on sale so I purchased one to fill my pots, then wrapped them in cellophane with a Christmassy tag.  The ladies were delighted.  Let me tell you dear friends .... quite a few of those choccy treats landed in my mouth while I was putting these together !!!! 😏  I've no idea how !!!Sid has 3 new family members of the 2-legged variety.  My son Kayne has built this wonderful hen-house & they have 3 baby hens.  Sid has named his one (pictured above) Frankfurter (!!!), Sid's Mum has named hers Gertrude, & my son has named his Wingy 😉 .. I shall try not to fill my future posts with too many chicken photos.  I had started my Christmas preparations early this year (mid November) but it still feels like it's going to be a mad rush to the end.  We are having our family Christmas this weekend as I will be travelling down to spend Christmas Day with Mum at the Resthome.  I will be back before then with another post.  I hope the lead-up is going okay for you all.  Remember to pause, to breathe & to try & enjoy the festivities.  (Yes - hark at me talking 😏)Thank you, as always, for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "My Childhood Chest of Drawers", "date": "Saturday, December 3, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersOn my last trip to Mum's, when I told my brother I would be taking home the old chest of drawers out in Mum's shed, he said some words I can't actually print on here 😉 ... but their interpretation went something like \"was I barking mad?!\"  No I was not !It took some effort on my part to load them into my vehicle as they are native timber & not exactly light ... but I was determined.This chest of drawers was used by my brother & I for the first 5 years of our life as we shared a bedroom together.  Eventually we got our own bedrooms & I think he used this for awhile longer before it got moved out to Dad's shed & became home to all his painting & wallpapering gear.  You see my Dad was a painter & paperhanger.  When I got the drawers home & loaded onto my deck I realised they were probably in much worse state than I had envisioned.  But that's okay - I still had a \"plan\". 😉😶 The drawers & the sides of the unit were full of borer holes.  I sanded & stripped the wood - it took me a week but that wasn't continually working on it - that was walking away from it quite often !!I treated it by spraying with kerosene to kill any live borer lavae.  Then I set about filling all those borer holes with wood putty.  Believe me friends, there were about a gazillion of them !!Lastly I oiled the wood using a woodstain that I already had on hand.  It has actually turned out darker than I wanted but I am fairly sure where I have placed it - on my covered deck area - it will soon lighten a bit & fade.  The stain looks patchy here but it is not this bad in real life.  I also replaced the 5 handles with new ones as they were broken.  I wanted a simple handle - nothing too fancy.  My \"plan\" for this chest of drawers & my \"vision\" was to use it to house all my garden supplies.  These were previously sitting on our old dog kennel & often looked messy/unsightly when you walked up our deck steps.Everything fitted in perfectly & I also ran an old candle along the base of the drawers as the wax helps them to glide open & closed easily.  I was really pleased with how it turned out but felt it needed \"something more\" ..............I ended up purchasing this botanical transfer from * this * gorgeous shop & I think it just finished it all off nicely.  I am really pleased with how these drawers turned out & the fact that they are so useful is a double blessing.  Safely under cover on my deck area & out of any weather.Attractive as well as useful at the same time 💚I also washed all my china plates & replaced a couple that had big chips/cracks in them using the plates I op-shopped in * this post * for $2 each. A \"Beautical Sunray Pink Petunia\" in my wrought iron chair planter - a gift from my friend Julie 💗Lastly dear friends - I absolutely LoVe this photo above - look at the body language on Sid!

{"title": "Chasing My Tail   .........................................", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers,Sometimes I watch Miss Pippi chasing her tail ... round & round she goes madly ... never actually catching it or achieving anything - well that is rather how this entire year has felt. Round & round I go - achieving very little at times.  And yet another month goes by since I last blogged.   I have been away down to Mum's again but prior to that, & just as I was recovering from my surgery, I caught Covid.  I know everyone has a different experience of Covid but I have to say - it absolutely flattened me.  I always had grand visions of being able to craft the recovery time away but friends, I could barely lift my head off the pillow - it just immobilised me & a month later, I am still trying to get some energy back. (I should probably add in here that I certainly did Not travel to Mums until I was well over my Covid)(The stunning Mount Taranaki was peaked in white in the background)I delivered a large citrus potpourri order (10 bags & 10 boxes) out to the lovely Deb at Brandy's Botanicals while I was down at Mums.  And she has just yesterday messaged me for another order please.  So my dehydrator is busy drying another load of oranges off my tree.It was the Centuria Garden Festival time while I was down at Mums.  I usually miss this yearly event but this year I was hoping to get to see a couple of the gardens.  In the end I managed to visit 3 but the one I was most excited about was Jenny Oakley's Garden out at Manaia. Mum & I first visited Jenny's garden together, probably about 10 years ago now.  I well remember her stunning hanging baskets & they were just as magnificent this time round.                                           Here they are hanging in this beautiful old Native tree.  Even Jenny's window boxes took my breath away.Such a riot of glorious colour everywhere 💗I loved how she had planted out these Moa's & Pink flamingo's that her husband had fashioned for her.  The Moa's are filled with Mondo grasses in green, & black for the baby.  The pink flamingo is planted with pink impatiens that will be stunning when they grow.  Such imagination 💕As luck would have it (& good timing on my part), Jenny was giving a hanging basket demonstration & talk at 11am on the morning I visited.  She gives a couple of these throughout the festival.  As well as being just a genuinely nice person, Jenny was So happy to share her knowledge.  I honestly learnt so much & so many little tips & tricks.  I shall be giving this a go sometime over the summer months.  The day after my return was the big Fireworks Spectacular at our local Speedway which we can see clearly from our outside deck area.  So my Grandsons & their families came for a Pizza dinner & then around 8.45 we sat out on the deck & watched the display.  The little ones loved it & it was all over by just after 9 pm.  I have to say I don't especially enjoy fireworks, mainly because of the trauma they create for our animal friends.  Thankfully I had gotten my two furry ones inside early enough as in past years Miss Pip has gone missing for days at a time, so traumatised is she by the noise.   En-route to Mum's I usually break for a coffee at the lovely Cafe Lure in Inglewood that I wrote about * here *.  I like to browse their craft section & purchased this catnip mouse for Madam Pip (Yes in floral colours, reminded me of Liberty fabric).  As soon as I gave it to her she just devoured it ... she can obviously smell the catnip inside.  Two weeks later & she is still obsessed with it.After my surgery my dear friend Sandy loaned me a wonderful selection of books to read, so I decided to make her a bookmark as a little Thank You.  I used one of my lovely friend Jennifer of Elefantz designs bookmark patterns - go * here * for the free downloads.   I made Sandy's in Tilda fabrics in two of her favourite colours. 💙 Lastly dear friends, my step-grandaughter Juno has become a \"big sister\" as they welcomed little Sadie Joy into the world a couple of weeks ago.  I just adore this photo above - they are all doing well & we look forward to meeting Sadie very soon.  Thank you as always, for your welcome visits here today,I am off batten down the hatches as we are experiencing dreadful stormy weather here this week,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Catch-Up Post  (Part 2)  ..........  (A Waffle-y Post)", "date": "Saturday, October 22, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersAfter hitting Publish on my last post, I was unable to get it to actually Publish.   I did not know how to resolve this as contacting Blogger seems to be a mission impossible, but finally I found a Community Help Forum & a lovely Polish man named Arek very kindly assisted me.  I was So immensely grateful as I had been wondering if I may have to give up blogging if I couldn't reach you all with my posts.  It made me realise how much I would miss this chatty, friendly place called blogland.  Anyway - all that just to say ... I am very happy to be back here again 😊 This is a bit of a waffle-y post filled with all sorts of things I wanted to share here.During our first Lockdown in 2020, my friend Gail dug out an entire garden of Clivias down one side of her house.  Unable to visit the Dump she filled 2 black rubbish bags & The Mr picked them up from her gateway to dispose of in the farm burning hole. When I saw them on the back of his Ute I grabbed them as I thought I might have somewhere to plant them.  The greenery was all cut off & it was mainly just the root system left.  We have a large area of native trees between our house section & our rented depot yard - nothing much grows here as the tree roots have sucked all the goodness out of the soil underneath.I carefully planted all the clivia's root systems & slowly they grew - I was delighted this spring that most of them are putting on such a lovely show of colour.  When I saw One Clivia Plant in my local Garden Centre for $25 I realised what a treasure trove I had planted here.  Some of you may remember this table & chairs that I revamped for Juno late last year in * this post *.  On my last trip to Mums I saw the little chair (below) in the local Hospice Shop for $6.  I walked back to my car without buying it .... but then I sat & had a think & I remembered that Juno is going to be a big sister any day now.  I thought an extra chair might be handy once Juno's new little sister can use the table too ... so I went back & paid my $6.  I gave it 3 coats of chalk paint in the colour Rosie.  It was actually a horrid thing to paint - I am not sure why but I didn't enjoy it & it took 3 coats to get a decent coverage.I still had some of the rabbit themed transfers left over so I was able to keep the same look going.  Juno is rabbit-obsessed so I am sure she will love this pink chair & will no doubt be the bossy older sister who gets to decide who-sits-where !!I gave the chair 4 new rubber feet that I already had on hand - as well as 2 coats of matt finish spray varnish.  I find this makes the furniture wipeable which is handy when it gets used by children. I saw these wooden slabs last month when I visited the Daffodil farm & purchased 4 (they were $5 each).  I had always wanted to make some stepping stones from our driveway to the corner of the deck which is where I take a short-cut every time I go to check the mail box.  The Mr made me stain them well with several coats of Oil before I set them in the ground because he is annoying, fussy thorough like that. I love how they turned out & now I can even pop across in my slippers 😉I have had to make an elevation in the \"hospital corner\" of my lounge, where I grow all my cuttings & seedlings.  I needed somewhere to put some seedling trays so this old wooden pew made the perfect second storey addition.Sometimes my \"hospital corner\" even gets the odd visitor  ............This dinosaur is one of Sid's most favourite toys, however it looked nothing like this when his little dog Darcy had finished with it.  She had bitten the back seam right open & much of the stuffing was missing as well as several holes in the arms & legs.  I was able to sit & stitch it all up & fill it with some new stuffing - Sid was delighted.To thank me he drew me this card ... it says \"from Sid to Granny\" but his G is back to front.  He also made the iceblock-stick/string toy for Pippi to play with 😉  These are the things I will treasure always.  Alec has just returned from a 10 day holiday to Tasmania, Australia.  He flew with his Mum & stayed at his Aunt's rural property - off grid, way out in the Tasmanian wilderness - no power or running water!  He enjoyed every moment of it.  I love this photo above, he reminds me so much of his Dad in this photo. Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,(Hopefully I can get this post to actually Publish!)With much love & friendship to you all, 💗Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Catch-Up Post  (part 1)", "date": "Saturday, October 15, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersSome days/weeks it feels like I achieve very little but once I look back through my photos, I see this is not always the case.The last of the Freesias picked before the thunderstorm came I have been in hospital for some surgery & I came home with a long list of things I was not allowed to do .... fortunately crafting was Not one of them.My neighbor gifted me this set of vintage scales back in January for pet feeding duties.  She no longer wanted them but they were always missing their tray.  I kept an eye out on my Op-Shop travels & found this expandable cake tin for just 50 cents in the bargain bin.I painted it with 2 coats of matt black paint & then 2 coats of clear acrylic spray varnish.It could do to be a little larger but in the meantime it does the job wonderfully & I'm thrilled with my 50c purchase.My youngest son cut me out these house shapes from a piece of custom-wood that I had lying around.  This design is from an old pattern identical to this one * Here *.   Yes I had \"assistance\" from Blackie with this project 😉 - he very kindly helped me select which buttons to use. I spray painted 5 of the tags with some matt black & then added Christmas fabrics to the roof.  I glued on some wooden buttons from Theodora Cleave that I already had in my stash.  The tags can be written on with chalk, then rubbed off & re-used.  These were such a fun project. 🎄These are photographed beside my adorable new tin sign from my dear friends Jane & SallyOne of my favorite things to do is watch YouTube videos - I find them very inspiring.  At present it seems everyone else is decorating for autumn & there are pumpkins Everywhere!  I found this simple free pattern on the internet & decided to try knitting some myself - I just love how these turned out & am now knitting some in paler colours.  Though I don't consider myself a very good knitter, these were simple & fun to create.I had a packet of wooden coathangers in my stash like these ones * here *.  I had painted two of them ages ago but never done anything with them.  I wanted to make gifts for two friends so I decoupaged them with a gorgeous Rice Paper & then stitched my friends initials onto some linen offcuts.  These initials are a pattern from Jenny of elefantz designs - I stitched them using Cottage Garden thread Pink Lavender & tied them onto the hooks. Just before gifting I'll add a generous drop of lavender oil to them. 💜Last year I purchased two Tilda Mystery Boxes from Craft with Fee.  I have been slowly finishing off all the projects in them & this needlecase was the last one.  Everything is included in the kitset - you just have to sit & make it all up, which is lovely & relaxing.  This particular Tilda fabric was one of my favourites from an older range.  Just prior to my hospital admission it was my eldest sons birthday.  Nobody could visit as they all had colds & I could not afford to catch anything, so there was no celebration.  As soon as I was home & able to, I baked him his favourites - Lasagne, & a Raspberry & White Chocolate Shortcake presented with a bowl of whipped cream! He was delighted.(Just some of the woolly mammoths that I managed to get a pic of)I have had Sid a couple of days last week as its school holidays here in New Zealand.  We went along to our local Library as their school holiday programme was Dinosaur Themed.  We made woolly mammoths.  Now let me tell you dear friends ... this was by far the most exciting thing that I've done for ages!! Which probably tells you something about my life of late.  (in fact I am pretty sure I enjoyed it way more than Sid did - I am writing this small as if I am whispering to you)Thank you so very much for your visits here today dear friends,I shall be back in a few days with Part 2 as I have lots to catch up on here,Wishing you a wonderful weekend, be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Snippet Roll ......  🖤  \" Things I Love \"", "date": "Thursday, September 22, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersA fresh new length of oilcloth arrived to start the week off - ordered online from * Here *.  I also picked the first vase of freesia's from my garden - I just adore their fragrance 💛When I placed the Oilcloth on my dining table I just loved it ... I asked The Mr what he thought of it & his reply was \"it just looks like something you dragged out of Grandma's attic\".Little does he realise that to me ...... this is The Perfect compliment!It was my dear friend Shirley who first introduced me to \" Snippet Rolls \" - I had never heard of them before.  Then I saw them on the lovely Michelle's blog & drooled all over my computer screen when I saw her exquisite work.  I emailed & asked Michelle about them & she very kindly shared some tips to get me started.  Out of the blue a package arrived from her filled with some bits & bobs from her own collection - how special & wonderful. Though I had very little idea of what I was doing, I cut a metre length of linen & began embellishing.  I decided my Roll would be themed on \"Things I Love\"  💗It must be well over a year ago that I first started this - I got as far as Friends & Family ... then kind of ran out of puff with it, tossed it all in a basket & shoved it under the spare bed. There were two things that happened to re-inspire me, & help me to complete it.The first thing was (in July) when my friend Sally gifted me this beautiful book above for my birthday.  I drooled over the pages, took it to Mums with me & read it from cover to cover. Upon my return home I pulled the Snippet Roll basket out again. I decided I needed to set up a special table to work on, & not have to clear everything away all the time which was hindering my progress.  I dragged in the drop leaf table that I revamped in * this post * along with a sturdy chair & set up a small corner of my lounge where I had good lighting & it didn't matter if I made a mess (which I did!!) 😉This was a great decision & this mess table stayed like this until I finished my Snippet roll.And Yes ... in case you were wondering ... I had the usual \"help & assistance of the furry variety\" 😐A couple of weeks ago, I put the final stitch in my Snippet Roll ... would you like to see inside it?? I started the first section with \"Friends & Family\" ... you can just see the word family embroidered in pale blue, where the arrow is pointing (bottom right)My next section in Things I Love was crafting & creativity.  I've forgotten to move my charms to the side before taking a pic, but the heart reads \"Love to Sew\"  💕You can click on the photos to enlarge them if you wishThe next section was my Garden ... once again I've forgotten to arrange the charms nicely.  These are off a broken pair of earings that I had years ago ... a tiny trowel & fork. The next section is Home.  I really love my Home & being at Home - it is one of the places I feel safest.  I could hardly do Home without adding Cats now could I??  Remember these are all the things I love.I happened to find a wooden black cat button in my stash & on further investigation, a pottery ginger cat button.  Miss Pippi is Not impressed with this - she feels she should be Fine Bone China & not just old pottery !!!My final section was Christmas.  I was going to do Tilda but I think that might take an entire Snippet Roll all on its own.  So I found some lovely Christmas buttons from Theodora Cleave - remember when I won the giveaway in * this post *. I ended it with a piece of treasured Liberty Christmas fabric.  It's all looking like it needs a good iron in my pics, but that is just from rolling it up tightly.  I backed the entire piece using this lovely cotton print that I had in my stash - I wanted something subtle & pretty.  I hand stitched this on ... like Michelle does in her work, I didn't want any raw edges that might fray.And how did I display my Snippet Roll ?  I just unwound a section of it & sat it on my mantle piece so I can look at it & enjoy it as I walk past.  This gorgeous tag was included in Michelle's parcel & I have this leaning against the wound-up bobbin.I'm really pleased with my Snippet Roll & would love to make another one sometime. I should add here that apart from Michelle's gifted trims, I just used items entirely from my stash & purchased nothing.  I should also add that my embroidery & applique skills are entirely self taught & probably Not that wonderful to be honest 😉As I type this rain is setting in again ... the furry two are on my sweatshirt, on my bed, curled up together. I can hear Blackie snoring rather loudly. Thank you dear friends, for staying with me through this marathon post,I hope the week is treating you well - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry two x0x0x"},
{"title": "Hydrangea Love  💙💙", "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersMy friend Gail gifted me this beautiful Hydrangea transfer for my birthday in June ... I absolutely LoVed it & wanted to use it on something special.   I especially love Hydrangeas & just adored the pastel colours in this.                     Seeing the black decorated lampshade on the packet gave me an idea . . . . . .I have this large plain table lamp in a corner of my Lounge.  The Lady that owns the Farm gifted it to me many years ago & I use it as I really love lamplight, but always wanted to give it a bit of a lift or an injection of colour. I carefully dismantled the lamp & then painted the base with 2 coats of chalk paint in the colour Old Linen. I dried it by the fire ... Miss Pippi takes her \"watching-paint-dry duties\" very seriously but after all - a girl does get tired !! 😉I also painted the lamp shade in chalk paint \"Antique White\" as it was showing some age spots & discoloration - it came up great!  Next it was time to affix the transfers to the shade. This was tricky (to put it mildly) as I had to pack thick bath towels inside the frame of the shade, to stop it cracking while I applied the transfers. I carefully worked my way around managing to cover nearly all the circumference of the shade. I was really happy with how the lamp turned out & found some old faded hydrangea heads that I spray painted with some colours I had on hand - just a quick whiff across the flower head to bring them to life.The frame had a price sticker on it from when I thrifted it ... $8.00I still had some transfers left over so I found this oval frame in my sleep-out.  It was actually pressed flowers inside glass - very old & faded so I decided to just paint right over the glass as it was secure inside the frame.  Once again - two coats of Old Linen chalk paint & a light sanding/distressing of the frame.While I was working out the placement for my hydrangeas I felt I needed some wording in the background.  Like my fabric scraps, I keep every single offcut of my transfers & I was able to find some vintage French wording in my offcuts envelope.  I love how this turned out 💙I hung it over the Gothic Mirror that I have in my lounge & just love my new Hydrangea corner so much. 💙Incidentally the cabinet that I dragged in had a brightly coloured transfer on the door which looked so gaudy.  I was able to wet this & scrape it off, & then give it a quick coat of the same chalk paint (Old Linen).  I love it much more with the door left blank.A string of fairy lights & it all looks complete. 💙 Each evening when I turn the lamp on it just makes me feel so happy with my little refreshed corner.After a couple of really nice spring days it has turned wet & icy cold here today - typical Waikato Spring weather.  I baked this morning ... a Weetbix Slice for The Mr, & a Raspberry & White Chocolate Shortcake as I have eldest son & family coming tomorrow.  I have some freshly dehydrated orange slices by the fire as I have more potpourri orders to fill.A certain ginger Miss has curled up on my sewing chair dreaming happily with her little tongue poking out. Yesterday * this special book * arrived in the post ... a treat (to me from me) using the last of my birthday money.  I have many jobs awaiting but for now I am going to sit down with a cuppa & maybe probably a slice of that Raspberry Shortcake & drool my way through my new book.  Wishing you a wonderful weekend dearest friends.Thank you as always for your welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Painting, Planting & The Daffodil Farm", "date": "Thursday, September 1, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWelcome to the first day of  Spring - my absolute favorite Season 💗 We have had a week of blue skies, sunshine & chilly-but-glorious days where you can just about see the garden waking up from it's winter sleep.Down the end of my lounge by the French Doors, I have what I call My Hospital Corner.  It's where I put plants that need reviving or some extra care. It's warm, filtered light with no draughts & plants seem to really come back to life here.  I often wish I could just lie down there awhile & rejuvenate myself !! It's also where I start my cuttings off & so I decided it was time to pot up some of the plants that I had grown from cuttings over winter.A rustle around under my house & I came across some old pots that had been tossed under there.  I painted them with left over chalk paint & applied oddments of transfers to cheery them up a bit. After I've applied the transfers I like to spray them with two coats of clear matt varnish just to seal & protect them & I find this works really well & also makes them scrubable if need be.This plant was grown from a leaf off my friend Joyce's plantI forgot to take a \"before\" of this one but it was a dark almost black colour.  I loved the fluted edge of it.This pink paint I have used is actually a Resene Testpot in the Colour Pale Rose - it's the perfect shade of pink 💗This was a tin bucket with rope handles that I found in my sleep out. It was the perfect size for my poor pot-bound ladder fern.(I can cut 3 plants labels from one length of Dowel)Pretty plant labels are expensive to buy but I enjoy making my own from these round wooden discs that you can buy from the Variety Stores ($2.99 for a packet of 4).  I buy a length of dowel from Mitre 10, hot glue it to the back & then paint the entire piece before adding the transfers.  These are great if you need to stake a plant too.I decided to use this old tin trunk as a plant display area as the large picture window provides good light for my plants.  These ones are all newly repotted in larger (upcycled) containers.Just beside the tin trunk is a selection of thrifted plant stands that I have painted over the years. I seem to have a bit of A Pink Theme going on down here.While I was outside re-potting I gave my deck table a good scrub & potted up these sweet little viola's.  The purple in them almost reminds me of velvet.  The potted white hyacinth was pulled out from under a garden shrub - its fragrance is divine.The other week I had to deliver some fresh bags of my citrus pot-pourri to The Farm Shop at Gordonton.  I had not supplied them for over a year due to Lockdowns etc & I wanted to deliver it & remove any old stock I had there.  My car smelt beautiful on the drive over!I had arranged to meet up with my lovely friend Sue out there & have lunch together.  Sue took me to the cafe out at Woodlands Estate on the other side of Gordonton.  I had not been here before & it was just stunning.  We had a lovely lunch & a wander around the gardens but could not go in the main house due to a private function being held there.Sue & I both wanted to go to Clandon Daffodil Farm.  It has been a couple of years since I was last here & it is one of my favourite places to visit.  Just seeing those rows & rows of happy yellow faces as you drive up is so uplifting.  Even though it was a wet rainy day it was still such a pleasant & enjoyable outing.  The shop is self service & they have a huge selection of daffodils for you to choose from & very reasonably priced.  Sue & I both bought a big bunch of Seconds.  They also sell a selection of bulbs here & have a display garden where you can see the different varieties of daffs available to grow now ... even a pink shade.When I got home I divided all my daffs up into different vases as I wanted to share them with my daughter in laws.  Sue has begun learning pottery & is doing such amazing work - I was delighted when she presented me with one of her bowls in a lovely dusky blue glaze.  I put a large vase of Early Cheer Daffs in my lounge so I could enjoy them each night & Oh the fragrance was amazing.  They always make me feel happy because I know when they appear each year ... spring is not too far away.Interestingly I took a photo of this notice at the Daffodil Farm & decided to do exactly as they suggested.  I often find daffs don't last long in my home as it gets hot here due to our fire.  But I did what they suggested (putting them outside on the deck each night), changing the water every 2nd day ...& they did Not begin to wilt until day 6 or 7, so I was really pleased.Thank you so very much dear friends, for staying through this lengthy post,I am off to fill the wood basket as it feels like another frost tonight,Wishing you a wonderful weekend - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

A Warm Welcome to You!! On my recent return from Mum's I was delighted to notice my Moth Orchid flowering away quite happily, despite my neglect.I have had this for about 3 years now & it was a Mother's Day gift from eldest son & family 💗Early in June my dear friend Sandy dropped in one day & presented me with this beautiful potted plant ... a String of TurtlesRight away I decided it needed its own special plant stand ... so I unearthed this old wooden stool in my woodshed that I had once painted in Resene Hot Chilli & used outdoors.  I cut an inch off each leg & then painted the whole thing in Chalk Paint - Vintage White.It sat like this for over a month until I came across this beautiful transfer online from * Here *.  I loved the individual flowers & vines on it so I cut out various ones & added them to my stool plant-stand.                   I love the way the vines look as though they are growing up the legs of the plant-stand . . . . .. . . . . .  & it looks perfect with my new plant sitting on top.  Thank You So much Sandy for your kindness 💕When Mum was in New Plymouth City Hospital I visited the Spotlight Store there to buy more dishcloth cotton.  Right next door is the Salvation Army Op Shop & of course it would've been rude of me Not to pop in 😉.   I definately do not need another mirror but I could not leave this one behind so at $5 it came home with me.It had obviously been dropped at some stage & the frame had 2 cracks in it ... but nothing that a bit of polyfiller & sanding couldn't fix.  I cleaned it thoroughly, fixed the cracks & then painted it with two coats of Chalk Paint in the colour Pumice.  Upon rummaging through my offcuts of transfers I found this floral design & some wording so I decided to add the transfers to the mirror part & make it into a decor piece.   I absolutely love how this looks.I even painted the back as it was very tatty.  Some light distressing afterwards & it was complete. I have sat it on top of my vintage Radiogram with a couple of other pieces in the same colourway. When I made the doiley bunting for my friend Jane in * this post * I showed it on Instagram & Ingrid contacted me to ask if I could make her two in cream/ecru shades & post them over to Australia.  I finally got around to completing this Order & then the package took a month to reach Ingrid.She was delighted with her two buntings & sent me the loveliest message to thank me.I thought you might enjoy this photo of Miss Pippi doing her morning meditation yesterday.  She is lucky I love her so much as she has been particularly naughty trying lately 😉Thank you all So much for popping by today dear friends,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend (it's a rainy🌧Friday here)Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much Love & Friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": " A Tilda Swap  ........  Across \" the ditch \"", "date": "Thursday, August 18, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersAt the start of this year Christine emailed me to ask whether I would be interested in doing a Tilda Swap with her as we are both dedicated Tilda lovers. I thought this was a wonderful idea & we both agreed to make very \"loose rules\" in that it would be a winter swap using Tilda fabrics but not necessarily a Tilda pattern. We both began working on our swap gifts in early Autumn & decided we would mail them to each other on the same day.  Christine is in Victoria, Australia & I am in Waikato, New Zealand so the Tasman Sea that seperates our two countries is often referred to as \"the ditch\".  We were curious to see whose reached its destination first.  Interestingly mine reached Christine in just over a week yet hers took 3 (long) weeks to get to me.During our waiting time Christine suggested we do a facetime call to each other & open our parcels at the same time.  We have never met & only became \"friends\" through this wonderful medium called Blogging.I had mine all laid out on a tray to begin opening them at our designated calling time ... it was So exciting & I even remembered to brush my hair that day (!!!) 😉 The first package I opened was these delectable treats from Australia ... Choccy Caramello Koala's, Rocky Road Cookie Bites & a box of Australian Afternoon Tea.  Christine had popped the Caramello Koala's in for the grandchildren but I must confess Not every single one reached the littlies 😯 (!!!)What was inside the other packages quite took my breath away  ... I must've mentioned once how I just adore the Tilda \"Old Rose range\" & Christine had remembered this ... this stunning project bag made from Old Rose fabrics & filled with all manner of stitching delights  💕 including a gorgeous variegated Cottage Garden Thread.The sweetest needle-case & matching pincushion 💕(The pattern Christine has used is a Gail Pan design)This darling little thread catcher that winds up & down magically, & a pair of scissors with a strawberry scissor-keep attached  💕You can read Christine's post about what she made me * Here * ... her photo's are much clearer than mine.I was honestly just SO delighted with my swap gifts & at the end of our phone call I realised we had both chatted for an hour!! It was simply wonderful.When we initially agreed on the swap the first idea that popped into my head was to make a doll for Christine.  She had mentioned she has pinks, greens, reds in her home so I pulled some fabrics in these colours from my stash & decided to make her the Rosalie Quinlan doll \"Ruby\"This doll has a tag hanging from it's hand that reads \"Dear Mummy We love you\" - so I decided to stitch \"I 💗 Tilda\" on my tag.The dress fabric is a piece from the Sweetheart Tilda range which is now a Very vintage Tilda (2015)The doll is made to hang from a loop on her other hand but I feel she is equally as nice just sitting. I had some treasured vintage linens in my stash & I used this gorgeous crinoline lady one for my doll's pinny.  Instead of French knots for hair as the pattern states, I gave her some pretty hair using hand dyed mohair.I painted her shoes using some pale pink chalk paint as I didn't have any fabric paint in this colour.Christine has named her doll \"Tilly\" 💗The face scrubbies & soap pouch are purchased from a gorgeous Handcraft Shop in Mum's townI had gathered together some bits & pieces to include so I decided to stitch a little gathered pouch to hold them.  The soap is from this Lavender Farm which is 2 minutes up the road from where I live.  The pouch is also a Rosalie Quinlan design from her book Gift.When I saw this wee china jug in an Op Shop the flowers reminded me of Tilda so I made a soy candle in the jug & included this, along with a N.Z magazine & N.Z choccy.The hanging doiley Angels are from the book Tilda's Winter Delights .. you cut them out & then add a paper doiley skirt - just so sweet tied onto parcels. And for Christine's post about what I made for her ... go * Here *     We both agreed this was just such an enjoyable swap & were both so VeRy happy with our packages.Quite by accident Sid & I have discovered that our local Library has Lego Club each Tuesday after school so we went along this week & had a wonderful hour building Lego with other children.  I think this might become a regular fixture in our Tuesday after-school activities.  Thank you all so much for staying with me through this lengthy post dear friends,  With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Hello (& Goodbye !!) to July .......... & Welcome to August ", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2022", "text": "Greetings (at long last) lovely friends & readersI did not mean to be gone for so long (2 months in fact) !!Some early spring flowers - picked from my garden just this morning 💛Just after I hit Publish on my last post, my dear 93 year old Mum became most unwell ...  3 ambulance trips in 10 days from the Resthome - Mum had Influenza A, a U.T.I. as well suffering a T.I.A.  My eldest son & I drove down arriving just after midnight to the nearest City Hospital.  I ended up staying for nearly 3 weeks until Mum was transferred back to the Resthome & became stable.  It was a scary & anxious time & not one I would want to repeat.  Upon my return our computer crashed & although I could read blogs on my phone,  I couldn't comment.  So I feel I have missed out on so much here in blogland & am happy to be able to post again.About 10 minutes drive from Mums home is Ohawe Beach - I went out there frequently for walks along the wild west coast & loved it.  I am over an hour from here to a beach so it was wonderful to be able to be so close to the sea. I confess to being a bit obsessed with taking photos of stunning Mount Taranaki - he was proudly wearing his white winter coat while I was there. The top left hand photo is just up the road from Mums, on one of my walks & the top right one is actually taken from my bedroom window at Mums - you can just see it peeking between the rooftops. I grew up with this mountain out my bedroom window & took it SO much for granted.  It never fails to take my breath away when I return.While I was away I celebrated another birthday - 62 years around the sun!! My friend Lynley popped in with a Red Velvet cupcake & candle so I happily blew it out for her.  Unfortunately just after our little morning tea Mum was rushed off in the ambulance yet again so my birthday involved 7 hours at A & E ... not exactly how I would recommend celebrating your birthday.Luckily just before my son & I headed off late into the night I remembered to toss my bag of knitting cotton oddments into the car & I was able to knit lots of dishcloths to fill in the many hours spent sitting in hospitals or Resthomes.  I use * this free pattern * & I have knitted so many I can now remember it off by heart.I miss these two so very much when I am away ... the ginger girl frets & doesn't eat properly until I return, then she sulks with me for a couple of days & then goes back to normal 😉😸 (well normal for her)While I've been away we have been getting a nice new wooden fence built.  This is very exciting for me ... we have always just had a wire fence between our section & the farm & it was falling down, to put it mildly.  Every time I would peg out my washing I would be trying to straighten posts that the cows had knocked over.  This new post-&-rail fence goes right around the outer perimeter of our section (260 metres) including the depot yard at the end which we rent out.(Click on the photo to enlarge it for a better view)The Mr bought one of the farm tractors home to remove the old posts & the furry two found it so incredibly fascinating climbing all over it & checking out the different smells of all the barn cats that live at the farm.  Inevitably there have been some Op Shop visits on my recent trips.  The St Vincent de Paul Op Shop in Mum's town had a large stack of plates for only $2 each.  Of course I need more china plates like I need a hole in the head, but however ............. these ones came home with me.  The two on the far right were only $1 each & the others were all $2 - how could I resist ???!!! 😯There were other op shop purchases but I think I will show these as I repurpose/upcycle them.  My daughter-in-law Sarah would send me lovely photos of my Grandson while I was away to brighten my days - I absolutely adore this one of Alec, sound asleep with the cat on the bed.Long time readers of my blog may remember the post I wrote about her finding this feral kitten that was so unwell - you can see how dear Bruno has well & truly landed on his feet paws !! 💙 Wishing you all a wonderful weekend dear friends,I shall be back soon as I have much to share with you,Thank you for your ever-welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Moving My Mum to Resthome Care", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have been away for over a week as I moved my dear Mum in to Resthome Care.    I think some overseas Countries call it Assisted Living but here in New Zealand we call it Resthome Care.     It feels like I went away in Autumn & returned in Winter as there are bare branches & leaves everywhere around my section & garden. The day before I went I had a VeRy important event to attend ... Grandparents Day at Sid's new school.  Though the weather was dreadful & the scheduled Cross Country Run cancelled, we still had a wonderful time & both enjoyed it very much.My 93 year old Mum has spent the past 10 years of her life saying she is Never Ever going in to Resthome Care ... so I knew it was going to be difficult to navigate.   We had been waiting all year for a room to become available & finally when one was, I didn't want to risk losing it.  I am hoping that as the days & weeks go by Mum comes to accept that she can no longer manage living on her own at Home anymore.  It is 21 years today since my Dad passed away from Cancer.    Mum's new room is very pleasant & has a nice big picture window that looks out on to greenery & big trees.  (You can just see Mums reflection in the window)The Resthome has 3 cats, two of them were rescue kittens & this one above (Boots) came to welcome Mum on her first day there.  Here she is sitting on Mum's windowsill.  The next day Boot's brother (Marley) followed me up the hallway & into Mum's room, where he promptly took up residence on her bed for the rest of the day.  The third day I visited, Marley was on her lap enjoying her pats.  I do think they sense when the Residents are \"cat lovers\" or not, as they don't go in to everyone's rooms apparently.I had really hoped that Mum would find \"a new friend\" while in the Resthome but I kind of thought a two-legged one & not a four-legged, furry one !! 😉When my brother came to install a new TV set in Mum's room Marley was not fazed in the slightest & just carried on sleeping.(The wooden childs chair was $5 & I thought I may re-purpose it as a plant stand)During stressful times I try to relax by browsing the isles of Op Shops ... however it was slim pickings this trip.  The above items were found in the local SPCA Op Shop apart from the Cane frame which was in a shop opposite that was closing down & was $3.I thought the wee lavender porcelain jug & bowl would be sweet with candles poured into them & the ($2) terracotta wheelbarrow will get a coat of paint & some succulents planted in it sometime.Before                                                                        AfterI couldn't resist this little framed cutwork design for $3 ... but once home I gave the frame 3 coats of Pale Duck Egg chalk paint as I thought this complimented the soft pastel needlework more than the darker wood.It fits perfectly on my occasional table with other thrifted/upcycled items painted in the same colour 💙You can read about the Jug Upcycle * Here *    & the taller Frame Upcycle * Here *This wee girl spends her Saturday mornings on the Counter at the SPCA shop & is quite a hit with the regular customers.  I asked if I could take a photo of her - she was very social & seemed to really enjoy all the pats & attention. Back in early May I entered a Mothers Day Giveaway run by Joy from \"The Joy Within\" .. & was delighted to be informed I had won it!!   The prize was a Gift Voucher & one of Joy's repurposed Squished Tin's.  Joy delivered my prize while I was down at Mums & I hope to use the Voucher to attend one of her classes at some stage.Thank You So much for stopping by today dear friends 💕I shall get round to visiting you all at your blogs as soon as I can,Right now I am off to make something sweet & sugary that satisfies my craving & no doubt, goes straight to my Hips 😉 !!!Wishing you a wonderful rest-of-the-week,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Bunting, Peat Pots & Gourds", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersJust trying to squeeze in one last post before we wave goodbye to May.My dear friend Jane asked if I could please make her a white doiley bunting using a mixture of crochet ones & vintage embroidered ones.  Luckily I had a fairly substantial stash 😉 as Jane wanted it 4 metres long.Bunting is really quite tricky to photograph unless you hang it somewhere. I did send Jane the above photo of Miss Pip very kindly \"ironing\" the doilies for me ... & promised to pick all the ginger hairs out before giving her the bunting.Jane was absolutely thrilled with her bunting & I have yet to go visit her & see it hanging up. 💕On my last visit to Mum's I very briefly caught up with my friend Joy from \" the Joy Within \".  Joy presented me with this little kitset above in case I wanted to do some crafting while at Mum's.  The kit included some peat pots, chalk paint, mod-podge & a beautiful selection of serviettes.  Joy holds workshops in her \"she shed\" where she teaches chalk painting & I had seen the peat pots done but never had a go.  I thought this was so incredibly kind of her.  Let me tell you dear friends ........ those peat pots are Sooooo addictive!!  In fact they are so addictive that I found myself driving to Mitre 10 hardware store in the middle of a thunderstorm to purchase more !!!  You just dry brush the chalk paint on & then embellish with the serviettes to your hearts content.  So Much Fun!I decided to make up a little gift package using 3 of the peat pots for a dear friend.   I filled One with lovely choccies, One with a tiny baby tears plant & the other One I made up a small French Pear Soy Candle into a glass container that just fit perfectly in the pot.I cut up a cardboard cereal box & covered with scrapbooking paper (& a paper doiley) to sit my 3 peat pots on .......... .......... before wrapping the whole thing in cellophane & adding a tag.  I left it in my friends porch to surprise her 😊when she got home.Way back at the beginning of September in * this post * - Sid & I planted some Dinosaur Gourd seeds.  We finally harvested them last week & below is what we grew from the one packet of seeds.I'm not too sure why they called them dinosaur gourds but Sid pointed out to me that the long one looked a bit like a Brachiosaurus's neck !Speaking of Sid ... he had his school disco last week & it was dress up.  He went as a Tiger & his Mum sent me this photo above just before he went out to the Disco.  🐯Yesterday I had a Baking day.  I made Banana Cake from some bananas that were turning, & then a no-bake Apricot Slice with a delicious cream cheese icing.  I plan to give most of this away as otherwise I am tempted to eat it & those jeans didn't get tight all by themselves Julie !! 😉I saw the above Verse on Instagram & it really appealed to me.  Things are \"very messy & difficult\" with matters relating to my Mum of late & I just have to keep going & trust that it will be okay in the end. Thank You dear friends - as always - for your visits here today,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Catching Up ...............  Part (3)", "date": "Friday, May 20, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersFinally - after this post - I should be all caught up again 😉Thank You for staying with me through these lengthy Catch Up posts.Finally today our permit came through so we could light our new fire - & we are currently having a thunderstorm so the timing was perfect !Last week my dear friend Sandy hosted a Pink Ribbon Morning tea for a small group of friends.  Sandy has hosted these in the past as we like to celebrate the journey back to wellness of our dear friend Pam, who has battled cancer twice.  I always enjoy going out to Sandy's as everything she does is just to exquisite taste & I knew the morning tea would be special.As expected it was just superb & the pink theme was so perfect & pretty.   💗  Sandy had mixed up a pink drink with soda water & we had pink straws, pink plates, serviettes & even pink coasters.  Pink candles were burning & a large vase of pink flowers.We enjoyed pink cupcakes, pink macaroons, pink heart marshmallows,  club sandwiches & Sandy had even made shortbread in the pink ribbon logo & iced this with pink icing sprinkled with pink & white hearts 💕  The entire table setting just made you want to smile.Our get-together's always go by so fast & before we knew it, it was early afternoon.  Upon leaving Sandy presented us each with a beautiful potted Cyclamen.I am lucky indeed to enjoy such friendships & it's so nice to get together & celebrate as we all lead busy lives & the months go by very fast before we manage to catch up.I have not done a display on my coffee table since my Valentine's attempt.    I just got tired of the furry two always sitting amongst my treasures & then I'd clear it all off for Sid to do play dough on Tuesdays ....  I kind of gave up for awhile.  However last week I decided to do another vignette with lots of candles as I love to burn them through our dark winter months.  I took a piece of advise from my dear friend Claire who said to decorate every spare inch & leave No room for any furry 4-legged beings to sit!   Lots of Op-shopped junk treasures used for displays !!I used trays to cover nearly  all the table & then did some candle, plant & vintage book displays on the trays. I really enjoyed this, using up items from my rather large stash.  I was so proud of myself when I'd finished & even made The Mr come & have a look.  (he was not in slightest bit interested)Well dear friends ............................................. you can see how well that worked out for me .......................................................In case you're wondering .... Yes he IS crying at me because I haven't left him any room to sit !!!!!  😐Last Sunday my eldest grandson Alec turned the big 7 !! He had a birthday party & his Mum made him a wonderful chocolate mud cake.Sarah, his Mum had gone to lots of trouble organising games to occupy all the children that came - a lovely mix of both boys & girls.I especially loved this game above ... seems only yesterday my own boys were playing Pin the tail on the Donkey!  Now its \"Pin the tail on the Dinosaur.\"   I loved seeing where all the tails ended up ... one even completely on the next window frame !!! 😉Saw this on Instagram & loved it !! Thanks again dear friends, for your ever-welcome visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend where-ever you are ... be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Catching Up  ..........  Part (2)", "date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersHere I am still playing \"catch up\" on my blog posts from my recent trip to Mum's & before that ........My sister-in-law told me about a new store that had opened about 10 minutes from Mums, out on the Coast road.  As I'm always looking for places to take Mum for a drive I thought it might be nice to drive out & visit it.  The store is called Brandy's Botanicals  -  the Owner Debbie has had a wonderful barn built on her property in order for her to sell her plants, seeds & other Giftware.It was really lovely & a wonderful selection with lots to look at plus the Owner was just so lovely & friendly.  My photos Do Not do it justice - it really was packed to the brim with plants that she had mainly grown all herself - plus a wonderful selection of seeds & some very unusual varieties.Mum chose this glazed pot & I helped her find the sweet little trailing plant to go in it.I bought myself 3 small size houseplants as well as 3 packets of seeds & the Owner tossed in the other 2 packets for free 😊On the subject of houseplants ... I noticed my poor Peace Lily was looking rather root-bound & in need of a re-pot.  I fossicked around under my house & found this old terracotta pot which needed a good scrub with lots of \"elbow grease\".  It has the odd chip in it but this just adds to the overall effect I feel. 😉After scrubbing & drying it well I gave it 2 coats of Pumice Chalk Paint & then applied a new transfer that I had ordered from * Here *.  I then sprayed it with 2 coats of matt finish acrylic varnish, just to protect it well.I gave my Peace Lily a good root prune before repotting it in fresh potting mix.  It just looks so much happier now & will hopefully flower again when spring comes.Prior to my trip to Mums my dear friend Jane requested a doll order for her Aunts 70th birthday.  Jane knew exactly the pattern she wanted - a Rosalie Quinlan doll called Ruby from an old craft magazine (Homespun I think) Jane requested that I make the doll in her Aunt's favourite colours of blues & greens ... \"vivid retro florals\" was Jane's words.  I was able to find exactly this in my vintage sheet collection, & Jane chose the homespun check for the bloomers.  In Rosalie's pattern the tag reads \"dear Mummy, I love you\" but Jane asked me to stitch \"Happy 70th Aunty Colleen\".  The pattern has a loop sewn to the dolls hand so she can be hung but is equally as nice sitting on a bed or a chair.  Jane tells me her Aunt Loved the doll & plans to hang her in her sewing room.  💙We had a stretch of frosts last week & it was Oh So Chilly.  These two spend most of the day tucked up on a blanket on my bed keeping warm together.I think I have one more Catch Up Post to put together friends,Thank You for your visits here today - I am off to collect Sid as we have a couple of hours together after school on Tuesdays.Wishing you all a wonderful rest-of-the-week,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Catching Up Post .......... Part (1)", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have been away down to my Mum's (Yes again!!) & I have lots of blogging to catch up on hence I decided on a couple of \"catch up posts\".The Mr snapped this pic last night after he had gone down to shut the cows away ... such a stunning sunset followed by a very chilly night.I have a new Grandson of the furry variety 😉My daughter in law found this dear little kitten living wild in the long grass on their rural road.  She caught it & took him to the Vets - he had Cat Flu, Conjunctivitis & a myriad of other things wrong ... rather a sad state of affairs & barely 6 weeks old according to the Vet.Sarah, my daughter in law, asked me if I had any blankets that I could share with her for the kitten.  I set to & cut up some thrifted cuddlies & also some wool blankets that I had on hand.  I overlocked all the edges of them & then Pippi tried them out for me for \"comfort & snug-ability\" 😉Here is the kitten (originally named Felix) after just 10 days of good food, medication & Lots of love & care.  He is trying out the new blanket above right.  My Grandson Alec has now named him Bruno which believe me is alot better than his first choice which was Sharky !!Such a dear wee thing & full of mischief  ... Bruno has landed on his feet with his new home & will be very much loved & adored.  💙The week I was away at Mums my youngest Grandson Sid had his last day at Daycare & got to wear the \"Leaving Cloak\" above left.  Then he had his first week at school, which he loves & just adores his new teacher.  (If you look closely you will notice he has had a haircut before starting school & also you might notice he was wearing his school uniform to Daycare  !!!)I took a slightly different route down to Mum's this time & went via the City & then around the Coast so I could catch up with two dear friends.  My sister in law Felicity has a Groovy new Coffee Cart & I loved her blackboard verse.The reason I took the coast road was so I could visit my dear friend Carolyn who had just celebrated a special birthday.  I made her one of Jennifer \"Books & Roses\" bookmarks to go with * this book * which I had bought for her. I knew she had recently had a vintage chair re-upholstered & I decided to make her a Roundie Cushion to sit on her new/old chair.  I had this piece of Vintage Barkcloth fabric in my stash & hoped the colours might be suitable.Carolyn was absolutely delighted with her gifts & the new cushion just fit perfectly on the chair.  I have given her a copy of the pattern as I thought she might like to make some more.  It is out of my \"Granny Chic\" Book You will be surprised to learn that I only visited One Op Shop on the entire trip!!   I actually called in to Spotlight while in the city & when I came back out to my car I saw there was a Salvation Army Op-Shop right next door so I popped in.  I noticed this cane chair for $30 & remembered that Mum had asked me if I would take her to buy a chair for her small front porch.  I thought this might be ideal & it was in excellent condition.  I walked back to my car, sat in it for 5 minutes & then went back in & bought it.  Mum was delighted with it & can get in & out of it easily - plus it fits well in the small space.  I have traced off a pattern to make her a squab for the seat part.  When she tires of it, I can soon find a space here for it. 😉Before my trip I found this old muffin tin in my cupboard - a 50 cent find in the Op Shop bargain bin (my favourite place 😉)I painted it with 2 coats of Pumice Chalk Paint & then lightly distressed it.  I applied these Re-design by Prima knob transfers that I bought ages ago - using a different one for each circle.  I first saw this idea on * this Youtube video * as I am a subscriber to \"Julie's designs & signs\" & love what she creates.  Julie used stamps on her muffin pan but I didn't have any stamps & felt the knob transfers fit perfectly. She also decorated the underside of her tin.I hung it in my kitchen on the old rake that I have hanging there & love how it turned out 💗You can read my post about the Rake upcycle * Here *I saw this Verse on Instagram & thought how very true !Thank you So much for your visits today dear friends ... I will be back soon with Part (2)Wishing you a wonderful rest-of-the-week,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "My Thrifting Haul(s) ", "date": "Monday, April 25, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLongtime readers of my blog will know that I love to frequent thrift stores & Op-shops.  I don't always find purchases but it gives me so much pleasure when I do come away with some new-to-me junk treasures.  My many trips down to Mum's this year (6 so far) have seen me stop at lots of Op-shops in my travels & I realised I had not shared my hauls from the last two trips.Half an hour from Mum's town I pass through the township of Stratford. I really like their Hospice Shop - clean, well laid out, good stock & reasonable prices.  These items above were all from there.  In case you might think that I buy these items & then don't especially do anything with them, I thought I'd share what I've done with some of the items in the above haul.   The beautiful hard-cover book above was $5 & still like brand new.  I bought it for Juno & it made a nice Easter gift along with the Carrot Treat Bag I had made for her.The Miranda Hart book ($1) is to gift to my friend Gail who absolutely Loves anything Miranda. I am half way through reading the Sophie Kinsella book ($1) & then I'll pass this on to a friend.The $1 piece of Linen has been washed, ironed & put away with my offcuts of Linen - I always pick up Linen when I see it at Op-shops as it is so pricey in the Sewing shops.The small wooden stool above was $8.  I painted this over Easter with 2 coats chalk paint in the colour Vintage White.It made a perfect riser for a small Easter display I had done & will be handy throughout the year for table displays.These two tall glass candle holders were $2.50 each. Although they don't match I knew I had a boxful of small candles at home that I was sure would fit in them perfectly.  They look wonderful tucked into another display on my round table & I will be lighting & enjoying them soon.This haul above is from the Hospice Shop in Mum's small town - again another very good shop to visit.  The needlework framed picture was $5 & this too got painted over Easter as the frame was chipped & tatty.I used the chalk-paint colour Old Linen which seemed to match the background fabric perfectly.  I Love how this turned out. 💗This heavy crystal vase was $3 & I made a soy candle up into it - these are handy to have on hand for gifts. The fragrance is French Pear & it smells divine.  The wee floral jug ($2) will also have a candle made into it once my new order of soy wax arrives.The round jar (you can only see the Lid of it in my haul photo) was 50c.  I needed a good sized jar to keep some vintage buttons in & this was ideal plus I loved the shape of it.  Any household items that I purchase are put through my dishwasher as soon as I get them home as I find this brings them up clean & shiny.The china cups & saucers above were bought from the SPCA shop - they were pricey at $10 a pair but I was sure they matched some china I already had - the jug & bowl above right.How pretty they look amongst my collection of green china ware. 💚Almost all of the china on this dresser has been thrifted.Another thing I always pick up is wooden embroidery hoops as these too are expensive in the Sewing Shops.  This one above was 50c & it just fit this sweet little stitchery that I had completed while down at Mums.  It looked a bit bland so I painted around it with some leftover blue chalk-paint & this seemed to really bring it to life.  The pattern is available from Twig & Tale Designs.We have had beautiful autumn days this past week & I've worked outside pulling one of my raised veggie gardens to bits & giving the soil a good feed before I plant for winter.  I harvested many green peppers which I froze & the last of my tomatoes.  I also harvested some self-sown pumpkins.  While at Mitre 10 buying sheep pellets for my soil I noticed their Bulbs were all half price so I purchased 2 packs of daffy's which are now in the ground.Since my return home Fat Blackie has taken up residence in the craft cupboard at the end of the hallway.  The door doesn't latch properly so he is able to get his paw around & open it. He is currently sleeping on a stack of nicely ironed linen tablecloths that I had just done.  Yesterday when I tried to get some fabric out from under him he hissed at me, the little so & so 😒Thank you so very much for your visits today dear friendsWishing you a wonderful week ahead - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Mum's 93rd Birthday  ........  & Some Easter Makes", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI hope you all had a wonderful Easter - it felt like it went by in the blink of an eye.Just before my last post I returned from a week down at my Mum's.  During this visit Mum celebrated her 93rd birthday.  She didn't wish to have a \"celebration\" as such, but my two sons & their families had arranged to all travel down & surprise her I really love this photo of Mum with my eldest grandson Alec ... they look like they have been up to some sort of mischief together 😉Mum with her two great-grandsons, Sid & Alec.Mum with my eldest son Aaron & his wife Sarah - (Alec's parents)Mum with my youngest son Kayne & his wife Nicole - (Sid's parents)We had a delicious finger-food lunch (catered for by yours-truly) followed by a sweet course.  My brother & his wife came as well so there were 10 of us around Mums kitchen table & we only just fit.I made Mum a chocolate mud cake & she got to blow out 3 candles for \"yesterday, today & tomorrow\".  It was such a lovely day & nice to all get together again after so long.My lovely friend Jane & I did a labour swap last year.   I sewed a Tilda Cat for her & in exchange Jane cross stitched this sweet Rabbit design for me.  This is a free download from Whilst Iris Naps website. I left the colour choices up to Jane & I absolutely LoVe what she chose to stitch it up in.Just prior to Easter I decided to sew it up into a simple small size cushion which I filled with crushed walnut shells to make it sit up nicely on my table.  I finished it off by hand-stitching this fluffy yarn around the outer edge.  This Bunnie pattern was purchased about 3 years ago now from The Makers Studio .   Once again I came across it & decided to sew a couple up.  I found the lovely piece of pale green linen - an Opshop purchase which looked like someone had started a cut-work piece & never completed it.   (I always pick up linen when I see it in the Op-shops)I made both sizes, one in cream linen & the other in the pale green.  I used Tilda scraps for their ears & embellishments.I added fine florist wire inside their ears to make them stand up a bit moreSuch a sweet design & fun to stitch up.  It will be hard to pack them away after Easter I think.The silver tray above left, was a $3 Op-shop purchase on one of my recent trips to Mums. I needed something about this size & shape for a \"carrot bundle\" I was making.  Over Easter I gave it a couple of coats of pale grey chalk paint.I'd seen an image of this Carrot bundle on Pinterest & it had stayed in my head (!!!) 😉.  I sewed them up using scraps of fabrics - the carrot tops are just Jute String unraveled ... it gets this wavy curly effect.   My Primitive Carrot bundle just fits perfectly on the newly painted tray.Likewise for this frame - yes, another 50 cent Opshop find.  I took the backing off, painted it the same grey as the tray & then hot-glued this birdnest, bird & real branches off my Plum Tree to the frame.  Another idea from the myriad of ones that float around inside my head !!!My only purchase this Easter was the sweet little felted rabbit in the purple jumper - I adored him 💜Instead of decorating my Coffee Table for Easter this year, I decided to decorate my Lounge Mantle.  This is mainly because of the 4-legged furry friends that Sit amongst my decorations !! I thought (hoped) the mantle was too high for them to get up 😉I just used all Easter decorations from previous years & the Peter Rabbit bunting was purchased from Spotlight.  The grouping of calico rabbits I sat in the chamber pot which I purchased in * this post * ... & sat this on the plant stand which I revamped in * this post *Well done & Thank You if you've stayed to the end dear friends,Its been another looonnng post,Wishing you all a wonderful Wednesday,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Upon my arrival she sat me down with a hot cuppa & a plate of home-made pizza bread.  It was just the tonic I needed & next thing ... this Beautiful pink hat box was placed in my lap. Claire had been going to donate it but then decided to revamp it to house my swap gifts in ... how stunning & perfect it was 💗This is what it looked like inside when I lifted the Lid ..........Four parcels each wrapped in a vintage linen tea-cloth & a Tilda envelope attached, tied up with a big pink bow !Oh Be Still My Rapidly Beating Heart ..........  💗These are the wooden letters (above) which Claire painted & decorated.L stands for Love-hearts ... a beautiful Love heart quilt made using Tilda fabrics ... & quilted with hearts 💕& a tube of Love Heart sweets.O stands for \"the shape\" ... yet another gorgeous quilt made using O-shaped blocks, quilted in O's & even an \"O\" cross stitch label on the back.  Also a delightful handmade ceramic O-shaped bowl.(I think about this point in time - I may have cried !!!)V stands for Violet & for \"V\"  ... a smaller size quilt made using V shaped blocks (gorgeous vintage Tilda), a Violet-coloured \"Scissor wall-hanging\" in a V-shape,  some tiny Embroidery scissors & 3 Velour hearts with Tilda Angels attached.If you look closely you may notice the M & M's packet is empty - I blame that ginger cat of mine !!E stands for Envelope & Easter Eggs !!!  A square shaped table quilt with Envelope blocks on it & two bags of Easter Eggs. Each package had one of these hand-sewn Tilda Envelopes with it & a handwritten notecard inside Here are the 4 Vintage embroidered tablecloths once I have ironed them all ... just gorgeous. Yesterday was the first chance I have had to even think about how to display my beautiful new treasures & I am sure I will continue to change my mind & re-arrange things.  This is a small display on the edge of my TV cabinet using the Envelope table quilt.The Love hearts quilt fits perfectly over an armchair & the Tilda Summer pillow, a gift from my dear friend Leeanne,  just compliments it so well.  The V-shaped quilt tucked under a small display of china in similar colourings.,I stitched a quilt hanger to the Scissor quilt & hung it in my sewing room along with a velvet bow ... but Claire informs me I have it upside down (!!!)  I shall have to rectify this 😉As you can imagine dear friends - I am just so happy with all my swap gifts - in fact, happy doesn't really do it justice.  Just So Much Love sewn in to each & every piece 💕 Claire's handwork is absolutely stunning!!Thank you dear readers, if you've stayed to the end of this photo-heavy post. Wishing each & every one of you a Blessed Easter ...

{"title": "A Wedding, An Ambulance, & A Special Birthday", "date": "Saturday, April 2, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersIt has been an eventful week & then yesterday ... we welcomed in another shiny new month ... April 💚Exactly a week ago today my Stepson & his Fiance got married in a stunning part of the Hamilton Gardens.   If you google Hamilton Gardens Medici Court Images,  you can see much better photos than I have taken. It was the most beautiful Autumnal day & the wedding was extra special because this was their 3rd attempt - having been forced to cancel twice last year due to Lockdowns.   Then my Stepson went down with Covid, only coming out of his isolation the day before the wedding.  To say we were all holding our breath is an understatement.  My photos are not great - I am always conscious of professional wedding photographers & their protocol so I only clicked a couple of snaps.The beautiful Bride & Groom after the service.Their wee girl Juno (nearly 2 now) had been given a new rabbit to match her new dress.  She did so well at the service & just sat quietly with the bride's brother without making a peep.A rare photo of me with my youngest son & his wife.  Kayne & Jared  (the groom) grew up together & have remained close.  After the service we travelled to Hayes Common for the reception. The florists had done a stunning job of framing the entrance with the same sorts of flowers used in the girls bouquets. After a delicious meal a pink Icecream Van pulled up outside the venue & we were all to order any sort of icecream we fancied.  We all wanted to loosen our belts after this evening !! 😉(Again - I forgot to snap pics & the ones I took of the couple dancing have come out blurry.)On the morning of the wedding as I was heading to a friends to get my hair done I got a phone call to say my 92 year old Mum had had another fall & been carted off in an ambulance.  This did tend to put a dampner on the days celebrations for me as I was so worried about Mum.The next morning when I learned Mum was still in hospital awaiting a CT scan I decided to head off down there. I was having a relatively uneventful drive until I encountered this huge landslide.  You can read about it * Here *.I was only the 3rd vehicle back & I was on the other side to this pic.  (this is the newspapers photo I have shown)I ended up taking a different route going back, then inland - a journey that normally takes me 4 hours ended up taking me nearly 7. It was a long day & I was pleased to arrive safely at Mums house.After 4 nights Mum was discharged from hospital (nothing broken) & I took her home to her place.  I then drove home again late Thursday afternoon but I will return to look after Mum next week & this will be ongoing until a bed comes up in the Resthome just up the road from where Mum lives.The reason I wanted to return home was because yesterday,  April 1st - was a special birthday in which Sid was turning 5 !!    🎈I spent yesterday morning wrapping presents & baking & then we had his little birthday celebration in the afternoon.One of his requests was for a dinosaur piniata which gave all the children lots of pleasure until they managed to get it to burst open & lollies pour out.And then this sweet little photo appeared in my inbox this morning of Sid with the Crocodile Lego set I gave him. I can hardly believe this boy is now 5 years old & will start school at the beginning of May.    I will miss my Tuesdays-with-Sid. I was able to briefly catch up with my dear friend Claire before Mum came home from hospital & she gifted me my swap gifts from our Valentines Love swap that I wrote about in * this post *Oh My !!! What treasures !!  I shall share those in my next post as I feel this one is already long enough.Thank You all So Very Much for your visits today,My posts & my visits to your blogs may be a bit erratic for awhile,Take care of yourselves dear friends - sending love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Carrots,  Fireplaces  &  Contrary Cats ", "date": "Sunday, March 20, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersIt has been another busy week but Oh I am loving these March Autumn days with the chilly mornings & evenings ... I just adore them 💖I came across this Carrot Treat Bag tutorial free on the Internet & thought what a wonderful idea they would be to make for my Grandchildren & pop a few Easter goodies in.  I was able to get 3 made up using orange & green fabrics already in my stash & thought they looked wonderful with the Easter tags I made in my last post. The only thing I needed to buy - besides the choccy - was 1 metre each of green & orange ribbon. (The Bunnie tag is to pop away for a rabbit I hope to sew one day)Then yesterday an Order arrived in the post from Love from Seventeen.  I often buy their seasonal tags to attach to gifts so the wee rabbits will be perfect tied around my Carrot treat bags. We have had Tradesmen here most days this past week as we had our old fireplace removed & a new one fitted.  This is what the cavity looked like once the old one was removed - I did paint around the edges before the new                                                                       one went in.While I was doing this I observed all the colours the fireplace had been.  When we first moved in 20 + years ago I had thought it was a muddy cream colour but looking at this now I see it was more a dirty pink.  I remember when everyone had gone to bed late one night I found a tin of British Racing Green paint in The Mr's shed & painted it green.  I could not get the pink colour clean no matter now much I scrubbed it.  Then it was a dark burgundy for awhile before I lightened it in this Post * here *It is a process now to change a fireplace.  Once the old one is removed you cannot fit the new one until a Building Inspector has checked the cavity first.  Here is Blackie checking out the new firebox & telling me there is no need to send a Building Inspector out - he can do just as good a job at checking everything 😉!!Here is our lovely new firebox.  We have a fan fitted in the bottom grill so this had to be wired in by an Electrician. Tomorrow at 8 am the Slate man is coming as the Hearth needs to be an inch wider to get our building consent.  As you can imagine Miss Pip is beside herself with all these Tradies here every single day & not impressed at all !!I went to pick up a presciption last week & noticed a new Op Shop in the old Bank building - an SPCA one.  So I went for a look & a purchase as it would be incredibly rude of me not to support them 😉I came away with the plant stand for $10 - the lovely vintage fabric above left was $2 & $3, & the plaster cherubs were $4 each.  While the men were fitting the fireplace & I was keeping out of their way, I painted the plant stand with 2 coats of chalk paint - Antique White.  I will show you in my next post what I have used it for.Some self seeded tomatoes have gone wild in my veggie garden & this is what I am picking every 2nd day.  The cherry ones are especially sweet & delicious. I took Sid to our little local Park last Tuesday & he wanted me to take a photo of the clouds - they were so fluffy & wonderful that day & the sky was Oh so blue 💙Whilst I was still keeping-out-of-tradies-way I made up another batch of miracle spray. You can find the recipe * here *  This is all I use for my cleaning - it is wonderful & a batch lasts me a very long time.Lastly dear friends -  I had left my (undies!!) drawer open while rushing out the door to an early appointment.  Upon arriving home I found a certain ginger being curled up sound asleep in it.  I posted this photo on Instagram & it got so many lovely comments.  The next day I was contacted by a PetModels Inc. Company telling me they were interested in pets like this & would I be willing to work with them??And Yes there were ginger hairs all through my \"smalls\" 😐Thank You Very much but No Thank You!!  This little ginger friend is already HIGH MAINTENANCE ENOUGH without the thought of modelling going to her tiny fluffy head!!  And she is so contrary I could imagine the whole thing being a complete nightmare!!   So not a word has been mentioned to her about it 😉Thank You So Very Much for your visits here today dear friends,I hope the coming week treats you well - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Craft Group Get-togethers, a Mirror, & a Potty (!!)", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWhen a New Year rolls around our small Craft Group usually get together & have an informal meeting to work out a rough programme for the year ... things we would like to create/learn/try etc ...After my visit to The Tree Church in * this post * I thought the ladies might like to get together Here for our first meeting & to work out our programme.  Due to various other commitments this didn't happen until late February but it was a beautiful summery day when we went.Just look at that beautiful Blue Sky !!!I had made a slice & some gingernut balls & Gail had made sausage rolls - everyone bought their own thermos flask & we sat in the shade & had our morning tea & wrote down some ideas for various activities throughout the coming year.There are usually 7 of us but only 6 could make it that dayWe also went for a big long leisurely walk around the Tree Church & Gardens.I could quite easily fill my post with so many photos - it is honestly such a stunning place to visit.  It closes soon for the winter months & then re-opens again in the spring time.Whenever I go down to Mum's I buy packets of these wooden cut-outs from a Variety Store in her small town.  I had put together some Easter themed tags by mod-podging paper serviettes on to them & thought the ladies might like to have a go at this at our next meeting.  Also the ladies each had to bring a painted bottle or jar so we could decorate these with mod-podged serviettes.  We all met at my home last Monday - it was such a fun activity & everyone had some tags & a decorated bottle to take home with them.We had a delicious lunch together & as always, there was an abundance of good home-made food.  The finished bottles all decorated top right.     I forgot to get a pic of everyone's tags at the end.Another Hospice store find on my last trip to Mum's was this $5 mirror.  The entire mirror panel from the centre was missing & it was all rather sad looking ... however I could see it definately \"had potential\" 😉It cost $17 to have a new mirror panel put in the centre which I thought was really reasonable considering they also had to put a piece of board in to attach the mirror to.  I noticed some gaps in the corner joins so I filled these with Polyfilla.  It was a simple job because I had \"good help\" on hand to assist me & ensure I didn't miss any bits 😉Then I set about painting the mirror with two coats of Soft Duck Egg Chalk Paint.  Once I was happy with the coverage I lightly distressed the whole piece & then Very lightly rubbed some silver embossing wax over the decorative edges of the frames.I had thought the hinges looked like brass so I was able to bring a bit of shine back to them with some Brasso ... also the tiny ball feet were brass.  I am So pleased I didn't paint over these but took the time to mask them out first.I just love my new/old mirror & it fits perfectly in the corner of my dining room with a set of fairy lights wound around it.  My dining room can be dark at times & I find the addition of mirrors helps to throw some light into darker corners.I follow Kim at Rosebud Collectables over on Instagram & she posts some real treasures for sale but I always seem to miss out on them.  When I saw this vintage chamber pot I quickly messaged to ask if I may purchase it & was lucky enough to be the first.  It arrived last week & when I opened the box it was bigger, heavier & more beautiful than I had imagined.  I have displayed it with a maidenhair fern for now but I am thinking that some Easter bunnies in a small group inside it would be rather lovely for Easter ...............I just adore the flowers on it ... & the colours.  💗 Way, way too nice for it's original purpose !!Thank You all So Very Much for your visits here today dear friends,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship To You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I did find some treasures at the op-shop 😊 I love the Hospice Shop in Stratford - its clean & well laid out & very reasonable prices.  This unusual metal urn was from the Hospice Shop in Hawera - $5 ... I plan to do something with it but just not quite sure what as yet.This book/letter rack was a $2.50 purchase back in * this post * at Christmas time - once again from the Stratford Hospice Shop.  My friend Sally had gifted me these 2 beautiful books, one for my Birthday, one for Christmas.  I decided to revamp the book rack to display my books in so I gave it two coats of Chalk paint, Pale Duck Egg.  I had to sand the folk art flowers off the front first as their outline kept appearing through my paint.Some offcuts of Re-design transfers in keeping with the bee/butterfly theme, just completed the rack & the books look perfect sitting in it on display. I wondered why the tiny succulent cuttings I had planted in this old watering ram in my garden were not doing especially well. I think they have been somewhat flattened by a certain four-legged creature who weighs a tonne !!Sid is currently obsessed with all things Pokemon related.  Last week I looked up the names he told me on good-old-google & we found images & printed them off ... he spent happy hours cutting them all out & I learnt new names I had never even heard of !!! 😉Thank You So Very Much for stopping by today dear friends,I shall be back in a couple of days with a follow-up post,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I like to change this out with the seasons but had done nothing on it since clearing away my Christmas decor.  I decided to try & recreate the heart/basket picture. I knew I had this old chicken wire basket in my sleepout so I dug it out & gave it a wash.  These quilted pillow shams were an Op-shop purchase that I had initially planned to cut up but were in such perfect condition I didn't have the heart to.  I folded & stacked them in my wire basket.Using some oddments of fabrics & vintage laces I sewed & stuffed two hearts & added some mother-of-pearl button embellishments.  I really loved the effect of these sitting in the wire basket.My friend Joyce had gifted me this heavy cotton lace tablecloth for Christmas - Joyce works in the Church Op-shop so no doubt came across it in there. I loved it & once again, it was immaculate.  I arranged a vignette on my table just using up bits from around my Home & some thrifted finds ... candles, old books, vintage china - all my faves.Another thing I like to collect is Vintage Bibles, Prayer & Hymn Books  ... seen above on my book rack.  I mostly come across these in second hand bookstores & even have one written in Croatian.I felt so happy when my coffee table vignette was finished & the wire basket just set it off nicely - & I felt pleased that I had used treasures from around my Home.    I sit beside this coffee table each night on the couch, & do my knitting or my stitchery work & watch TV. You know dear readers - I had thought that by covering the vintage lace tablecloth with Lots of display items there would Not be room for any furry four-legged creatures to park their ample proportions on !!! It would appear I was Wrong !!!!  Here is Madam Pip the other night watching the lovely Sherry Iris's Stitchy Podcast on YouTube  ......   & as if that wasn't enough, The Mr sent me this photo below while I was down at Mum's to tell me \"everything is under control here\"  !!! 😖Seriously dear friends ... goodness knows how I managed to raise two sons into quite decent adults when I can't even get two cats to do as I want them to  !!! 😟I used the dried Rose Petals in my Potpourri'sWe are getting good light rain as I type this & I am so thankful.  This morning I picked all the roses that were about to drop their petals as this is a good time for drying them.  I spread them on cane trays in my Sleepout to dry.I also picked a bunch of mixed dahlias to enjoy inside.The Mr has gone to Auckland today on farm business so I made a banana cake this morning as I had banana's going brown.  I only ever ice half the cake as The Mr doesn't like icing & always picks it off.And I cooked myself my Most Favorite Lunch Ever - poached eggs fresh from the neighbors chooks, on toast with cherry tomatoes & basil straight from my garden.  I saw this funny on Instagram & thought it was perfect ... I am off to clean up the Craftermath that is currently in my Sewing Room !!!Thanks so very much for your visits here today dear friends,With Much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the naughty furry Ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Away (Again)   ...............    & Back Again", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI see I have some new followers to my blog ...... A Very Warm Welcome to you All !! I have had to do another trip down to my Mum's this past week so I have missed catching up on your posts. But before I went away to Mum's Alec asked if he could come & stay again before the school year resumes.I took both my grandsons, Alec & Sid to The Space Centre which is just up the road from me & although I have driven past it a thousand times, I'd never been inside.  The boys loved it - especially Alec who is a bit older & very in to astronautical things.Alec wanted to craft again so out came all the sparkly bits & bobs from my craft drawers.  He wanted to make A Christmas Tree this time so I cut a shape out from felt & he was happy just to work out his placement & glue things on ... no sewing required 😉(I also have lots of apple cucumbers which I forgot to include in the photograph)I have an abundance of courgettes, cucumbers & green peppers in my veggie garden at present so I picked alot to take to Mums & give to other friends also. As I planned to call on my dear friend Carolyn en-route, I baked a Chocolate Fudge slice & a batch of Gingernut Bites - gave half to her & took the other half to Mum's.Remember the old aluminium pots I revamped in my last Post ... well here is the smaller one which I wanted to gift to my friend Carolyn.  She loves Yellow so I painted it the same Pumice Chalk Paint as the larger one & then added a Sunflower 🌻 Iron Orchid Transfer to it.I purchased a lovely sunny looking Calla lily that sat perfectly in the pot. I've left it up to Carolyn whether she plants it or uses the pot for something else.My brother had organised for Mums kitchen, dining & lounge ceilings to be plastered & painted while I was down there.  \"You can take Mum out while the tradesmen are here\" he told me.  I thought this would be simple enough but what I hadn't  envisioned was that I would be the one to empty the rooms, take Mum out, & then put everything back again once finished, whilst also cleaning Every Single Thing.   I felt like I had run a marathon when I finally got home again.On the 2nd day we had 4 hours to fill in so I took Mum up to the Garden of Remembrance at the Crematorium where my Dad's ashes are buried.  We took silk flowers & managed to find the plaque we had put there several years ago along with other silk flowers from previous visits.  Mum always feels better when she has visited Dad she says.On the way back I stopped in 2 Op-Shops in Stratford.  I found the treasures above at the Salvation Army Op-Shop.  The silk framed pictures were dirty & covered in fly spots but I was able to gentle wash them & dry in the sunshine.  At $2 for the pair I could not leave them behind ... Yes one is very faded but I still love it & have hung them on my bedroom wall.At the Hospice I found the two trays above right - $6 & $4 respectively.  I hope to paint/revamp them both.  My daughter in law's Mum Julie, is turning 60 & I wanted to make her something to gift.  I stitched another of the Books & Roses bookmarks that Jenny of elefantz designs is so generously sharing with us this year.As I don't really know Julie's colors I made this one to match the book that I had purchased for her in the Boxing Day sales. Stitchery worked in Cottage Garden Threads \"Running Postman\"I used a scrap of Tilda floral from the Old Rose Collection & then I added a soft blue velvet ribbon to the top as I had no tassels left in my stash.Jenny has released a new bookmark pattern while I was away ...  go * Here * to access it - it is beautiful & is next-on-my-list-to-stitch 😉😊Thank You all so very much for your visits here today,I hope the week ahead is filled with many happy moments dear friends,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Op-Shop Treasures", "date": "Tuesday, January 25, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThe weeks go by so quickly & here we are in the final week of January already!I want to teach my grandsons the value & the JOY of op-shopping & buying second hand.I took Sid along to St John's Op Shop last week as we had a couple of bags to drop off & - as luck would have it - they had a large collection of dinosaurs that had been donated.Sid & I chose all the above figurines & Jeep for the sum total of $35.00.(including Dragon book further below) When you push the orange button on the top of the Jeep the cage doors open & a dinosaur pops out & growls. This was priced at $4.50 ... I let Sid take this one home with him as well as 2 dinosaur figurines that he chose.  (the other figurines I kept here for both Sid & Alec to play with when they come)Sid's Mum pointed out to me that this crocodile was a Schleich brand.  A quick google search of this same toy & it showed a new price tag of $25.00 ... I paid $3.50 for this one. This beautiful Dragonology book was in nearly-new condition - I paid $5 for it & found it on Book Depository for $62.00 !!  I have put this book away to gift to one of my grandsons when they are a bit older.  Whilst at the Op-Shop I found the aluminium pots above for $4 & $6 respectively.  I had an idea for both of them ... I will share the larger pot today but the smaller one has not yet gone to its recipient so I will share that in another post.I painted it with two coats of chalk paint in the colour Pumice - then applied the remnants of an Iron Orchid designs transfer to the base & the lid.  Then I gave it 2 coats of Annie Sloan clear wax.I purchased this beautiful pink Begonia on special at my local Mitre 10 & it fit perfectly in the pot.  The friend I am giving it to just loves anything Pink 💗  I decided I am not going to plant it as she may choose to use the pot for something else.My friend Gail is having a birthday at the end of this month.  She is really tricky to buy for now as she more or less has everything she wants or needs.  I bought this book awhile ago for her & decided to make her one of the beautiful free bookmarks that Jenny of elefantz designs is so generously sharing throughout this year.I stitched it on a scrap of pale blue linen (using Cottage Garden thread \"Blue Wren\") ... & instead of \"2022\" I stitched Gail's name.  I embellished it with some lace scraps & a piece of treasured Tilda Fabric from the Windy Days collection.The cotton dish/washcloth knitting continues - I like to knit these at nights when I am tired or perhaps when Sid is watching his Dinosaur programmes on YouTube & sitting still for half an hour ... I like to have something to pick up.  * Here * is the free pattern I like to use - knitted on the diagonal - easy peasy.Yesterday I made myself a new Ironing Board Cover.  Long time readers of my blog will know this is something I like to do as each new year rolls around.  I had 60cms of this lovely Cath Kidston fabric purchased from Mystyle which fit perfectly.  I always just take the old cover off, lay it on my new fabric & cut around it, then overlock the edges, sew a casing & thread a new piece of elastic through it.  It probably takes me half an hour tops.  I even gave my Iron a clean 😉Thank you as always for your visits here today dear friendsI first tried to do this blog post on Sunday Evening but you can see by the photo above, how much progress I made on that !!!  😐Sending much love & friendship to You All,Love Julie & the furry nuisances ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Church Made Of Trees", "date": "Sunday, January 16, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLast Sunday my dear friend Sue & I went to Church together - we went to The Tree Church a stunning venue about half an hour from here.  Sue had visited once before but I had never been.   Oh dear friends - it was  Amazing !!I took about 50 photos in total so I have tried to pick out the best just to give you some idea of this beautiful property.  Believe me dear readers - my photos do Not do it justice.The approach to the church top left & inside - the altar.Taken from inside the church looking outwards ... you can see the Iron windows top right.Although the Tree Church acquired new owners about 18 months ago, it was the realisation of one man's dream - who had the vision to build a church frame from iron & then grow & train trees over the entire shape of it. The entire property covers 3 hectares & is planted out in the most amazing garden - I just loved all the structure from the different trees that were planted.  If you click * here * it gives a bit more background about the history of the Tree Church & if you scroll to the bottom of the page there is a beautiful soothing Video to watch showing the Church & Gardens.I adored the trees in the avenue above left - their trunks looked & felt like paper bark.Sue said these clipped trees above left reminded her of Dr Seuss trees.There was an area of flower gardens planted in a cottage garden style as well as a large veggie garden area. It was all immaculate.Tall sunflowers that reached way up above our heads.Sue managed a photo of us both inside the Church - I am inclined to chop heads off when I try to take selfies 😉We spent a good couple of hours there & then we drove over to Cambridge & went to The Podium Cafe where we enjoyed a delicious lunch while chatting & watching the boats & water ski's on Lake Karapiro.  It was such a wonderful days Outing 😊These are lightweight aluminium horseshoes worn by Race Horses that I cover.I managed to complete two Orders this past week ... the first was for my friend Jan, who asked me to make a white horseshoe & if possible, to put a gold \"50\" on it as it was to be presented at a 50th wedding anniversary.The 2nd Order was for 20 Mothball Sachets for my friend Marie who had an infestation of moths in her Merino Jumpers. Luckily I had all the dried herbs on hand to make these up & only had to purchase the whole cloves.As school is on holiday here 'til February, Alec came to stay a couple of days.  His first request was \"can we craft\". I cut out a large fabric heart shape & set him to work embellishing it.  Alec loves anything shiny & gold so he was in his element.  He quickly decided he did not wish to learn to sew the things on as yet so we relied on craft glue & the hot glue gun. We had a visit to the Park & then the Berry farm to pick raspberries & of course, a berry icecream each 😊The next day he enjoyed the play dough ... I had a couple of new colours & lots of shape cutters as I had been gifted some new cutters for Christmas.  I have been trying to blog for at least 3 days now with no success - I thought I would show you this next photo so you might realise how very difficult it is to actually get computer time around here 😉Thank you as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Happy New Year Everyone", "date": "Wednesday, January 5, 2022", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersHappy Shiny New Year to you All ...  & Welcome to 2022 💙I've felt so shattered since my return from Mum's - I've had to have Nana Naps each day & certainly slept through the New Years entrance.   The Mr pointed out to me yesterday that it was an incredibly busy lead up to Christmas & now that it is over with, sometimes you just have to rest & re-group.Each Christmas I usually include a Lego set for the toy content of my Grandsons Stockings. This year Alec's parents informed me that he no longer played with his Lego - but what he was Very Into was Gemstones.Luckily I was able to go online & buy Gemstones from a variety of sellers, but when they arrived they just looked like a bunch of coloured stones.   I found some voile bags & printed out labels for each set of rocks, then found this pale grey box & was able to make a label for this from some wooden cutouts I found in my craft drawer.I love this photo above left - you can see the joy on Alec's face when he opens his Gemstone box & in the next pic he is busy yelling \"Sid - look at my Gemstones!!\" ... however Sid has just opened his new Lego pack & could not care less about any old Gemstones 😊  ... Just precious memories. We had a lovely early Christmas celebration on Sunday 19th & I fed them all a traditional Roast Turkey Lunch.Youngest Grandson Sid with their dog Darcy                           It's hard to believe this wee rascal turns 5 this coming year & will be off to school.   The next day - Monday  - my dear friend Sandy had invited 3 girlfriends to her home for a Christmas Morning Tea. It was so lovely to catch up again as I had not seen one of the girls (Pam) for well over a year.  Sandy is always a wonderful Hostess & she presented us with a delicious morning tea & we were still sat chatting & laughing well after lunchtime !From left to right,  Bev, Pam, Sandy & myself 😊  ....   the food was simply delicious !!Everything Sandy does is to exquisite taste & her home was so beautifully decorated for the festive season.  I couldn't resist snapping a few photos.Later that same day The Mr & I travelled over to the City to pay a Christmas visit to Juno & her parents (they were travelling South for Christmas this year). We gave her the table & chair that I revamped in * this post * along with other gifts ... & I took some home-baked treats so we could enjoy a Christmas supper together.Juno was quite taken with her table & chair & I was delighted when her Mummy told me one of her absolute favorite things is Rabbits.The next day was my Tuesday-with-Sid,  then on the Wednesday I got up very early & set off on the 4-hour drive down to Mum's.  I always stop at Stratford for a takeaway coffee & can never resist a quick look in their local Hospice Shop.  I came away with the above items as the books were all $1 each, & I purchased the china because - of course - I needed more vintage china like I need a hole in my head !!😉I love these photos above - Alec was quite taken with Mum & very affectionateThe Thursday was spent doing errands & tasks for Mum as well as a huge grocery shop.  On Friday I prepared a big finger-food luncheon as we had visitors - eldest son & his family were en-route to Palmerston North & also Mum's younger brother had travelled over to join us for Christmas.Mums younger brother Rol - top left  ......   Aaron, Sarah, Mum & Alec top right.The obligatory Family Photos.Christmas Day itself passed in a complete blur & I forgot to take any photos. But I cooked another Roast Turkey Lunch for Mum, my Uncle & my brother & his wife.  Very early the next morning I left to return home again, trying to avoid the usual Boxing Day traffic.I received some lovely books for Christmas - the Joy of Gardening book I purchased for myself from The Mr.  He also gave me a leaf blower which I was most excited about as I love power tools (yes I am strange like that !!) The other books were gifts from my friend Sally.I returned home to lovely decorations posted from friends across the ditch (Australia).  The candle on the right was gifted from my Stepson & the fragrance is Christmas Lights - pomegranate & fig - just light & pleasant.Well dear friends - our weather here is scorching & we are in the midst of a heatwave.  Some rain is forecast tomorrow but I won't hold my breath.  I turn the air-con on in the afternoons & these two usually retreat to our bedroom which is nice & cool with the blinds down.Wishing you all the most wonderful New Year,Thank you as always - for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A December Recap", "date": "Thursday, December 30, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWell another Christmas is behind us & tomorrow evening we roll on in to a shiny New Year.I thought I would do a bit of a recap on some projects I completed in December but did not get to post about prior to Christmas. In no particular order here either  😉 . . . . .While searching the internet for a Primitive Santa pattern I stumbled across these beautiful patterns from                    Kentucky Primitives & fell in love with this one -  \"Mousie's Christmas Letter to Santa\"The pattern comes as an instant download & included is the Letter that Mousie wrote to Santa, which you then have to coffee stain & generally \"muddy up\".Click on the photo so you can enlarge & read the LetterThe letter is so sweet - you can read it top right.Unfortunately my Mousie Brown turned out to be more of a \"Ratty Rat\" as I added too much black to my light brown paint.  Once dry, you sandpaper him & then rub with cinnamon so, as you can imagine - he smells great!!I gave him a jute string tail & a woollen checked scarf.  His pencil is made from a twig & the end sharpened, with a dab of black paint added.I got these large books for free from my local 2nd hand Bookstore in Kihikihi, so I painted & distressed them for Mousie to stand on ... a little primitive vignette.I packaged up & posted off a large order of my Citrus & Rose petal potpourri to the bottom of the South Island.I made two Lavender & Lace covered coat hangers for my friend Bev.I made a Lavender sleep pillow to gift to one of my daughter in laws, along with a jar of Sleep Balm purchased from The Herb FarmYou may recall the swap I mentioned in * this post * where I made the 8 felt mice to send to my swap partners.  A gorgeous array of Christmas Ornaments & gifts began to trickle through my mailbox.  We were allowed to create, thrift or purchase a Christmas related ornament & the girls came up with such a wide variety of goodies. From the far north to the deep south, lovely packages came in & brightened my days. The girls each agreed that we all got far more out of this swap than we ever anticipated & it was so special to open each of the swap gifts & think about the giver, most (6) of whom I have never even met.This year I made Gingernut Bites, Fudge Cake & Mars Bar SliceI made my usual Christmas baked treats & packaged them up in cellophane & brown paper bags ready for gifting to friends.In early December I invited 3 girlfriends for a Christmas Morning Tea. I polished my Oak dining table & set it nicely with my vintage crochet table cloth & my finest bone china.  I went to answer the phone & when I returned I had     \"an extra guest\" sitting at (on !!) the table (!!!) 😑( Stitched using Cottage Garden Thread \"Mistletoe\" )I finished these two Stitcheries during Lockdown & finally made them up into small plump cushions using some Liberty fabrics.  The patterns are a Natalie Bird Design from this Christmas book * here *...... I can show them now that they have been gifted.I came across this Stitchery on calico that I had started many years ago.  I used to make these Oval Christmas Santa bags & sell in my Craft Cottage, but had never made one for myself.  This is a very old pattern by Wendy Briggs of Country Friends Designs whom I am sure is no longer creating.I finished stitching the Santa & then made him up into this cute Christmas bag ... I had planned to fill it with greenery & berries but this might have to wait until next Christmas now. 😉Well dear friends - this is my wish for you all as we wave Goodbye to another Year & we welcome with anticipation a New One.Thank You all so much for taking the time to visit with me here ... I appreciate each & every one of you. 💕Wishing you a wonderful celebratory weekend ... mine will be spent with a good book, a glass of vino & a couple of furry friends,With VeRy Much Love & Friendship To You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Hang on a minute & I'll pass you one through the screen 😉😊🍷I have a Galley style kitchen that you walk into directly off the deck & then into my dining room.  A couple of shelves in my kitchen above - just small festive bits tucked into them.The bench to the right of my stove area.Beside my dining table I have a vintage Singer Sewing Table which I change the displays on throughout the year. This is my Christmas display (which I think I showed last post)Our dining room is L-shaped & has the fireplace in, as it was originally the lounge.  This small round table above holds my knitted ornaments tree & some other bits. I purchased the Poinsettia yesterday for $5.The table in the corner (above) holds some handmade items & then below is the fireplace hearth & mantle. (If you click on the pics you can enlarge them & see clearer)The mantle is not especially wide so I am limited to what I can display on it.A small display of bottlebrush trees on my china dresser.  (I am totally in love with bottlebrush trees lately!!)Now we walk through into my Lounge room ......A display on my vintage typewriter & then the Tilda Reindeer I made last year hanging above this.My American Oak Spindle Leg table with some handmade Santa's on - & the antique wooden trolley cart filled with teddies beside this.The old fireplace mantle which I installed * here * - both in the day & at night.Vintage Metal highchair & handmade Mohair BearI like to create little vignettes, which I say are for the grandchildren but truthfully I think are for the grown-up-child that lives here (Yours truly !!) 😉I had planned to pack away the Tilda Princess-&-the-Pea cot which I made in * this post *.  However I decided to leave her out & give her some Christmas embellishing.I wrapped some empty boxes with pink paper & sewed her a simple Santa hat (pink of course) from a scrap of pink felt. 💗I hung my gorgeous pink stockings from my Gothic Mirror 💕This Tilda Father Christmas was made earlier this year & was my first attempt Ever at Needleturn applique.  I have hung him on my quilt ladder.Another little pink vignette using up bits I already had .....          The tree stands just behind my couch rather than in a corner so it is decorated all the way around.Under the tree is my vintage metal trolley filled with (empty) wrapped boxes & (some of) my vintage teddy collection.Beside the tree I have a squishy armchair & a round oak table - both Christmas decorated 🎄Beside my TV is another small table - this time a primitive vignette.  I will write about Mousie Brown in my next post - he is a new pattern.  The music bunting was made just yesterday from some scraps of vintage sheet music I found.The top of our vintage radiogram - I like to put little Santa hats on my teddies at Christmas.     I haven't included my coffee table display (similar to last years) & a couple of other tables because I think you might all have a crink in your necks by now.Thank You So Very Much for staying with me through this long drawn out post.    This will be my last post before Christmas - we are having our family Christmas this Sunday & then I am heading down to Mum's mid week to spend Christmas with her.    I would like to take this opportunity to Wish You All a peaceful & blessed Festive Season - may you all enjoy the spirit of Christmas.  I appreciate each & every single one of you that takes the time to visit me here & read my ramblings.

{"title": "Christmas Festivities", "date": "Monday, December 6, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersIt feels like December came around really fast!Last weekend I sat on the floor & wrapped 48 tiny parcels in red tissue paper ....  I was filling my grandsons advent stockings again, even though it only feels like yesterday I was filling them for last December.On Wednesday the 1st December I hand delivered them & both boys got to open their first one.  I picked Alec up from school which he was very excited about.  Also he had forgotten it was December 1st so his advent calendar was a real surprise.Last December I made myself this Advent Angel just prior to Christmas & only got to enjoy her for 7 days before \"the big day\" arrived.So I was delighted to pull her out this year & get to enjoy her for the full lead up. Each day I change the swing tag on her dress.Go to this older Post if you want to read the details about her.Early in December our small craft group usually go out to lunch as our little \"break up\" for the year.  This year we decided to go across to Tirau, about an hour away.Last year a couple of the ladies handed out bags of baked treats at our lunch so this year I decided to do something with the multitude of cotton dishcloths that I continually knitted during our Lockdowns, to help keep myself sane.  I frequently buy soaps from this lovely little craft shop out at Pirongia & store in my gift box.  I added a soap to each dishcloth & wrapped it up nicely in cellophane with a Christmas swing tag tied to it. I did up 7 packages & popped them in my vintage cane basket so the ladies could each choose their own.The Craft ladies were all just delighted with their little surprise gifts 💙Speaking of dishcloth cotton, I purchased these two new lovely colourways from Spotlight last week when I went across to visit Alec.  You can see from the photo that a certain ginger 4-legged furry creature took a liking to the bottom one while I turned my back for barely 2 minutes !! 😖We had a lovely outing to Tirau for our lunch & I purchased a couple of Christmas gifts for hard-to-buy-for people.  I usually buy a couple of new Christmas decorations each year & these above were my purchases from Tirau as they had 25 % off all Christmas stock. I belong to a small private group on Instagram of 8 ladies & this year we all agreed to take part in a Christmas Ornament swap.  The ornament could be handmade, shop bought, or thrifted.  I decided to make the girls these felt mice in stockings, a free pattern off the internet (which I can no longer find) & I began stitching mine back in early November as I knew they were labour-intensive & fiddly.Once finished I thought they looked a bit tiny so I decided to add a box of my citrus potpourri to each parcel as I was sure the girls in the group would love this.  I purchased these Kraft favour boxes online from * Here * & just love how attractive my potpourri looked all packaged up in them.Recently I called in to see my friend Gail at the Op Shop where she volunteers - she was just about to toss this broken section of Christmas Tree in the skip.  Being the \"Steptoe\" that I am, I asked her if I might please have it.  I chopped it up with The Mr's wire cutters & the greenery has come in so handy this year for both decorating And gift wrapping. Madam Butterfly (aka Pippi) was off colour for a few days last week -  She gets like this from time to time.  I came home from Tirau to find The Mr had tucked her up sound asleep - I am rather thinking she might put this on for all the fuss & attention she gets 😉Thank You all for your ever-welcome visits here today dear friends,I hope the coming week is good & kind to you,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "This Past Week I  .............................", "date": "Saturday, November 27, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers  It was another busy week here at Threadbear HQ 💗This past week I received some wonderful surprise mail, all the way from the U.K. Sid was most taken with the card of the Owl, the Pussycat & the pea green boat !!Pam - a longtime reader of my blog, wanted to send me something to say Thank You for my blog & all the links & tutorials that I share with you all out here in blogland, so she stitched me this absolutely beautiful Needlebook & filled it with goodies before sending it across the oceans & the miles to me here at the bottom of the world.  The front (left pic) & even the back (right pic) had a gorgeous design stitched on itPam's work is just exquisite & I know this will be treasured as well as Very Well Used.Thank You So Much Pam for your kindness & generosity. 💕This past week I was able to meet up with my Craft Group ladies again - we are allowed to have small gatherings indoors now, so we all met up at Maureen's home last Monday.This is what the table looked like as we all worked on beaded Christmas trees that Gail & Maureen had stitched onto fabric for us ready to embellish.  All we had to bring along was a selection of charms, beads & any broken jewellery bits.  None of us finished our trees (there was lots of chatting & catching up) but I have clicked a few pics of our works-in-progress.I just loved the top left hand pic of the doiley tree Maureen had made & would love to make one similar.Joyce's one (top left) was almost finished - Sharlaine's is the green one.I think these two were Sally & Liz's ... I will show more pics when the girls (& myself) complete them. Some of us are going to frame ours & some will make into wallhangings.This past week I had a haircut which delighted me immensely 😊  Also I took all the vintage china off my dining room dresser & gently washed it all after a winter of fires & dust.  I decided to take the beautiful birthday quilt my dear friend Leeanne made me, off my bed for the summer so I found a way to drape it over my dresser & thought it looked lovely with the china all around it.When I was happy with the arrangement of all my china I added just a couple of simple Christmas touches to the dresser.This past week I dug out this Christmas Pattern that I purchased (about 4 Christmas's ago) from Grandmothers GardenThe Pattern is called Christmas Bowl Fillers & comes complete with a pre-printed panel from Bonnie Sullivan of All Through The Night designs.  You applique the preprinted designs with wool felt - I had fun sorting through my scraps of wool felt & Miss Pip very graciously approved my choices for me 😉Once the handwork was done I quickly sewed & stuffed them into tight little cushions & then I added some feathery wool to the outer edges to give it a fluffy Christmas look.  I also stitched some tiny charms to several of the cushions.I have had this tiered tray for ages but never ever used it so I really enjoyed doing a Christmas display in it using my new cushions/bowl fillers.These 6 wool felt decorations were handstitched by me way back in early January in this post * here * - this was an Op Shop kitset purchased for $5.  It is lovely to be able to add them to my Christmas displays this year.You might remember on my last trip to Mum's in early October I purchased these 2 china tureens ($6 & $4) from the SPCA shop.  You can read about them * here *  They were both minus their lids but I had thought I would like to fill the larger one with my citrus potpourri & make up a candle in the smaller size one.Yesterday I did just that & I am so pleased with how they both turned out - the candle fragrance is Christmas Time, which I thought was perfect & the potpourri smells of delicious orange/clove scents.The Mr is away riding Moto X this weekend so I am hoping to finish all my Christmas decorating.  I am usually always a not-before-1st-December kind of girl but this year I am trying to be more organised & it has felt like it's bringing a little Joy to things.  I have been thoroughly enjoying watching \"Christmas House Tour\" YouTube videos & I may do a little pictorial House Tour when I am finished so long as I don't bore you senseless 😉Wishing you all a wonderful rest of the weekend dear friends,Thank You - as always - for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Dinosaurs .......... & Some Christmas Touches  🎄💝", "date": "Friday, November 19, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersAlthough the past two days have been sunny, the week prior was wet & windy & wild.  Though I am always thankful for any rain at this time of year as it gives the garden such a good drink, the winds were just dreadful.A vase of spring roses picked before the winds bashed them 💕On the wettest days these two took up residence on my couch - I was quick enough to toss a cotton sheet over my good quilt & cushions.  As you can see one has the entire length of the couch & one gets to curl up in the little space left over 😉I had purchased this gorgeous Dinosaur fabric from my local Patchwork Shop just prior to Lockdown. I wanted to make each of my Grandsons a pillowcase for Christmas.  I used this simple tutorial * Here *  which I find fast & effective to make up.The top left hand photo shows the back of the T-Rex one. This was a cot panel that I cut down to pillowcase size. I made Sid a Triceratops Crown & we both coloured it in - he loved it & wore it for two days running before asking me to cut it down for his toy Tiger.  I bury dinosaurs in the sandpit & then he uncovers them using my paint brushes & tells me about the fossils he unearths. After he went home on Monday I decided to put my Christmas Tree up & add the lights.  I thought it would fill in several hours the following day while we decorated it together.Let me tell you friends ... that boy is a trooper.  He had far more stamina & staying power than his Granny did. I wanted to stop after about half an hour & have a cuppa but he kept on going until every single last decoration was on the tree & believe me ... there are alot !!And he didn't just put them all down at low height either - he climbed on the little stool & spread them around at all different levels.  He did a wonderful job & I was most impressed but most importantly - he loved it !!And I might add ... we did not even get the felt tree skirt around the tree before Madam Pip came along, curled up on it & promptly went to sleep!!On my last trip to Mum's I purchased these wooden discs in her local Variety store - $2 for a bag of 10.  I had some Christmas paper serviettes left over from last year so I mod-podged some on to the wooden discs & made lovely tags to tie onto packages for Christmas.  This was such a fun & simple task that I thoroughly enjoyed.I must be honest & say that the next task was definitely Not fun & enjoyable.    I have loved these shabby twig trees for a long time - they are a free tutorial on Kerryanne's blog.    I just found it so incredibly fiddly & ended up having to spray starch/iron my fabric strips to stop them from all turning towards the back.   I had no cream coloured bells so I painted a rusty bell & I won't go in to detail about how time consuming that task was suffice to say I won't be making anymore of these. 😉I made a felt matchbox mouse to gift to a friend.   (This used to be a free downloadable pattern but I can no longer find the link to it.  If anyone should want to make one then email me & I can send you my pattern.) I have long admired these teeny tiny stockings that are all over Instagram & finally got around to making myself a set.  I stuffed mine with wadding & then added greenery & pip berries to the tops. These are just pegged on to my Christmas ribbon with tiny pegs from the $2 Shop.  I made mine up using some primitive duller coloured fabrics but I would rather like to make myself a pink set too 💗Thank You so much for your ever-welcome visits here today dear friends,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Under My House ............", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersGosh here it is the 11th already ... over a week gone by so fast !When we extended the deck around 3/4's of our house we hung a large swinging door at one end so that we could access the cavity underneath at any time.  It's a good place to store old garden pots, bamboo stakes & other garden-related paraphernalia.  I crawled under there last week as I wanted a pot for a maidenhair fern.  It's not pleasant under there - its dark & full of cobwebs but I did find some hidden junk treasure. This chipped ceramic pot was the perfect size for my fern so I gave it 2 coats of Chalk Paint in the colour Grey Mist.  Before it dried I picked any black cat hairs out of it 😉I finished it off with this Re-design transfer & a couple of coats of clear wax.  Now we have the birds, the bees & the butterflies 😊Once we finish with fires for the year I give the firebox a good clean out & fill with pinecones. I polish the hearth & surrounding bricks & I like to sit my plants along the hearth for the summer months.Also under the house I found these two rusty old watering cans.  I hauled them out as I had a plan for one of them.I painted it with some leftover black chalk paint that had nearly gone hard, but which I added water to.  Then I used up some of the Iron Orchid transfers that I had left over from when when I upcycled the vintage SawsI sprayed it with 2 coats of matt finish polyacrylic to protect it.I planned to sit it outside on the deck by my Mangle & the saws. I had thought about planting it with some black mondo grass however when I posted a photo & mentioned this on Instagram the majority of people said Leave it as it is.  What do you think dear blog readers ... plant or leave as is ??The kitchen smelt a delicious mix of Sweet Lime & Mandarin & also Christmas Tree fragranceWe had atrocious weather last week with strong winds & rain so I spent a pleasant morning in my kitchen making up some candles into vintage containers & using up the last of my Soy Wax.  I plan to give most of these as Christmas Gifts.I came across this box full of vintage Tala cookie cutters in the back of a cupboard.  I thought about donating them but then decided to make up some play dough for Sid to play with .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  which he very much enjoyed & the cookie cutters were a big hit !Thank You so very much for your visits & for stopping by here today dear friends,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "These Lockdown Days ......................................", "date": "Sunday, October 31, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThe days & weeks continue to go by so very fast - we are still in Lockdown Level 3 here so many of my days are still taken up with looking after Sid. I can hardly believe we turn the calendars over to November tomorrow !!I just Love this photo my son sent me of Sid with Darcy - just a boy & his dog, two scruffs together  - happiness indeed 💙(Sid uses my kindling wood to make fences & enclosures)On Friday we went down to the Pond to feed the fish & while we were gone, another big black T-Rex got inside the dinosaur enclosure!  Oh dear - we must've left the gate open 😲 !! While hunting in a drawer for a piece of flannelette I came across these vintage flour sacks.  I thought they would be ideal to make some outdoor cushions with as I needed some for my rustic garden seat down by the Pond. I made an inner & stuffed them quite loosely as I wanted them to feel squishy. They are perfect for the seat & it doesn't matter if they get left out in the odd rain shower.  The cherry blossom tree (Shimidsu Sakura) is in full bloom at the moment.While ratting around under my house looking for a planter pot I came across this vintage childs table & chair set.  I pulled them out & gave them a scrub - they were Very rusty.  I thought I would like to paint them up & maybe gift to my step grandaughter Juno for Christmas.The Mr made me sand them first & then spray them all over with an anti rust Primer.  I usually want to take the quickest, simplest method but he makes me do things properly as he is boring fussy particular like that 😉It is very much a matter of using up what's on hand in these current Lockdown times. The chair is painted in Dulux Lake Camp (testpot) & the table is left over paint from my fire surround - Dulux Ngataringa Bay. I was most excited as I had these gorgeous rabbit transfers that I planned to use on them - purchased from * Here *I was able to do a click-&-collect with my local Mitre 10 store & purchase some new rubber feet for each item which just finished them off perfectly. (I should add here that it took 3 goes to get the right size!!!)Rather than waxing  I decided to spray both items with a matt finish polyacrylic which I had on hand - I think this will give a better protection should Juno happen to draw on the table.I'm really delighted with how these turned out & hope Juno gets lots of happy hours using them. 😊The Magazine is the Spring 2018 Issue - No 26This vintage Tilda charm pack was tucked into my birthday gift this year from my dearest friend Leeanne.  My heart skipped several beats 💗!!  I had earmarked this pattern in the above issue of Simply Vintage Magazine to make the Spring Cushion.The pattern is by Tweetledee Design Co  ... I decided to make mine up into a table runner as I did not have anywhere for another cushion.I just adore the faded florals of these earlier Tilda ranges & am not so partial to some of their newer brighter ranges.  This charm pack was called \"All that is Spring\" The Needleturn applique always takes me out of my comfort zone but finally I was happy with my centre panel.I just did some simple straight line machine quilting across the pieced blocks.It fits perfectly tucked into my Spring display ... I picked a small vase of Seafoam roses yesterday before the rain bashed them all.  It's hard to believe only one more month of Spring time left.I saw this on Instagram last week & it made me smile ... all that Lockdown Baking & Eating has resulted in \"Covid Curves\" so I could definately relate 😉  I hope it makes you smile too dear friends.Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,Thank You So much for stopping by here today,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "To Mum's & Back Again ................................  (Part Two)", "date": "Monday, October 18, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI paid 50c for the small china butter dish & the Yankee Candle was $4 - brand new! Long time readers of my blog will know that I love to scour the Op Shops in Mum's small town.  This visit I literally had to run around them as I waited for Mum's prescription to be made up.  I found the items above at 3 shops, Hospice, St Mary's & the SPCA ... I've put the prices beside each item.I especially love the two tureens above that I found at the SPCA shop - minus lids but only $4 & $6 each. The china is W.H. Grindley & Co & each piece is number stamped.  I would like to make a candle up in the smaller one with 2 wicks & maybe fill the larger one with potpourri.The beautiful vintage cushion cover that all my thrifted items are resting on was tossed to me by my friend Claire as I was leaving her Home.  Yesterday I made a calico inner for it & stuffed it tightly.  I really love the pattern & am wondering if it might be Sanderson Linen?I treated myself to this beautiful Candle while down at Mum's with some leftover birthday money.  I have been given the Oakmoss fragrance before & absolutely loved it ... & I can verify that I still do !! 💗The Mr informed me that it rained here nearly every day that I was gone & I can see the garden has come to life in the few days I was away.  The pram that I featured * here * is almost entirely surrounded by forget-me-nots & granny bonnets now.  The blossom trees are in full bloom . . . . . . . . . .  the clematis is in full bloom & my pots are flowering away merrily Beautiful vibrant Rhodohypoxis ...... I have 3 pots of thisI had sewn basil seedlings & these are now ready to be planted out & the 3 different varieties of tomatoes that I planted in plastic buckets have grown So much.As I mentioned in my last post we are currently back at Level 3 Lockdown so the Daycare Centre is closed for Sid.  I have had him extra days last week & again this week.  We played dinosaurs on the floor & then we noticed that a really big black T-Rex had decided to join our game 😉I took him in to town to the Park which was taped off & a big \"Closed\" Sign on it ... so we went to the local Rose Gardens & Sid ran around there for an hour On my 2nd night Home I was just about asleep when I heard this almighty crash that I thought was a bus driving into my lounge French Doors!!   Upon investigation I found my large oval mirror had fallen off the wall taking two glass fronted pictures with it & shattering my beautiful glass Fairy Dome.  There were splinters of glass & mirror shards everywhere to clean up.  I was none too impressed 😞My second \"accident\" was when I noticed this small wooden table top was stained & swollen on one side. I had watered the plant that sat on it prior to going away & not noticed that the water had over-run the saucer causing the wood to swell. Fortunately I managed to get it smooth using the electric sander, repaint it & it is now back in place with a piece of Oilcloth underneath to prevent this happening again. I am hoping there's Not going to be a third thing !! 😉Well dear friends, that's about me all caught up.Yesterday I made a Fridge Drawer Stew as I had lots of veggies needing to be used up & I also made a Scroggin Slice ... so I think I might just go put the kettle on.Thank You - as always - for your visits here today,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0"},
{"title": "To Mum's & Back Again   ..........  (Part 1)", "date": "Wednesday, October 13, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI had a good, but Very busy trip down to Mum's & returned home right as my region went into another Lockdown.  On my second day at Mum's we travelled just over 2 hours away to meet up with two of her brothers.  We had lunch at The Herb Farm - a wonderful place just out of Ashhurst with a cafe as well as a shop selling their handmade herbal products.After lunch we sat in the gardens for awhile & I captured this lovely photo. Mums brother in the middle is nearly 80 & the one on the right hand side is 94. (Mum is 92) These are the only remaining siblings from \"the first batch\" ... Grandma had bunches of children in batches & she had 11 altogether.  The reason they came in batches was because she lost pregnancies in between & then the older batch had to help raise the younger ones.After lunch we drove to the Cemetery  to take flowers to the family graves that are there.  It took us 2 hours to get around 5 graves as they were scattered all across the cemetery. Mums sister on the far right died at 5 months old in 1936.  I love Cemetery's - when I was young I used to find them spooky but now I find them incredibly peaceful places.We visited my brother & had afternoon tea.  He has finished building his fence which I wrote about in * this Post *I was lucky enough to visit my dear friend Claire for an hour. We had a quick cuppa & I took a few snaps around her beautiful Home of some of her latest creative endeavours.I always love Claire's displays & find it makes me feel very inspired.  One of her spare bedrooms above.A sweet little spring display in her entrance way.The wool picture above left is a recent completion & hangs on her Sampler wall.New Coffee Table Vignette on the right.But the item below really caught my eye & though I tried very hard to sneak it into my bag, I was not successful 😉 (I'm talking about the Dress not the Vodka !!!)Claire's craft group had taken part in a knitting challenge. Claire had knitted a bodice & then sewn a tulle skirt to attach to it & hung it from a miniature (chalkpainted) hanger. She had knitted the bodice using a long string of tiny fairy lights, so once you turned the wee switch - it lit up!!!My pic is not doing it justice - it was Stunning!!Before I left I had to finish a bunting Order for my friend Joy. Her request was for a gender neutral woodland themed nursery. The Mum-to-be loves foxes so this fabric was perfect.  I added the hearts as the Mum-to-be has upholstered a vintage chair in forest green.  Miss Pippi very kindly multi-tasked by pressing my fabrics for me whilst doing her morning meditation at the same time !!When I delivered the bunting to Joy I had ordered 3 of her handmade wooden tags in a lavender theme. Joy had so kindly made me extras as well as some of her other beautiful tags & some new butterfly paper serviettes to use for decoupage.Blackie did his usual \"feral trick\" & disappeared while I was away which gave The Mr & I even more grey hair!! He has returned again & is currently tucked up on my (un-made) bed with Madam Pip as we are getting icy spring showers here today.Thank You all So Much for staying with me through today's lengthy post.I will be back in a few days with Part 2 as I still have a tiny bit more to share.With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "The Blink of an Eye .....................................", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersAnother busy week has gone by in the blink of an eye.This vintage Cane Dolls Pram was gifted to me over 5 years ago by my dear friend Leeanne.   I usually plant it over winter with Pansies & then in summer it enjoys either Petunias or Busy Lizzies.  After I removed the flowers last summer I noticed that the entire carriage underneath had collapsed - due to constant watering the wood had rotted.  I didn't plant it over winter but I really didn't want it to go to the \"cane pram graveyard\" just yet ... so I pulled it into shape as best as I could & then stacked lengths of wood to hold the undercarriage up. This worked well but looked hideous so I popped it in a spot in my garden where I knew the plants would grow around it & hide this ugly fixer upper.  I lined it with a black rubbish bag & then planted some Snapdragons in it ... true to form the flowers have grown & it now looks great tucked into the garden beside my deck where the forget-me-nots will sprawl out & surround it.  It has bought me many years of pleasure this ratty old cane pram. Last Saturday my eldest son turned 40! He wanted to celebrate with a finger food family dinner here at home.  On birthdays I always ask my boys if there are \"any special requests\".  He asked for a Honey Rice Bubble Slice & a plate of Salmon Rolls.  It only seems just yesterday that I was making Honey Rice Bubble slice for them as youngsters.We had a very enjoyable evening & his wife Sarah made him a carrot cake which is his favourite.  I blew up some balloons but these were more for the little boys than the big boys.Aaron is my eldest son & is dad to Alec, my eldest grandson.Happy Birthday Aaron - you have grown into a wonderful man that I am So Very proud of  ...  & it feels like I blinked & forty years went by!!On Monday I hosted the craft ladies - we are able to have small gatherings indoors now & as there were only 7 of us we had a wonderful day together sharing ideas, inspiration & delicious food.Our last meeting was a few months ago now & we had all worked on felt pincushions in a variety of patterns.  I had taken along 3 of my Hatched and Patched Designs pincushion patterns & some of the ladies made these - others made felt fruit pincushions.  I decided to make the Alice Angel Pincushion but as I have lots of pincushions - I made mine into a door hanger by filling her with dried lavender,  stitching a hanging loop & some rusty bells to the bottom.My one is shown up close on the left & the ladies creations on the right - poor photo sorryOn Monday I made up kitsets for us all to make the \"Christmas Elf in a Pudding\".  This is a pattern from Tis' the Season gifted to me by my neighbour last year.Some of the ladies bought along their Lockdown projects for Show-&-Tell, & Gail had made this beautiful framed Tree.  She had sewn a tree shape to some embossed fabric, stuffed it lightly, stitched on some braiding & then embellished away with beautiful copper coloured charms before framing - it was truly stunning !!On my Tuesday-with-Sid it was a beautiful sunny spring day so we went to the Park for a couple of hours, then Sid had an Icecream & a packet of Smarties ... & Granny consumed an entire bag of Jet Plane lollies All By Herself  😐 !!If you look at the pic above right you can see that Blackie was not at all worried about Sid & had a nap on the couch while Sid watched Dinosaurs .  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  . whereas Madam Pip who prefers to act traumatised all day long, hid in a sewing room drawer that I had accidently left open.I am happy to report that after the seed planting efforts in my last Post it would appear that Houston We Have Liftoff  !!  😊  I'm sure you can see from the photo above which ones I planted & which ones a certain little boy buried down real deep !!Well dear friends - I had my final Covid Vaccination this morning & now I need to pack my bags as I am off to Mum's for my usual 3 monthly visit.Thank You for your visits here today - wishing you all a wonderful weekend - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship To You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Snippets from my Week", "date": "Friday, September 17, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI was delighted yesterday, to collect my newly framed Sampler from my local boutique Framing Shop.I began stitching this back in June - it is a French General Chafarcani Panel pre-printed on Linen.  There were a set of 4 in the series - I only purchased 1 & now wish I had bought more. Really hard to photograph on this rainy dull dayJanet at the Framers helped me choose this frame - new in stock.  I liked that the \"plain-ness\" of it didn't detract from the stitchery itself & I also really liked the pale pink wash of the wood.I stitched this using Cottage Garden Thread in the colour \"Running Postman\".  (Whoever knew that Running Postmen had a colour ???!!!) 😉Very slowly my Sampler Wall is growing .........................My dear friend Carolyn was up visiting as her youngest son & his partner have just welcomed a new born baby son.I buy white bath towels when they are on sale & use these to back my BibsI wanted to put together a handmade baby parcel for Carolyn to give them so I went hunting through my stash of fleece & flannelette.  I made 3 bibs using * this * free pattern which my daughter in laws always told me were \"the best bibs Ever\"!  I made a thick fleece cuddle rug from some gorgeous polar bear fabric & added in a pair of knitted booties. The lockdown dishcloth knitting continues as I slowly use up all my oddments of cotton/bamboo.  I really like using * this * free pattern as I find it enjoyable to knit up as well as being a nice size for a dishcloth (not too large, not too small)My lovely friend Shirley asked me to run up 4 lavender sleep pillows for her. She provided the beautiful Japanese Woven fabrics cut in to 6 x 4 inch squares. Shirley is a wonderful sewer but her machine has thrown a massive wobbly & gone away for major repairs. To try & use up some more lemons & oranges, I made a Citrus Slice  & also made The Mr a Weetbix Slice which is his favourite.As mask wearing is mandatory in our country now, I have had more requests for masks.  I don't especially enjoy making these as I find them very boring & uninspiring to make & lots of people request plain black which probably doesn't help.  The one on the far right (black with scissors) was for my hairdresser which I thought was perfect for her.Last Tuesday Sid & I planted some \"dinosaur gourd seeds\" which I hope grow as a certain little boy pushed the seeds in rather deep 😉We also planted some sunflower seeds as every year I seem to leave this too late & then wish I had. My dear friend Sandy left me a deliciously moist Banana & Chocolate Chip loaf in my letter box yesterday - it was such a treat with my coffee this morning. Wishing you all a wonderful weekend dear friends Thank You as always, for your visits here today,With much love & friendship To You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Three Upcycled Items  =  $7   Total", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersA couple of months ago I had to travel to Putaruru, a small rural town about 45 minutes inland from where we live ... I had to collect a farming part for The Mr. There is an Op Shop in Putaruru called \"Paws\" (Pet Animal Welfare Shop).  It is dimly lit inside,  everything is just tossed on shelves,  there is very little in the way of displays -  but the prices are Very reasonable - my kind of Op Shop !!  😍 This old steamer pot (for $2) was the first item I picked up & the lid (which doesn't fit the pot) was $1.  I had an idea in mind for these.I painted the pot & the lid using Newtons Chalk Paint in the colour Country Green.  Because we are in Lockdown it was very much a matter of using up what I had on hand as there were No shops open to buy supplies.  Once dry I decided to apply some transfers & as you can see I had good assistance in choosing which ones to use. 😉I tied a thin balsa wood swing tag to the handle once finished.  I also sprayed the entire thing with 2 coats of clear acrylic varnish in a matt finish.The pot had to wait two more weeks before our Lockdown Levels changed & I was able to purchase some plants for it.  First I lined the inside with a black rubbish bag as even though it had holes in the bottom I didn't want the water pouring out every time I gave it a drink.I had visualised white petunias in it but all I was able to get were dark burgundy petunias, which I think will be equally as nice once they bloom.The 2nd item I purchased from Paws was this wooden box for $1.00It contained filing cards inside which were surprisingly still in quite good condition.  It had a chip out of the lid which I was able to fill with polyfiller.  Once again - using up what I had on hand, I painted this with Voodoo Molly Vintage chalk paint (Robins Egg) - two coats.  Then I stenciled this rabbit design to the top using a testpot of white acrylic that I found.  I ended up sanding it back quite a bit as I wasn't especially happy with my stenciling finish initially.I lined the inside with some cardstock paper & screwed a small file-label holder to the front 💙It looks perfect amongst some other pastel items on my corner table.The last item I purchased (for $3) was this heavy old metal stool. I could not resist it & could visualise it already revamped in my mind.I removed the seat part (with great difficulty) & then set about painting the legs with some Pumice Chalk Paint left over from the drop leaf table I painted HereFortunately,  amongst the myriad of things in my stash - I found a piece of thick foam rubber.  I had to get The Mr to help me upholster the seat as it needed an extra pair of hands. I had this Sanderson Oilcloth left over from other projects & I use it sparingly as I adore it.I absolutely LoVe how this turned out. I painted right over the rubber feet of the stool as I knew I could not get to any Hardware Stores to buy more & I think it turned out just fine. It's actually really comfy to sit on too ! I was so chuffed with my 3 upcycled items for the princely sum of $7.00  💗Thanks so much for staying with me through this waffly post dear friends - I shall leave you with this picture of Blackie.I walked around my house & I counted Ten different comfy sleeping places  - boxes with blankets in, cushions & folded up cuddly rugs, lined baskets ... just especially for the furry ones !!And where does he choose to sleep I ask you  . . . . . . . . . . ???On top of The Mr's electronic keyboard !!!! 😖    No further comment I think  . . . . . . . . . .Wishing you all a Wonderful Weekend ahead,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},

I had forgotten I had shoved them under there last year when they finished blooming.Pretty Pots of Tulips & a white Hyacinth which smells divine !!I was cleaning out my hallway cupboard & came across a plastic bag of doilies that my friend Gail had tossed my way. In the middle of the doilies I pulled out this cross stitch, all screwed up & forlorn looking.I decided to frame it myself & make up a little Spring Tablescape on my Vintage Singer Sewing Table, which still had its Autumn display on it. I have a box full of frames in various sizes & states of repair - left over from the days of running my Craft Cottage.  I found this one which was a good size to fit the cross stitch.  I gave the frame 2 coats of paint & then decided to add the small scroll to the top.  I gave the cross stitch a gentle iron to get all the creases out & then framed it using some double sided tape.I was really pleased how it turned out & the frame fitted it perfectly.These sad looking little birdhouses were in another box of junk treasures so I gave them the once over with my cream chalk paint too & then added a couple of Transfers & some dried moss.The lace doiley I displayed on my pedestal stand was thrifted as were the lace cloths I used on the table.I found some Tilda flowers that I had made a long time ago & displayed them in a thrifted glass bottle ... the flower plate was a thrift store find on my last trip down to Mum's. The wool blanket flowers were displayed in another thrifted glass milk bottle.(I foraged a couple of birds nests)I dug out the \"Spring\" Stitchery that I made in this Post  last year.The China tureen is also a thrift store item & the other few bits were just gathered from around my house.  Total Cost $ zero !!And to put the finishing touch to my display ...... I picked my very first vaseful of freesias to sit in a thrifted vase.On Wednesday I knew my friend Sandy was heading in to town so I left bags of Oranges, Lemons & some Worm tea in my letter box for her to collect on her way past.She Very kindly left me a delicious Banana Loaf in return & I have been enjoying it with my cups of tea.Mask Wearing has become mandatory in my Country now so I decided to make myself a couple of new ones yesterday, using up some scraps of pink floral fabrics. I also made The Mr a plain black one.I have 2 friends with birthdays soon & I want to post them each a Garden Voucher which I am able to buy using click & collect. I made two hanging heart pockets as I love using these to gift a Voucher inside.  These are made using *  this great tutorial  * from Craft With Fee.  And I reluctantly cut into my treasured Tilda fabrics 💕Miss Pippi - tucked away where she is NOT supposed to be !!!!! 😖Thanks So Much for your visits here today dear friends,I hope you all have a wonderful weekend - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Lockdown Projects ...........................................", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLockdown Life continues here at the bottom of the world with our Level 4 Lockdown having been extended until the end of the month.    There is always plenty to do here at Threadbear HQ - though I must admit my energy levels (& enthusiasm) this time round are somewhat diminished.   Yesterday I was weeding an area of my garden & could smell the heavenly scent of wild violets - so I picked the sweetest little bunch to enjoy inside 💕We have a surplus of lemons at the moment - our tree is laden & it's branches bending over.  I swap produce with my neighbour Jenny who gives me free range eggs in exchange for broccoli & worm tea.  Jenny left a dozen eggs in my letter box a couple of days ago so I decided to make a sticky Lemon Slice.I used * this * recipe here - a recipe from a Cafe, that I had torn out of an old newspaper.  When I make something citrusy I want to really taste the citrus - not just a hint of it.  See the piece missing from the corner .......... I can most certainly attest that This Slice Was DELICIOUS !!!!  😉Filling some bottles of worm tea for Jenny prompted me to give my worm farm a good clean out. I like to hose down the lids & get rid of any bugs & things every few months. I managed to fill 7 more bottles of worm tea - with spring just around the corner it's time to start liquid feeding plants & potted things again.I came across a half pot of Resene \"Hot Chilli\" paint in my cupboard which was timely because my outdoor table & chairs were looking tatty after the winter.I decided to give them a good scrub & then a coat of paint to freshen them up.Our weather this week has been more settled & it was quite pleasant painting outside on my deck area.I am always impressed with how much one good coat can give them a new lease of life.    Now if only the birds will stop using the chairs as perches ..........I scrubbed out my old kettle, which I painted & stencilled last year & planted a small white paper daisy in this.Last October on one of my trips to Mum's this drop-leaf tea wagon was waiting for me in her shed.  My sister-in-law had seen it being carted to the road side \"free for the taking\" & grabbed it for me, along with 2 wooden chairs for herself.I pulled it out of my sleepout on Thursday, gave it a good wash down & then prepared to paint it with chalk paint in the colour \"Pumice\".I started off out on the deck but found it easier to put it on my table upside down & get in all the nooks & crannies.  Yes I had my usual \"Supervisor\" who rather enjoys watching paint dry !! 😉Most of it took 3 coats before I was satisfied with my coverage - I had masking taped the castors as I didn't want any paint on these.I had this gorgeous Iron Orchid Transfer that I planned to cut into & affix to my tea wagon, to take the plain-ness off it.I had a vision in my mind of flowers cascading across the top & down one of the drop leaves of the table as if someone had thrown a bunch of flowers across it . . . . . . I kept having to walk away & then come back to it several times before I was happy with my finish - it was tempting to keep adding more but I tried to restrain myself.I'm really pleased with how it turned out & just have to give it all a coat of clear wax now to protect it.I just added a small flower & a leaf to one leg (below)Last night at the dinner table I was telling The Mr the story of how I came to get the tea wagon - he would have No Idea what I have stashed away in the sleepout nor where I acquired it from.This morning this little funny appeared in my Inbox - sent from The Mr.  (Yes I must confess I am rather like that at times !!!)Thank You all So Very Much for your visits here today dear friends,I hope you are staying safe & well no matter where you may live in the world,Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With Much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "The Princess & The Pea   ......   ❤  Tilda Style  ❤", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers(warning - Photo heavy post - I've tried to condense it but there's still lots of pics - apologies in advance)Long-time readers of my blog may remember the Princess & the Pea Cot I did for my friend Sally way back in 2017.    I loved it & found it rather hard to part with ... & always kept in the back of my mind, that one day, I would like to do one for myself.On my trip down to Mum's early last month I drove past a Vintage Store several times & couldn't help noticing a dolls cot out front on the footpath. I mentioned this to my friend Claire while we were Op-shopping just prior to my trip home - next thing I know she had whisked me off to the Vintage Shop & was able to secure the cot for me at a Very Reasonable price.  I was So excited 😊 !!I must mention that as I was paying for the Cot, the lady very sweetly asked me \"Are you going to be doing it all up nicely for a young girl?\".   I smiled at her & replied \"Yes I am going to be doing it all up nicely but it's for a rather large Not-so-Young girl aged 61!\" 😉As you can appreciate, after spending goodness-knows-how-long sitting out front of the shop - it was in rather a filthy state. I gave it a good scrub on my return home with sugar soap.The next time I visited my local Library with Sid, I found * this * book the same one Sally had given me to use for her Cot.  The Princess themed doll & bedding patterns begin on Page 104.Over the course of a wet, rainy week I painted my cot using Chalk Paint in the colour Vintage White. Painting all those dowels was not exactly my idea of fun - but I love how it all turned out.I glued two thin lengths of wood together, painted & screwed to the back - this was to hang my lace drapes from.  This cot has a front that actually drops down & the mechanism is still in good working order.First up I made a selection of mattresses.  I know in the original story the Queen piles 20 mattresses up on the bed but I had to make do with 6 as I didn't want a tower of mattresses toppling down on me.I especially loved the ticking stripe ones.  These fabrics are all from my Tilda stash - some vintage Tilda & some from more recent ranges.I was looking forward to making the bed quilt & cut into some gorgeous vintage Tilda that I had set aside for this.I  attached some wide vintage cluny lace to the top, just to give it a bit more prettiness.I didn't have enough Tilda fabric for the back but I found a pretty embroidered supper cloth that I used to back it.Then I made a wee pillow - again using vintage Tilda.💕💗💕💗Next it was time to drape the cot .....  I was over in the city so I popped into Spotlight as they have a good selection of lace/net curtains, which just happened to be 40% off that day.I found a length of cream gathered lace in my stash which I sewed to the bottom - I visualised it just touching the floor.I was happy with my cot drapes but after walking past them for a day or 2 I felt they needed something more ... so I decided to make some folded fabric roses from oddments of cotton lace.  I found this Youtube Video really helpful as I couldn't for the life of me, remember how to make these.I also wound some ribbon & lace around knitting needles & painted these with a mixture of water & PVA glue.(which is what you use when you don't have any Stiffy Fabric Stiffener)This was the effect I was after ...  tumbling down ribbon curlsNext it was time to make my Princess.  The fabrics I used for her nightie & stockings are not Tilda fabrics but were already in my stash & I didn't have any Tilda that was suitable.I love the sweet little crown charm which I tied around her neckI am so pleased I gave her messy bed hair, which is what you would expect after tossing & turning all night long while sleeping on the pea !!!  I made her a crown by photocopying some Tilda fabric onto Inkjet paper. The first crown I made came to an end when a certain ginger 4-legged chewed it (!!!)I also gave her a wee lace hanky as she was probably quite distressed after her fitful nights sleep & needed to mop her brow 😉I tucked the wee felt Pea into the mattress.  I am deeply indebted to my lovely friend Jane, who kindly came to the rescue when I could not find/buy/acquire a crown anywhere. How perfect she is ... I Adore her !!!  I think I should probably add at this stage - growing up I had 3 dolls which I adored , but never ever any cots, prams or other dolly related things, bar a rusty old pushchair that the neighbor tossed over the fence one day rather than take to the Tip.  I was always a doll lover & No - I am not going through a 2nd childhood but I do feel that at 61 years of age, it was wayyyyy past time I got my very own dollies cot.And for those of you that were wondering ... Yes I did have unwanted help & assistance with the creating of my Princess & the Pea.Most especially from my Very Own Real Life Princess !!!If you've managed to last til the end - Thank You So Very much!!We have gone into another Lockdown here in New Zealand, which was initially for 3 days & this afternoon has been extended to a week at this stage. I am fine as I have a good supply of toilet paper & Sewing essentials but I am a bit worried about my rapidly diminishing chocolate stash (!!!)Stay safe & well dear friends - wishing you a wonderful weekend,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "The Tale of Two Cats  ............  (Tilda Ones) ❤", "date": "Wednesday, August 11, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI try to find things to enjoy no matter what season we are in.  It's still wintery here but the Daphne is in full bloom & I have a garden full of Green Dragon Broccoli ready for picking, as well as the citrus trees being laden.This was last Thursday's pickings & I also gave away 2 large heads of broccoli.  The oranges are small, but are sweet & tasty - these ones were picked for dehydrating.                           I also picked a bunch of Camellia flowers before the rain bashed them & turned them brown.Last year during our Lockdown, my friend Gail dug up a corner garden on her property & removed everything - she wanted to plant it in succulents.  She filled a rubbish bag full of winter roses (hellebores) & clivias.  When our Lockdown went to the next level & we were allowed to see people again, she asked me to burn the rubbish bag on my burning heap.   (The variegated one is the third photo)Instead I removed all the plants from the bag, cut them back (they looked rather sick for awhile) & planted them in my garden.  I am delighted this winter that the hellebores are flowering away happily & there are a wonderful mix of pinks & creams, & even a variegated one which I have not photographed particularly well.This morning I picked a vaseful of the hellebore flowers to enjoy on my kitchen bench. The vase was a $1 Op Shop find & is perfect for sweet little bunches of flowers like this.Before I went away to Mum's last month, I started work on one of the Tilda Cats - a free pattern off their website - go * here * & scroll down about half way.  I had the dark grey fleck fabric in my stash which I used for the body, & the dress is made from Tilda Woodland fabric.Upon my return from Mum's I finished her - I thought I would give her to Juno (my stepgrandaughter) for Christmas, as Juno loves cats & they have a real life grey cat.Click on the picture to enlarge & get a better viewThe bag is included in the pattern - some of the Woodland range have the sweetest selvedge edges, including this with the coloured squirrels along it.  I cut it out & sewed it to my bag strap as I thought it was delightful.  The Tilda pattern doesn't have whiskers but I decided my cat needed some so I used a thin waxed leather thonging that I had in my stash. I had barely put the finishing touches to Juno's Cat when my lovely friend Jane called out & commissioned me to make her a Tilda Cat.  Jane had her own pattern & wanted hers made in a pretty pale grey linen & the dress from a vintage floral sheet.When it came time to cut the dress pattern out, I didn't need to iron the sheet as Pippi very kindly did it for me !!! 😉I LoVe how Jane's cat turned out  -  in fact I love it better than the one I made for Juno 💚.  Jane's only request was that she have a green nose to match the green in the dress fabric.And that she have a hanging loop on the back as Jane planned to hang her up.My other finish this week was an Order for 20 mothball sachets for my friend Maria.  I haven't made these in awhile & the house smelt fresh & lovely with the dried mint inside them.You can find the recipe for these at the bottom at the bottom of this post Here.As I sit typing this today, the furry two are sound asleep on my bed (Yes on my good bedspread that I said they were Never Ever getting on !!!)Wishing you a wonderful rest of the week dear friends,Thanks so much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Tilda Father Christmas ", "date": "Friday, July 30, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI hope your week is going well & you are looking forward to the weekend, as I am.I purchased the Tilda book above from * Here * several years ago now.  I had always wanted to make the Father Christmas inside it but I felt daunted as I had never done needleturn applique before.  When my friend Claire came to stay in early May she offered to do the needleturn pieces for me & post up for me to stitch onto the clothes.  I agreed ... however when I got my fabrics out to sort which ones I chose to use, I decided it was probably high time I had a go at needleturn applique myself 😉.  In hindsight I think I should've probably chosen something a bit simpler to begin on, & also not so fiddly.  However - I persevered & over a period of about 2 months I worked away on the leaves & tiny borders of my Santa's clothing.I must be honest here & say - I am sure if you \"needleturn whiz's\" saw my methods, you would roll around laughing !! 😄    But I got there in the end.Instead of quilting the fabric afterwards, as the pattern suggests, I just used Sandcastle fabric, which is already quilted - I really liked this effect too.  The other change I made was I gave my Santa a fur beard instead of the quilted fabric beard shown in the pattern.The pattern for the tree is also included in the book - I gave my tree a rustic twig stem & then spray painted a rusty star to adorn the top. This time round, instead of having Madam Pip \"assisting me\" I had Blackie plonk himself down on my needle turn applique & give everything a liberal coat of black hairs 😟 as well as getting glue baste-it on his paws.  Honestly friends, it's a wonder I get anything done around here !!!I am so thrilled with my Father Christmas ... he's far from perfect & there Was rather alot of Glue baste-it used, but he's finished & I'm just happy that I gave it a go.  Before we know it, it will be December again (!!!) & he will look wonderful hanging in my 💗 Pink Christmas area 💕My friend Jan dropped the black fabric dinosaur panel into me recently - it was going to be tossed out at the Op Shop where Jan volunteers.  I unpicked the dinosaur panel & then sewed it onto a small cushion for Sid, made from some dinosaur flannelette in my stash. The picture is made entirely from sequins, hand-sewn on, & when you rub your hand upwards on it - the sequins all change to the blue & spell the word \"Roar\".  Sid was delighted with it & now takes it to bed each night.Before                                                                      AfterThis silver coffee pot above was in the thrift shopping haul from my last Post... a $5 purchase.  While I was already painting with my \"Pumice\" chalk paint, I gave it 2 coats & then applied some remnants of Re-design transfers to it.I added one to the lid also, then I very lightly buffed all the detailing with some silver gilding wax. Last Sunday The Mr was away all day riding Moto X so I had a cooking day.  I made a Lasagne for the freezer & I made a fudge cake to take to my Craft Group on Monday (which ended up being cancelled)  then I put a Fridge Drawer Stew in the slow cooker, which lasted us 3 nights last week.  I loved this wee funny below - it came into my Instagram account this week & made me smile.I hope you all have a wonderful weekend dear friends.Those of you that follow my blog by email notifications - Please Note that Blogger is going to be removing this notification & you will no longer receive email notifications after this month.  I will make further investigations & figure out another way to notify you when I can. Thank you all so much for your visits here today,Have a wonderful weekend dear friends,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "There ............................ & Back Again", "date": "Friday, July 23, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have been away down to my Mum's for a week & have also been home a week - finding the time to blog again has been difficult as it has been a busy time with school holidays.Mount Taranaki (formerly Mount Egmont)Whenever I return \"home\" again this beautiful mountain always takes my breath away as it rises from the mist.Mum & I went out to my brother & sister-in-laws for afternoon tea. Mum's cat Bubby went to live with them 3 years ago now & she usually hides whenever Mum turns up, but this time she was more than happy to have a pat & a belly rub.My brother has a 40 acre farm high on a hill with stunning views but in a real wind channel. His first fence blew down in strong winds but he is now erecting this Gabion Cage fence which will be sturdier. The amazing thing about this is that my brother is building this all by himself - each stone has to be placed by hand in the wire cages which he erects first & concretes into a base -  my brother only has one arm as he lost his other arm in a motorcycle accident at age 20. He has 15 cages to build & fill to complete the fence.I had some good luck thrifting this trip - I stopped at Stratford Hospice on my way down & bought these goodies above - I am about half way through the ($1) Lesley Pearce book now & can hardly put it down. On the Saturday morning I met my friend Claire in town & we did some thrifting before having a coffee together.  The plates above right were at a ladies market stall & were $2 each & the tiny one was $1.  I bought the wooden mirror for $10 - I wanted to use the frame of it & the wee salt shaker was 50c & is Old Foley china.Last week Alec came to stay for some of the school holidays & then Sid joined him on the Tuesday. They made roads with my knitting needles & we built houses, petrol stations & even a McDonalds.My lounge looked like a bomb had hit it & Pippi hid for an entire day. My friend Gail had gifted me the image above left for my birthday - I loved it & had it in my head that I wanted to mount it on a vintage tray.  I found the one above while down at Mum's for $10.  I always put them through my dishwasher before painting as it removes any grease or residue. I gave it two coats of Chalk Paint in the colour Pumice.I used baking paper to press into the bottom of the tray to get \"a pattern\" so I could cut my image out neatly. Then I modpodged it onto the tray & once dry, I sealed it with mod podge also.  I rubbed clear wax over it all & then rubbed dark wax just over the detailing as I felt it gave it a nice antique-y look.❤  I just LoVe Mother Goose & her babies  ❤And Yes - that actually IS a cat on my worktable 😉This vintage teapot above left was a $4 find at Hospice - I gave this two coats of Pumice while I was painting my tray & then applied a Re-design transfer to it along with a tag.  This one will be planted for a birthday gift.Yesterday I picked the first of my daffodils before the rains came - these were lying on the ground as we have had strong winds this week - but they soon perked up inside & make me feel as though spring is not too far away.Wishing you all a wonderful weekend dear friends - be kind to yourselves & to each other,Thank You all for stopping by here today,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Giveaway Winners & a Birthday  ......................................", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLate one night last week I went through all the comments on my Giveaway post & gave each one a number. I had 75 comments altogether (not counting a couple of replies & a spam)  I wrote the numbers 1 to 75 on separate pieces of paper, folded them & put them all in my vintage twin-spout teapot.  Then I got The Mr to draw out 2 numbers.  First he drew out 44, then No 3.The winner of the 1st Prize is Christine from the blog MacDonalds Patch & the winner of the 2nd Prize is Janet from the blog Roque QuilterBoth winners have been notified & I will be posting their parcels off overseas to them tomorrow.  I So enjoyed this Giveaway & would love to do these more often - I just loved reading everyone's comments about their favourite season.    I did a tally in case you are interested ......  Autumn (fall) was the winner with 36 votes followed by Spring at 23 votes, then Winter at 8 & Summer at 7. Some people didn't name their favourite, some named 2 seasons & two people said every season has its own special rewards to look forward to ... which is absolutely right ❤As for myself - it was always Spring for me - the season of Hope after a cold winter & watching the garden come to life again.  But I have to confess our Autumns now are just beautiful & mild, so I think I might love them both equally.Last week I also celebrated another birthday - I turned 61.   We had a simple informal family tea on the Sunday night & my daughter in law made me an Orange Cake with cream cheese icing - it was indeed delicious & moist.I had a fairly quiet day on my birthday, which is what I wished for ... but I got thoroughly spoilt with some lovely gifts from family & friends.The Mr had given me some money to buy a birthday gift about a month ago & I chose this vintage looking wrought iron planter.I took it with me to the Garden Centre last week & bought this terracotta pot to sit in it along with the beautiful pansy - a new variety called \"Eyelash Pansies\" 💕This old teapot had been sitting in a box of junk treasures so I gave it a coat of chalkpaint in the colour \"Pumice\"  ....  & some remnants of Re-design transfers to embellish it.  I was able to remove the pin from the lid & put it on backwards as I have a pot that sits perfectly in this.  I will plant it with some babies tears ... a gift for a friend.Longtime readers of my blog may remember reading in * this post *  how pleased I was with my 3 baskets of hanging geraniums. I have been able to start more cuttings from my main plant & potted them up this week - two of these baskets are going down to my sister-in-law as she asked me to do some for her.  I have tucked them up under my covered deck area as the heavy frosts we have had this week can burn the foliage.I got up early this morning & made another Fridge Drawer Stew as I had pumpkin going soft & broccoli that needed using up. These stews are so warming during these winter months & use up all those leftover veggies in the Fridge - The Mr would have this every night if he could.When I've peeled all my veggies I take the bowl of peelings out to my worm farm ... on my way back to the house I noticed Blackie asleep in the catcher of the ride-on lawn mower because of course - there are No Nice Comfy Places to sleep anywhere else on the entire property 😉Thanks so very much for your visits here today dear friends & thanks to all of you who took part in my Giveaway.If I could - I would give a prize to each & every one of you. 😊I am off down to my Mum's for a few days to help her out so I shall catch up with all your blogs on my return,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Sewing Doll & A Collection of Vintage Saws", "date": "Monday, June 28, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThank You all for your sweet kind comments regarding Pippi sleeping in my \"greens\" fabric basket in my last post - there have been \"some developments\" when I realised that Blackie had decided it looked a rather comfy spot to sleep in too & took it over.This morning at 2.30 am I heard a crash & upon investigation ...... a basket of green fabrics upturned on the floor & two cats looking at me with big innocent expressions 😉I have removed the basket & there is an empty shelf there now 😑Earlier this year I had a huge craft magazine cull.  While sorting through them I came across this VeRy Old Australian Country Craft magazine & rather liked the  primitive Sewing doll pattern inside.  I had a very dear friend celebrating a special birthday this month so I put the magazine aside & thought I might make the doll for her.I made mine much Less primitive than the doll in the magazine but I was thrilled with how she came out.   The pattern is called \"Stitching Clarabelle\" by Lynette Gunning of Lynette's Country Treasures.  I think it was the small stitchery sewed to the doll's hand which appealed to me so much, as the friend I was making this for is a professional Quilter.I purchased a 4 inch hoop which fitted the stitchery perfectly.I made her a button & cotton reel necklace as the pattern suggested which turned out really sweet& I also stitched some sewing themed charms to her Pinny.  The hair is hand dyed mohair from my stash.The fabrics are from a Lynette Anderson range which had a sewing theme & were perfect for the doll.And Yes dear friends ... I had the usual help & assistance from Miss Pippi as she pressed & ironed the doll for me !! 😉😕This small collection of old wood saws & saw blades had been sitting in my sleepout for a couple of years.  Last weekend when our weather was atrocious I decided to paint them on old sheets in front of my fire.  I knew I wanted to put transfers on them but wasn't sure what colour to paint the saws ... in the end I used up some old black chalk paint that was going hard in a pot.The \"Befores\" on the left & Part way through on the rightTwo coats each on both sides was enough to cover them well - I left the handles original.I was excited about adding the transfers  -   Yep there she is again right there in the midst of everything !!!I absolutely LoVe how these have turned out.  I gave them all two coats of a matt finish spray varnish as I knew I wanted them to go outdoors & was hoping this might seal them a bit & prevent moisture getting under the transfers.I wish I'd sat my squirrel on a branch now but too late ........I think these look wonderful hanging under my covered-in deck area & the black goes well with my vintage Mangle.  Another upcycle ticked off the list ❤If you have not already entered my Giveaway dear friends - there is still two days left to do so.  Go to this post * here  & enter in the comments section.  I will be drawing this on Wednesday 30th June & remember I will post anywhere in the world!Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,Thank You as always for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "Welcome to June  (already)", "date": "Sunday, June 6, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers Welcome to another bright shiny new month Gosh it's a bit scary to think we are mid way through the year already !!    Although June is officially the beginning of winter here at the bottom of the world, I realised I had not yet shared my Autumn tablescape with you.I have a vintage Singer Sewing Table in a corner of my dining room & I like to change this out for some of the seasons (not all).  I did a \"gourd & pumpkin theme\" for autumn this year & displayed them in my very old scales.I made a small size Tilda pumpkin from some scraps of fabrics - the pattern can be found in this book Here - Sewing by HeartThe display of lace pumpkins were made in * this post * last May during our Lockdown.Although I had a very good strike rate with my gourd seedlings this year I neglected to harden them off enough before planting outside & I lost alot of them.  I'll know not to do that this year hopefully 😉(The thread catcher pattern & kit were given to us during the Class we took)Last night while waiting for The Mr to bring Pizza home for tea, I whipped up this little thread catcher to match the storage pod I made back at the Tilda Trunk Show class.  Some followers have asked if I have the pattern for the Storage Pod - I have managed to find it * Here * - it is a free download & such a simple-to-make project.I have had the pattern book above for over 10 years a Very Long Time ... I have always wanted to make the Vintage Zinna Pillow featured on the cover - a pattern by Renee Nanneman of Need'l  Love.I decided to begin this project in early March & pulled out all my Tilda fabrics in pretty pastel shades. I would say I used 95% Tilda & added in some other pastels as well. This was made entirely from fabrics in my stash.I must admit to feeling rather daunted when I made my first petal & then read in the pattern \"repeat for 100 petals\" 😕Although they suggest the rows be covered with gathered seam binding when finished, I decided to use an applique/blanket stitch over each row as I went, to prevent any raw edges & am happy with this effect.The whole process took ages ...... but it was okay because I had lots of unwanted help & assistance along the way!!And when I didn't feel like ironing all my petals - Miss Pippi very kindly did it for me 😉😐I backed it with a good quality prewashed calico, stuffed it tightly & then stitched the seam closed.Finally .... (Yesterday) I finished my Vintage Zinnia Cushion - I adore it !!! 💗I absolutely love the pastel combination of pinks, blues, reds & greys with a touch of other colours thrown into the mix. It has turned out quite large too - measuring 55 cms in diameter.I would love to make a bigger unstuffed version as a mat to go in front of my pedestal handbasin but I think I need a bit of a lie down for now 😊Today is wintery so I have made my first Fridge drawer Stew for the season & it is cooking in my crock pot (slow cooker) - I had some veggies going soft in the Fridge Drawer so I chopped them all up with some steak/kidney in the bottom & this will be heartening & warming for our tea tonight (& tomorrow night hopefully)Thanks so much for your visits here today dear friends - I shall leave you with this photo of Blackie taken half an hour ago.  Tho' there is light drizzle falling outside, & there are Two banana boxes with soft blankets in on my deck area (as well as an assortment of cushions) - he would prefer to sleep out in the creeper growing in the old watering ram. Mind you, as The Mr pointed out to me - he Is wearing his winter coat - along with about 3 other winter coats as well I think 😉 !!Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Re-decorating the Spare Bedroom", "date": "Sunday, May 30, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersEarly last month I had a 3-day \"window of opportunity\" where I had nothing much planned (no Babysitting, Appointments or urgent Orders requiring attention) ... so I decided to empty out & paint my spare bedroom. I had two newly-acquired Decor items for my spare room & both were sitting still in their wrappings in the back of my Wardrobe.  I thought it was high time I got them out & put them in their rightful places.I saw this Image on Instagram & it appealed to me 😊I emptied the room out & gave the walls a thorough wash down - I planned to paint them the same colour (Cottage Cream) but they definately needed a scrub with sugar soap first. I gave them 2 coats & The Mr also gave the ceiling two coats - what a difference a fresh paint job makes to a room 💗The left hand pic is the smaller window & the right hand side the larger windowThe first new item I had was a blind which I'd had made back in January to fit the larger window in my spare bedroom. The smaller window already had a blind in this fabric & I had cheap tatty old calico curtains at the bigger window. The second new item I had was this Stunningly Gorgeous Quilt which I had purchased from my dear friend Leeanne - also earlier this year.  I had watched her make this Low Volume Log Cabin Quilt using offcuts of Vintage Linens as she would send me sneaky pics as she completed different blocks ... & I had fallen in love with it.I did not think for one moment she would ever sell it but she has opened A Felt Store & is selling lots of her handmade quilts now.  As well as her professional quilting business, she also enjoys making quilts to sell herself & is rather a whizz at it 😉Look how perfectly it fits on my King Single bed   ....  Oh Be Still My Beating Heart  💗💓                  This heavy old Oak bed was rescued from my daughter in law who no longer had room for it.It is honestly impossible to show this quilt up in its full glory as every single time I look at it - I see a new & different block.Leeanne has also quilted it on her long arm machine, using one of her edge to edge designs - Moulin Rouge I absolutely Adore my quilt 💕 Thank You Leeanne !!You can find Leeanne Here on her blog Quiltmekiwi  ....  or  Here on Instagram  ....  or Here on FacebookI also had another new-to-me item but this one was 2nd hand.  This mirror had been languishing in my sleep out for several years quite some time & I decided to paint it & use it in the room.Unfortunately some of the decorative edging had become brittle & fallen off but I was able to find most of the pieces & glue them back on.  I filled any gaps with Polyfiller & then painted the mirror in Vintage White Chalk Paint.When this was dry I masked off the frame & painted the decorative corner pieces in Pale Duck Egg.  I'm so pleased I did this as it just makes them stand out that little bit more.The mirror fits perfectly above this native Rimu Bookcase (would you believe - rescued from an old cow shed at a farm we milked on once !!!) It is not a large room by any means but I have re-arranged the furniture & I prefer it like this now that I no longer need a cot in here for Sid.A lamp on a small bedside table. (another upcycled project)This wee Autumn Angel sits at the foot of the bed - I made her in this Post back in 2019 And I finally have somewhere to hang the Tilda bunting I made in this post back here 💕Thank You dear readers so much for your visits here today.This is my wish for you in the coming week my friends,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Garland, A Rabbit, A Birthday ......... & A Dillybag ", "date": "Sunday, May 23, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers 💗Another busy week has zipped on by in the blink of an eye.At the Tilda Trunk Show show my friend Claire purchased some fat quarters of this sweet Tilda Angel fabric - we knew there was a free pattern on the website to make the garland.  Claire very kindly shared some of her fabrics with me before going home, so I made up my angels this week & plaited some Perle' thread to string them across my mirror.It's rather tricky to take mirror pics - you have to toss the mess out of sight before you click 😉I made 17 angels altogether but decided to use one for a keyring as The Mr had broken mine earlier this week. Here is the pattern above & * Here * is the link to the free pattern - you need to scroll 3/4's of the way down the page.While culling some pattern books recently I came across the book above & flicked through it.I fell in love with the little Primitive Rabbit & knew I wanted to make it up as I had some of the exact same wool fabric in my stash.He came together quite quickly & I also found enough orange wool scraps to make the carrots for his packback.  I have weighted the base of him with some Granite to help him stand up better.  He looks cute tucked in with my autumnal bits.While I was stuffing him on the Tuesday I had Sid here  ...  our conversation went like this.  Me holding up carrot (first pic) \"Sid what does this look like?\"  His reply - \"a carrot Granny\".  Good boy!!! 👍 Me holding up rabbit (2nd pic) \"And what does this look like?\" His reply\"Granny that's a whale\"(!!!!) A Whale ????😕My eldest Grandson Alec turned 6 last weekend & this year he was able to have a party & invite his school friends - both boys & girls. It was wonderful. Last year we were just coming out of Lockdown & gathering numbers were limited to 10.Alec's Mummy made the tastiest chocolate cake & he got to help decorate it ... I'm sure the party guests had a wonderful sugar overload.                   I especially love this photo of my eldest son (Alec's Dad) taken with Sid, his nephew.Thank You all for your sweet kind comments on my last post regarding Claire's swap gifts. I was surprised to receive a package in the mail this week along with a note to say that this was part of her \"D\" gift.  Claire had made me the most beautiful Dilly Bag from patchwork Tilda hexagons - she had not quite finished it when she came up to stay but was able to complete it when she got home again.We are already planning our next swap though we both might need to catch our breaths for awhile.There have been Tradesmen here for 2 days this past week ... after 20 years of one tatty old Spotlight in my kitchen I now have beautiful new pendant lights which I adore. However, now that I can see clearly I see I needed to perhaps clean a bit more thoroughly in my kitchen 😉We also had our native timber benchtops sanded & oiled & I have spent this weekend giving them another 3 coats & am finally able to put my clutter bits & bobs back on my benches.  Miss Pippi was rather traumatised this week having Tradies here two days in a row & is today tucked up with Blackie on my bed, which so far I have been unable to make & it's now 4.30 pm in the afternoon !!Thank You dear friends, for your visits here today,I hope the coming week is good to you all - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "My Tilda Swap Gifts & A Tilda Trunk Show ❤", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersLast Friday night my dear friend Claire arrived to stay the weekend as we were attending a Trunk Show together, further up the Island.I didn't know it but Claire had secretly finished my gifts for our Tilda Swap.  When I walked into the Lounge later in the evening - she had laid out these boxes all tied up with ribbon & handmade Tags spelling the word T I L D A  ... I thought my heart was going to stop I got such a surprise !!                                       Would you like to see what was in the boxes ?? 💗 \"T\" is for Teacup pincushion, tea, tea coaster, teabag holder, tea strainer & below ... the most beautiful string of teapots & teacups - all sewn in gorgeous Tilda fabrics.The right hand photo is where I have hung my teapot strand & it looks perfect there 💙 (& is also high enough that it's out of reach of a certain ginger furry being)A little vignette on my vintage scales left - & right ... the teacup pincushion sits in my sewing roomThis afternoon is the first opportunity I have had to do a few little displays with my new treasures so I shall pop the photos in for the ones I have done so far.Click on the photos to enlarge & see the detail in the Iceskate !!\"I\" is for Iceskate, Icecream & Initial (J)I attached a mini quilt hanger to my Initial & hung it in my sewing room with the Icecream pinned to it. I have also saved all the handmade tags as the fabrics all matched the items.(The Iceskate is popped away til Christmas)\"L\"  is for Little birdhouses, little birdhouse quilt & lavender filled angel wings 💕Another little corner display arranged today .... fairy lights & all.\"D\" is for Dachshund Dog, doilies & dishcloths & last but by no means Least ...\"A\" is for Angel .... & there were Two of them !!!!Oh be still my beating heart 💗💓I think I should mention here - when we decided to do the swap we vaguely set the end of May as our deadline.  I worked away on mine over 3 months & took it down on my last trip to Mum's due to the fact that it was too big to post.  Claire works full time & still managed to create all of the above in just over two weeks time!!!We both agreed that we just LoVed what each other had made & we should definately do this again sometime !! 😊Saturday morning we were up bright & early as we had to travel almost two hours to attend the Tilda Trunk Show.  You can read a bit more about it on House of Patchwork's Facebook page.  My lovely friend Shirley also came along as she is a Tilda Lover too.Inside it was almost wall to wall Tilda & I thought I just might have died & gone to Heaven !!Alot of my photos have come out blurry so this is just a small selection of what was on offer.Yes Please .... I'll take one of everything !!! 😉We had booked ourselves into the morning class also which took just over an hour & we made the sweet Tilda bags below right.My gorgeous friend busy at work at her machine ... all equipment & materials were supplied - you just had to turn up & create.After our class it was time for some lunch & the Hall Committee Ladies had made a wonderful array of homebaked goodies for us to purchase.  The tables were all set with vintage embroidered tablecloths & vases of handmade Tilda flowers. It was just simply perfect.All in all it was a most wonderful day doing something I really enjoy with the added benefit of my dear friends for company - all 3 of us agreed that it was really well done & we would certainly attend again.These are my purchases above dear friends ... I especially wanted some of the new chambray's that Tilda have released & I was so pleased to get these as well as some Tilda basics & a few florals. Thank You for staying with me through this photo heavy post.  I shall leave you with this photo The Mr sent me this morning. It has turned chilly here now & he has to jump start the tractor at the farm each morning ... he lifts the bonnet of his Ute to attach the jumper leads & Fluffy immediately sits in there where she knows it is warm - has a wash & then a sleep, while The Mr goes & feeds out to the cows. We won't tell Miss Pip or she'll be wanting to get in there too !!! 😉Wishing you all a wonderful weekend dear friends & Thank You as always for your welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Hanging Hearts,  Book Bundles & Thrifting Finds  (Catch Up # 3)", "date": "Sunday, May 2, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers Miss Pippi frets alot when I go away to Mum's & is always contrary for a few days upon my return.  She decided to take up residence in my pretty Tilda-lined Suitcase even tho' she barely fits anymore.  She is sitting on my spools of lace here so you Cannot tell me this is comfortable 😉Immediately after Easter our little Craft Group had another get-together & I taught the ladies to make these hanging hearts.There is a wonderful tutorial right * Here * from Craft With Fee on her YouTube Channel.They are a fun & simple project & easily achievable in a few hours.  The ladies really enjoyed making them & were delighted with their finished hearts.I chose to make mine in pretty Tilda fabrics & embellished with some wooden buttons from Theodora CleaveI tucked a garden Gift Card into it & added a handmade Soy Candle as mine is to be gifted to my sister-in-law.I wanted an autumnal themed centrepiece for my coffee table but had nothing suitable so I decided to make something myself.I took another 3 hardcover books, glued them together & painted them with chalk paint.  Then I went to The Graphics Fairy website & typed in Autumnal Images. I found this gorgeous maple leaf one so printed it off onto photocopy paper & modpodged it onto my books. (these images are all free)Wait until it's completely dry before you cut through the gaps in the book spines or it will tear.This old wooden scroll was in my junk drawer treasure box so I typed out \"Autumn\" & then glued this onto my books with the scroll over the top - I painted the scroll first.  I then wiped the books over with some distressing ink but coffee grinds work just as well if you don't have any ink.  Whilst looking for autumn leaves in the garden I found the sweetest little birds nest fallen from a tree. (the eggs are faux)I pressed some leaves under heavy books - this only took 4 days - & then I did an arrangement on the top of my books using a selection of the leaves & the birdsnest.We are having quite a mild autumn here & I am so enjoying all the colours of the leaves that are falling now. Here is my book bundle displayed on the coffee table - I am so pleased with it 💗I have had the opportunity to frequent the Thrift Stores lately (Op Shops we call them) & have found some real treasure.This sweet little cup above left was only 50c & matches my egg cup perfectly.  The dish on the right was $6 - both at Stratford HospiceThe wooden candlestick was such a bargain - only $9 & it stands 50 cms high.  The hearts were $2 & $4 - I plan to paint the larger one.This china gravy boat was $4 at Salvation Army - it made a perfect candle holder last week when I made another batch of Soy Candles.But I have to say - my favourite find Ever would have to be this sectional mirror - purchased from Habitat for Humanity for $40. It was hidden under about an inch of dust & when I gently cleaned it all off I fell in love with it.I have sat it on The Mr's chest of drawers & it makes me so happy when I walk into the bedroom & see it.The lady told me she had only put it in the Shop about half an hour before I purchased it.  It is Very heavy & I am sure - Very old.                                                                                💗💕💗💕💗💕Some of the detailing up closer. Well dear friends - thank you for staying with me through another lengthy post.  I am sure I am all caught up now. 😊Thank You - as always - for your visits here today.I hope you all have a wonderful week ahead.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "A TILDA Swap  .................... (Catch Up #2)", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers 💕(Warning - Long Post & Photo Heavy)At the beginning of this year my friend Claire & I decided to do a Tilda swap - this entailed each of us making for the other an item from the letters T I L D A .  Claire & I are both dedicated \"Tilda Addicts\" loving both the fabrics & the patterns.  We agreed to have an approximate timeline for our swap as the end of May .... however once I began working on my swap gifts, I found I could not stop.  I had planned a visit to Mums at the end of this month but when she had her fall & I bought my visit forward, I decided to take Claire's swap gifts long with me in the hope that I could catch up with her on this trip. (Claire lives in Mum's town but we don't always get to catch up)When we first decided to do the swap I purchased these wooden letters from Spotlight.  Whilst painting another item I applied some cream chalk paint to them, so to pretty them up a bit I added some small size Re-design transfers. As I didn't want to drill holes in my letters I attached them to each package with double sided tape.Would you like to see what was in each package?? (I will link to the patterns I used & also try to remember the fabric ranges tho' this may be a bit trickier)\"T\" stands for Tea towel, Tilda pumpkin, tea coasters, tea mug & tea ... also tags I knew these were the colours in Claire's kitchen.I took a plain white waffle tea-towel & patchworked a pumpkin block onto it using a mixture of Tilda fabrics from older ranges.The pumpkin block is from this book Tilda's Sewing by HeartWhile I was browsing the book I decided to make Claire a pumpkin - pattern is in the book.  I actually scaled the \"smallest size pumpkin\" down a bit & used matching fabrics to my teatowel block.The Holiday Spices tea was purchased from Harney Teas.I also made a pair of tea coasters using some white linen from my stash & adding a Tilda Yo Yo flower/Suffolk Puff.I took a photo of my pumpkin block & then ordered a tea mug using this personalised service from Vistaprint & had Claire's name printed on it.Lastly I cut out some cute tags using images photocopied onto thin card. (I knew Claire loved tags)\"I\" stands for  \"I 💗 Christmas\"(Yes I know I bent the rules a bit on this one 😉).  .  .  .  I made Claire a Tilda SantaThis Santa pattern is from this book Tilda's Christmas IdeasClaire decorates her entire home for Christmas so I knew that making her anything in this line would not be out of order & was fairly sure she did not have this Santa.Underneath all that mohair beard he does have some eyes - the white wooden stand is for him to perch on but I thought Claire may even decide to hang him.I am pretty sure this fabric is from the Tilda Old Rose range.The pattern book comes complete with the drum which you photocopy onto thin card & make up - his other pocket holds his drumsticks. (toothpicks with beads glued on)I included one of the tags I made earlier in the year & a card of gorgeous Christmas buttons from Theodora Cleave\"L\" stands for Lovely little linen table runner & lavender bags 💜I used this Video tutorial from Crafts with Fee's YouTube channel to make Claire a table runner with Applique & Prairie points.  I know I frequently mention Fee's channel as she shares such wonderful projects.  I used a mixture of Tilda Maple Farm & Woodland fabrics for this project.  The grey linen was in my stash & was left over from this bunting that I made recently.The table runner is reversible & can be used on either side.  I enlarged it slightly from Fee's measurement.I made two lavender bags using English Paper Pieced hexagons - the linen was already in my stash & the lavender is from this years harvest.\"D\" stands for Doll .... Tilda Fisher Doll with her Whale(I had to quickly take all my photos before I left for Mums hurriedly so the light is very poor & yellowish unfortunately)This pattern is from this book Tilda's Seaside Ideas - which I borrowed from my local Library.The doll is dressed in Tilda Plum Garden fabrics - one of my favourite ranges.I had no matching fabric paint for her boots so I just used my pale blue chalk paint & it worked out fine.  This particular pattern has the sweetest little cardigan that laces at the neck, the pattern of which is in the book.  I knitted up to the underarms & then just could Not figure out the pattern from there.  I even took it to my clever-knitting-friend-Shirley for advice but she found the same. So I unpicked it & knitted a tiny dolls Jumper pattern which I Could figure out.  I made the smallest size whale, pattern also in the book - this was fun to make.\"A\" stands for Angel ... Tilda Autumn Angel & her PlumAutumn Angel is a free pattern from * Here * on the Tilda WebsiteI used gorgeous Maple Farm Fabrics for my Autumn Angel.    I purchased these fabrics from * Here *I made myself this pattern almost two years ago - blog post here  & still really love my Autumn Angel. I extended the apron quite a bit & added the pompom trim, the same as I did for my Angel.  The Plum is also a free pattern on the website.Well friends you can see why I could not post all that & wanted to hand deliver it.  I also wanted to see Claire's face when she opened each package & afterwards she may have shed a tear or two - she was so delighted with all her treasures.  Claire is one of the kindest, most generous people I know & it was such a pleasure to make this for her & bring her some Joy.  I thought long & hard about her colours & what she might like & was pleased to say I got it just right.  (If you are on Instagram you can follow along with Claire * Here *If you made it all the way to the end - Thank You So Much !I shall be back in a few days with my final Catch Up Post.Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Away ............................ & Back Again  (Catch Up #1)", "date": "Friday, April 23, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers,I have been away unexpectedly .... my elderly Mum had another fall (her 2nd in a month) so I dropped everything & drove down to be with her.  I returned home again this week & have decided to try to resurrect my poor neglected blog.Because I have not posted since before Easter I have decided to write a series of \"catch up posts\" going back to Easter & moving forward from there - please humor me with this dear friends 😉Easter was quiet in our house - believe me when I say Quiet is perfectly fine by me!   The Mr is right in the middle of autumn calving so he is gone early for most of the day.  I decided to sew a rabbit for myself that I had earmarked approximately 2 years ago to make - good things take time dear friends 😊The pattern is called Hareloom Easter Rabbit & is by American Designer Gini Simpson of \"Cat and the Fiddle Designs\" (can find no link to this sorry)  The pattern is out of an old Homespun Magazine No. 58 (Vol 9.3)I had a beautiful vintage chenille (candlewick) bedspread that was threadbare in many places  .... I decided to take the plunge & cut into this to make the rabbits skirt.  It was okay because I had Miss Pippi to oversee & talk me through this nerve-wracking process !!I'm really pleased I used the candlewick as it is so beautiful & up close it looks like tiny hand embroidered rosettes.The face took quite a bit of work as it's been quite sometime since I've painted a dolls face & the nose & cheeks are stuffed to make it appear 3-dimensional.  I had to take my time & frequently walk away from it for a break. The lace & ribbon rose at the ear are my own embellishment.I had a 9 cm pair of dolls shoes in my stash which were much smaller than the pattern required so I cut the foot down quite a bit when sewing the legs. The socks were bright white but I tea-dyed them & added the rosettes to the shoe. The egg was just an Easter decor item that I had which fit perfectly stitched to her hand.I finished her on the Tuesday after Easter & I just LoVe her 💕 & have decided Not to pack her away with my Easter things - she can stay out all year round & I can enjoy her.  I have tried to think of a name for her & for some reason Milly keeps coming to mind. Any suggestions dear readers?While I was in the rabbit-making-mood I decided to make a customer order.  Joy had asked for a Tilda rabbit & I explained it wouldn't be done before Easter but she was fine with that. Her preference was autumy colours.She came together quite quickly & the dress is made from Tilda fabric - I added one of my primitive wooden carrots.  Joy was delighted with her & has now asked me to make a similar one wearing dungarees.This is a free pattern from * Here * on the Tilda Website (scroll about 3/4's of the way down the page)Two elderly customers had ordered new wheatbags so I was able to run these up as I found a large bag of wheat in my freezer.  I keep it in here as it stops the weevils getting in to it ... I also toss a handful of lavender in my wheatbags but this is optional.Also over Easter I began working on a large Soy Candle Order - I have 20 to make & have the vintage glassware ready to go but have been held up waiting for more Soy Wax to arrive.  I was able to make 10 before I ran completely out of wax & then - just today - my wax order has arrived.I also made The Mr his favourite Weetbix slice & picked several large bowls of cherry tomatoes. I grew these in big black buckets this year & they are still producing great quantities of tomatoes.The autumnal colours of the hydrangeas are still beautiful even though the garden is fading.  I picked these just prior to heading to Mum's & they are still drying in their vase.I should mention my Mum is now doing much better & improved immensely during the time I was there.  I have much more to share with you dear friends so I will be back in a few days with Catch Up #2.Thank You as always for your welcome visits here today,With much love & friendship to you All, 💗Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Some Easter Decorating  -  Threadbear Style", "date": "Saturday, April 3, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersSome simple & inexpensive Easter decorating has been taking place here at Threadbear HQ over the past couple of weeks & I thought I would share a few ideas with you 💕 These rabbit picks were purchased at my local Variety Store - a pack of 6 for $2.50.  I painted them all in different pastel shades when I had my testpots out doing other painting bits & bobs. They only needed one coat each - I also trimmed their bases as they were a bit long for my requirements. (sorry I did not get a \"before pic\")I found some oasis/floral foam in my stash (tho' if you do need to buy it the Variety Stores are the cheapest). I also found some dried moss left over from Christmas & a couple of vintage china teacups with matching saucers. You can remove all this afterwards so you are not forfeiting your good china cups.  Cut some oasis to fit in your cups, cover with the dried moss & then poke your rabbit picks in - I did not use any glue whatsoever & they stay in nice & securely.Such a sweet little Easter display.  I came across this tiny knitted jumper in a box.  My Mum used to knit these for me when I made a small Golly called Teenie Weenie Golly.  This was my one last Jumper so I thought I would make a rabbit to fit into it.     I used the free bunny pattern on the Tilda website. (scroll right down nearly to the bottom of the page)I decided to make my rabbit some dungarees instead of the dress in the pattern.  I drafted off a simple pattern with no bib as I didn't want to cover up too much of the jumper.  I used some of my treasured Tilda fabrics for the body & the dungarees & gave her a prim carrot to tuck in her pocket.I was thrilled with how my bunny turned out & when a customer saw it she immediately wanted to purchase it so bunny has now flown to the South Island to live & I shall have to attempt to knit another Jumper myself (& won't that be fun dear friends) 😉This simple silver stand was an Op Shop purchase for $5 last year sometime.    I painted it with some pale duck egg chalk paint while I was painting my rabbit picks.  Two coats & it was well covered.  I had been wanting to make some scatter eggs as featured on Craft With Fee's YouTube channel.    Here is the link to the tutorial should you wish to go look at it. I just love everything Fee creates. 💗The eggs were such a simple fun project to make & just used up some scraps of felt & fabrics. I made 5 but could easily have kept going I think. I stitched some pom pom trim & ric rac trim to a rabbit teatowel & then hung it from a piece of thin dowel - it makes a pretty Easter wallhanger but once again, can easily be dismantled & re-used.On Thursday 1st April we celebrated Sid's 4th birthday - his only request was for a dinosaur cake which his Mummy made for him complete with a volcano & lava.  It's hard to believe this dear little Pipsqueak has turned 4.  Some simple Easter decorating that I have done this year - I just enjoy the pastels at this time of year so much.You may remember when I made the table runner last Easter in this post * Here * Dear Jenny wrote a post * Here * last week about how lucky we are nowadays with our appliances & what it used to be like in our Grandparents era.  I left Jenny a comment to say I well remember Mum using an old wringer washing machine & how it would jam - I have one now that is planted with Impatiens in a part of my garden & folk are always drawn to it when they visit.  Jenny asked to see a photo of it so I thought I would share it here.Which reminds me - when I planted it last Spring I put two punnets of Impatiens in it - one red & one white ... as you can see, mixed up labels again 😊These autumn days are beautiful with that real nip in the air now & some leaf fall starting.  I have bought the banana box out of the woodshed & filled it with clean blankets - Miss Pip saw me bringing it up the steps & was in like a lightening bolt.Wishing you all a very blessed Easter dear friends - thank you so much for your visits here today 💕With much love & friendship To You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Rabbits, Carrots  ......................................... & Teasel Hedgehogs", "date": "Wednesday, March 24, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersGoodness I did not mean to be gone for so long 😉 (again!!)After the two Primitive Rabbits I made in my last Post to give my Grandsons for Easter, I decided to make one for the biggest kid of all ...... Yes - Yours Truly !!Once again I had an oddment from an old candlewick bedspread.  When I got the name tags made for my Grandsons I also got one made for the actual name of the Rabbit Pattern  - \"Wesberry Wabbit\" Of course I had to give her a Tilda scarf 💜She is displayed on my old Telephone Table amongst a few Easter decorations & I love looking at her sweet little face.I think it was on Pinterest that I first saw the idea of taking apart wooden clothes pegs & then gluing them back to back to make into carrots.  I thought the sizing of these would be perfect to go with my little Tilda Rabbits - A free download from Here (scroll nearly down to the bottom of the page)However - I didn't want bright orange carrots - I wanted more of a salmon pinky colour.  I mixed together some yellow, pink & dark red paints until I was happy with the colour & then painted my carrots.  I used some Dark Green Perle thread for their carrot tops which I hot glued on.They are just the right size (& colour) to accompany the Tilda Rabbits I am making 💗I wanted a jug to keep my Easter Egg Picks in ... the one I used last year was pretty but it got broken.  I saw a lovely pastel one Online with flowers on it, but the price tag was $40 plus $9 freight.  $49 for a Jug .... I don't think so 😕.  I saw the green one above left in Hospice for $3 .... perfect size - wrong colour  ... I painted it with my pale duck egg chalk paint then sanded it ever so lightly.  I applied some oddments of transfers that I had left over & scuffed the edges of my Jug just slightly before waxing it.Seriously dear friends ... you do Not need to spend alot of money to get what you are after ... just try thinking outside the square sometimes.The second hand Bookstore in my local village of Kihikihi has a large cart out front with Free Books written on it.  It is full of hard cover & paperback books & they are All Free !!    I came away with an armload last week as I was more than happy to help her disperse with some books 😉.  I removed the dust covers, hot glued 3 of  them together, & then chalk painted them.    I downloaded the Hare Picture free from The Graphics Fairy onto plain photocopy paper I modpodged the picture onto the books & then cut through each gap individually ... before tying with some twine & faux greenery. I thought it made a very cute Easter display with my mossy rabbit on top. (I also distress inked the edges of the books to give a time worn look)There is a really great tutorial here on Julies designs & signs YouTube channel where I got my inspiration for the book bundles. It is well worth a watch as she explains the whole process very clearly.Before I sign off dear friends I have had a few emails & comments left lately requesting the pattern for my Teasel Hedgehogs. Unfortunately when you come through as a no-reply-blogger I am unable to contact you to pass it on - so I will insert the instruction sheet here for you to copy off & also if anyone is wanting pictures of the Teasel Hedgehogs then go to this post Here from 2017 ... & there are lots of photos from the class I taught.                                           Have a lovely rest of the week dear friendsRemember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Farm Life, Juno 💕  ....  & Primitive Rabbits", "date": "Thursday, March 11, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersFrom time to time my dear bloggy friend Woodfairy Betty asks to see more aspects of farm life so I thought I would share some in this post.I rarely get called upon to help on the farm these days but lately I have been helping out a bit due to our Milker/Farm Worker being on a months holiday.   Last Saturday I went out to help The Mr with some fencing & a few days prior we tagged cows together.This is the Farm Buggy that I got to drive down the farm - I had to follow The Mr in his digger as we put in alot of new fence posts along the main race. We also moved the Herd.  The cows are dry at present but will be calving in early autumn. They were happy to get a fresh paddock with some grass in it.  We own the Herd but not the farm & we milk 220 Freisian Cross cows, which by todays standards is considered a small size Herd.This is how you fence on Peat Country ... also how you shift heavy concrete troughs.  The farm is 288 acres & is all flat.  We replaced many broken fence posts in the main race & the two farthest paddocks.On the way back the clouds rolled in & the rain started.  And there was Fluffy waiting on the cold concrete cowshed yard - waiting for The Mr ... certainly Not Me 😉On Sunday Juno & her parents came to visit, which was lovely as it had been The Mr's birthday during the week.  Look at the arrow in the top left hand pic & you can see there was a certain someone who did Not think Juno's visit was lovely.She very much enjoyed the pond which I have been busy working on lately & trying to clear & sort out - it was much neglected (by me !!) 😉She also enjoyed the morning tea I made including (birthday) chocolate cake, home made sausage rolls & pikelets.  It's hard to believe Juno will turn one next month.I came across this very old Homespun Magazine last year during our Lockdown when I re-read & culled alot of my craft magazines.I had always wanted to make the chenille rabbit in there called Ms Wesberry Wabbit - a pattern by Melissa Duncan of Mogs Designs.When I saw online that Love from Seventeen were reducing all their Easter tags I ordered one each for my Grandsons - at half price I could not resist.Fast forward to a whole year later & I actually got to make the Rabbits.  I had some candlewick fabric that I found in my stash, remnants of an old bedspread so I cut out two rabbits to make up for the grandsons for Easter.I put the finishing touches to them yesterday - instead of wire for the whiskers as the pattern suggested, I just used some leather thonging I had.  I love the quirky, slightly Primitive look to them.Now I am under no illusions that the grandsons will much prefer their chocolate Rabbits but I have packaged everything up ready to give them at Easter time.Thank You for staying with me through this photo-heavy post dear readers(Just a small note before I sign off .... I was asked a question from Loraine UK but I cannot find a way to reply  as you come up as a no-reply-blogger. If you go back to my post dated Friday July 28th 2017 where you asked the question - you will see I have replied to you in the comments section.)Wishing you a wonderful rest of the week. 💕With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Welcome to March ❤", "date": "Thursday, March 4, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers & Welcome to March 💗March is officially the first month of Autumn here in New Zealand & I must admit I am enjoying that little nip in the air after our hot dry summer. I picked a straggly vase of roses as we were forecast rain this week but it hasn't amounted to much & the ground is still very dry.I had the most delightful surprise package arrive all the way from Australia last week from Sue of                 Kiwikids blogEverything was packaged just So Beautifully !! I had admired some beautiful upcycled silver spoons that Sue had featured on her Instagram page - so when the lady that creates them put more up for sale, Sue chose two & sent over to me as a gift.As you all know - I just LoVe 💚anything that is giving new life to something old ... I poked them in a plant that sits on my bench top so I can look at & enjoy them whenever I am at the sink.   Thank You SO much Sue for your thoughtfulness.Also a wee Thank You gift last week from a young Moto Cross rider - I mended her torn Moto X pants & she gave me this beautiful pink begonia as a Thank You. I have planted it in an old metal bucket & it seems quite happy there.(Click on the pic to enlarge to see the sorry state this was in)When Sue came to visit back in January she tossed me this vintage wooden drawer set that she had thrifted at some stage, but decided she no longer wanted.  It was heavy solid wood & the drawers were lined with very stained fabric so I imagine it had been used as Jewellery or Makeup drawers at some stage.I scrubbed it & then gave it two coats of cream chalk paint in the colour Vintage White. I ended up having to give it a 3rd coat as some of the original stain bled through my paint.When I was happy with my coverage, I found some remnants of transfers that I had cut in to & added a few to take the plain-ness away from the drawers.I removed the old fabric that was glued in the drawers & used a scraper to remove excess glue.  Then I covered some cardboard with wadding & fabric & re-lined the drawers.  After painting they did not slide in & out so easily so I ran an old candle along the bottom edges of them & this made a huge improvement.The wee drawer set fits perfectly on the end of my sewing bench & I look forward to filling it with some sewing notions.I follow the blog A Spoonful of Sugar  & saw this sweet Easter pattern featured at the weekend.  It is now so simple to just click \"purchase\" & it's instantly uploaded to your inbox - no longer waiting weeks for patterns to arrive in the post.I first made a pink version - it is so handy when you have a large scrap bin of offcuts to go through & I was able to find a nice selection of pink fabrics to make it up.  I enjoyed it so much that the next morning I enlarged the pattern on my copier & made up a blue version.This is more of a placemat size & Yes I went through my scrap bin again but also tossed in some offcuts of Tilda fabrics.  I am really happy with my coasters & it has made me feel like pulling out my Easter decorations now that we are into March & Easter is only about a month away. (I should note here that I am supposed to be working on a large Candle Order but am waiting on an Order of Soy Wax to arrive & as Auckland is once again in Level 3 Lockdown - the postage is taking forever to get anywhere.)  Many of you comment or email me when I do a post that doesn't feature my two furry friends so I thought I would show you where they both are today as I sit typing this post.   Miss Pippi is on the spare bed where she is \"warming\" a piece of chenille I pulled out this morning to make a rabbit from,  & Fat Black is tucked away in the back of my Sewing Wardrobe where he has been sleeping since Tuesday when Sid pulled the buckets of toys out to play with - No we are not able to put them away as yet 😉 (but we live in hope)Thank You dear readers for your ever-welcome visits here today,I hope the week is going well & treating you all kindly,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "More Orders  .............................. & The Dinosaurs Came To Town  (!!)", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersIt has been another busy week filling Orders that have come in recently ....I bagged up 10 bags each of Cottage Garden & Citrus/Clove potpourri's & sent over to The Farm Shop at Gordonton as they had completely sold out.(Not sure why my picture is showing the pinky colour at the bottom)Kerrin emailed me to ask if I could please make her another 6 handy kitchen hanging towels ... I had made her some several years ago & she loved them & used them every day.Her request was for No bright colours please so I kept to a fairly pastel colour palette.  I knew she absolutely loved anything paisley so I was able to find enough paisley fabrics in my stash to make up 6 different ones.My friend Vicky's son & partner are having their first child & are not going to find out the babies sex beforehand.  They have done up the nursery beautifully using natural caneware & complimented with greys/mustards & a hint of turquoise.     Vicky asked me to make a bunting in these colours so she can give to them at their baby shower.I had the natural linen in my stash & my friend Gail gave me some  grey linen to go with it.  I purchased the cute novelty print fabric from my local Patchwork Shop & was able to fussy cut out the letters making sure I got the little animals in.  I found a nice light mustard fabric in my stash so used this to make the binding.Vicky was delighted when I delivered the bunting yesterday.In the middle of the week a surprise parcel arrived from my friend Joy of  The Joy Within .  Joy decoupages these sweet wooden hearts & had been sending out a few to friends for Valentine's Day.  I just adored the one she had made for me 💗As my sewing room had undergone a long-overdue tidy up this week I decided to hang my heart right above my sewing table where I could see & enjoy it while I worked.This photo above is looking up at our house from the back part of our property.  I was walking up from the pond last week & noticed how pretty my hanging baskets of geraniums were looking at present.  (& look at that blue, blue sky 💙)I first grew the one above left from a cutting from my Mum & once it was established I started two more cuttings off last summer.  You can see the other two baskets in the photo's above right.  They seem to do well here despite the wind that can whip through this area.Last Sunday I took Sid & his parents to see The Amazing Dinosaur Discovery which was in our part of the Country.I love this photo above though it wasn't always like this & he was a bit overwhelmed & frightened at first but once he settled down, he really enjoyed it - as did his Granny 😉I thought it was really well set up & enjoyed looking at the models & reading the information about each one.Sid's favorite dinosaur is a Carnotaurus which is in the photo below left.I liked the fact that there were lots of interactive activities there ... Sid got to dig for fossils above He got to climb up high inside a dinosaur Bouncy Castle ... & to color in Dinosaur pictures.He got his face painted with Dinosaur horns & his Daddy stuck his hand in a dinosaur's mouth (!!) 😉  It was such a fun & enjoyable Sunday outing.Thank You all So Much for your visits here today dear friendsEnjoy the rest of your week & remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Orders .................... & Cleaning the Back Deck Area", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2021", "text": "💗 Greetings lovely friends & readers 💗I came home from Mum's with this sweet china teacup & saucer - a favorite of Mum's but it had a tiny chip in the rim so I offered to make a teacup birdfeeder for Mum from it.Here I am trying it out in my garden  As I have had a steady stream of Orders come in this past week I thought it was high time I made a start ...Ali requested 2 wheatbags in darker colors - I put a generous handful of lavender in each one to make them smell nice & posted them away to her.My lovely friend Jane had purchased this gorgeous length of vintage fabric - ? Sanderson.  She asked me to sew it up into a simple bolster style cushion for her & fill with wadding.I finished off another Christmas Tag using one of Barb's beautiful wooden buttons won in her Giveaway I have had to go over to the city twice in the last fortnight for Appointments so I took myself off to Spotlight.  Browsing the aisles this beautiful hessian caught my eye. The lace edging is painted on & I thought it would be perfect for my outdoor table so I bought 3 metres.  It was only $6 per metre & I had a $10 off coupon.I overlocked each end, then gave my outdoor table a really good scrub & left it to dry in the sunshine. I loved the new table runner & it fit just perfectly.Now friends I kid you not ......  No Sooner had I put it on the table, stood back to admire it, & Princess Pippi appeared ... sashaying down the runner like a catwalk. I think I lay the runner down, blinked - & she appeared 😉After her usual investigating, sniffing & giving it approval - she lay down on it & went to sleep for the entire afternoon !!Whilst buying the runner length I noticed this paw print hessian so I bought a metre of this also as my outdoor cushions were looking rather shabby & falling to bits.  I re-used the existing inners & just made fresh new covers - Blackie tested them out for me for softness & comfort 😉I also scrubbed down the old dog kennel which I use as a kind of potting bench on my deck. The curtain I had on it had long since gone threadbare so I found this nice floral fabric in my stash & sewed up another curtain.  A new length of oilcloth just finished it off nicely.  Gosh I wish I had taken a \"before pic\"  -  what a difference!!Today is Valentine's Day so I would like to wish you all a wonderful Valentine's Day however you choose to spend it.As I had some banana's going black I made The Mr a banana cake - I am going to leave it uniced as The Mr dislikes icing & I will just sprinkle some icing sugar on it instead.It smells so delicious straight from the Oven & I am thinking it may not last long once we cut into it - I am off to put the kettle on friends. Thank You all So Much for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Another Week Zipped on by ......................................", "date": "Sunday, February 7, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersWell another week has zipped on by & here we are into February already !!Whenever I need to just pop to town briefly, I quickly throw a linen dress on & toss my round-the-house-tatty-cotton-dress on the spare bed.  I hadn't realised Miss Pip was shut inside & came home to her curled up sound asleep on my house dress & did not have the heart to move her. Alec does not return to school until next Tuesday so he came to stay at Granny's for awhile this past week.  We went to the Park, the Library & then to the local Berry Farm for an icecream cone. There are raspberries & blackberries available for picking at present so we picked a punnet of raspberries tho' alot went into a small boy's mouth I noticed 😉We went to the Garden Centre as I had a voucher from Christmas.  We bought Petunias & Busy Lizzies to fill some pots that had long since past their best.  I also bought a new pair of Gardening Gloves as mine were full of holes.While Alec watered the garden (& most of me !!) I filled another 8 bottles of Worm Tea.  (This is the liquid residue that comes from my Worm farm & makes wonderful plant food)I Wish I had taken a \"before pic\" of this ceramic pot from Mum's. She had used it to soak some old paint brushes in - obviously the paint had been brown as that is the color the pot was! I spent many hours of elbow grease scrubbing the outside & the inside to get it clean, then put it through the dishwasher a couple of times.  The inside was still a bit stained but the outside came up well.I applied a Re-design transfer to it & potted up some babies tears - it goes nicely in my bathroom on the end of the bath.I always follow Down to Earth Rhonda's advice & toss my tatty old dishcloths in the rag bag at the start of a New Year.  I have been knitting up my cotton/bamboo oddments & now have 4 fresh new dishcloths to use ... & will continue doing this as I have lots of scraps of the cotton yarn to use up.  Another way I like to start the New Year is with a new Ironing Board Cover.  This heavy duty cotton fabric was in my stash so I sat on the floor yesterday, traced around my old ironing board cover & made a new one.  As I use the ironing board so much for craft work etc my covers get a hard time & I just LoVe having a fresh new one 💕My stepson sent through this gorgeous little photo of Juno wearing the dress I gifted her at Christmas time.  The sweet dress was made by my friend Julie who sews/blogs under the label bo and coI thought I would share this delightful photo of Darcy - Sid's newest family member.  She has bought such joy into their lives & although she looked like she had \"rolled in coal dust\" when she first arrived, I notice how much she is lightening & going quite caramel. She honestly has the sweetest nature.Wishing you all yet another great week ahead dear friends,Thank You as always for your visits here today - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0(NO idea why that has come out super huge dear readers - blogger does my head in sometimes !!! 😕)"},
{"title": "Home From Mum's", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersI have returned from my trip down to my Mum's & these two have not let me out of their sight since my return. Yes - you see correctly dear friends .... they are on the good bedspread Again 😕 (!!)I must mention - the morning I got up early to travel, Blackie bought me in a little \"leaving gift\"  -  & left it on the dining room carpet where I very nearly stood in it !! (Tho' my photography is not showing it's full size - it is indeed a rat !!)Mum has a wooden fence that runs the entire width of her property - my brother had water blasted this fence but not got around to staining it.  I offered to do it while I was there.  I have to say - about 5 minutes into this project I wished I had kept my mouth shut tight. It was a horrid job & took me 3 days in the hot sun to get 2 good coats on both sides.            I was very pleased & relieved to complete this job & Mum was happy.I took Mum to the crematorium where Dad's ashes are scattered & we took flowers as we usually do. It is so nice to see the silk flowers from the previous visits are still there along with the little plaque that Mum has put there for Dad. We had not been to visit this spot for nearly 2 years. Mum has lost yet more weight.  I realised she is giving her delivered hot meals to her \"new friend\" - a stray cat that visits daily crying with hunger.  I went to the Supermarket & bought a couple of big bags of dry cat food & set up a little tray down the back where Mum had been throwing her hot meals.  By the time I left the cat was eating the dry food.  I was able to pat it on one occasion but I did get hissed at too - underneath all that fur he/she was very bony.While waiting on a prescription for Mum I had approximately 5 minutes to do a quick scour of the 2 Op Shops that are opposite each other in Mum's small town - Hospice & the SPCA.  I was thrilled to find all this vintage glassware for the sum total of $24.00. I have a large Candle Order to complete & am rather short of vintage glassware containers.  These have all been put through my dishwasher & have come out sparkling.It has been very dry while I was away & nothing got watered so much of the veggie garden is going to seed.  The tomatoes are just starting to ripen at long last & this was my pickings this morning - courgettes, a cucumber & some tomatoes. The lillies outside my dining room window were bent over from the winds, so I picked a couple of big stems to enjoy inside,  tied the remaining ones up & gave them a good watering with the sprinkler.  I know lots of folk don't like the fragrance of lillies inside but I just love them 💗This dahlia decided to put on it's very first bloom.  This is Cafe au lait - I had to put my name down for these bulbs at my local Garden Centre & wait a whole year for the bulbs to come in. I bought two packs (they limited numbers) & planted them not far from each other - this one has come up but the other has not showed its head above ground.  These heads are the size of a dinner plate. I bought this terracotta pot home from Mum's shed - she has alot she no longer uses.  I scrubbed it yesterday & painted it with a new colour chalk paint - Pumice by Reloved Boutique.This morning I applied a Re-design transfer to it & waxed it well.  It is a birthday gift for a friend who I am catching up with tomorrow.I like to paint the inside too when it is to be planted as I feel it protects the outside paint & transfer quite a bit more.This vintage enamel wall vessel has been sitting on The Mr's work bench for over a year now a very long time.  Finally while I was away he managed to fashion me a little tap to screw into the hole in the bottom where a tap would have originally been.  I was delighted.This morning I applied an Iron Orchid Design transfer to brighten it up a little - I just LoVe it so much 💕 & would like to sit some dried flowers in the top at some stage.Thank you as always for your very welcome visits today dear friends,I hope the coming week is good & kind to you all - a shiny new week tomorrow And a shiny new month,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Buttons,  Tags,  Hearts  & a Frame", "date": "Saturday, January 23, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersSometime back in very early December I entered a competition run by Barb of Theodora Cleave.  I really love Barb's buttons .... well everything she designs really - & I subscribe to her online newsletter which is where I first read about the competition.You had to share a Tradition you engage in each Christmas so I emailed Barb & shared one I had begun with my own sons & now continue with my grandsons.  In the hectic leadup to Christmas I must admit I forgot all about entering until Barb's email popped into my inbox informing me I was one of the two winners.  I was so delighted & a couple of weeks ago Barb's box of goodies arrived - all packaged up beautifully like opening the most special advent calendar. Oh My !!!!  I could barely breathe .... the packages just kept on coming.  How special I felt that day & my mind was spinning with projects & things to create with the beautiful array of buttons & handprinted ribbons I had won 💕💗The week following my receiving the prize I decided it was high time I actually did something with some of the buttons!!   These two tags above were my first attempt - they are a pattern from an old Christmas issue of Simply Vintage Magazine - pictured below.I love to pull my old copies of these out & go through them & always seem to find a new project I wish to make.Two dear friends have birthdays early next month - both are in their 70's & have homes full of \"stuff \" but both love their gardens so I decided to get them each a Garden Voucher.I follow Craft With Fee on YouTube & came across this wonderful tutorial for making these hanging heart pockets - I hope the link works here okay ...     https://youtu.be/Z_8rRFFrt4YI thought the pockets would be ideal to pop the Garden Voucher in rather than buying a birthday card.  I used some of the buttons from Barb to adorn my pockets instead of the applique flowers that Fee used on hers. A couple of dried lavender sprigs & the voucher tucked in ... just perfect.  I bought my vouchers from Mitre 10 which is a large hardware store here in New Zealand but each branch has a wonderful Garden Centre inside it.  It's a pity their brand colors are orange & not nice pastel colors to match my heart pockets 😉Jenny of elefantz encourages us to pull out our \"orphan stitcheries\" & turn them into something.  I came across this one in a box which is originally a Jenny design.  I decided to make it up into a pincushion & then filled it with crushed walnut shell which keeps your pins nice & sharp.  Although I tossed it in my pressie box, I actually pulled it out again as I decided I could do with a nice new pincushion to start the New Year off.This picture was an Op Shop purchase for $10 - bought for the frame & Not the picture which was very faded, rubbed & worn in areas.  I painted right over the entire thing with my Voodoo Molly Vintage Chalk Paint in the color Old Linen.  The Mr was watching me & nearly had a seizure ... \"for all you know it might be a Rembrandt\" he stated.   For $10 from Hospice I somehow doubt it!!! 😉I had a section of the transfer left over from when I did the Nesting Tables in my last post & wanted to use them up.  I cut several of them out & spread them around to fit them inside my frame.  I especially loved the finished effect when I rubbed the frame over with some silver gilding wax that my friend Gail had loaned me. Hard to show up in my photograph but the wax just bought out the filigree in the frame so well.  My picture looks great hanging just above the Nesting Tables in my dining room.Well dear friends - although I would dearly LoVe to go to my Craft Room & play - I am actually off to pack a bag as I head to my Mum's early tomorrow morning.  Thank You as always for your visits here today.Wishing you a wonderful weekend - be good & kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

She's Waving Her Brush Again (!!!)", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readersThe day after I returned from my Kinloch trip I decided to clean out the entire Sleepout.  This involves hauling nearly everything out & Hopefully NOT putting it all back in again 😉This Nest of tables had been in the back of my sleepout for about 5 years now - given to me by a customer when I ran my Craft Cottage.  I was only just into painting/upcycling then but had thought I could do something with them. If you click to enlarge the pic you can see the blistering of the varnish in the right hand photoAs you can see they were Not in a good state of repair - the thick shiny varnish on them had blistered & peeled & the main table had a crack right through it.  I knew they would require some work & not just slapping a coat of paint on them. 😉  I sanded & sanded the small nesting tables first while The Mr glued the split with PVA & clamped it for a couple of days.  The large table required the most work & the varnish did not want to lift on this one.After sanding the smaller tables they changed colour somewhat from the dark brown they had been.  I washed the dust off them & dried them in the sunshine.Because it is now so hot here, it is not good for painting outdoors as the paint dries too fast - so I set myself up a \"painting station\" down the end of my lounge in the cool - as I knew this project was going to take several days/a week to complete.(I'm not sure why the right hand photo is showing the cream table as yellowish)As all our shops were closed still this was very much a case of using up what I had on hand.    I had decided to paint the nesting tables in different pastels so I had to find colors that complimented each other.  The main table & one small table are painted in Aged White,  The pink is a Resene testpot Pale Rose that I used alot around here & the grey is Grey Mist from Newton's Paints.While I was happy with my color combination I still felt they lacked something so I dug into my supply of Re-design Transfers that I buy from Paint Me Vintage .I absolutely LoVed this one.   I used the main part of the transfer for the big table.  Translated this reads \"A house is made of walls & beams while a home is built with love & dreams\".  How perfect 💕I then scattered some of the remaining transfers on the bottom shelf of the nesting tables but left the tops plain.  I am really happy with the finished effect & the transfers just seem to set it all off nicely.  I also lightly sanded the edges of them to distress them a little.Cup of tea anyone ..... I can give it to you on my new/old nesting tables 💗My lovely friend Jane had given me this plain white cross so while I had my transfers out all over the floor I decided to embellish it a little.  I am so pleased with it & when I texted a photo to Jane she mentioned that she thought I might just be a teeny bit addicted 😉These little tin hearts were 50c a pair from the Stratford Hospice Shop back in this post * here *.   I painted them with my testpots then added some remaining floral transfers & ribbons - they look great hanging on my fireplace bricks. Also in my sleep out was this metal cooking pot. It had been in a banana box of junk treasures that The Mr had come home with at one time.  I decided to paint it for a friend's birthday gift.I LoVe this green chalk paint - it is called Country Green from Newton's Paints.  The pot took 3 or 4 coats to get a good coverage but I was so excited to embellish it.Don't you think the addition of the transfers just finishes it off so nicely dear readers?  I had to stop myself from getting quite carried away but I must say - I LoVe it so much I am just a bit tempted to keep it for myself 😉😊In the midst of all my painting escapades my friend Sue came over for a visit from the city.  We had morning tea here & then drove around the road to Alphra Lavenders - a gorgeous lavender farm about 5 minutes from where I live.  This is the sight that greets you when you get out of your car & you can imagine the fragrance.The mountain in the background is called KakepukuSue took this lovely pic of us both in the midst of all the lavender.Thank You all So Much for your visits today dear friends & for staying with me through this lengthy post.  Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All, Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "These Twixmas Days  (Part 1)", "date": "Thursday, January 7, 2021", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers -  Happy Bright Shiny New Year to you All !!!I read on Lucy's blog that the days in between Christmas & New Year are called Twixmas days.  After the busy-ness of Christmas passes I just love these more relaxed days with less pressure & no meals to cook as plenty of leftovers to consume.  Sometimes it inspires me to craft & create, to garden or just relax with a book.This is how the furry two spent their New Year - tucked up together on the bed !!My New Year celebrations involved a glass of bubbles, an early night with a good book & at least One Cat tucked up beside me - just perfect !!We have welcomed a new furry member to our extended familyAfter the sad passing of dear little Karma in * this post * Sid's family have welcomed a new furry girl into their lives ... dear little Darcy whom is both delightful AND rascally all rolled into one.  She even got to take part in the annual Christmas Photo Shoot.I spent 2 1/2 days putting the Christmas decorations away & this was alot less fun than it was putting them all out.  I came across this stitchery tucked in a Simply Vintage magazine - it is an older pattern by Natalie Bird of The Birdhouse - stitched way back when I ran my craft cottage.  I found some matching fabric in my stash so I bordered & backed it & made the 5 felt pennies that the pattern called for.As I didn't have any spare wire hangers I used this old wooden lace making spindle to hang it from.This sweet little Moptop kitset was a gift from my neighbor for pet feeding duties & I finally found time to make her up using a hot fix rhinestone tool borrowed from a friend.The lace detailing on her felt hat                                          Her beaded \"legs\" under her petticoat I must be honest here & say that although I am pleased with the finished product she was not especially enjoyable to put together & I didn't seem to have enough fingers or hands at times !!! 😉Whilst I was digging out long-forgotten-kitsets I found this one above - an Op Shop purchase for $5 & it had everything included inside to create the 6 wool felt decorations.These were very enjoyable to stitch of an evening & you can either affix a tie to hang them from the tree or a small gift can be fitted inside each one as they are backed with wool felt.  My favorite was the black cat but Sid told me he preferred the sheep 😊In early December I ordered the above pad of Iron Orchid Transfers from * this online store *    - it was not inexpensive but had so much in it - 8 pages of transfers in total.I wanted to affix the Deer's head to a mirror but had nothing suitable - I was so delighted when The Mr picked this one up for me off Facebook Marketplace for a bargain price & wasted no time applying my transferReally tricky to photograph !!  The Mr thought I may want to paint the frame but I loved the slightly coppery rustic look of it all.The day after Boxing Day I headed down to Kinloch - a small bay on the edge of Lake Taupo.  My eldest son & his family have built a holiday home there & younger son & family were also staying in Kinloch.  We had a wonderful family day together. I took a picnic lunch & we went to the Lake edge where we flew kites, & the little ones swam in the crystal clear (but freezing cold) lake water.Even Darcy came along for the day 😊Thank You all So Very Much for your visits here today dear friends,I shall be back soon with Part 2 of my Twixmas escapades.I hope your week is going well ... remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "An Advent Doll & A Pink Parisienne Boot", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2020", "text": "Greetings lovely friends & readers 💗Another Christmas done & dusted - gosh where do the days/weeks go to I wonder ??A vase of flowers picked yesterday - the smaller roses are \"The Fairy\" .... I am unsure what the larger ones are - however their scent is divine & fills the dining room.(Dear little Juno who is almost 9 months old now)We had a wonderful Christmas spread out over about 3 days which is what happens when you have an extended family all with different places they need to be. We got to have an early Christmas tea with Juno & her family which was so lovely - she very much enjoyed the Tilda Angel Mouse I made for her in * this post *The younger ones really make me enjoy Christmas - I get alot of pleasure seeing it through their eyes. Sid tripped over running in his new Batman Jandals & grazed both knees & his cheek so he was looking a little battle worn.The week before Christmas a small bundle of beautiful Liberty fabrics arrived from Millymac SuppliesI had found a completed dolls body in my sewing room (Yes - I really do have dolls bodies lying around my sewing room!!) & I had wanted to make an Advent Angel for quite some time.  I had seen one on a vlog last Christmas & just loved the concept ... so I set about making some clothing using my new Liberty fabrics. The doll pattern is called Friendship Angel by the late Rosalie Dekker designs - I adore Rosie's doll patterns. I made her pantaloons, a dress & some angel wings & then I embellished her with some festive bits that I pinched borrowed from my Christmas tree 😉I used my computer to print out the tags & my friend Sally lent me her numeral stamps to countdown each day.  By the time I completed my Advent Angel I only had \"7 days to go\" but next year I will get to enjoy her for the entire month of December.I thought this tiny snowflake ornament complimented the snowflake theme in her dress.  The mini wreath was made by wiring a piece of greenery & adding a bow.When I posted a pic of her on Instagram it was Boxing Day - my friend Chris left me a comment saying I now needed a tag to read \"thank goodness that's over for another year !!\"  ... I definately think I shall have to make one of those !!! 😉I'm not sure now how I originally founds Kim's gorgeous Sarahlizzies blog but it has become one of my absolute favorite places to visit - filled with beautiful flowers, quilts & vintage gorgeous-ness.  Kim had a giveaway awhile ago & I entered but my name was not drawn out so I was surprised to get an email from her asking for my postal address.  It took a long time for this package to arrive but when my Rural Mail lady delivered this large box my hands were shaking as I opened it up. Inside wrapped up in a beautiful vintage afternoon tea cloth & pink satin ribbon was this beauty .  .  .  .  .  .A Vintage Lace & Embroidered Parisienne Boot (stocking) - Kim's stunning handwork - embellished with such a mouthwatering assortment of vintage bits & bobs, lace, trinkets, doilies, braid, beads, mother of pearl buttons .......................... 💗💗💗The other side was just as stunning - how could you choose which side to display .... Oh My that ribbon gathered rosette just took my breath away !!It was like Kim peeped inside my head & saw all the gorgeous things that I adore & then fashioned them all into a satin & lace Parisienne Boot 💕Seriously dear friends - my photos do Not do justice to all the detail in this !!     I still find that everytime I look at it, I am discovering something new ..........  And so I knew immediately where it would hang ... in my pink Christmas area that I wrote about in my last post - just perfect.  And every time I walk past I see it which is just so special.  Thank You dear Kim from the bottom of my heart for your kindness which sprinkled so much joy into my festive season. Honestly the friends I have made in this little blogging corner of the world are just extra special.(Oh & incidentally - when the Christmas is all packed away for another year this stocking will certainly be staying Out !!)And so dear friends - we close the door on a year that probably none of us have ever experienced before & hope to never again.  What a year it's been & I had such high hopes for 2020 !I hope the coming year brings you what your heart desires dear friends - thank you for always stopping by to visit me here in this little corner of cyberspace - your visits mean more to me than I can ever explain. Take care dear reader - be kind to yourselves & to each other & may the coming year bring you many blessings & joy filled moments.With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

Usually I put the tree up, then fling a few Santa's around & toss the rest of the boxes back in the sleepout. This year - for no apparent reason - I decided to get every single decoration out, repair many of them that needed it, & either display them - or send in a box to the Op Shop.Sid & I started the tree a couple of weeks ago & then my dear friend Carolyn came for lunch so she helped me to finish it.Though I have photographed it at night the lights are not really showing up.              Lets start in my dining room - my vintage Singer Sewing table has a small display of Santa's on itAnd my Vintage Typewriter is in another corner . . .This small cupboard is beside my fireplace with some bits on it -- including the Mossy Gnomes that I made earlier this year.The little Christmas Pudding elf is handmade by me - as are the chalk hearts poking out of the plants on my hearth.I LoVe unpacking the handcrafted items made & gifted from dear friends over the years.A very tiny bit of Christmas in the kitchen including a fresh batch of citrus potpourri in my vintage scales 💗Moving in to the lounge area now .  .  .  .A coffee table Christmas display - Lots of candles & fairy lights everywhereThis was my One Purchase this Christmas - bought while shopping down at Mum's in October with my friend Claire. At her suggestion I added moss to the base & also thread a few more pip berries through it - I especially love it at night time when the fairy lights are turned on.These old ice skates were a Trade Me purchase about 2 or 3 Christmas's ago - I tossed them in the sleepout wardrobe & never thought any more about them.  Last week I pulled them out, scrubbed them & soaked the filthy laces in them - they came up well.  I had an idea in the virtual Pinterest Board that goes around inside my head of what I wanted to do with them 😊I found my bag of faux greenery & berries & hot glued some in the tops of the boots but first I filled each boot with wadding so my greenery would not slip down inside. I had initially thought about putting them on a wreath but I didn't have anything large enough so I found this old chicken mesh frame in my sleepout & they fitted on this perfectly.     I was able to affix them using the laces so they are removable at any time - I tied some rusty stars & bells to them & then wound a faux berry strand around the frame.I'm just so pleased I finally did something with my vintage Ice Skates 💕  Here is the fireplace mantle that I revamped in * this Post * - all decorated for Christmas - I really enjoyed putting this area together.And a little wooden cart of teddies at the base - these Santa Hats are from when I had my Craft Cottage - I would pop them on all the bears & dolls for sale in the Cottage.The top of the Fireplace MantleMore beautiful treasures handmade by special friends 💕(Sid watched me wrap these parcels up so he knows they are just boxes)Under the tree is this vintage cart & some old teddies that I found in a bag in the sleepout wardrobe - the parcels are just wrapped up boxes - I can't put gifts under the tree as yet as it's too hard on the little ones who want to open them 😉A Vintage Feather Tree purchased years ago in AustraliaMore handmade Santa's - these ones are a few years old nowAnd finally - after all the Tilda Reindeer I have made for orders over the years - I finally sat down & made myself one!!This is a lovely pattern in the Tilda Book \"Homemade & Happy\"  - there are 2 sizes & I have made the larger one.I was able to find some mossy branches on my very old Plum Tree for his antlers. Thank You all So Very Much if you have managed to stay til the end (Phew).  I cannot end this post without giving you a link to my friend Claire's Stunning Christmas Home. If you are on Instagram you can go * Here * to see photos & video's of her home - believe me friends - it is well worth a visit.Wishing you a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I added a ribbon & silk rosette to mine & also a little bow on her tail.  I also used some feather wings that I had on hand instead of sewing wings as stated in the pattern.Miss Mousie is going along with the beautiful dress I bought from Bo and Co in this post * here * ... & a sweet little Scottie dog purchased from this gorgeous shop in HaweraJuno's parcel is all tied up & under the tree - it doesn't hurt in the slightest to have a touch of pink at Christmas time The personalised swing tag is from Love from Seventeen online storeIf there was an award for World's slowest knitter I think I could well be in the running ... but I do enjoy knitting the cotton bamboo washcloths of an evening.  I have been knitting up little bundles to gift this Christmas along with a handmade soap - I enjoy making & gifting these so much.Alec came to Granny's for a sleepover on the weekend so we spent an hour at the park & he had a wonderful time on all the equipment.I have been doing quite a bit of Christmas decorating in the house & will be back in a few days with some photos to share with you.  In the meantime have a wonderful week dear friends & thank You SO much as always - for your visits here today.With much love & friendship to you ALL.Love Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

They make these up from offcuts of the larger frames & they are only $5 each.  I purchased 4 of them last month - the glass for them is optional but is no extra cost.I added a bird decal to the right hand one & painted this with my chalk paint - the other one I just scuffed with fine sandpaperI painted two of them as I had made these little handstitched hexies from some Tilda fabrics & vintage linen offcuts & the frames were just the perfect size to fit them in - these have been gifted to a couple of special friends 💕 (I have no idea why that all just came out in really large print but I am leaving it  - please excuse)Last Saturday while it poured with rain I stood at my kitchen bench & worked on a candle order. The request was for French Pear & Pumpkin Spice fragrances & the kitchen did indeed smell beautiful.Thank You all for your kind & encouraging comments regarding my new Oilcloth tablecloth in my last post - I love it so much.When I put it on the table I did my usual \"rave\" to The Mr & to the Universe & anyone else who is listening - how those flipping cats are NOT to get on it!!!!  Well dear friends .... you can see how successful I was with that one !!!!!! 😐Some of you may remember the red cupboard I upcycled in this Post * Here *It seems my blog post caught the eye of the editor of the Resene online newsletter & she contacted me through Instagram to ask if she might feature it in their latest newsletterYou can read the article about it here in the latest Resene Online Newsletter  (scroll down about half way)I proudly forwarded it to The Mr's email for him to read telling him it was my \"five minutes of fame\"   😉  He very delicately pointed out that it was probably more like 30 seconds of fame !!!   You can sign yourselves up to receive the online newsletter * Here * if you wish - it is free to receive & has some really good tips & advise I find.Thank You as always dear friends - for your visits here today                                  Wishing you all a most wonderful weekend,                                      With much love & friendship to you all,                                           Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Fireplace Colours, Duck Planters & Craft Fairs", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Friday to you all. I hope the week has treated you kindly ?I finally decided on a fireplace colour after much deliberation & changing-of-my-mind  . . . . the colour I have painted it is called Dulux Ngataringa Bay  .  .  .  .  I went with a matt finish paint & tried to pick out one of the paler colours in the wallpaper background.For the summer months I am able to place my potted plants along the hearth but will shift them once fires begin again.  The vintage fire screen was a $5 purchase from Hospice last winter.I must confess I am still undecided whether I 💓💓 it or not but I have put my paints & brushes away for now as I am tired of it all. I think I would really like to paint the wooden fire surround but it is native Rimu & I think The Mr would have an apoplectic seizure if I painted it so I have decided not to push my luck as I have gotten away with painting quite a bit of native timber around here lately 😉The colour is Madame de Pompadour by Vintro Chalk PaintsI removed the half dead maidenhair fern from my duck planter, gave it a scrub, then painted it with a pale pink chalk paint ... I repotted my poor root-bound Peace Lilly & it fits nicely in the duck planter & I am hopeful it will flower again.For over a year now my lovely green & cream china has been packed away in a banana box - so it was lovely to get it all out, wash it & display again on my antique dresser.This gorgeous tin sign was gifted to me for my 60th birthday by my lovely friends Sally & Jane ... finally I found a space to hang it up above my dining table.I was most excited last Tuesday when a new length of oilcloth arrived that I had ordered online from this wonderful storeThis is a matt finish linen blend oilcloth & is fully wipeableThe Owner - Sarah - very kindly sent me free samples of 5 different oilcloths that I saw on her website & liked. This was so helpful & I soon chose the bees as my hope with this dining room was to lighten what is sometimes, a rather dark room.Sid & I picked a fresh vase of roses from the garden to sit on my new tablecloth 💗For a long time I have wanted to put together a Spring Tablescape but spring will be finished here in another couple of weeks so perhaps I will aim for this next spring.  In the meantime I finished off a lovely stitchery I had been working on from Jenny of elefantz design's stitchery club that I belonged to.  The pattern is called Nana's Jug of Posies ... but I added the words to the bottom as I had in mind my spring display.My original intention had been to frame it or make a small cushion but I came across an old embroidery hoop so thought it would fit nicely in this.I found a length of pink velvet ribbon just the perfect length & tied it to this old chicken mesh frame that was in my sleepout.I'm delighted with my stitchery & hope to continue working away on some spring-related items.We still have things to finish in the kitchen & dining area - we are getting our wooden benches sanded & re-polished, a new light fixture & I would like to make some new cushions for my dining area couch ... but Christmas Orders & all it's busy-ness may have to take priority for now.  I shall keep you updated as I progress dear readers.Last Saturday was the annual Christmas Craft Fair in my small local town.  I have had a stall at this for many years but this is the 2nd year where I have gone along as just a customer.  The sun was shining & the crowds were out.  I especially wanted to buy a dress from my friend Julie of Bo and Co to gift to Juno for Christmas.I was delighted to choose this gorgeous pink dress with bunnies on it ... I also bought some handmade soaps as I like to gift these with my knitted cotton dishcloths ... I bought some relish (to gift) & some pottery Christmas ornaments to tie onto gifts.Here is a photo of my friend Julie's stall that I borrowed from the local Craft Fair Facebook PageI also bought these 3 little perennials for my garden & No Willie ... the ginger cat did not come free with the plants !!! (Buy 3 ... get a free cat !!!) 😉Do you remember back in this post when I made the suitcase planter for my lovely friend Jane's 50th birthday ... well she sent me this photo last night of how it is thriving.    I was rather tempted to reply & say \"I'll have it back now thanks\" 😉  It looks stunning & I love the colour combination of the petunias 💕Thank You all So Very Much for your visits here today dear friends,I hope you have a wonderful weekend - the sun is shining here 💛Be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Chaos & Disruption .................................... & Birdfeeders (!!)", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2020", "text": "Mid Week Greetings dear friends & readers,The house has been in rather a state of chaos & disruption this past week as I have been doing some re-decorating.I picked my very first vases of roses & sweetpeas at the weekend before the winds & rain came & bashed them all 💗Just over a week ago I had a moment of madness when I decided to empty out my dining room & give it a paint.  Truth be told I really wanted to do this in November of last year but back then I was running back & forth helping Mum who had broken her hip.  As soon as we finished with fires for the year I emptied out the room & gave the walls a good wash down with sugar soap. They were very discoloured.Once I began painting the walls I had my unwanted helper constant companion Pippi who kept a watchful eye on the paint as it dried 😉I took this pic while The Mr was painting the ceiling to show you how discoloured it was - even though I had washed it prior.As our kitchen & dining room are all one L-shaped room - this meant I had to paint the kitchen too.Whilst doing the kitchen walls one of my ladder rungs broke off !!  Now friends I know I need to lose a few kilo's but seriously ....................... 😕The leg is still black & blue as the bruising has come out over several days.  I went to Mitre 10 & invested in a nice new strong stepladder!Last Saturday I decided to wallpaper the wall above my fireplace using up the left over paper from my Lounge feature wall - I had 2 rolls left.  This came together quite well but now I have the dilema of what color to paint the bricks around my fire, which currently looks just like this in the picture above - while I decide with my various testpots.  I would like to go lighter for a change from the dark red.The Mr came home from Moto X a couple of weeks ago with a repair job for me.  This bear had been won by an 8 year old girl & then her new puppy had gotten hold of it. Though I forgot to take a before pic it had no eyes, one ear off, a torn cheek & the mouth stitching missing as well as a ripped jacket & was filthy.I was able to wash the bear & clothes before attempting to repair it. I am pleased I still have some eyes & thread from my teddy bear making days. The young girl cried with joy when The Mr returned it to her.I found myself in Cambridge last week so I popped into a lovely vintage pop-up store called Linen and Stone - I have been there once before & they sell rather unusual bits & bobs. I could not resist this enamel ware jug on the top left (cos I need more enamel ware like I need a hole in the head !!!) as well as the delightful Shaving linen cloth.  The silver plated stand on the right was only $4 at the SPCA shop just a few doors along - I am hoping to chalk paint it.I get a little giddy with excitement when folk give me their rubbish treasures ... my friend Gail gave me a box of old paperwork to burn for her & this rusty cobwebby chandelier was sitting on the top of the box !!  I removed all the wiring from it & then wire brushed it to remove the surface rust - I spray painted it liberally with a rust killer/primer.  I had a plan for this chandelier 😉Remember my Op Shop finds from last month on my trip to Mum's ... well this set of 3 china cups were just $10 for the set ... I thought they would be perfect for my \"chandelier plan\"I painted the chandelier with 2 coats of chalk paint (Country Green) which I felt went nicely with the soft florals in the teacups/saucers.I glued each teacup to its saucer using a good porcelain glue that I use on my teacup birdfeeders & I know it withstands the weather.The Mr drilled tiny holes in each light socket & then I wired the teacup handles in using 18 gauge galvanised wire.I have hung it in my deck area in a spot that is a bit sheltered from any strong winds.I filled it with wild bird seed ... I know it will take the birds a good couple of weeks to come to it but once they do it will be very popular I am sure.I just feel so happy with it & also delighted that I have rescued something from landfill & given it a second life 💚Yesterday afternoon the weather here was dreadful so it was an inside afternoon for Sid & I. I made him a train & he filled the passenger carriage with his dinosaurs & Yes ... I did get to push him around the lounge in his train making tooting noises 😐 Oh Lucky Me !!!Thanks So Very Much for your visits today dear friends,I hope to have some finished dining room pics to share in my next post.Take care dear friends & be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Love Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Return from Mums & Still Running .........................", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers. Gosh I have hit the ground running since my return from Mum's & have yet to come up for air.Hence my blog posting And reading & computer time in general, has been virtually non-existent.Mount Taranaki was wearing a cloak of snow. I have always referred to this maunga as a \"she\" but have found out it is in fact a \"he\".Firstly an apology ... Thank You to you All for the lovely comments you left me on my last post ... I apologise I have not replied but I don't have internet access when at Mum's & I have just not had a chance since my return home.I needed a comfort stop at Stratford on my way down so I popped into the local Hospice shop & came away with some treasures - all of this for just $25.The books in St Mary's Op Shop were all on sale for $1 each so I bought these four to read.There is a new Arts & Crafts Store in Hawera called The Collective ... I popped in there twice & was able to buy some really lovely handmade gifts for Christmas & a Birthday.I got to visit Joy from The Joy Within when I delivered the large candle order to her ... I just love having a browse around her wonderful shop filled with treasures.So much eye candy ........There was a surprise waiting for me in Mum's garage .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  my sister in law had picked this tea wagon up off the side of the road where someone was placing lots of furniture items \"free for the taking\"  .... I look forward to revamping this piece.Mum had given me a large banana box of items to be taken to her local Hospice Shop.  Of course - in my capacity as Steptoe - I rummaged through it all first !!  The two plates (above right) were at the very bottom of the box so these got fished out rather promptly.I have been washing the weatherboard walls of my house & decided to add to my plate wall this week ... making my total number up to 7.  Way back at the beginning of September I decided to make a suitcase planter for my lovely friend Jane who turns 50, today to be precise.  I found an old suitcase that had been tossed my way by my friend Elaine ... I added the wooden slats, lined it with a black rubbish sack, filled with potting mix & planted it.Although I forgot to photograph it when first planted, I have diligently been feeding & watering the plants over the past 8 weeks & they have grown prolifically.(The suitcase already had the stencilling on the lid when I acquired it from Elaine)I was able to visit with Jane this week & gift her the suitcase planter - I was really pleased with how the petunias had grown but hope the lobelia that is tucked away in there grows soon too.Jane was thrilled with her planter & cried a teeny bit but she assured me they were happy tears 😂Blogger appears to have a total mind of its own today dear friends & is merrily changing my font size & the layout of my alignment as it pleases. I have no idea why it is doing this !Miss Pip did her usual fretting while I was away at Mums, did not eat & lost weight .... which meant Blackie got to eat her food as well as his & put on weight 😐Thanks So Very Much for your visit today dear friends,I hope the week is treating you well - be kind to yourselves & to each other.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "The Second Reinvention of  \"The Purple Cupboard\"", "date": "Monday, October 12, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI am off to my Mum's for a week but wanted to share this post before I go.Way back in 2016 - almost 4 years to the day - I purchased this purple cupboard from the Church Op Shop for the princely sum of $3 !You can read my blog post about it * Here * but for those of you who can't be bothered scrolling, here is an old pic of it in all it's purple glory 💜And here (below) is the first revamp I did on it ... I used it at my Cottage to display the pots of babies tears plants that I used to sell.Roll forward 4 years & it had sat on my Cottage deck, neglected & forlorn ... home to birds, spiders, rodents & other creatures !!I hauled it up to my house & gave it a Very long overdue scrub.You can still see the original purple colour on the back of it hereThen proceeded to paint it in front of the fire on my dining room carpet (Yes - I use splash covers)!!Once again the colour is Resene \"Hot Chilli\" - a leftover testpotOnce it was red again I decided to stencil the drawer & then the lower front panel - I was inspired by my red kettle from last week's post as the pop of white seemed to stand out so well on the red.I lined the drawer with a thick black rubbish bag before planting  ....  my hope is that the impatiens & the lobelia will grow & spill out over the front of the drawer.Another scratch around under my house unearthed these containers which I also planted with red & white impatiens. It was rewarding to use up just what I had on hand & not buy anything except the punnets of plants.Note to Self ..... Your red chair needs a paint now Julie !!!I have tucked the pots away in a sheltered spot while I am down at Mum's as we get so many strong winds here during the month of October.I have been working diligently on a large soy candle order to go down to Hawera with me.My friend Joy from The Joy Within is taking part in a Christmas House Tour on 28th November - this is a fundraiser for St John's & a group of friends open their homes all decorated for Christmas - Oh what a sight it would be 💗I have been scouring Op Shops for the past couple of months gathering together a large assortment of vintage glassware to make the candles in.  There was a wonderful array of fragrances including White Musk, Vanilla, Orange/Clove, Pumpkin Spice, Lime/Basil/Mandarin & Christmas Tree.My house smelt divine to put it mildly 💕Of all the vintage glass containers this sweet little trinket bowl above was my absolute favorite & I had much difficulty parting with it !!My winter vegetable garden is finally coming to fruition & I am picking veggies most days - giving away lots & cooking lots too.I picked this assortment this morning to take down to Mum's & share amongst the family.I miss these two so much when I go away - but this morning there was a huge fight between them both ... hissing, spitting & Lots of fur flying (mainly ginger !!)           Now to see them tucked up together (Yes on the good bedspread!!!) 😐 it's hard to believe they were anything but good mates.Have a lovely rest of the week dear friends,Thanks So Very Much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": " Succulents  -  (more !!) Painted Pots  -  & Bunting", "date": "Thursday, October 8, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers &  Welcome to October 💗We hope you are a good month !Early each autumn I plant these vintage aluminum pots with pansies ... these flower for me right through until the summer months & look so pretty on the old scales out on my deck.This autumn however, there were no Garden Centres open & no pansies available.  I walked around my garden & pulled succulent cuttings where-ever I could find any ... I was surprised at all the different varieties growing around my section.I potted them up into my vintage aluminum pots & they have really thrived on the deck area.  When I posted this picture on Instagram a lady commented that they look rather like coral.Long time readers of my blog will know that I use the area down the far end of my lounge, in front on my French Doors as my \"glasshouse\" areaI grow all my cuttings & seedlings down here as well as putting anything that is looking a bit sick here & it usually revives & takes off again.It was time to do something with a lot of the bits I had been resurrecting over the winter months.Another fossick around under my house & another two pre-loved pots were unearthed & scrubbed ready for painting.I have been enjoying using this Grey Mist chalk paint so I continued with the theme as well as adding some Re-design transfers from Paint Me VintageI especially love the bee pot - despite this being the tattiest pot of them all it has turned out great.Last night I waxed them & then planted them up this morning.While I was painting by the fire yesterday I decided to do another coat on this old red kettle as the colour was faded & tatty looking.The red colour is Resene \"Hot Chilli\"A simple stencil in white & I just LoVe how it has freshened it up - the white Impatiens plant is just perfect 💕Click on the pic to enlarge .... it is incredibly tricky to photograph bunting !!This pre-printed bunting panel was purchased from Millymac Supplies a few months ago. It is a design by Natalie Bird of The Birdhouse designs & was printed on a gorgeous linen - I adore anything pre-printed 💙Slowly over the winter months I have been stitching it & working on a panel when time allows.Finally last weekend I finished the last (7th) panel.  I was delighted & decided to sew up my bunting adding 3 extra panels to make a total of 10 scallops.I chose 3 different Tilda fabrics for my extras ... an older range of Tilda prints that I cannot remember the name of.The \"sunny days\" panel is repeated at the beginning & the end.I used some Cottage Garden threads on some of this to give a bit of variation especially when doing the satin stitch.I had no binding in my stash so just made up a scrappy binding using the leftover Tilda fabrics.And Yes .... I had some help with the placement of my bunting pennants & also some unwanted help with the ironing/flattening of the fabrics !!  😉On Tuesday I had a visitor for the day ...... Spiderman came to visit for the day & showed me how to jump off my deck from way up high !!!!It helps if you are wearing Spiderman shorts, cap & undies & also in the way you hold your fingers apparently !!!!  😊Thanks so very much for your visits today dear friends,I have had such difficulty with the new blogger writing today's post - it changes the font size & placement at least every single paragraph & has a complete mind of it's own !!I am off to hunt out that chocolate bar I keep hidden in my Sewing Room purely for Emergency Purposes !!!With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Another Busy Week .........................................................", "date": "Wednesday, September 30, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersAnother week has rolled on by & we are just about to turn the calendar over Again !!I picked the last freesia's for the season this week - before the winds & rain battered them.Also I was so pleased to see the orchid flowering that my son & his family gifted me last year for Mother's Day 💗Last month at our craft get-together Maureen gave everyone a flying geese shape that her husband had cut out of wood for each of us.We had to paint the shape & bring to our next meeting to decoupageI painted mine with some very pale pink chalk paint.Last Weekend we had a 4 hour power cut ... there is not alot you can do with no power so I sat at the table & decided to start working on my flying goose.As you can see I had \"my usual furry assistance\" 😉I mod podged some of the gorgeous rice paper that I had purchased from Paint Me Vintage to my goose.Then I added a lace ruffle & heart charm to the neck,  & found 3 small pearl heart buttons which I glued to one of the wings.I also attached a hanger to the back so I could hang my flying goose.Last Monday we met at Sally's & here are some of the ladies working on their geese - like me, some had completed them already. We shared a delicious lunch while the mod podge dried & then we carefully sanded the edges of our geese.I snapped this pic just prior to lunch so you can see the bottom two are still wet & also one is yet to be trimmed.Some of the girls used rice paper but most of them used serviettes to decoupage the geese.It was a fun craft event & I really enjoy seeing all the different variations come to life.The two pots above left were hauled out from under my house, painted & then I applied a Re-design transfer to the pale grey one.   I stencilled the white pot as this is a gift for my sister in law who is very much into black & white.I would love to plant it with black pansies but I think I may have missed the pansy season here now. ❤I have been the lucky recipient of some kindnesses lately & it was time for me to say Thank You to some folk.I made some lavender bags using vintage linens for Jill, along with a Thank You soap ....  & I made a Soy Candle & some Potpourri for Julie as a \"Welcome to your New Home\" gift. Both ladies received some of my Gingernut Bites in cellophane packaging.Then this morning I hand delivered a small parcel to my friend Marie who turned 80 the other week & wanted \"no fuss, no bother whatsoever\"Sometimes I just don't want to not acknowledge certain things so Marie received lavender bags, choccy's, baking & some veggies from my garden.Yesterday was my Tuesday-with-Sid day so I said to him \"let's go to the Library\".  His reply was \"Oh Granny I think the Library is closed ... I think there's a piece of the corona virus there\".(He's 3 & a half I might add !!)Off we went & he spent a pleasant hour there looking at books & puzzles - I snapped the pics above of him .... probably seaching for the piece of the corona virus !! 😉Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friends,I hope your week is going well - remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to You All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "(Still !!!) Waving My Brush Around ...............", "date": "Sunday, September 20, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers (warning .... photo heavy post so grab a cuppa or a tipple !!)My dear friend Sally had a birthday coming up & after coming across this watering can in my sleepout, I decided to paint/revamp it as a gift for Sal.These are just the aluminium watering cans that you can buy from Hardware Stores.I pulled the half-lid off the top & then proceeded to paint it by my fire over a couple of days.I used a lovely colour Chalk Paint called \"Grey Mist\"After I was happy with my coverage I applied some transfers to both sides of it and .  .  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  . I also applied some to the spout.To finish it off I tied a swing tag to the handle.I had initially planned to plant it up for Sal, but in the end I decided to just include a garden voucher so she could choose what she would like planted in it herself.Some knitted cotton dishcloths & a handmade soap also got popped in the birthday parcel .  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  . along with some Mars Bar Slice & Gingernut Bites as I know she loves my baking 💗  I received the loveliest message from Sal to tell me how delighted she was with her parcel.This next part of my post is especially for Gail & Sarah who both contacted me after my post about my Fireplace Mantle & asked if I could please share more info on the \"fairy/snow queen dome\" shown on my mantleHappy To !!! 😊This glass dome came from my Mum - I think she had received it as a gift but decided she only wanted the imitation succulent inside & not the dome itself.Here is an image borrowed from the web of what it originally looked like.For my part - I was more than happy to receive the glass dome & it sat there for many months before I finally decided to do something with it during our Lockdown.I had the vague rumblings of an idea of what I wanted to achieve ... so I hunted out this wee fairy from amongst my Christmas decorationsI painted the wooden base, then glued on torn music papers & glued one of Sid's building blocks to the centre base as a prop.I covered this with some dried moss (Yes I do keep all these bits on hand!!) then I glued a large bead to one side & covered it in moss - as I wanted a prop to sit my small tree on.I made a small \"banner\" with music paper & a brass tag & glued this in place ... also tucked a tiny porcelain cherub in the other side.The fairy got her wings, hair & belt removed & then I added my own dolls hair & wings as well as adding in lots of sparkly embellishments, pearl beads, more sequins to her skirt & I even made her a halo from florists wire.Everything was either stitched or glued in place & it all came from my stash - nothing was purchased as there were no shops open !! I gave her a feather for a wand & then I glued a porcelain bird (also found in my Christmas stash) to the top of the dome & tied a French tag to this.I hot glued her onto the mossy base making sure she was really stable - I also carefully wound a small set of fairy lights up around her.Here she is in all her glory with the lights on ... the new mantle is just the perfect place to display her  💕Last night as I was going to bed I snapped this pic of my mantle with all my fairy lights on ... Yes I do like to live in a bit of a wonderland 😉Thank You all So Much for staying with me through this lengthy post but before we go, let's just play a wee game called \"Can you spot the fairy ??\"This \"game\" happens most mornings when I am attempting to make my bed !!!Wishing you a wonderful week ahead dear friends,Be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I just love both the patterns 💕When I put my new (vintage) bedspread on our bed & made myself some new cushions to match I loudly declared to all & sundry (& anyone else that might be listening!!) there was No Way In The World those cats were going on the bed anymore !!!!Well you can see who won that argument & it certainly Was Not Me !!! 😣Thanks So Very Much for stopping by today dear friends.I will be back (hopefully) before the end of the week with a final Part 3 as I still have more paint projects to share with you.Take care & be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I was able to fill them with my grandson's toys, books & puzzles thus doing away with 4 random baskets & boxes cluttering up scattered around my lounge !!This narrow wooden shutter was also a purchase from Paint Me Vintage ... I gave each side 2 coats of vintage white chalk paint.It is just the right width to sit on my mantle.Yes I found some old fairy lights in a drawer last week & have wound these all across my mantle ... The Mr just rolled his eyes 😉Our small craft group were due to meet up at Maureen's.The girls had expressed interest in learning to apply transfers at last month's meeting so I told them all to bring an opshopped item that they had painted Gail had ordered a couple of tranfers & we cut them up & worked out a price for each one - the girls had so much fun & said it was all totally addictive !( Click on the pic's to enlarge & see them more clearly )Gail had painted a small oval coffee table, 2 waste paper bins & a cute little wall cupboardMaureen had painted a container that her husband had made her for their en-suite, & Sally had painted a rectangular op-shopped trayI had hauled these 2 heavy ceramic pots out from under my house - I'm not sure who they originally belonged to but I emptied out the weeds & soil, scrubbed them & painted by the fire - a pale grey (leftover) chalk paint.After applying a transfer to each one, I gave them 2 good coats of wax,  then planted them with some of my spider plant babies that I first started off in this post back in AprilThanks so much for staying with me through this lengthy post dear friends,I will be back in a few days with \"Part 2\" as my paint brush has sure been getting a good work out lately !Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "It All Started With a Fireplace Mantle ....................................", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI used to have this old wooden fireplace mantle in my Craft Cottage - it was ideal for display purposes.When I no longer needed it,  I moved it to a corner of my deck area - under cover, but still exposed to the elements.It was time to do something with it before it got ruined.I dragged it against a wall in my lounge - I had always had ideas of bringing it in here but wasn't sure where to put it as I seem to have cluttered my lounge up as there was rather limited space in my lounge!!!  😉You can see from the pics above, the top was in a bad state of repair.I always Loved the centre detailing,  so I added a couple of scrolls that I had in my stash - removed from an old Singer Sewing Machine Drawer.I sanded the top & filled any gaps & then gave it 3 generous coats of Voodoo Molly Vintage Chalk Paint in the colour \"Vintage White\"I waxed the whole thing with clear wax & then after watching This Video Here I applied a coat of dark wax, rubbed it off & then another coat of clear wax.I love the slightly aged, antique patina it gave to the detailing.Then I lightly scuffed the edges of the whole mantle with sandpaper.I have positioned it against my feature wall as I love the effect of it against the wallpaper & when it was against the cream painted wall - it just looked lost.I have been working on something to go in front of my mantle - I hope to share this with you in my next post.When I stood back to admire my new/old fireplace mantle I decided I no longer liked the grey frame around this gorgeous Cross Stitch PictureThe frame had originally been gold & I had painted it with Grey Chalk Paint 3 years ago.I had some leftover Resene Test Pot in the colour Pale Rose so I applied this over the grey & immediately loved it 💗Incidently in case you may think all these painting projects are so simple & easy .... I took these snaps to show you just how tricky it can get around here at times ... especially when there's a paint pot out & a certain inquisitive 4 legged ginger critter !!!Invariably she ends up with the odd patch of colour on her !!!These two stools were looking shabby  -   they had been painted/upcycled by me well over 4 years ago now.The paper doilies that I had modpodged on the tops were lifting & discoloured - stained by cups of tea & the odd glass of red wine !!!After a quick google search I found that you can remove old modpodge by soaking well in warm water - I tried this & found it worked fairly well. A good sand afterwards & the remainder of the doiley & glue had gone.I gave both stools a fresh coat of paint & then decided to stencil onto them with my new bee stencil.I wanted a dark grey colour but had none so I mixed up small amounts of white & black chalk paints until I was happy with the shade.Ooohhhh how great they look !!! 💕Two coats of wax to each stool & now they will be wipeable & much more hard wearing.There has been quite a bit of painting/upcycling going on here at Threadbear HQ.I hope to be back soon with another update post.Wishing you all a wonderful week dear friends - thanks so much for your visits hereWith much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Small Road Trip .......... & Another Gnome (!!!)", "date": "Friday, August 21, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersLast week I had a craft order to go to The Farm Shop at Gordonton  Normally I post my potpourri over, but I had 4 Vintage Teacup Bird feeders to go as well & these must be hand delivered due to their fragile natureI wish the computer screen was scratch-n-sniff as the fragrance from this batch of Cottage Garden Potpourri was just heavenly 💗I bagged up a dozen bags each of my Citrus potpourri & my Cottage Garden potpourri(I sit a bag of Wild Birdseed in each one)The 4 teacup birdfeeders ready to go - the cups/saucers can be unscrewed from the stakes.After delivering my goods to the Farm Shop (& making a couple of purchases) I stopped in at Grandmother's Garden - a beautiful Patchwork & Quilting store right in the centre of Gordonton Village.I had a lovely browse as it has been a good couple of years since I have stopped here, but all that came away with me was some DMC thread, stick on thimbles, a fat quarter of tonal white & an enamel pin.  I am trying to be disciplined & use up what I already have in my stash 😉Further down the road I took a tiny detour to stop in at Clandon DaffodilsOh My!! I am so pleased I did!!  What a gorgeous place 💛Rows & rows of daffodils of every variety imaginableThey have a self service shop with an honesty box system & so many different varieties to choose from.  Yes Please ... I'll take one of each 😉I bought the 5 bunches for $20 & then came home & shared them out with some family members.Unfortunately they don't last a great length of time indoors with winter fires etc ... but I did notice the pale coloured ones & the double frilled ones lasted several days longer than the more common variety ones. After my morning's outing I felt inspired to start on another kitset - yet another gift from my lovely neighbor once again for pet feeding duties.This gnome is called Lawrence & is slightly larger than Fraser Gnome - shown in my last PostInstead of being wild & wooly, Lawrence was more dainty with tea dyed lace embellishments & the most gorgeous charms in the kitset The only add on I made was again to the beard - I added in the black voile ribbon as I wanted the beard fuller (the same as with Fraser)His hat trimmed with lace & vintage brass charmsAnother mossy stick came from my garden - I especially loved the lantern charm tied to the end.Remember in this Post back in April where I mentioned all the feral cats that The Mr feeds at the farm??Well meet Fluffy Cat 😉She was wild also, but has quietened down so much & become so friendly that The Mr decided to get her speyed.  She is currently at the Vets as I type this getting her little surgery done.  We will endeavour to find her a good home as she is such a lovely cat.And this is what a certain ginger girl thinks about another cat getting any of The Mr's attention - Not Much !!!Thank You - as always - dear friends for your visits here today,Wishing you all a lovely weekend - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

{"title": "A Watering Can, A Wheelbarrow  ...............  & A Hen !!!", "date": "Friday, July 24, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersWhen I returned from my trip to Mum's I noticed that my sister in law Leonie, had stashed an old tatty watering can in the boot of my car.    She asked me Please would I paint it for her?It had been sitting outside with weeds growing in it & was in a sad looking state.I gave it a good scrub & then let it dry by the fire before attempting to paint it.Leonie's request was for red so I found some red paint in my supplies & proceeded to paint it on my kitchen bench, drying it by the fire between coats.It actually took 4 thick coats to cover the black & used up the whole test pot of paint.Leonie had given me a transfer she had purchased from The Joy Within so I applied this before waxing it.What a transformation !!! A couple of swing tags tied to the handle & it was complete 💕Leonie is going to sit some white cyclamen in it - I have suggested she just sits the pots inside on something & doesn't plant it with soil.This wooden wheelbarrow below had long been languishing in my woodshed.We had used it for many years when I worked in town in the Gift Shop to hold \"specials\" at the shops entrance way.My friend Gail had decoupaged some gollies onto it at some stage & I think she had painted it brown.It was in a rather sorry state of affairs!After a really good scrub & a hose down, I dried it by the fire.After I had done the first coat I realised I was going to have to sand the decoupaged gollies as their outline was still showing through quite clearly.I used The Mr's Orbital Sander & gave it a thorough going over.I felt much happier with it once this was done. 3 coats later & I was able to apply the transfer I had purchased from Paint Me VintageFront & Back ViewsI cut a piece of a cardboard box to the shape of the bottom, glued some wadding to this & then covered it with a scrap of vintage Sanderson fabric I had.I affixed this to the base with double sided tape.For now I have filled it with some lap quilts & some vintage embroidered supper cloths, though I am unsure/undecided of the perfect display for this wheelbarrow.   Perhaps some dried hydrangeas ??Any suggestions would be most welcome dear readers 😊I am just so pleased I \"rescued it\" & it's no longer residing in my woodshed as a home for spiders & other rodents.My friend Elaine sent me through some photos of a Vintage Cane Hen Carrier she had purchased.Elaine asked if I had a pattern for a chook or a hen that I could make to sit inside the Hen Carrier by the mesh inserts.I dug out my rather old & tatty copy of Hettie Hen - this is a doorstop pattern & it has been many years since I have made Hettie now.Though I used to make them in hessian - Elaine & I decided you would not be able to see the hessian through the mesh so we settled on lighter greens & pinks instead.I had a pretty green polka dot fabric that I made the body from - this doorstop is weighted with a half a brick so she is good & heavy.For the shawl I used some gorgeous Tilda fabric 💗Elaine collected her Hettie Hen last week & was just so delighted.She sent me a photo but told me she hasn't the heart to put her away in the Hen Carrier, out of view  ......  so for now Hettie gets to sit beside it instead.I have had my eldest grandson for part of the school holidays - we got some puzzles out of the Library to do as he really loves puzzles - he was so proud we were able to complete this 300 piece one.On one of the days that Sid was also here it poured with rain all day long.I put an old shower curtain on the floor & bought the sandpit inside for them to play.  They played really well together but like all boys ... they certainly \"had their moments\" 😉No this is not Miss Pippi ...... though I'm sure she would like it to be  !!!!Thanks as always dear friends, for your visits here today,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend - I think the sun is even going to make an appearance here for a change.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

(Part 2)", "date": "Friday, July 17, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersThank You all So Much for your very kind birthday wishes in my last post.The day immediately after my Birthday I travelled down to Mum's - I had not been down since January due to the nationwide Lockdown.Mount Taranaki was wearing her winter coat & it was certainly chilly down there but also fresh & crisp - different to the damp air we get here in the Waikato.The 5 days at Mum's went by in the blink of an eye & was extremely busy with lots packed into it.Two of Mum's brothers travelled over for lunch & to catch up with her.  We had Dr's appointments & Lab tests to attend. I took Mum to The Possum Factory at Stratford to buy new slippers. We had all the carpets in her house shampooed.   I cleaned out some cupboards & stocked up on groceries as well as doing several crock pot meals to freeze for her.  I got to visit No Op Shops but there was a special appointment that I had on the Saturday that I was really looking forward to.I begun following The Joy Within on Facebook & Instagram awhile ago & just LoVe what she creates.When I read that Joy had opened a \"She Shed\" on her property to sell her goods from I knew I wanted to visit. We had corresponded & Joy had ordered some candles from me so it worked out perfectly to deliver them & visit Joy's store.As well as selling many upcycled items that Joy has painted & embellished, she also sells the paints, transfers & stencils to do your own repurposing.Alongside this she runs Workshops from the classroom attached to the Store.We spent a lovely hour chatting,  sharing ideas & drooling over all her beautiful creations.I purchased some transfers, some tags, a pot of chalk paint & a set of Tiny Homes for myself 😊Long time readers of my blog will know I get to visit my talented & very creative friend Claire on the odd occasion when I am down at Mum's.   (Incidently Claire & Joy are Sister-in-laws)Claire had messaged me & said to \"pop out for a quick cuppa if you have an hour free\"  ... I was so looking forward to catching up with her again.Little did I know she had secretly organised to hold her monthly craft group meeting while I was there ... as I know the other girls it was such a wonderful catch up again & has been 6 years since I last saw them !!We had a divine afternoon tea (forgot to take any pics unfortunately as was so busy eating) ... & the girls even gave me gorgeous surprise birthday gifts 💕Claire had made me a bird tree & a matching bird house - she had constructed the tree herself, painted & decoupaged it & then made 6 Tilda birds to hang from the \"branches\".I was So spoilt ....  & quite speechless. It was honestly the loveliest afternoon, but all too soon our visit was up & it was time for me to head back to Mum's.I have often posted photos of Claires stunning home over my blogging years - I just adore it so.I think what I love the most is how she has filled it with her vintage & handcrafted treasures & made it just so special.I think Claire would do this even if she lived in a hay barn !!!She just has the unique knack of putting things together that make my heart beat a little bit faster.The quilt on the right is a recent completion .... vintage linens & Liberty squares ... Just stunning!!!She always has new projects & quilts completed to show me & I try really, really hard ... but I can never quite manage to get them into my car without her noticing 😉You can click on the pics to enlarge them if you wish.Claire has been doing a mini quilt a month, all with a different theme - Love, love them all !!!  💗The top left one is dedicated to her brother Chris,  who was tragically killed in a car accident in February.A corner of her kitchen bench above leftThe dresser above was dark brown & Claire has recently chalk painted it. When I got home again I put together this little vignette with some of my gifts.Leeanne had made the mini quilt from leftover blocks when she made me the 16 patch quilt in my last post - it fits just perfectly on my spindle leg table.Whenever I go away Miss Pippi frets & hardly eats & spends most of her time tucked right down on my side of the bed.This was one of the pics The Mr sent through to my phone.Have a wonderful weekend dear friends !!Thanks as always, for your visits here today - be kind to yourselves & to each other.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

(Pandemics & suchlike !!)(My friend Sally snapped this pic)The entire time we were at the dining table Miss Pip sat at this door with her sour face on ... she would not come in but just wanted to ensure we felt guilty about her being out in the cold & starving 😟Dinner time was a very casual relaxed event with my sons & their families sharing it with us.We ordered gourmet pizzas & tapas from this local Restaurant & the food was divine & almost everything got eaten - even by the little ones.Books, Choccy, Wine & relish & tea gifts .... a beautiful Flower Carpet Rose & even a pot of chalk paint !!!I was thoroughly spoilt this birthday by dear friends & family & received some most special & wonderful gifts - such an assortment of goodies - it has been like Christmas for me 💕The pansies top left have grown since I took this picGorgeous soy Candles, face scrubbers & a possum duster !!  Room diffusers & a wonderful knitting bookMy neighbour dropped me off a dozen fresh eggs from her chooks & my dear friend Carolyn, who travelled up for my birthday - crafted me this stunning mosaic garden ring which reads \"Life is a Garden\"(My photo is not doing it justice this grey overcast day)Eldest son & his family gifted me an old fashioned Lilac Tree which I have always wanted in my gardenBeautiful cards including handmade ones from the grandsonsAlthough we had my celebrations on the Saturday, my actual birthday fell on the Tuesday.This package from my dear friend Leeanne - had sat in my wardrobe for a few days & when I opened it on my actual birthday  - I must confess I shed a few tears (happy tears!!)Leeanne had created the most beautiful 16 patch quilt for me - a full bed size in gorgeous fabrics & then custom quilted it & posted it all the way down to me !!The quilt has a flange binding, which I love & the cutest label on the back from a vintage doileyWhen I put it on my bed to take some pics, Miss Pippi immediately tested it out for me for \"comfort & snugability\" 😉She informs me it definately passed the test !!!I shall treasure this quilt for the rest of my days - Thank You So Much Leeanne.I consider one of my greatest achievements in my 60 years on this earth is the special dear friends I have acquired & hold dear to me  💗I have been away down to my Mum's so I will write a \"Part 2\" catch-up post in a couple of days,Thanks for stopping by today - wishing you all a wonderful weekend dear friends,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "A Rag Doll Order", "date": "Friday, June 12, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersGoodness me ......  Friday again already !!A couple of weeks ago my dear friend & long-time customer Christine rang to inquire whether I could make a Rag Doll for her granddaughter Krystal who was soon to turn 7.Christine texted me through these pictures above  .....  this was a doll she had bought from my Craft Cottage many years ago that Krystal just Loved & played with each time she visited her Nana's home. So Chris wanted an identical doll & the aqua bow was to be the colour theme along with a request for long brown hair.I asked Chris to please send the doll over to me so I could draft off a pattern & she did warn me she may need some repairs as she has been very well loved !!I removed dollies clothes & gave them a wash  -  her arm surgery would have to wait for now as I needed to draft patterns off for the body & the clothingI find it quite difficult drafting off patterns & Krystal's Rag Doll turned out just a fraction bigger but I was most relieved when she was all finished & thought she looked so pretty all dressed in aqua .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . complete with long brown hair as requested.When a doll is to be played with by a child I always double stitch & reinforce everything when making it.I had to visit my local Patchwork Shop to get aqua fabrics & found the ribbons for her hair in just the perfect shade of aqua.The little socks & shoes were in my stash from all the doll making I have done over the years.Next it was time to repair Chris's original Rag Doll - her arm got re-attached & her legs reinforcedHer clothing was washed & pressed & a new skirt was made after I had a slight accident with her old one involving a splash of bleach !! 😐I had a wee chat with dolly & she was most happy for me to make her a new skirt in Tilda fabric. Her hair was re-attached & she also got a brand new set of hair ties made.All in all - a big improvement & she was smiling happily again 💗After reading this post * here *where I made myself a new ironing board cover my friend (also called Julie) asked me to please make one for her ironing board.When she dropped off her existing one for me to copy I realised it had the wadding stitched into it - unlike mine in which I just stretch a nice new length of wadding over the ironing board first - easy peasy.As you can see I had Miss Pain in the Pippi's help to measure, cut & sew the wadding into the cover 😉(And Yes - it took me half an hour when finished, to pick the ginger hairs out of the wadding !!!)I knitted two more organic cotton washcloths as I am making up another wee package for Juno - my new (step) granddaughter.A friend told me our local Woolshop is closing down so I popped in last week to stock up on some Dishcloth Cotton.  I really loved the top two pastel colors which I hadn't seen before. I also treated myself to a brand new pair of knitting needles - a rare purchase.And then - just this morning - my neighbor dropped off the parcel above  .....  a Thank You gift for pet feeding duties I had done recently.I especially loved the bundle of fat quarters with sewing themed prints on them, & the wee hanging fairy is a kitset with everything included. 😊Here's wishing you all a wonderful Weekend dear friends,Take care - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I went through my stash of crochet doilies & glued a selection onto the light shades.Then I used clear fishing twine to hang them from the exposed beams in my Cottage at differing heights.One day - when my ship comes in (!!!) 😉- I will get these all wired up & then turn the switch ... & it will look stunning.For now - it looks pretty darn good anyway.A neighbor is moving to another district so I made a citrus slice & dropped a large container on their doorstep while they were busy loading up their trailers.The link to the recipe I used for my slice is * here *My daughter in law gave me another bucket of feijoas so I made up a feijoa cake - just using my regular Banana Cake recipe but substituting the bananas for 5 large mashed feijoas.I topped it with a cinnamon spice icing - I can definately verify that it is just delish !!I shall leave you with this little fairy - asleep on my tatty old pink dressing gown last night while I was trying to knit  -💕 Bless 💗Thanks So Very Much for stopping by today dear friends,Wishing you all a wonderful week - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Very Special Sewing Doll", "date": "Monday, May 18, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers .... & Welcome to a bright shiny new week.It must be about 10 years ago now that a customer came to my Craft Cottage & gifted me this pattern.Her words were \"this looks like something you might like to make\"Oh how very true indeed 💕The Pattern is called Emily by Debbie Magee of Always Stitchin' 2003 .... though I can find no website for Debbie now I have long ago lost count of how many times the Emily pattern came out of the drawer & sat on my craft table - waiting to be made up - only to be tucked away again.Finally -  the time had come to bring her to life.I made the body up, stuffed it tightly & then decided to give my Emily some painted boots.She posed none-too-elegantly by the fire while her boots dried !!(No dolls were harmed in this process - no feet were scorched either !!!!)I had just enough length of a lovely piece of plain cotton/linen blend to make her dress.I really enjoyed making the prairie points on the hemline & used lots of my Tilda scraps.All the laces & vintage doilies, trims etc were all found in my stash.Tilda scraps for the pockets & hexie too Then it was time to embellish the dress with the pockets & doilies.I changed the pattern a little & omitted some pockets, while adding in extra crochet doiliesI tipped out a brown paper bag filled with vintage sewing notions & decided these might be ideal to adorn my dollies pocketsI am pretty sure these vintage threads above came from Kiwikid Sue - thanks Sue!The \"tape measure\" is a length of woven tape measure ribbon that I had The little Singer Sewing Machine was included in the pattern but I felt the first one I made was too small so I enlarged the pattern a little & much prefer the larger size.(The Word Singer is just written on with gold gel pen.)I found a vintage wooden needle holder in my junk bits & also some old rusty bobbins which I strung on some linen cord that I plaitedSome sewing embellishments were added & the piece of cross stitch was the corner of a serviette that I fussy cut.It fit in the wooden hoop perfectly She has a felt hat which I also changed the pattern of as my first version turned out huge & flopped around on her head & made her look like a clown  -  her hair is hand dyed mohair I love my Emily Sewing doll  -  I was tempted to give her some wings but have decided she is quite perfect just the way she is. 💖I need to find just the right spot to hang her in my sewing room.At nearly 90 cms in length she is one tall girl.It was another busy weekend with the birthday of my eldest Grandson Alec who turned the big 5 !!Alec's Mum made him a treasure chest cake which turned out wonderful & tasted delicious.We had a lovely birthday party but kept our numbers to just 10 in accordance with our Level 2 rules & restrictions.I quite enjoyed the smaller number & found it a wonderful gathering.On Saturday morning I made these two pot holders for my gift box - this is a free pattern download from the very kind & generous Jenny of Elefantz DesignsLate last week I spent a cosy morning in my kitchen making up a batch of soy candles into vintage glass containers.I had some new wooden wicks that I was keen to try out as I have heard these crackle when they burn - I hope so.Also a gorgeous new fragrance - Pumpkin Spice.  I did not go into raptures when I smelt it in the bottle but once made up in the soy wax - Oh My !!!  💗 It is divine !!!The 2 candles above right are the pumpkin spice fragrance & they make the whole house smell so wonderful - even without being lit.I hope you are still keeping safe & well dear friends & readersHere in New Zealand our restrictions have been lifted in many areas but we still must be vigilant & careful.Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - take care of yourselves & each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I have had this gorgeous piece of vintage fabric squirrelled away for the longest time & finally sent it to Leeanne a couple of months ago asking her to please make me a whole cloth quilt from itI decided to take advantage of her very good offer above . . . . so I chose a swirly quilting design called \"dancing leaves\" & chose my backing fabric & batting from Leeanne                                                                                  The Back ViewOh I am so delighted with my quilt 💗- it brings me so much pleasure to look at it & the beautiful fabric has been bought to life with Leeanne sprinkling her magic over it. Last Saturday I arranged to meet up with my daughter in law at a half way point between their home & mineWe had not seen each other for 6 weeks, but I had a sack of organic chook pellets for her hens & she had veggie plants for meI baked a batch of white chocolate & banana muffins to take to her as I had bananas turning brownJust prior to our Lockdown Level 4 I had tried to buy veggie plants but there were none to be had in my townMy daughter in law had managed to get some in the city so she had bought some extra for me & then planted them on into a large tray from her worm farm - they were doing splendidlyI got spinach, silverbeet & lots of cabbage plants from her that I quickly put in the garden just before a couple of days rain came.Then mid week my friend Julie told me about a small garden shop in town that was selling veggie plants on a click & collect basisSo I was able to buy brocolli & cauliflower & beetroot seedlings - it felt just like Christmas 💚A few days ago I found this little wooden corner shelf in my sleepout so I screwed it into a corner of my kitchen & did a quick shelf displayWhile I was in my kitchen I made up another batch of Miracle Cleaner as I have been going through so much lately, with all the cleaning I seem to have been doing.You can find the recipe for this on Annabelle's blog post * here *It is wonderful & I use it all over the house for all sorts of things.Thanks so much for popping by today dear friends,I shall leave you with this pic of Yin & Yang taken this morning in front of the heaterI hope you all have a most wonderful weekend - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship To You All, Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Functional ..................... but still beautiful .........................", "date": "Thursday, April 30, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersAlthough I like things to be functional, I think there is no reason whatsoever - why they can't also be beautiful.(Or aesthetically pleasing as some might say)First thing last week - I cleaned my Laundry.A really, really good deep clean that included the walls, the ceiling & the floors.The net curtain at the one window in my laundry had long ago seen better days.  I remembered about a piece of fabric I had purchased from this gorgeous French Shop last year when I visited with my lovely friends Sally & JaneA gorgeous vintage piece of linen imported from France - the odd tiny mend in it too 💕 I had washed it but done nothing with it - it had sat in my sewing room shelves.I decided to make up a new curtain for my window so I added a casing to the top & then threaded it onto an old length of rod  .  .  .  .Although it was not really the colours I had in mind for my Laundry - it fit perfectly at the window.Next I decided to make a new peg bag as the bottom had fallen out of my old one quite some time ago.I knew I had a nice piece of red/white ticking fabric that would be large enough but I felt that I needed to try & bring in the oranges & blues in the curtain piece.I also decided I needed to try to use up some of the hexie flowers - an Op Shop purchase from This PostLuckily enough I had, not one but two helpers for this exerciseMiss Pip helped me choose colours & then Blackie very kindly pressed them all flat for meI added in some Tilda fabrics as I knew I had some oranges - as well as some vintage embroidery pieces that were torn or tatty on one endA bit of a faff .... but it turned out very pretty & functional & beautiful .  .  .  ..  .  .  . and I managed to combine the oranges & the reds & the blues all together 💗I removed the plain centres of the hexie flowers & fussy cut some Tilda fabrics to replace themI LoVe my new peg bag ...... & it is functional but still beautiful in my eyes.During Lockdown Sid's parents have informed me he no longer has a daytime sleep - so I decided to take down the cot I had in my spare room.This left me a space to bring in the drop leaf desk I had in my Cottage.I never particularly liked this desk but it held all our paperwork & everytime I needed a receipt I had to run out to the Cottage to look for it.It would be much better inside the house.After painting I lightly distressed all the edges with sandpaperI begun to paint it with chalk paint but very soon ran out - so I finished the entire desk using my acrylic wall paint - Dulux Cottage CreamI liked it but I didn't Love it  ......  something was missing.I had ordered a pretty transfer from Paint Me Vintage a few weeks ago & this week, when our Country moved to Level 3 Lockdown we were able to receive parcels again.I thought the transfer might be perfect to bring the desk to life some what.I was able to cut into it & use 2 sections - I just love the way it has turned out & given the desk such a pretty french vibeFunctional ...... but still beautiful 💗Another special delivery to arrive last week was our brand new grandaughter (my step grandaughter)  We welcomed to the world little Juno Elizabeth weighing in at 8lbs 10 ozs By that I mean we welcomed her via cyber space as she is allowed no visitors just yet - but I can't wait to give her a cuddle 💗I was delighted when The Mr arrived home from the Farm supplies shop with a bag of potting mix for me the other day!It just goes to show how the simplest things can give you pleasure.I have been potting up lots of small cuttings & growing them by the French Doors at the end of my lounge which is like a little hot house area for plants.The Mr has several stray cats at the farm that come & go at various times, sometimes increase in numbers, sometimes decreaseTheir names are Friendly Cat 1, 2 & 3 (!!!) He feeds any that are there as they keep the rats & mice down & also help prevent the birds constantly building nests in the tractors & diggers - such a fire hazardAlthough they are quite wild, some have become tamer over time.  He sent me this photo yesterday of 3 of them in the back of his Ute when he came back from shifting the cows.I have promised Not to show Miss Pip the photo (!!) 😉Thanks So Very Much for your visits here today dear friends,I hope you are being kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Simple Rag Rug Tutorial ", "date": "Monday, April 20, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersThis lock down is teaching us all to use up what we have on hand  . . . after all,  we have little other choiceLast week after I washed my kitchen floor I noticed how tatty the rag rug was that sits directly below my sink.In fact it was getting to the stage where - every time you walked over it - another piece of red fabric came off !!I like a small mat beside my sink but as you can appreciate, it gets grubby - so is frequently in the wash.I decided to make myself a new one using an old method that I used to teach many years agoWork out what size you would like your rag rug to be & then gather together your supplies dear readers . . . - A selection of fabrics - any scraps will do - in fact you can use old clothing, t-shirts, upholstery or curtaining fabrics for these rag mats- A piece of calico or hessian  - I used calico as I knew this rug would be in the wash a great deal- Pencil & ruler, sewing machine & thread, scissors etc- A piece of wadding the size of your mat- One Ginger Cat - this is entirely optional although in my case .... it was not optional at all !! 😐(here on in the ginger cat shall be referred to as \"my assistant\")I worked out I wanted my mat to be 25 inches long x 18 inches wide (64 cms x 46 cms)Cut your piece of calico to the size you wish your rag rug to be.Draw lines along the width of it approx 1.5 inches (4 cms) apartYour assistant can help with this (!!)Draw right to the end of your calico pieceThe most tedious part is cutting your pieces of chosen fabric.I cut mine approximately 5.5 inches x 1.5 inches (14 cms x 4 cms)If you are slick with a rotary cutter you will be fast at this - I am rather slow.Toss all your cut pieces into a container & mix them up as you go.Cut more than you think you will need !Do not be exact with each piece as some variation doesn't matterBegin sewing them on your lines starting at one endI kept my basket of pieces right next to my machine & picked out one each at a timeTry Not to sew two pieces the same side by side if you canThis pic shows how I just move them all to one side to begin my next row - it's not difficultThree quarters of the way through  -  taking a breather The finished rag rug top - you can now snip off any longer lengths if you notice any (I did have some)Cut a piece of calico the same measurement as your topYour assistant can help with this taskThen cut a piece of wadding the same size as this - get your assistant to lay on the wadding to stop it moving around as you cut 😉Pin back your fabric strips roughly with pins - this will save the pieces getting caught in your seam as you sew - pin all the way around your matThen make a sandwich with the two calico pieces facing, & the wadding on the bottom, & pin really well right aroundSew around 3 sides - the 2 long sides & then 1 shorter end & then turn your rug through.I use a long needle to pull my corners out neatly - then I iron right around the whole mat & iron the open end together before sewing it closed.Take your rug outside & give it a really really good hard shakeStand back as lots of threads will fly off it.Lay your rug in your chosen place & then get your assistant to test it for \"comfort & snugability\"  💕Stand back & pat your back & tell yourself how absolutely clever you really are !!!Give your assistant the rest of the day off as she will be fairly exhausted after helping you so much today.  😉I hope you enjoyed this tutorial dear friends,Thanks so much for stopping by here todayDo let me know if any of you make yourself a rag rug - I can lend you the assistant for no cost whatsoever! With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

{"title": "Staying in my Bubble ...............................................", "date": "Saturday, March 28, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersAs of midnight last Wednesday New Zealand went into Level 4 Lockdown due to the Covid 19 virus.For us here this means everything is closed to the public except supermarkets, chemists, medical centres & petrol stations.Our Prime Minister has said \"we all have to stay in our bubbles in order to flatten the curve of this pandemic\"Personally I am more than happy in my bubble, but I know there are others that will really struggle with it & my heart goes out to them 💗I have a new (step) granddaughter due in 2 weeks time whom we will not be able to visit until this is all over.Over the past couple of weeks I have been doing some sewing for her just using up bits from my stash - I thought I would have no feminine fabrics but I was able to rustle up some pretty colourways.I made 3 bibs using this free pattern from the internet - I have made these for my other grandsons & their Mum's tell me -  \"these are the best bibs ever\" !! I always buy white or cream towels when I see them on sale & use the toweling for the back of the bibs.  I had an end left over from a white towel so I made two burp cloths & bound them with pink bias binding.I knitted two pink organic cotton washcloths using this free pattern I made a flannel wheatbag & the bunny rattle is made from a vintage wool blanket - I tucked a rattle into the bunnies tummy before stuffing with fibrefill.I found a length of fleece large enough to sew two cuddlies.The little cloth doll is called Maisie & is a pattern by Kate Henderson of never enough hours blog I packaged everything up in pink tissue paper & The Mr was able to deliver it over to the city before the lockdown came into force.Once we were in lockdown I decided to spend some time giving my sewing room a good clean, tidy & sort.This was looooong overdue dear readers. 😉It was lovely to give it all a good freshen & a fluff up & when I was finished I thought I would sew a new ironing board cover. Whenever I do this I just take the old cover off, cut the elastic & pull it out of its casing, open the fabric out fully & lay it on the new fabric on the floor - cut around the shape, make a casing, new elastic & voila .  .  .  .  .This fabric is Cath Kidston & was purchased a couple of years ago when Mystyle first closed its Cambridge shop. I originally planned to cover a chair with it but used something else instead.Last month my friend Gail turned 70 & had a small party.Although she said \"no gifts\" I wanted to give her something but was not quite sure what as Gail has everything you could ever want  😉I had this vintage cane dolls pram in my sleepout so I lined it with a black rubbish bag & planted it up with petunias for her.  On my way to her party I stopped at the Variety store & purchased a helium filled balloon that said \"Happy Birthday\" & tied this to the handle.Gail said it has continued to flower away beautifully & she was thrilled with her gift.Like alot of you I am sure, every now & again I feel this tight knot of anxiety about this horrid pandemic in our world - I worry for my children & grandchildren & what the future holds .....When I feel this happening I try to distract myself with some home remediesI play with Pippi alot - she is a great entertainer & very much lives in the momentBlackie has been bringing in on average one mouse a day (!!) lately so he prefers to maintain a social distance as Mum is none-too-happy with him 😐I burn lavender oil in my diffusers as I find this helps to calm meI knit dishcloths & I stockpile dishcloth cotton yarn in lovely colours 😉😇I try to cook good nutritious meals & I spend some time outdoors each day if the weather allows.I find if I keep my hands busy then my mind stays on track so I try to keep creative & do things that bring me pleasure.I am thinking of you all at this trying time dear friendsTake care of yourselves & each other & stay in your bubbles,With much love & friendship to you all ! 💕Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I was so encouraged by your words that I shall endeavour to keep plodding along with my blog & trying to post a bit more regularlyIn fact it has been a week of plodding ... some Orders were finished up & I have been waving my paintbrush around againMy sister-in-law Leonie gave me a piece of fabric & a chair pad she wanted covered - I forgot to take a \"before pic\".As there was a piece of fabric left I stitched up a small plump cushion to go on the chair & covered a button for the cushion centre.It is almost a year now since Leonie's Mum Dulcie passed away.Dulcie was a friendly, happy lady who loved clothes & loved bright colours.The fleece coat above left was one of her favourite garments - Leonie had it hanging in her wardrobe & asked me if I could make some lavender filled hearts from it - for her to hand out on her Mum's anniversary.Originally I was to make 6, then 8 ...... then this grew to 12.I am sure that due to the drought we have had this summer, the oil content in the lavender is high because these hearts smelt SO fragrant ... just divine 💜These wooden items have been sitting in my Cottage waiting for me to upcycle/revamp them for over a year now.Finally I hauled out all my left over colours of chalk paint.Top shelf                                                                            Lower shelfThis old wooden trolley has been painted in Sandstone & the stencilling done in Duck Egg Blue - I only own one stencil so you get varying versions of the same thing 😉This small wooden cabinet had been gifted to me years ago & - at the time - I stripped & oiled it.Now it too got painted in Sandstone & lightly stencilledThe oak bedside cabinet above got painted in Old Linen - I love this colour as it has a faint bluey/grey tinge.Some leftover rub-ons got applied to the door.This small polka dot suitcase got a freshen up with some pale duck egg - I don't know why I bothered masking up the handles as I ended up painting them anyway 😉Some time has been spent with my beautiful grandsons who are growing up so very fast!They both came for a sleepover at Granny's - we had a wonderful time together but one of us (Yes, you can guess) was shattered at the end & needed a nap to catch up again  !!I still enjoy knitting at nights  - these cotton dishcloths are made using all my oddments of bamboo/cotton yarn - they are real scrap bag cloths.   But they are fun to do & don't require too much concentration - which suits me just fine of an evening.Thanks so much dear friends for your visits today,I hope the rest of the week is good & kind to all of you,Thanks again for all your kindness & encouragement in my last post.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Positives & Negatives", "date": "Monday, March 2, 2020", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI am having yet another attempt at resuscitating this poor neglected blog of mineFebruary was a month of many positives AND negatives & I just did not get any time to blog.We had endless ups & downs with my Mum during February & then I myself became sick - twice !!After several Dr's visits & investigations I tested positive for campylobacter & am now taking antibiotics to clear it up & get back to some good health.So blogging definately was not a priority - some days it felt like it took all my energy just to get through the day.Though my poor garden is rather like my blog - sad & neglected - the roses are still blooming away.This is a good time of year for picking & drying the many petals I require throughout the year for the potpourri's I sell.An added bonus is that it doesn't take long for the petals to dry to a crisp these hot summer days.My friend Carolyn visited early last month & bought me a large armload of Nigella Seed Heads  (Love in a mist) from her garden.When I cut them all up they filled a 10 litre bucket - these will be wonderful to help bulk out my citrus potpourri'sThe statice is blooming & required cutting & hanging bunches to dry.I have picked 3 trays of lavender heads so far (tho' there are many more still to pick) & sat one evening & rubbed one tray full into brown paper bagsI had an Order from my friend Marie for 10 lavender bags & 10 mothball sachets, which I always enjoy making.(The mothball sachet recipe can be found at the bottom of this post if you would like to make your own.)Quite some time ago I bought this chandelier off Trade me, a New Zealand auction site, similar to ebay The seller was demolishing a house & as no-one had bid on the chandelier they offered it to me for $5.00  ....  pointing out to me that it would probably need re-wiring to be able to use it.I removed the lightbulb holders & pulled out the wiring from it - I had no intentions of it ever being re-wired.Then I painted the brass with some left over chalk paint (Colour - Yorkshire Stone)I found 3 matching china cups + saucers in my stash & made soy candles in each cup (Fragrance - Black Raspberry/Vanilla)I used a strong Araldite Glue to affix the saucers to each of the 3 \"arms\" of the chandelier & then glued the cups onto the saucers.After hanging it up I decided it needed some crystals hanging from the curves of each arm - my photographs are not doing it justice - it looks gorgeous hanging up & I am so thrilled with my $5 purchaseWhat's more - another of the endless ideas floating around in my head  has come to fruition 💕😊 !!On Friday I had to deliver a tractor part to The Mr at the farm & snapped a quick pic of the dry brown pastures - this countryside is peat & usually manages to keep a green tinge over our hot summer months but everything is brown & crisp for milesToday is overcast but still humid - Miss Pip has spent the day in her banana box out on the deck, & I think Blackie is under the house in the cool - he will return covered in cobwebs tonight.I have reached a bit of a crossroads with my blog & alot of things in my life of late.I wonder if my blog has become a bit stale & I don't seem to have as many interesting things to post about compared to when I was running my Cottage ?I shall be giving it some deep thought over the coming weeks about whether or not I continue.In the meantime Thank You All So Much for your visits & your continued support here.With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Gosh how lucky I am !I have her home now & she is not going away with the rest of the Christmas decor - she sits here in my lounge watching over me 💖I have named her Angel Claire.Have a wonderful weekend dear friends - it's hard to believe we say farewell to January tonight. Thanks so much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Shirley had come across a piece of handmade felt that she had made awhile ago & decided to make 6 little stockings with crocheted snowflakes on & silk ribbon bows.Shirley asked me to fashion her \"a coathanger of sorts\" to hang them on.I had a lace covered cream satin coathanger already made so I added a wooden snowflake to it - sprayed first with some cream spray paint.I made some holly shaped leaves from felt for each end along with gold bells & embellishments to compliment the bells Shirley had stitched to her stockings.When I delivered the coathanger to Shirley I thought it looked So Stunning I could quite easily have bought it right back home with me!!I decided to do a quick paint/upcycle on this old wooden stool to use in my bedroom.I have to do these projects when The Mr is not here because he does not like me painting the native wood.The colour is Old Linen (chalkpaint) & I covered it with some leftover curtain fabric.Though my eyes are tired at night, I still like to sit & knit either dishcloths or cotton scrubby cloths,Blackie tucks up right beside me these evenings - he is feeling rather tired himself from all the Christmas prep he has still to do 😉 !!Thanks as always for your lovely visits here today dear friends,I hope the lead up to Christmas is going well for you all,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Advent Calendars & Train Trips .........................................", "date": "Wednesday, December 4, 2019", "text": "December Greetings dear friends & readersAbout 5 years ago I bought some sets of novelty pegs in a half price sale.I had originally intended using the pegs to make Advent Calendars to sell at Christmas time in my Craft Cottage.This idea never came to fruition.Last month, when a box fell off a shelf in my sewing room - out tumbled the pegs ..... perhaps I could make Advent Calendars for my Grandsons ??These wooden \"trees\" were purchased last year from The Warehouse - once again at half marked price so instead of being $20 each, I got the 2 for $20There were only 15 round hooks in each tree - so I carefully unscrewed theseI hot glued the novelty pegs onto my trees, making sure to cover the holes & also to evenly space out my 24 pegs.While down at Mum's last month I came across a Photocopy Shop closing down with all her plain wooden letters for 50c each.I purchased my grandson's names & once home, I painted them with a testpot of chalk paint I found in my cupboard ... Imperial Red - the perfect Christmas red  💗When dry I hot glued my letters to the star on the top of the tree.My local Patchwork Shop StitchinStuff was selling these lovely printed panels with little stockings on so I purchased a different one for each of my GrandsonsNow believe me dear friends - sewing all those teeny tiny stockings was not terribly much fun at all 😉 !!As the girl in the Patchwork Shop said to me \"the first 3 are great fun & then after that it's just plain fiddly\"And I had 48 to sew !!Each one was backed with a red/white spot fabric I found in my stash The Panel I used for Alec's advent stockings reminded me very much of French General fabrics 💕During the process of making all 48 stockings, as well as working on my Orders ...... I somehow lost Numbers 16 & 23 !!  I could NoT BeLieVe it !! It took me 3 days to find them in amongst the mess that my sewing room is in creative space that I work in 😉So I decided to make a small pouch that the stockings could be kept in when they are un-pegged each dayI used the same red spot fabric & the edges of the stocking panels had these lovely fabric tags on them, so I stitched one on each pouch.My next task was taking one stocking & heading off to my local Variety Store to find treats small enough to fit into the stockings.I decided to wrap each days surprise in red tissue as I had visions of Alec peeking in all the stockings to see what was in them.48 tiny packages later & I was finished !! Phew !!Last Sunday, the 1st December I packed up a picnic lunch &  took my grandson's & their families to the Hamilton Miniature Train ParkThe day was warm & windy & we just had the bestest time togetherWe rode the trains & we picnicked & the little ones rode bikes, blew bubbles & told stories to each otherThe Park has many big established trees that are just wonderful to picnic under.I also gifted my Grandsons their Advent Calendars & watched with pleasure as they each opened Day 1.Well dear friends I am currently working on my very last Order 😊Thanks So Much for your visits here today - I hope the coming week is good & kind to you all,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Christine's Christmas Order - (Part 2)", "date": "Sunday, November 24, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers(Warning - bit of a photo heavy post!!)Last Thursday I loaded up my car with all of Christine's Christmas Orders & drove to the other side of the city to deliver them, & to see her Christmas decorating (shall not mention the fact that I got lost twice in the city trying to find her!!) Believe me friends - I was Not disappointed!! 😊Above is the Christmas Tree in the Winter Wonderland Lounge which is where the Angel & Santa from my last post were created forMore Winter Wonderland VignettesWay back in this post in 2016 Christine commissioned me to make her a black & cream Santa to go in her black/cream decorated lounge.(Photo of the Santa from my 2016 blog post)This year - in her new home - the master bedroom has the black & cream theme ..... so Christine asked me to make up an Angel that matched the SantaI was fortunate enough to still be able to buy some of the black floral fabrics for her wings & bloomers(I have used the Charlotte Angel Pattern again by Rosalie Dekker designs)I had used the wooden star buttons on Santa's Jacket & I managed to find one left in my stashHere they both are below - sitting on the bed in the black & cream decorated bedroomChristine had even decorated her dressing tables in a black & cream Christmas theme - just stunning !These photos below show her dining area - this was decorated in a copper & gold colour scheme - quite traditional, which I loved.In this area is the free standing fireplace - Christine had wound bubble wrap around the chimney flue & then added greenery & stunning copper & gold Christmas embellishments - it looked just like a tree 💗So of course - she needed a copper & gold decorated Santa & Angel for this area.When Christine placed her Order she had given me some of the copper & gold fabrics which I used in both the Santa & Angel but was lucky enough to find others to compliment this colourway.Also some copper bells for Santa to hold which were found in a Variety Store in Mum's townI made up a patchwork stocking using a mixture of all the fabrics & stuffed it with greenery, a copper wire heart & a vintage Santa ornamentFor his other arm I found this coppery coloured bear - leftover stock from my Cottage closureI removed his bow & made him a bowtie & a pom pom hat . . . . .He was the perfect size for Santa's other arm & just tucked in nicelyMiss copper/gold Angel turned out beautifully - her hair is the most gorgeous coloured hand dyed mohair(You can click on the photos to enlarge them if you wish)I love her sweet little face.I even found some sparkly copper ribbon at my local Patchwork StoreOnce again, the Variety store provided the copper hanging crystal decoration which was just the right size to stitch in her handsThe paint for her shoes is Burnt Sienna  -  I found by mixing just a teeny bit of black into this, it gave just the right shade of coppery gold that I was afterChristine was delighted with her entire Order & we had a lovely time finding homes for all her Angels & Santa's in her beautifully decorated Home.Remember in my last post how I said she even decorates her bathroom at Christmas ??Well dear friends, I took a photo to prove it 😉 !!If you have managed to stay with me til the end, thank you So Much! I hope the week ahead is good & kind to you all,Thank You, as always, for your visits here today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Christine's Christmas Order   -   (Part 1)", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersIt is a wet, rainy Monday here today in the Waikato  I am pleased I took the time yesterday to pick some flowers for inside the house as my roses are looking rather worse for wear from all the rain we have had (Sorry Willie !!)Though I am not complaining as any rain at this time of year is So appreciated & saves alot of manual garden wateringMy lovely friend Christine decorates her entire house every Christmas - she does something festive in every room, even the bathrooms !This Christmas they have a new home over in the city - so Christine is changing her decorating a little to go with their new home.She has placed a large Order with me which I have almost finished so I have decided to break it in to 2 partsto share with you Her first request this year was for a \"Winter Wonderland themed\" Angel & Santa.  Her instructions were that \"she wanted them to be in silver & white - to still look a bit country-ish & not look too modern\"I have been sewing for Chris for a number of years now & I think I know her taste fairly well.  Added to this is the fact that she just pretty much leaves me to do what I think ... so it's often quite a leap of faith on both our parts.Once again I went back to the Rosalie Quinlan Pattern \"Charlotte Angel\" as I find this a good size at 73 cms tall plus her length matches well with the Santa Pattern I use.The gorgeous silver snowflake & star fabrics were all found at Spotlight.  I took these doll bodies on my last trip to Mums & spent time sitting stuffing their looong skinny limbs.While down at Mums I found the delightful glittery snowflake/tassel ornament in a Variety store The hair I use on these Angels is hand-dyed mohair yarnI didn't gather her sleeves in, as the pattern stated, but left them billowy.When the wings are sewn I always paint them with a watered down PVA glue mixture as this keeps them stiffHer shoes were painted in silvery grey chalk paint that I found in my paint stash - trimmed with lazy daisiesI felt the large pom pom trim on her dress just helped give her that country look I was trying to achieve.Next up came Santa - this is a pattern I have made several times for Christine - it is called \"Prim Olde Santa\" & is designed by Kerry Daly of Primitive Country Treasures  (this was published in a very old Homespun Magazine)I repeated the silver & white theme using some soft fleece for his jacket trimmed with a silver lam'e fabricI used the same fabric for Santa's hat as I used for the Angel's wings.I also repeated the bobble trim on the hem of Santa's jacketIn Kerry's original pattern he holds a ragdoll but I decided against this as I wanted to keep to the white/silver colourway  This white teddy was sitting with some leftover stock in my Cottage so I removed his red bows/trims & dressed him in a silver/grey bowtie & fur trimmed hat.He was the perfect size to tuck under Santa's armI made a patchwork stocking as per the pattern instructions & was lucky enough to find these silver & white sparkly berries & cones at Spotlight. The tin teddy had once-upon-a-time adorned a Greeting Card (Yes I really DO keep all sorts of junk!!) - Teddy had a fluoro pink bow which I dabbed with my white paintI felt Teddy just finished off the stocking nicely.I purchased the chunky wool yarn for Santa's beard from SpotlightI must confess I had not been excited at all about bringing these Winter Wonderland folk to life but I just absolutely LoVe them 💕I have sent photos to Christine & she adores them also & can't wait to hang them in her winter wonderland themed room 💗I should mention that while I have been beavering away in my sewing room these past weeks, I often spot Miss Pippi tucked up in my fabric baskets - if she just moved 2 baskets to the right, she would be in the orange basket!Last Saturday (9th) was my town's annual local Craft Fair.Though I have had a stall for the past several years, I was so relieved I had not booked myself one this year - especially when all the issues unfolded with Mum(Photo sourced from the local eventfinda page)I did decide however, to go as a customer & get to have a proper look at all the different stalls - this year there were 100!The weather was kind & the rain stayed away - there was a great atmosphere.As I could feel a chesty cold coming on, I just had a relatively quick wander & chatted to a few stallholders, but I did manage some purchases while there.I bought some lovely plants from two stalls & then some handmade soap from my friend Pauline who runs a wonderful homegrown business - Infused With NatureThis local lady was a new stallholder & I loved her ceramic work. I bought some herb labels which I will put in my garden when the rain stops ... along with this cute hanging cat which I plan to put on my sewing room wall ... it reminded me of a certain 4 legged girl that resides here 😉Well dear friends - I will be back before the end of the week with Part 2 of Christines Christmas OrderThanks So Much for your visits today I hope the coming week is good & kind to you all,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Home Again ", "date": "Monday, November 11, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,Welcome back to my poor neglected blog -  & also Welcome to November!Since my last post (a whole month ago!) I have been back down to Mum's again  (4 trips in 6 weeks) - but I am pleased to report that Mum has finally returned Home again, as per her wishesIn order for this to happen lots of changes had to be put in place in Mums Home & also daily routines.This has meant that I am finally able to return Home again myself - I miss my Home so much when I am away & I miss my two furry friends far more than I care to let on 😉Miss Pippi frets when I go away & upon my return, she becomes my shadow for a week or so.While I have been away I have been conscious of my Orders piling up & not getting done so I took some hand sewing with me on my last tripMy lovely friend Jane bought this pattern out earlier in the year along with some Liberty print fat quarters & requested me to make it up for herI managed to get the bears stitched & stuffed while down at Mums & also the doll body stuffed.Upon my return I have finished her off & Jane was delighted with her OrderThe pattern also comes with a drawstring bag pattern to be made as storage for the doll & bears - but Jane & I both agreed they were far too nice to spend their lives tucked away in a bag 😉Also on the \"half started pile\" was this old suitcase that I had put one coat of chalkpaint on - & then decided to add a glue-on embellishment before continuing to paint.I purchased several of these embellishments from Paint Me Vintage - they are just glued onto the item & then when painted they look just like they have always been part of it.The suitcase was painted in Old Linen & then lightly scuffed.Now you will no doubt be wondering why I put the embellishment on the side of the suitcase & not in the middle ??Because I had something (or someone) rather pretty to sit on the suitcase . . . . . . . . . . . This Autumn Angel is a free pattern from the Tilda Website - I just adored her & decided to make her up in some of the Plum Garden fabrics as I had a few fat quarters of this rangeHer patchwork Plum pattern is also free to download on the websiteI made her apron longer & added a bobble trim - otherwise I just kept to the original patternThe merino wool dolls hair I purchased from Millymac SuppliesThough I have been diligently working on a large Christmas Order, it has been lovely to create something just for myself for a change also.I potted up a sweet little Op Shop china Jug with babies tears for my friend Jane's birthday a couple of weeks ago.Also my Aunt is turning 90 next weekend. Though we have been invited to the birthday luncheon Mum is not up to the trip - I am thankful for this as the journey would involve 7.5 hours of driving for me.So I decided to make Aunty Noeline a lavender bag & send it off with a nice card - she likes nothing frilly or flowery so I kept it very plain & simple on a nice piece of linen in her favorite color way.It is filled with my own homegrown lavender & smells divine. 💗Over the weekend I harvested half the beetroot ready in my garden - my crop has done really well this year.I cooked most of it for eating & then grated some of it & made a delicious raw beetroot salad.The recipe is * Here * for anyone that might be interested.(I didn't add raisins & just used Balsamic Vinegar for my dressing)Well dear friends - that's me all caught up I think.Thanks so much for your always-welcome visits here today,I shall be back soon to share a beautiful Christmas Order I have been crafting.Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Broken Things", "date": "Sunday, October 13, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersGoodness I did not mean to be gone for so long - somehow another shiny new month has come along 💛My Mother has had a fall & broken her hip.  Most of the past month has been spent down in Mum's province, sitting by her hospital bed in two different hospitals.Mum underwent surgery to pin & screw the break, & a rod was inserted - she then returned to the local hospital in her small town for rest & rehabilitation.At 90 years old my Mum's bones are frail & her lower body strength is rather minimal.I honestly don't know what the future holds ... it is a period of deep uncertainty & we can make no plans at present until we see what unfolds.While Mum was in the main city hospital where she underwent surgery I travelled each day to sit with her - a journey of about an hour 15.   After doing this for a week my dear friend Carolyn invited me to stay with her - she is only 20 minutes drive from the hospital.  I spent some nights with Carolyn & the days with Mum.Carolyn is a talented & creative friend - she had decided to mosaic the concrete entrance ways to her property using up some of the large stash of broken china & tiles she had acquired.Late one afternoon I was able to sit outside & chat with her as she did some mosaicing - & listen to the incredible bird life in her garden.I especially loved the way she had inserted little handles & critters into her work.One side is complete & she is working on the other side - even her letter box got the mosaic treatmentIt was fortunate that I remembered to toss my knitting into the car as I threw some things together before heading off on my journey down to MumsThe long days at the hospital has seen my dishcloth pile grow & there have been two more added since this photoOn the exact same day that Mum had her fall I had undertaken a small upcycling projectI have never had a bedside cabinet - always just making do with a stool by my side of the bed.This little wooden unit had sat in my wood shed for several years, becoming home to a family of spiders.A good scrub in the spring sunshine & then a coat of chalk paint (color - Old Linen)  - I ended up giving it two coats before being called away down to Mum'sUpon my return it was the first project I wanted to complete.  I had a couple of odd transfers left over from this project *Here* so I cut them out & applied them - Miss Pippi checked it all out for me & gave it the once over !!            Before transfers                              After transfers                    Finally a good coat of wax & it was complete - all using up products that I had on hand & nothing purchased.  I am loving having the drawer to hide my chocolate stash bits & bobs in 😉 !!On Friday I had to pop into town & run some errands for Mum & well - wouldn't you know it, the Op Shop just happened to be right next door 😊I could not resist treating myself to a few treasures to bring home with me.Thanks so much for your visits dear friends - I shall get around to visiting you all at your blogs now I am home briefly,Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Pincushion Swap", "date": "Wednesday, September 18, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Wednesday to you all !!A couple of years ago my dear friend Leeanne emailed me & said  \"here is a blog I think you might really enjoy\"The blog she was referring to was Janet's blog  \"Rogue Quilter\"I began following Janet & spent many hours drooling over her beautiful quilting & fine detailed work - in particular her mini quiltsOn a post a few months back, I happened to comment how beautiful I thought this bowl of pincushions was - all made from leftover scraps by Janet\"Would you perhaps like one ?\" asked JanetAnd so I offered to do a small swap with her - we both quickly agreed not to put any pressure on ourselves & just make this swap very casual  - which suited us both perfectlyI wasn't sure what to send to Janet - but I remembered her mentioning how much she loved my upcycled projects I came across these two wooden spools - they had been tossed my way when a friend was throwing out an old spinning wheel that had gotten wet & somewhat swollen in size(I have probably had these for about 4 years now)I decided to upcycle one of them & make into a pincushion for JanetI made the top \"pincushion part\" by gathering a circle of raw linen, filling it with wadding & affixing it to the spool - then I wound some thin batting around the centre stemI covered this with some tape measure ribbon that I already had in my stashBecause the base was not sitting stable I glued a large washer to the base & then covered this with black wool felt - this gave the whole thing some weight & good stability(This was actually The Mr's suggestion - not mine) 😉I had enough small beaded letters in my stash to spell the word \"quilt\" - unfortunately not enough to spell \"Rogue Quilter.\"I stitched some tiny hexies to the top & then sewed on a couple of copper effect sewing charms - also in my stashMy pincushion was ready to send across the oceans & the miles to Janet in Utah.As I forgot to photograph my parcel before I posted it I have borrowed this photo from Janet's blogI purchased some handmade lavendar soap from this gorgeous Lavender Farm just 5 minutes up the road from where I live.,Also I purchased some Whittakers chocolate, made here in New Zealand - & sent one of my linen lavendar hearts.I crossed my fingers & toes that all this would get through Customs without a hitch 😉You can read Janet's blog post about receiving my parcel * Here *Yesterday - to my utter delight - Janet's swap package arrived.Let me tell you friends, before I even got the end open, I could smell this most delicious fragrance !! 💗Janet had sent me some of her own handmade herbal soap - it is Sooo divine, I cannot describe the incredible smell of it (& that beautiful bee shaped soap made my heart skip several beats)!!Along with the wonderful promised pincushion Janet had included one of her mini quilts ! 😊This one had been made from scraps retrieved from the rubbish bin while Janet was on Retreat - one lady had tossed all her scraps out & Janet had \"rescued them\". I was just delighted & quite honestly - speechless! The workmanship & tiny piecing is just incredible.  Also included was a notepad & some delicious sounding choccy treats (which won't last long in my hands I can assure you !!)Thank You So Very Much Janet - your parcel made my day & I just can't stop staring at all my treasures.You are so kind & generous & I wish there wasn't a great big Ocean in between us !!! 💕Yesterday was a Tuesday-with-Sid-day & as it turned cold & rainy, we - (I) - made a hut!It only seems like just yesterday I was making these for Sid's Daddy - covering my old wooden clothes horse with sheets to make a hut !While Sid had a nap in the afternoon I sat & bagged up fresh supplies of both my citrus & my cottage garden potpourri'sI supply these to The Farm Shop at Gordonton & they were low in stock so tomorrow I am driving over to replenish their supplies.This afternoon I have finished making up more of my teacup birdfeeders - these are also going to the Farm Shop to be sold on my behalfI sell each birdfeeder with a small bag of Wild Bird SeedAnyone who has been following my blog for awhile now knows my addiction inclination towards old vintage china - I love to scour the Op Shops for it.So I had a good stash to choose from to make these up today.Before I drive to Gordonton I am driving across to the opposite side of the City to attend my eldest Grandsons Daycare as they are having a Grandparents Morning.Thanks So Very Much for your visits today dear friends,I hope the rest of the week goes well for you & you find some happy moments in the busy-ness of your days,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A little bit of D.I.Y.", "date": "Saturday, September 14, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,Just after my last post Sid went away with his parents for a holiday to the Sunshine Coast of Australia.As I didn't have to look after him for the week I decided this might be a good opportunity to paint my Hallway.My first EVER homegrown freesias picked from my garden - their fragrance is divine !!~My hallway is only small but it leads to our Utility rooms & - although tiny - it has 3 doorways & 2 cupboards leading off it.And not much room to move either !!It used to have an exterior glass door at the end but we removed this when we did our lounge reno & made it into a craft cupboard - you can read about it in this post HereSo now we have no natural light coming into the hallway at all.Firstly I needed to nail quarter round moldings to the corner of the wall that the builders never finished off  - this then had to be filled & primer/undercoated.Then I began painting the walls & YES - I had constant unwanted supervision throughout the entire process !!! 😉It was a very small space to move around in & it is only fair to say - I got paint everywhere !!~!My dear old Dad was a painter & he would've been turning in his grave if he saw how I worked !!Once I got two coats on the walls & the door frames painted, I decided to paint the door at the end (my craft cupboard) in pink.I had a Resene testpot in the colour Pale RoseOnce I had done a coat of this, I didn't like it at all - it reminded me of pink primer paint ... so I tried out some blue colors I had in testpots.By this stage it was resembling a bit of an ugly patchwork quilt 😉Finally - after a day of walking past it - back to cream the door went !In hindsight I am so pleased I kept it the same color throughout as it's such a small space & it helps to lighten it a littlePlus I had decided to apply the leftover transfer from this little upcycle project that I did HereThis whole process was to be very much using up what I had on hand & not buying anything !The sweet little china cross was a birthday gift from my lovely friend Jane.These gorgeous vintage frames were purchased last year from my friend Sallys online vintage store - I loved them but had never found the right spot for them to hangYou can see in this picture & the one below, that my hallway had once upon a time, been wallpapered in a heavy duty textured wallpaper.  I simply painted right over this & loved the effect of it all.A simple bevelled glass mirror - an op shop purchase - was my final decoration to the wall.As our cat's litter box goes into the hallway at nights I chose not to place any other furniture in the narrow passageway.But I do plan to make a long rag mat (from scrap fabrics) for the floor - once I catch my breath.Next up I wanted to do some sort of shades for the 2 lights in the hallway - I found these old wire frames in my sleepout so I chose a pretty Tilda fabric from my stash, that echoed the plummy colors in the door transfer.I tore strips, ironed them & then wound them round the wire frame - my only purchase was 2 of those skeletal light bulbs that have the filaments showing  (not photographing especially well here today)It has certainly freshened & lightened it up but gosh I am SO pleased it is all done & I hope I don't have to do it again for many, many years! Give me a piece of furniture to paint anyday in preference to a room !! 😉During the course of last week & in the midst of my painting spree - I remembered my lovely friend Sally had a birthday coming up.I found this old wooden box in my sleepout so I painted each of the 4 sides with some black chalk paint & my stencilThen I lined the whole box with a black rubbish bag & planted it with a punnet of snapdragons (antirrhinums) - these have such a long flowering period & if you pinch the centres out, I find they bush out nicely.A little chalk board sign & the planter box was complete.The next day I made up a batch of lemon dusters as I knew Sal would enjoy using these. I also made a Citrus Slice - some to enjoy & some to gift to Sal, as we seem to still have an abundance of lemons & oranges on our trees.Thanks so much for staying with me through this lengthy post dear friends.Before I sign off, I just wanted to share this delighful photo of dear little Sid on holiday in Noosa.Isn't this just the picture of a little boy in absolute heaven ?! 💙Wishing you a wonderful weekend dear friends,Be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

Lampshade", "date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2019", "text": "Good Wednesday Morning to you all dear friends & readers 💚Early last month - when I should have been working on Orders but was distracting myself - I decided I was tired of my coffee table display & thought it was perhaps about time I put my Easter things away (!!!) 😕I found this lampshade on top of a wardrobe in my sleepout - it had been a $5 purchase from Hospice sometime last yearAs you can see it was in excellent condition but the fixture inside where it could be fitted to a lamp stand, was missing.I decided to pull all the covering off it including the wrapping around the sides of the frame  I had a \"sort-of-an-idea-floating-in-my-head\" that I wanted to rust itI soaked it in a mixture of vinegar & salt - as I only had a shallow plastic bath I had to rotate it over several days but finally I could see the rusting process beginning I left the top & bottom of the frame with the wrapping on as I planned to re-wrap this with new fabricOnce I felt it had rusted enough I rinsed it well with cold water (you need to do this in order to halt the rusting process) then left it by the fire with Miss Pippi to supervise while it dried.This is how it looked once I had wrapped the top & bottom of the frame in a dull brown fabric - I wanted a rustic primitive look - you see I planned to use the frame as a sort of \"rustic cloche\" on my coffee tableHere it is all set up on a vintage crochet doiley with my fairy lights wrapped around it I used a small stack of vintage prayer books & some other rustic looking objects as a display under my \"cloche\"The hessian table runner just seemed to compliment the display perfectlyDown one end I displayed the soy candles I had made in some gorgeous crystal jugs gifted to me by my dear friend Sue I am really thrilled with my new/old display - however when I showed The Mr my finished cloche, his only comment was \"I think you have ruined a perfectly good lampshade !!\" 😉Speaking of rustic things - I have been working outside on the very occasional days we have had fine weather - these are few & far between!This rusty old tin hatbox was out in the woodshed so I lined it with a black polythene bag & then planted it with some succulents that were ready to be transplanted outI am hoping they will multiply & spill over the edgesWhilst weeding an area of garden I noticed some pots tucked under a shrub & upon pulling them out, I see they were my hyacinth bulbs from last spring - just beginning to flower.The scent from the white one is beautiful 💚Last weekend before the wild weather came again I picked a large vase of daffodils & two jars of white Daphne to enjoy inside instead of watching it all get bashed around in the garden.My friend Denise posted this little Verse on Instagram - I just loved it & asked her if I could share it on my blog  I hope you can read it okay - it is titled  \"Seenager\"Thanks again for your visits & your lovely comments today dear friends,It is nasty weather here again today & Miss Pippi is tucked up on the couch by the fire sound asleepYou can forgive her anything when you see her like this!(including the mouse she bought in at 5.30 am this morning!!!)Have a wonderful day dear friends,Much love & friendship to you all 💗Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Three Large Angels Made Using Vintage Linens", "date": "Thursday, August 15, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersGosh - Thursday already! Another week is flying by!Jillian came to visit me in late May - she bought with her a large basket filled with her late Mum's vintage linens & doilies - she asked me if I would make them up into 3 Angels for her & her two sisters  We sat together & I went through the basket & selected anything that I thought might be suitable - these are my selection above.Finally - about 10 days ago I found some time to begin Jillian's Order.Firstly I had to dye my calico for the Angel's bodiesI prefer using Parisian Essence to traditional tea dying as I like the mottled effect it gives plus I find you can control the colour alot more this wayOnce the calico was dried & ironed I began tracing out the dolls - I wanted to make a decent sized Angel to do justice to the doilies so I chose Charlotte Angel by Rosalie Quinlan Designs as she measures a generous 72 cms tall. As you can see above, I had some assistance with laying out the body pattern.In fact, this assistance continued right throughout the making of these dolls !!It is always nerve wracking cutting into other peoples treasured vintage linens - but Miss Pippi was there to \"talk me through\" cutting into the beautiful vintage lace tablecloth that I needed to use for a doll's dressLast weekend during our dreadful stormy weather I stayed indoors & quilted around the Angels wings as well as painting their shoes & drying them by the fireYes - I should have done the shoes first, but I was undecided about colours until I had them dressedThe White Angel was the first one finished - I had suggested to Jillian that I make a white one, a cream one & then one with a mixture of both colours(Incidently all the linens & doilies I used for the Angels had to be soaked & washed first as many had slightly yellowed & some had age spots on them)I pieced two smaller doilies together to make her bodice - I really loved the doiley I used for her pinny (below left)Her dress was a simple white table runner - but the doiley I used for her wings was one of my favorite's with gorgeous fuchsia flowers embroidered on itNext up was Miss Pink - named because I used a selection of doilies that matched & made up a pretty dressing table set.Miss Pink's dress was made from the vintage crochet tablecloth that Pippi was helping me cut into earlierHer pinny & bodice were part of the set & then I pieced two smaller doilies together to create her wings.I cut down a small size crochet doiley to use for her collar & added a simple pearl strandHer shoes were painted a delicate pink called Pale Rose & then I took the smallest doiley of the set & stitched it into her handsThe last Angel I have called Miss Burgundy - due to her burgundy/russet coloured hair. The hair I have used on all 3 Angels is hand dyed mohair yarn that I buy online.Once again Miss Russet has the most gorgeous doilies for her bodice & her wings were another doiley pair pieced together.I lightly stiffened all 3 Angels wings to prevent them from falling forward.All the Angels have bloomers made from vintage crochet linens I did not stitch anything into Miss Burgundy's hands as I remembered that Jillian had a box of her Mum's vintage handkerchiefs - we had talked previously about stitching these into the doll's hands    💕All 3 ladies in their finery, reclining on my spare bed  - ready to fly away home to Jillian's 💗On Monday I had a baking day - these are few & far between nowadays as they are often followed by Eating Days!!Firstly I made a Feijoa & Coconut Cake using some feijoa pulp I found in my freezer.While this was in the Oven I made Rice Bubble Crisp - a recipe I used to make frequently when my boys were young.Lastly I made a Bacon & Egg Pie for our dinner this week - I serve this with either veggies or salads to give us some variety.And then last night I sat with my own vintage linens on the floor to work out which ones I wanted to use in an upcoming project  As you can see friends  ......  I had assistance yet again !!! 😸My good friend Julie has started a blog.  Julie creates beautiful children's clothing for sale under the label Bo and Co - we always ensure we are neighbors at the yearly craft fairs we attend.In this world of Instagram I still really enjoy blogging & reading blogs so I am So pleased Julie has started one  Here is the link to her delightful blog ...    Hello Bo and CoPlease do pop over & say Hello & let her know she is not just talking to herself 😉Thanks as always dear friends, for your visits to my blog,As the week is nearly over I hope the coming weekend is wonderful for you all,Take care of yourselves & of each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Craft Group Meetings, Veggie Gardens & Cat Scratching Poles (!!!)", "date": "Wednesday, August 7, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Welcome to August !!Sometimes in the midst of winter, I find it's the simple little things that can bring the greatest pleasureLike nipping out between the showers today to pick a bunch of daphne for my kitchen bench 💗Yesterday was our monthly Craft Group Meeting & it was my turn to be the hostessThe ladies were keen to learn candle making.I found a big old cathedral candle in the back of my cupboard - one of those that seems to burn half way through & then give up completely.I chopped it up on the brick path using my axe (!!) & then we melted it down in two old saucepans.The ladies had all bought along op shopped containers of various shapes & sizes, & I showed them how to \"wick them\" before pouring our candlesWe scented the melted wax with beautifully smelling Orange & Clove Oils.While we waited for them to set we had a delicious lunch.You know - I have said this before But ...... if we get nothing else right, we sure know how to do the food part of it 😉The finished candles ...... I wanted to pour another thin layer of melted wax over the top to fill in the small dents but the ladies decided they quite liked the \"character\" this gave their candles.All in all - a wonderful way to spend a chilly wet winter's day!Sid has discovered his love of drawing with felt pens.Luckily I always keep a large stock of blank paper in the house for just such activities ... he loves me to sit beside him & drawYou can see my version of a dinosaur in this picture - Sid has \"coloured it in\" & then informs me the big black blob beside it is \"Granny being eaten by the dinosaur\" (!!) Thanks Sid!When I returned from Mum's 90th birthday back in April, I decided to replant my veggie garden as our autumn days still seemed so mild.I had purchased some veggie punnets while at Mum's & planted a couple of each into her raised garden so I had left over broccoli, silverbeet, cabbages & red beet to plant into my two gardens.I have been surprised how well the plants have grown through our cold winter months & have recently begun picking a variety of veggies for our evening mealThis huge head of broccoli (one of my favorite veggies) is sitting on my kitchen bench to be cooked with our dinner tonight.It is honestly quite pathetic how The Mr & I treat our furry friends here at Threadbear HQ 😺Miss Pippi has repeatedly scratched & worked away at the edge of our (2 year old) carpet until she has worn it to a thread.Last week in desperation I drove to the Vets & purchased this scratching pole below - I have always thought these were hideous things to have in your room but needs mustThis is the photo I took of it in the Vets carpark & sent to The Mr via my phone to see what he thought.I am pleased to report that Her Royal Highness has begun to use it .... I must admit The Mr & I take it in turns to \"spend time\" with her dragging her favourite cord over it & encouraging her to jolly well Use the thing !!Yep - just like I said ......  we are pathetic 😉 !!I was gifted this lovely frame by my friend Jane, for my birthday back in June.I knew exactly what I wanted to put in it ... a photo of each of my grandsons.I had these photos of Alec & Sid enlarged to 5 x 7  & am so delighted with them in my frame.Well dear friends - it is time once again to fill the wood basket,Thanks So Much for your visits here today - I hope the week is treating you kindly,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "(Still)  Chasing My Tail !!", "date": "Sunday, July 28, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI did not mean to be gone from here for so long!It feels like I have been chasing my tail for the entire month of July!Since I last posted here I have completed a large sewing Order, had a trip down to my Mum's, put together some gifts, looked after Sid extra days & had a tummy bug!!Phew 😉 Life is certainly never dull here at Threadbear HQ!So blogging has definately taken a bit of a back seat.My friend D placed a large sewing Order with me earlier in the year & I finished the first part of it in this post *Here*In classic \"Julie fashion\" I left the hardest items til last.Finally I managed to complete the Order for D & she collected it just yesterdayThese patchwork foxes are from the Tilda book Sewing By HeartI have never made them before & think I may need a good long rest before I attempt them again 😉!!The first one I made was the large size in the photos above - he (or she) measures 77 cms tall - a fact I overlooked until I begun sewing him.The second size is called \"small\" but I would say it's more a medium at 62 cms tallThis one came together much easier as is often the way when sewing things for the very first time.I thought they made such a great pair with their cute faces - as if their little personalities were showing throughThe final part of the Order was from another Tilda book - this time  Homemade & HappyIt was D's idea to have the toy animals made up & then hang them up as a mobile - I thought this was such a wonderful idea.The pigs tail has florist wire in it to make it bendableI used fabrics from my linen stash to make the animals - the fabric for the pig was a linen wrap skirt hand painted with flowers - I thought it was perfect for the piggyThe Lamb was made in white handkerchief linen .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  & the deer was made in raw linen with antlers courtesy of my flowering cherry blossom tree which is currently bare of leaves, so ideal for finding the right antlers.The photo on the right shows the petite size of the animals I purchased a natural cane ring from Spotlight & hung the animals using some clear twine.In between working on this Order I wanted to make a homemade gift package for D.I used some flannelette fabric to make some bibs, backed with white towelling, I made the cat toy from a wool blanket scrap & inserted a rattle inside when stuffing it.Some cuddly rugs & wraps were made & I just could not resist this gorgeous fleece from Spotlight while I was there buying the ring for the mobile.  Just look at that little hedgehog family 💗Speaking of gift making - I decided to make hottie covers for two people that I love & care about a great dealThe first one was for my sister-in-law (& dear friend) Felicity who runs a busy little coffee cart in New Plymouth - she is there all year round rain hail or shine!I found this gorgeous tartan blanket & embellished it with some kiwiana fabric as I knew Felicity loved these colours.I thought it might keep her cosy & warm in between customers.My daughter-in-law had requested a hottie cover for Alec - he already had the hot water bottle but no cover.I know he is a robot loving little boy so I decided to applique a robot onto the cover (The Mr laughed loudly when he saw my attempt at a robot - I can't imagine why !!!)I also knew Alec loved anything tactile, especially satin - so I stitched a length of wide satin ribbon to the back so he can run his fingers along it when he is cuddling his hottie.If you have stayed with me right til the end friends, give yourselves a pat on the back!Thank You 😊 !I think by the look of this photo above I need to fill the wood basket & light the fire - it feels like a chilly night ahead.Thanks So Much for your visits here today friends,I hope the week ahead is filled with good things - take care of yourselves & each other,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I will think about lacquering these trays with a clear coat but as I don't plan on using them I am in no hurry.This past week has seen some lovely sunny winter days but Oh My - what cold starts with some really heavy frosts.I made Sid a hut on the couch last week & he played quite happily for sometime while I sat at the worktable & made up some kitsets for a class I was teaching on Friday - felt Christmas OrnamentsMiss Pippi made sure I cut them out accurately & no mistakes were made !! 😉I had some exciting mail arrive with another Order of beautiful wooden buttons from Theodora CleaveI follow Barb on Instagram & when she posts her specials I am often tempted - her work is adorable 💗Well dear friends - it feels like another ripper of a frost tonight so I am off to fill the wood basket,Wishing you all a wonderful weekend & thanks as always, for your visits here today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "Creating   \" Pearl \"", "date": "Friday, June 7, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersAbout 4 years ago now my friend Gail closed down her Gift Shop - I had worked part time in this store for 18 years  but left about 7 years ago to focus on my Craft Cottage.After Gail closed the doors The Mr & I went with our large enclosed trailer & took several loads of left over stock back to Gails house.This torso/mannequin was amongst the stock, in fact there were two of them - it had been for sale for $160 - $80 in her half price saleNo one had bought them so I asked Gail what she wanted for this one & she said $20 !  I promptly paid her for it & now Wish I had bought the other as well.Home it came & - in typical \"Julie fashion\" - sat in the corner of my bedroom gathering dust bunnies for 4 years !!I had a rather vague idea of what I wanted to do with it but nothing specific.One afternoon in late summer I dragged it out onto my deck area & began to paint it with some leftover acrylic wall paint that I found - Cottage CreamIt took several coats to cover the fabric body & the dark wood base but eventually I was happy with itInside it sat - in a corner of my lounge - for a further two months!!Last weekend was a long weekend here in New Zealand being Queen's Birthday Weekend.I dragged it down to a light sunny spot by my french doors & began to decorate it with cream crochet doilies, of which I have rather a few 😉I had this deep cream fringing which I glued to the lower part & then just carried on - making it up as I went along - mod podging on doileys & vintage laces.It was fun but I needed to walk away from it often,  then go back & view it through fresh eyesSlowly over the course of the weekend I built up the doiley coverageUntil I decided I was happy with it .  .  .  .  then I stood back & decided \"she\" needed a belt around her waist & a corsage at her neck I found this fabric flower for the corsage & embellished it with some milliners netting For the belt I used a wide cream cotton lace & then fashioned a calico \"flower\" which I embellished with pearls & a lace frill + more milliners netting.I decided to add a long string of Pearls around her neck ... this is when I decided to name her Pearl 💗Lastly I lightly sanded/distressed the woodwork & then glued a row of mother-of-pearl buttons around her neckThe back viewThe front view ... I gave her two good coats of mod podge when finished which has sealed all the fabric nicely & will make her \"wipeable\" should I need to clean her 😉I have taken her outside to my deck area to try to get a clearer photo on this dull grey winters day.I really, really LoVe Pearl 💕 & am so pleased I finally got to bring her to lifeI also managed to complete some more upcycles for my local St John's Op Shop over the long weekendA wooden coat hook with gold hooks - I didn't even unscrew the hooks, just chalk painted over them ... the colour is Arctic, a pretty pale duck egg colourThis wooden camphor box got the \"Arctic treatment\" also You can see in the left hand photo how the marker pen colours bled through my paintwork despite 3 coatsThe interior of the box was such a mess - someone had stored felt pens/vivid markers inside it at some stage.I painted the sides & planned to line the base & inside lid with some cotton fabric. Unfortunately the vivid markers bled through the paint - even 3 coats didn't hide it, so I glued some pretty scrapbooking papers onto the sides, which complimented my lining fabric.This plain wooden tray was my first attempt at using the stencil I purchased from Paint Me Vintage in this Post I rather love how this tray turned out & gave it a good wax afterwards to make it wipeableAnd two more gold mirrors - one completed here & one still in the process - the colour \"Old Linen\"I could not believe my luck last week when I won an Auction on Trademe for these gorgeous vintage embroidered tea towels.I just adored them & was even more thrilled when the parcel arrived in the post & they were even more special !I am unsure as yet what I will do with them but I am absolutely certain they will Not be used to wipe dirty dishes !!!Thanks so much for staying with me through this rather long post dear friends,I am battling both a head cold & a tummy bug at present so I am off to join this little furry friend & tuck up for this wintery afternoonTake care dear readers - be kind to yourselves & to each otherWith much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

Yes some purchases came away with me 😉The colours in the vintage sheet are actually much more vibrant but are not photographing well on this dull winters dayI loved the colours in the vintage sheet on the left & the sweet little jug & bowl just finished off a small shelf display of cream ware perfectlyI could not help photographing the soft toy dogs outside this mans store ... people were just stopping in their tracks & smiling at his display ... how wonderful that he set them up outside each day to bring joy to folksClick on the photos to enlarge them for a closer lookDonna & her family have owned this seaside property at Port Charles for a few years nowTwo years ago they completely demolished the small batch that was on the hillside property & built a wonderful new eco friendly home in its placeThis is the view from the deck looking out towards the bayDonna & I sat out on this deck lots & knitted & chatted & drank many cups of teaThe view from inside the lounge area - you would never tire of looking out hereThe banana palms grow everywhere & they cleverly built the deck around these two established onesLooking down from the deck - self seeded banana palmsOne of the highlights (to me) about this special area is that there was no phone or internet reception which just added to the serenity & peacefulness of it allYes that is Yours truly - surf casting off the wharfNo, I didn't catch anything besides a large clump of weed, but we enjoyed a mornings fishing together Views from the wharf - looking out to sea & back towards the inletWe walked places - lots - even way out across rock pools when the tide went outThis seaweed (that was everywhere) is called Neptune's beadsEach night I enjoyed a hot bath in the tub (& a glass of wine) on the deck outside under the trees listening to the night sounds & the moreporksI love how Donna has kept her furnishings really simple & easy on the eye ... the shelf unit on the left was constructed from old beehive frames - we lit the small fire each day & it heated our waterAll too soon it was time to pack up & head home ... what a wonderful magical place this is & I hope to return again one day ... Donna & I chatted non-stop all the way back to Thames & then I had to head home again  - back to cats & reality 😉Since my return home I have been busily working away on OrdersMy friend & long time customer \"D\" gave me an large Order which I decided to break up into 2 parts in case I found it too overwhelming.Part One was collected last week ... 10 lavender bags & 10 mothball sachetsA tilda rabbit - the enlarged size - dressed in overalls in a gender neutral colour scheme.  \"D\" loves mustard so I found this gorgeous mustard spot fabric in my stash.Two childs size covered coathangers with lavender bunches10 vintage covered coathangers with lavender sachetsNormally I use vintage pillowcases for these but as I ran out, I used some vintage supper cloths for the last few coathangers\"D\" was delighted with the first part of her Order ... in typical Julie fashion I have left the trickier items til last 😟Thank you all so much for your lovely kind comments on my last Post regarding the banana box fiascoAs you can see from the photo above, I have still not managed to acquire another banana box !!Thank You all So Very Much for your visits today & staying with me through this photo heavy post,Wishing you a wonderful week ahead - be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

Catch Up Post #3", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers &Happy Monday to you all !!April & May are my busiest months for family & close friends birthdays - I have 10 altogether over a 6 week period.Although I purchase some gifts, my budget certainly doesn't allow me to buy them all & besides - I really LoVe giving handmade 💛This year I had two close friends having special birthdays - the first was my friend Carolyn Now by the time you reach \"certain ages\" your Homes are full of things & the last thing you need is more \"stuff\"So I decided this year to give my friends useful gifts.I used Jenny's wonderful tutorial * Here * for the decorated teatowels, Fee's amazing tutorials * Here *  & also * Here * for the decorated rubber gloves - & the beeswax wraps The knitted scrubby cloths are a free pattern download from * here * ... I have knitted these before & the yarn is great value as you get at least 4 cloths from one ball!As I had recently made up a large batch of Miracle Spray I filled a spray bottle to tuck in with Carolyn's gift & also printed off a copy of the instructions My second friend having a special birthday in May was Donna who is turning 60.I made Donna up a red themed gift for her kitchen using this gorgeous kiwiana fabric - I knew Donna loves native birds so this was perfect for her.Once again I trimmed teatowels & matched the gloves .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  & knitted cotton/bamboo dishcloths, scrubby's & filled this sweet little pot with a handmade soy candle Lime, basil, mandarin scent.Both these gifts were posted to their recipients, who were delighted to receive the handmade goodies 💗My final special birthday for May was my grandson Alec - a robot obsessed little boy who was turning 4 !!I had bought a metre of this lovely robot fabric a wee while ago on sale at SpotlightAs Alec is now in a bed, I made him a pillowcase using this great Tutorial from Tiny HappyAs the fabric was especially wide, I had quite a chunk leftover so I decided to make him a book pillowThough I had not much of a clue what I was doing .... I made a simple pocket on the front  When I came across this robot motif I decided to embroider Alec's Bed on it & applique it to my pocketThe finished book pillow top left - a trip to my local Paper Plus did not unearth any robot books but I decided Dragon's would suffice instead 😉As Alec is currently having swimming lessons I purchased this cute wet bag from a lovely home based business for him - the robots on it were just perfect!My daughter in law requested my usual sweet platter which is popular with the grown ups as well as the littlies  -  & I also made a plate of salmon rolls for the partyWe had the most wonderful time & even the sun came out so the children were able to get outdoors.Alec had a chocolate cake decorated with an edible picture - Transformers of course 😊💙 !Phew - now that I have finished with the run of birthdays for a wee spell, perhaps I can get back to my Orders again.Last week I gathered a large box full of walnuts from the front yard ... after a day or two I noticed Blackie sleeping in the box, on top of the walnuts.       Can't be very comfy I thought ??So - kindly - I tipped all the walnuts out & placed a nice wool blanket in the box & gently lifted him back in.He immediately hopped right back out, gave me a filthy look,  a flick of his tail -  & huffed off  !!Two hours later & who do I notice sound asleep in the banana box ??Miss Pippy  😸💛Roll forward to the next day & His Lordship decided perhaps he could \"suffer the banana box after all\" !!??So no words are needed to show you what happened next . . . . . .I think you call this  A Mexican Standoff ??!!!         .  .  .  .  .  .  suffice to say, I am currently on the look out for a second banana box !!! 😣Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends,Thanks so much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},

I want to wish all the Mother's out there, be it two or four legged ones, A Very Wonderful Day  💗(If you manage to stay with me til the end of this post you will see the \"very kind & generous gift\" that Miss Pippi presented me with this morning)Quite sometime ago I entered a wee Giveaway over on Raewyn's blogThere were two draws, one for a book & one for some thread -  & I was lucky enough to win the book.I had quite forgotten about it as Raewyn informed me it had to come all the way from the States - so it was such a wonderful surprise to receive it in the post last week.Thanks so much Raewyn for the opportunity to enter your generous Giveaway.In my last Post I wrote about the Winter Wreath Workshop my friend Sally was holding at this amazing Venue *here*.Last weekend I was fortunate enough to be able to go with my friends Sally & Jane to visit the Venue, while Sally did some prep for her upcoming WorkshopWe were lucky enough to be given a tour of the house & the gardens & I rather promptly fell in love with all of it.Although I think I took about 50 photos, I have just shared a very few with you hereThe formal dining room where Sally was to host her workshop                                            The photo to the right is the scullerySome of the outdoor areasThe statue is called Guardian of the Garden.  The far right photo is some old pet gravestones in the garden.We also had a bit of a Girl's Day Out shopping but I will share my purchases with you in another Post.Last week I stood in my kitchen & made lemon dusters.This is a recipe from my book The Natural Home by Wendyl NissenI had some old cloth nappies which I had purchased from the Op Shop - these make perfect dusters.Lemon Dusters are simply equal quantities of water & white vinegar + lemon essential Oil,Soak the dusters in this mixture then squeeze out, roll up into lengths, then roll into a ball - they look a bit like cinnamon scrolls!I like to put pieces of lemon peel in with them - the fragrance when you take them out of the Jar is just wonderful!Now that we have started having winter fires, the dust is incredible & these are ideal for giving the mantel a quick wipe over.Silver Trays that had rust or imperfections in them that wouldn't polish outI have been painting/upcycling some more projects for the St John's Op Shop - these were done using the grey chalkpaint - Quarter AbsoluteI really enjoyed doing this corner shelf above but .  .  .  .  Chalkpaint Voodoo Molly Vintage - Colour Sandstone.  .  .  .   I did Not enjoy doing the rattan tray above - it took so many coats to get a decent coverage.Yesterday was my youngest son's birthday - I got up early & made him a chocolate cake as I was going for morning tea.I stopped on my way there & bought a box of smarties to decorate it. I cannot believe my son is 34!   Where did those years go to I wonder??!! I posted on Instagram last week, how when The Mr comes in from the farm each night, he stands in front of the fire & takes his smelly/dirty socks off & tosses them on the mat.Miss Pippi makes a beeline for them & then spends the rest of the evening rolling around in them & sleeping.There's just no accounting for taste in some folk 😉And speaking of Her Royal Highness ... here is the Mother's Day gift she so kindly left me this morning under my gardening shoe!Still alive & moving I might add! 😖Thanks So Much for staying with me through this lengthy post dear friends,I hope the coming week is good & kind to you all,I shall be back soon with my second Catch Up Post,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I am looking forward to revamping it slightlyI was delighted to arrive home to some surprise mail packagesThis plate above had been gifted to me by my late Aunt about 4 years ago.  She always called me \"a crafty tarty\"  so I was thrilled to come across Miss Vintage NZ who paints plates for sale & also does commission work.I had sent it to Ange a couple of months ago & it arrived back while I was away .... it is now hanging in pride of place in my sewing room & makes me think of Marg every time I look at it 💗These beautiful hydrangeas were picked about a month ago & plonked in a bucket of water to have a good drinkUpon my return from Mums they felt dry & papery so I arranged them in my vintage cane trolley. Sid's parents sent me this delightful photo below of Sid modelling the wool vest I made him in my last postWhat a little treasure he is.Well dear readers, I have just this morning put the last stitch in these two Tilda rabbits & am off up to my local Post Shop to send them on their merry way.I enlarged the pattern slightly more again from the last ones I made & this pair measure 37 cms in length.Thanks so much for visiting here today dear friends,I hope the coming week is good & kind to you all,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I wanted to make Sid another Vest, the same as the one I made him last WinterThis pattern is called The Pathfinder Vest & is a design by Twig & TaleThe only thing I needed to purchase was the lining fabric ... in keeping with the rabbit theme I decided to applique a small rabbit on the outside of the vest (& give him a fluffy tail of course!!)Everything else I used was already in my stash including the soft grey wool Army blanketI bought Sid some other items of clothing to match & then I appliqued another small rabbit on one pair of track pants, using a scrap of wool felt.I also added to his collection of Dinky toys & bought him a book about trucks.We had a lovely party/morning tea/luncheon at Sid's home just today to celebrate his turning the big Two !! 💙My how those two years have simply flown by !Eldest grandson Alec, is to be a Pageboy at his Aunt's wedding in two weeks time so his Mum Sarah requested a horse shoe for Alec to give to the BrideI cover aluminium horseshoes that are given to me by a dear 92 year old gentleman who still \"works\" at the local racing stablesIt was fun to create another horseshoe after not having done one for over 3 years now.My lovely friend Shirley recently gave me her beeswax pellets  - Shirley had intended making wax wraps when she purchased the pellets, but had a change of heart & was not feeling inspiredFor my first attempt I made some up for Shirley ... I used too many pellets initially, but soon learned to cut back the amount to make them more pliableAnd then yesterday afternoon I made another batch up, some round ones included.  These are to be gifts for my daughter in laws.One thing I learnt rather promptly .... when making these up it pays to shut all the doors & windows as those bees will come for miles & they will surely bring all their relations along too!! 😧I also completed another two of the Tilda rabbits that I featured in my last post as part of an Order.They have both gone to their new homes & I forgot to photograph them.It occurred to me while I was busy creating this week ... I really enjoy experiencing a wide variety of craft ... it brings me so much pleasure to work in several different mediumsFinally dear friends, Her Royal Highness  Miss Pippi still has not gone back to her basket but instead has taken up residence (again) in Sid's cot.  This face greeted me last Tuesday when I went to put Sid down for a nap!!!What do you think she might be saying ?? 😉Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead dear friends,I am off on my annual jaunt down to Mum's ... this time we are celebrating her 90th Birthday !!Thanks to you all So Much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Rabbiting .................................................", "date": "Thursday, March 21, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersIt's strange how I can remember exactly  where I was & what I was doing when news of some very tragic events occurred in my life.I distinctly remember pushing my trolley around the Supermarket when I heard the devastating news of Princess Diana's death like it was just yesterday.Likewise I recall vacuuming my lounge early one morning when The Mr switched on the TV & I absentmindedly thought what a ghastly movie was on .... when in fact it was the Twin Towers terrorist attacks being broadcast live! So it is that it will be forever imprinted in my brain how I was happily ensconced in my sewing room (sewing fabric rabbits) when The Mr rang to tell me the devastating news of the terrorist attacks in Christchurch last Friday.I turned on the news reports & sat for the rest of the day in tears scarcely able to believe what I was seeing unfold in this beautiful Country of ours.(Image from Instagram)Two days later when The Mr asked me what I had planned for the day, I told him it seemed \"inappropriate & frivolous\" to spend time sewing rabbits when there was so much devastation going on in Christchurch.He wisely pointed out me that when we no longer continue with our normal lives as such, including the small things that bring us pleasure, then surely we are allowing the people who perpetrate these hateful crimes to win out?He was right.      I went back to my sewing room.The Tilda Rabbits that I had been enjoying working on are a free pattern from HereThey are made entirely using up what I had in my stash & the wee pink girl below left is dressed in a Liberty print remnantHere is a wee pic of Blackie lying down dreaming of catching rabbits helping me choose fabrics for my rabbits !!I made two of the original size & then enlarged the pattern a bit & made two bigger size rabbits.Original Size measuring 27 cms from toe to tip of earLarger Size measuring 35 cms from toe to tip of earI am not quite sure of my sudden fascination for rabbits but I did love them & thought they looked simple enoughOn Monday morning I thought I had completed them until I remembered these beautiful Tilda buttons, gifted to me by my lovely friend Shirley ... so each bunny got a matching Tilda button tied on 💗Although the pattern says to paint the eyes on, I just used black DMC & a french knot.On Sunday morning I pulled out my container of vintage sheets & enlisted Miss Pippi's help in choosing a sheet to make a mattress for the basket gifted to her in my last postIt did not take long to run up a soft round mattress for her basket - I made it nice & padded so she was not sitting on the hard base & since then  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  she has not gone anywhere near her new basket, the fickle creature that she is !!!!! 😉BEFORE                                                                                       AFTERThis tall wooden pedestal Plant holder was another revamp for the St John's Op Shop, along with the 3 items in my last postThis one was painted in a pale Grey Chalk Paint called Quarter Absolute - I love this colour & it came up wonderfully after a rub with soft wax.When I returned these items to the store I could not resist buying this unusual silver sugar salver It was certainly Not this colour when I purchased it but some elbow grease & some Silvo cleaner & it came up beautifully to add to my non collection of silverware 😉  - I have filled it with some rose petal potpourriTo finish this post on a lighter note dear friends, I have been trying to walk each day now for 4 weeks to benefit both my physical And my mental health.I must be honest & say that I do Not really enjoy exercise but I endeavour to make myself do it in some form or other.And so I could laugh & fully relate when this came through in my inbox from my dear friend Willie Just the laugh I needed thanks so much Willie!For those creative folk out there, here is the link to some information & a free pattern to make up heart blocks for those affected by the Christchurch devastation.I plan to make some up next week.Thanks So Much to you All for your visits today,Be kind to yourselves & to each other dear friends,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I did not even dare go in my bedroom!!And so it was, that same night, while browsing Pinterest I came across the sweetest little pincushion that just happened to be made using vintage silverwareThis is the lady - Laurie May - that I must credit with creating the pincushion ...... her flicker pages are just beautiful 💗 I remembered that I had a few pieces of vintage silverware left over in my Cottage from when I closed it a year ago.This little silver sugar bowl above - almost identical to Laurie Mays bowl - was among my leftover bits.For my \"pattern\" I drew a bread & butter plate circle - one in calico, one in a cream crochet doileyHere is the sugar bowl all polished up, & with the pincushion part inserted - now to create the wee birdI used a scrap of cream wool blanketing from my stash & fashioned a wee birdie with wings & a tailThen I affixed my bird to the pincushion before adding some bling - I keep a small bag of old costume jewellery in my craft stash - this is an old broochSome mother-of-pearl buttons just finished it off.I am delighted with my birdie pincushion & shall be finding a nice spot to display it among my non-collection of silverware 😉Last Saturday I had some luck at the Op Shops in my local townI haven't visited for several months & was delighted to come away with this stash of treasuresThere are 7 Op Shops in my small town & these treasures were bought from just two of them - Hospice & St John's This beautiful glass pedestal stand above ($10 from St Johns) was just perfect for the new/old pomanders I wrote about in my last postI wanted to display all my pomanders together so this oak petticoat table from my Cottage, was just the ideal sizeI had some lovely post this week also - this book had been on Order for several weeks & finally arrived in my mail box.I have been enjoying following along with Jenny of elefantz in her Gentle Domesticity book studies & now I will have my own copy to leaf throughEvery morning when I get out of bed, I complain endlessly to The Mr about the cats sleeping on (my side!!) of the bed all night!I tell him I am going to get my own bed in my own room with the door shut tight 😉This morning, this little funny appeared in my inbox from The Mr alongside a message he wrote telling me \"we will follow you Mum, no matter where you go !!\"Thanks so very much for your visits today dear friends,I hope the week is treating you kindlyBe good & kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A few bits & bobs ..................................", "date": "Wednesday, February 27, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersWishing you all a Very Happy Wednesday !!It has been a bits & bobs kinda week with time spent in the kitchen, the sewing room & the garden.I called to see my friend Elaine to drop her some bottles of Worm Tea - we had not seen each other for quite some timeAs I was leaving Elaine presented me with these two decanters telling me she no longer wanted them - lucky me! They are what I would call a small/medium size decanter, the tallest one being only 19 cms high.I knew I didn't need any more for my Laundry Liquid so I decided to make up some bath salts to fill the more square shaped decanterI used this recipe *here* - nice & simple & everything was already in my cupboards (not the Wendyl's brand but just basic baking soda)For the fragrance I used a mix of lavender & rose geranium essential oils, & added a handful of dried lavenderThe recipe made up enough to fill the square decanter Plus I managed to fill a glass jar for my present box.I filled the tall narrow decanter with some liquid body wash that I had already in my bathroom cupboard, then tied them with some sparkly twine & bling They look great sitting on the end of my bath tub.While I was in the kitchen I made up a double batch of Miracle SprayI used the recipe from *here*My friend Marie had asked me for the recipe so I printed it off & also filled a small bottle for her to try I finally finally finished a stitchery I began about two years ago. I kept picking it up on & off but it still seemed to take forever to complete.This is an old Sampler Pattern by Wendy Brigg of Country Friends designs The stitchery above was the first one I completed & had framed -  I really wanted the same frame, & was concerned they may discontinue this style as I was taking so long!They are now hanging on my lounge wall & even though there are several Samplers in this series, I have decided there will only be two done by Julie 😉My South Island friend Therle very kindly sent me this sweet Golly Cross Stitch two winters ago & I finally got around to getting it framed as well - just gorgeous!Last week while The Mr rode twilight Moto X, I was tidying & faffing in my lounge.I decided I would like to add one or two more pomanders to my collection (I have 7).  A quick look on our buy/sell site Trademe & low & behold - someone was selling a collection of 8 china pomanders for just $15.00 !!Now I could not possibly leave them there could I ??!!They arrived just yesterday & I had a lovely time gently washing them all & replacing most of the ribbons - underneath the dust & grime, they came up beautifully 💗Some time was spent in the Sewing Room finishing off these sweet little fabric Sewing Machines, a pattern from the Tilda Book \"Homemade & Happy\"The one above was intended for a gift but I am rather liking it sitting on my sewing room bookcase & feel it just might have to stay there!!My daughter in law sent me this delightful photo of my beautiful wee grandsons - cousins, not brothers. Both families had a weekend away & the wee boys had a wonderful time together.Finally folks, my friend sent me this little verse on Instagram & I loved it ... so very true indeed!Wishing you all a wonderful rest-of-the-week dear friends,Take care of yourselves & each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Week's Worth of Projects", "date": "Monday, February 18, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersIt has been a productive week here at Threadbear HQ with lots of little finishes.The needlework cushion cover below, was 50 cents at the St Johns Op Shop last year ... the edges were badly frayed & it needed a clean, a re-sew, a new inner & some TLC 💗It finally got all this last Monday morning & turned out rather well I thought!On Tuesday while Sid slept, I pulled this wrought iron set out from under my trees.  I shove it under there when I go to mow & often a week can go by before it gets pulled out again.The birds has used it for a perch & the family of spiders that had taken up residence in it, had kindly invited all their cousins along!I scrubbed it & hosed it & when it was dry, I gave it two coats of Resene Hot Chilli.  It has been this colour for several years now, originally it was white.I found 2 testpots of the Hot Chilli colour left over in my cupboard so it worked out perfectly & cost me nothing more than lots of elbow grease.How wonderful it looks all spruced up & sprayed with Ripcord to deter the spiders ... even my old kettle got a touch up with the remnants of red. Speaking of  \"Sid Tuesday's\"  ... I found it pays Not to leave him unattended with a marmite sandwich for anytime or he is rather inclined to paint himself with it !!! 😉On Wednesday I sat outside on my newly refurbished table & chairs & spent a pleasant couple of hours rubbing lavender stalks into my large enamel bowl 💜On Thursday - Valentines Day - I picked myself a bunch of roses & put in a lovely crystal vase .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  & then, because it was the day of Love Pippi left me a wee gift on my slippers that were lying at the door - so kind & generous of her 💕😻 !!On Friday morning Sue came for a visit & bought me a large bunch of dried flowers out of her garden, along with the book all about crystals.We \"traded\" as I sent her home with a rather large armful of lavender sprigs & some worm tea!On Saturday I worked on completing these 3 mini quilt hangers.My dear friend Leeanne had tossed these orphan quilt blocks at me when I stayed with her last JulyI knew I wanted to do something with them & it was coming across these mini wire hangers that inspired me to make 3 little quilts for my sewing room wallYesterday - Sunday - I was able to complete this little Cath Kidston pouch.  When I purchased the book Stitch! several years ago, this kit came free with the book.My dear friend Sally kindly did the cross stitch work for me & I just had to sew the pouch up.I thought the wee cat charm was just perfect as a zipper pull.Then today,  Monday - with all our citrus fruit falling due to the drought, I made a Citrus Slice in readiness for Sid's visit again tomorrow.  He loves his Granny's baking.Phew - that was a busy-ish week !!That's the beauty of blogging ... often when you feel you have achieved very little, you look back at your photos & find you have in fact, accomplished lots !!Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead dear friends,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Things that make us happy ...............................................", "date": "Monday, February 11, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersLast week while recovering from some rather major dental surgery along with a pinching nerve in my lower back, I decided to take it a little easier & do some things that I enjoy rather than the never-ending list of jobs that constantly goes around in my headI finished off the Miss Maggie Rabbit that Blackie was so kindly \"pressing for me\" in my last postShe is a delightful pattern from Alicia Paulson  which I purchased many years quite sometime ago now. I always had it in my head to make her up in Liberty fabrics & was thrilled to be able to purchase these from AliceCaroline fabricsI knitted her little capelet in some knitting cotton that I already had in my stash, but I am thinking now it might look better made up in double knit yarn??Her boots are all hand stitched in felt ... I enjoyed making her so very much! 😊No sooner had I finished Miss Maggie than a beautiful package arrived in my mail!I used the last of my Christmas money from Mum to purchase some gorgeous Greengate goodies from Lillians Cottage, who are currently having a summer sale with good discounts!The next day I sat out on the deck & enjoyed a coffee in my new cup along with a magazine on loan from my dear friend Sal.I had a bit of an idea floating around in my head for an upcycle project(The Pink Paint is Resene's Pale Rose - a testpot)The ugly brown veneer tray above was a Hospice purchase ... Sid had been using it to drive his matchbox cars around on & park them underneath but had now moved onto various other \"car parks\"I painted it pale pink then lightly distressed the edges.I had wanted to paint the wooden shelf on the left for quite sometime now  -  I wanted to lighten up some areas of our lounge as we seem to have quite a bit of dark wood, which I find gloomy at times. I gave the shelf 3 coats of Newtons Chalk Paint ... Aged White ... in some lights this colour has an ever-so-slightly grey tinge to it, which I love 💗This pretty pink china above, had been stored away in a cupboard, hidden from sight & gathering dust bunnies.It had been gifted to me by a dear elderly friend before she went into Resthome care - I loved everything about it, the colour, the pattern, the vintagey-ness of it - but I never had anywhere to display it, until now !I made a sort of tiered arrangement using the shelf, tray + teatowel & napkin from GreengateI came across this vintage china bowl out in my Cottage - it had previously been used to display soaps for saleI made up a fresh batch of Cottage Garden potpourri with all the roses I have been drying, & displayed it in the bowlReally rather ticked pink with my new lightened up corner 💗Last Tuesday, while Sid slept, I made two veggie quiches using courgettes, tomatoes, spinach & basil from our vegetable garden -   one was for us & the other was for Sid's family.Next I made an Oaty Ginger Slice before realising I could not eat it due to my dental work, so this was given to Alec's family.Just yesterday I carefully washed, dried & pressed the Linen Cover on my Sanderson Slipper Chair. Please tell me friends ... How do they jolly well know when you have done this & Why do they jolly well think you have done it just for them ???!!! 😟Wishing you all a wonderful week wherever in the World you might be,Take care of yourselves & each other,Thanks so much for your visits here today dear friends,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "3 Little UpCycles  . . . . . .  & An Egg Poacher !!", "date": "Sunday, February 3, 2019", "text": "Sunday Greetings dear friends & readers!Thank You All So Much for your lovely positive comments on my Sewing Room Revamp last week.And a Very Large Welcome to my new followers!Feeling so inspired about my freshened-up Sewing Room I actually sent my Sewing Machine & Overlocker away for a long-overdue service.But I have not been idle friends ...... it was a good opportunity to undertake a couple of small upcycle projectsThis sweet cane basket was tucked away in my sleepout - it had been gifted to me by my dear friend Claire a couple of years ago but I had done nothing with it.I gave it a good scrub & a dry in the hot summer sun - it came up beautifully 💗There were 6 coasters altogether so I stitched 1 of each colour on each sideI had purchased these crochet coasters a few years ago at a Craft Fair but never used them ...... I considered them far too lovely for The Mr to plonk his cup of tea on !! 😉I carefully stitched them to each side of my basket.Then I padded the base & lined it with a pretty Tilda Fabric, before adding a tin tag & some voile ribbonAs I have begun knitting dishcloths again this month, it is just perfect for storing my patterns, needles & dishcloth cotton, & can be carted around with me.Last year I purchased this large oval frame from the Hospice shop, shoved it under our bed & promptly forgot about it!The frame had a mirror inside which was broken so I removed this along with the backing board.You can see from the right hand pic, there was a small chunk of the decorative wood missing so I carefully filled this with some polyfilla & did my best to try to sculpt it somewhat!(The colour is showing up much lighter in this photo than it actually was)This is the frame with 2 coats of chalkpaint on ... you can hardly see where the gap was ... my arrow is pointing to it.I am delighted with my new green colour ... it was a new testpot from Newtons Paints called Country Green ... I LoVe it 💚I stapled a length of string across the back & hung some old family photos from it It still seemed a bit bare so I dug out these letters I had purchased from the Variety Store when I got the letters for Sid's Suitcase... buy one, get one free so the 2 letters cost me $1.00 !They were a yucky dull brown so I painted them both & then scuffed them with my sandpaperI am delighted with my new/old upcycled frame(by the way - for those that are wondering about the \"G\" - the Mr's name is Graham)Each day I have been trying to spend some time outdoors & tame the wilderness that is my garden.In a particularly messy area, I uncovered these two items, long blown off the deck into the undergrowth.I scrubbed the terracotta dish to get it clean & carefully washed the cloche, removing the colony of spiders that had taken up residence in its wires.I used a pale grey Chalky Chic paint for the dish (2 coats)I found these two vintage enamel mugs in my cupboard so made up a soy candle in one, then popped a baby houseplant in the otherNo the nests did NOT come with the eggs in, they are fake, as is the fake bird pinned to the side!These two birdnests were found in the garden also so it seemed perfect that I make up a little vignette with them all. I had originally planned to paint the wire cloche but it looked pretty enough with some fairy lights wound around it.Last week, on Trademe - I sat up late & won an auction for a vintage aluminium egg poacher for the total sum of $6.00!The Mr assured me there would be \"no other fool sitting up that late bidding on a crusty old thing like that\" ... but I wasn't taking any chances !!I had been feeding chooks for my neighbours again & getting lovely freshly laid eggs daily.Oh the Joy to poach myself an egg with golden yellow yokes & enjoy it with my homegrown cherry tomatoes & basil ... my favourite dish.Last night I found this old wire frame under my house & used it to hold up the lillies that were threatening to topple over in my gardenEach night when I water the garden the scent from them is intoxicating . . . tho' I know not everyone likes the scent, I adore it!Well dear friends, thanks so much for your visits today,I am off to the cool of the dining room fan to work on a felt rabbit I have been handstitching.While I have been at the computer Blackie has been flattening it giving it's legs a little press for me!! 😊I hope the coming week is good & kind to you all,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Sewing Room \"tizzy Up\" !", "date": "Monday, January 28, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersWhen I became inundated with Orders last December my sewing room turned into a tip!Things got pulled out & not put back, & somewhere under all the mess I am sure there was once carpet!When I was busily tidying for Mum's arrival, all sorts got tossed in there & the door pulled shut quickly!I commented to Mum while she was here \"I must tidy my sewing room\" ... her reply was \"I think it's going to need a bit more than just a tidy!\" 😉Finally last week I felt ready to tackle it.I decided this year my policy would be to use up what I already have on hand!The first item I tackled was the wooden Bear shaped shelf  that I upcycled in this old PostThis shelf houses most of my fabrics & two of the shelves had come loose & fallen down ... fabric had been tossed on there every which way, much of it had fallen down!The Mr re-screwed the shelves for me while I ironed & folded all my scrunched up fabrics & sorted them into coloursI had enough of the fabric left over from the tablerunner that I made in this post here to make a new ironing board cover  . . . this fabric was gifted to me by my dear friend Leeanne & I adore it.  It is a slightly heavier weight cotton duck fabric, & my sewing room blind is also made from this.Late last year I covered the ugly black topped trestle table in my sewing room with a length of spotty oilcloth which I purchased from My Style NZHowever this mess still stared out at me so I decided to screw some curtain tracking under the lip of the table & make some curtains that could easily be slid back & forth when I needed suppliesLooking down onto the spotty oilcloth topOnce again, using up what I had, I gathered together 3 vintage supper cloths with pretty embroideries on themI joined these two togetherThird one below ...I had purchased some curtain tape last year from the Op Shop for the princely sum of $1 !I joined the 2 narrower supper cloths together to make one side, then had an opening in the middle & used the wider supper cloth for the other end.I am thrilled with my \"granny chic\" curtains & they slide back & forth very easily making access simpleI sorted & tidied & was able to condense 20 of these A4 boxes down to just 12, then I made up some new clearer labels for them.My friend Jane had gifted me this gorgeous Poppy Treffry teatowel for Christmas ... I assured Jane it would definately NOT be used as a teatowel, so I made it up into a wallhanging to hang on the large wardrobe doors in my sewing roomThe wire hanger was another $1 Op Shop purchase 💙I hung the two vintage Holly Hobbie Needlework Pictures above my sewing machine so I could look at, & enjoy them!Pale Blue shelf is an old upcycled wooden Fruit BoxMore tidying & sorting & decluttering took place!The small book case is an old upcycled wooden Nail BoxLastly - but not least - I invested in a small desktop fan to cool the room down while I work in there!I think Mum would (might) be impressed with the room now! 😉Also this week I .  .  .  .I made another two lavender/lace covered coathangers for my dear friend ShirleyI picked plums, courgettes, tomatoes & apple cucumbers from my veggie gardenAnd I picked a vase full of pretty pink dahlia's from my flower gardenIn my post this week I am linking up with Jenny of elefantz designs in her gentle domesticity book studyI hope you have a wonderful bright shiny new week dear friends,I shall be back in a few days to share some small upcycling projects with you,Thanks so much for popping by today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

{"title": "Last Minute Christmas (Catch Up Post #3)", "date": "Wednesday, January 16, 2019", "text": "Mid week Greetings dear friends & readersAs is usual for me, I worked right up to the very last minute before Christmas finishing Orders & making some GiftsI spent a pleasant afternoon in my kitchen making soy candles in vintage containers,  gathered over a period of time from Op ShopsMy kitchen smelt delicious !!!These crystal ones below were gifts for two special family membersThe fragrance \"calico\" is one of my favourites 💗Early in December one year ago, my Mums eldest sister passed away - Aunty Margaret was one of my favourite Aunts & her daughter Jackie & I are very close.After her death Jackie gave me a large pile of vintage doilies & linens that had belonged to her Mum.There they sat, for almost a year, in a heap in a corner of my sewing room.I pulled them out on Aunty Marg's anniversary & decided to make up a table runner for Jackie to have in memory of her Mum - Miss Pippi was kind enough to help me in my selection & placement of the doilies 😉The table runner came together quite well ......... stitching them all on & overlapping them is a time consuming process, but I was pleased with the end result.The runner ended up a good size too,  finishing at just under 1 metre 40 in length.Jackie & I met up for morning tea at Tirau in mid December & I was able to give her the runner as a surprise gift.She was delighted & messaged me on her arrival home to tell me she had found just the perfect spot to display it.Mum arrived on 20th December to spend Christmas with us & because my eldest son & family were going south we had a small pre-christmas get-together on the 23rd DecemberIt is very much the little ones that bring joy to these occasions with their utter delight in it all.My grandsons Alec & Sid are growing up so fast & will be turning 4 & 2 this year respectively.I was thrilled to capture a nice photo of Mum with her great grandsons ... I have, just today, put this picture in a lovely frame I have.Almost at \"the midnight hour\" I decided to upcycle a small vintage suitcase I had for SidMum & I had bought him a selection of matchbox toys for Christmas (some countries call them dinky toys) & I wanted him to have something to cart them all around in.I painted this with 2 coats of Resene Black & then glued the letters to the top ... I had purchased the letters months ago (50c each at the Variety Store)The Mr commented he was surprised I could actually part with a vintage suitcase!!  I did confess to feeling a little bit faint 😜Sid opening some of his matchbox toys! (Christmas Day)The suitcase went down a treat & he soon filled it with his toys & insisted on carting it everywhere!I love this photo of Sid with his parents taken on Christmas Day.Well dear friends, I hope the week is treating you kindlyWe have been lucky enough to have some rain & cooler temperatures the last two days & I am so thankful.May the rest of your week be happy too!I have one more Catch Up Post to do & then I shall leave you all in peace (for while!!)With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Craft Group Christmas Break Up (Catch Up Post #2)", "date": "Saturday, January 12, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Weekend to you all.In the second week of December our little craft group got together for our end-of-year break up.We all met up out at Liz's beautiful home, about 20 minutes out in the country -  we all bought along a plate for a shared lunch(Sometimes I substitute the grapes for strawberries, sometimes just dried apricots will do) This is my standard \"go to dish\" when I am asked to bring a plate.You can find the recipe for my Gingernut Bites here & for my chocolate fudge slice hereIt's simple to put together as you can make the uncooked recipes a day or two beforehand & keep in fridge.Our challenge for last month was to make a dream catcher.Though I was not especially inspired by this challenge, I must admit I really enjoyed making my dream catcher (above & below) & just used up craft items already in my stash.I remembered to click some pics of the ladies workLiz's Dream catcherJoyce's Dreamcatcher ...... Joyce even crocheted her own doiley for the centre!Gails DreamcatcherI really loved Sharlaine's one above ... she had handcrafted the feathers herself using cord!After morning tea the ladies made felt mice ... I taught this as I had some kitsets left over from when I taught the class in this PostThen we stopped for lunch ... if nothing else, we sure do know how to get the food right!!  Our lunch was delicious!!We had all been asked to bring a Christmas themed craft or decoration along, wrapped up ... then we each chose one out of the basket lucky dip style 😉I was delighted upon opening mine to receive this repurposed wooden platter upcycled by Sharlaine.Though my photo is not showing it, the whole picture has been lacquered with a fine glitter & just sparkles away ... so beautiful!I wrapped up one of my primitive pocket ornies which I had liberally scented with Clove Oil.Joyce received my mystery parcel & was thrilled ... she rang me days later to tell me her whole house smelt just gorgeous!!I think this dainty sparkly ornament was made by Gail ... squares of fabric folded & pinned into a polystyrene ball ... so very effective!After lunch Gail was keen to try a craft she had seen on You tube ... Gail had watched the video clip above & decided to try this method on some soft toys purchased from the Op Shop ... she had bought out a bucket of the cement mix required & we all had to have a go at dunking a soft toyThough the whole process seemed a bit \"drastic\" it was a messy but fun creative time with lots of laughs.  A couple of the end results ... these take several days to dry & can then be used outdoors as garden ornaments.The day after our craft break up my neighbour Jenny came for the morning.She was keen to learn how to make potpourri & I had been promising her a lesson since last winter!  Jenny had been gathering & drying lots of bits from her garden & her walks, & had a lovely selection to work with.I had picked oranges from her fruit trees & dehydrated them for her.Together we made the 3 bowls full above ... Jenny was so delighted at her first attempt & planned to keep some & gift some for Christmas.The next day she returned my enamel bowls to me with the goodies pictured above inside them as a Thank You 💗Finally dear friends, before I close this photo-heavy post, these two vintage Holly Hobbie needlework pictures were a gift from my dear friend Sally ...

Catch Up Post #1 (Pre Christmas Orders)", "date": "Wednesday, January 9, 2019", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers Happy bright shiny New Year to you all!!It is taking me awhile to get back to blogging again & I did consider perhaps closing the door on my blog.However I do enjoy blogging & connecting with other like-minded bloggers a great deal .  .  .  . so have decided to continue for now.As I feel I am so far behind I have scheduled a series of four Catch Up Posts over the coming week or so.Today I would love to share with you the Orders I finished in the lead-up to Christmas when I was absent from here, but sewing my little cotton-pickin' tail off  😉Desiree ordered a cream Angel from me, the same as the one I made in this postThe pattern is Charlotte Angel by Rosalie Quinlan Designs.I had a beautiful vintage looking Christmas decoration from the Christmas Heirloom Shop which I stitched to her handsHer apron is made from a vintage lace table runner.She is a large size Angel measuring 85 cms long.Desiree also requested some Christmas Buntings from me . . . 6 lengths at 4 metres each . . . unfortunately I had some unwanted help of the 4-legged variety while selecting & tracing out my flagsMiss Pippi made sure I selected nicely contrasting fabrics & didn't choose any that might have clashed 😉This is what my dining room looked like (above) when I had them all laid out, ready to attach the bias bindingI loved all the different fabrics I used but these two in the top right hand photo are my favourites .  .  . olde world Santa'sAfter I sold the two Tilda Reindeer that I made in this post I received Orders for 4 more -  so ended up making 6 altogether this ChristmasThey look very plain until you attach their antlers & they really come to life.I was lucky our old Plum tree has lots of mossy gnarly branches ...... the Mr helped me choose just the right shapes for my reindeerNext Christmas I hope to make a pair of reindeer for myself ...... to decorate my own walls.I made 10 lavender/lace covered coathangers for my elderly friend Margaret who lives in a resthome . . . then I made another 2 for my dear friend Shirley, to gift to her daughter in law.Early in December, a friend I have not seen in 10 years called for lunch on her way travelling North.She claimed she had no idea of my tastes but gifted me this gorgeous tin vase, which I soon filled with seafoam roses from my garden.I just LoVe it 💗Well dear friends, thanks so much for stopping by today,I shall be back in a day or two with Catch Up Post # 2,Wishing you all a wonderful Wednesday,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

{"title": "Flowers, Orders & Treats!", "date": "Sunday, November 25, 2018", "text": "Good Sunday Greetings dear friends & readers I have been picking my rose petals every few days to dry for potpourri, & was so pleased I picked myself a vase of beautifully perfumed roses last week as my garden has been buffeted by rain  & strong winds all weekendThe white roses are Iceberg  -  I do not know the name of the pink one but it has such a gorgeous old fashioned perfumeThis wrought iron chair has sat in my sleepout for a few years now.I pulled it out a couple of months ago & removed the wooden \"seat\" part & then it sat untouched until just last week.A good scrub then a paint with my Resene Amulet bought it up good as new.I purchased a new coconut fibre basket liner as I had the old wire basket from another project ... I potted up some succulents from the garden & am hopeful as they grow they will spread & cascade nicely down the sidesWhile I was out on my deck giving everything a good freshen up, I planted up my tatty old suitcase again  I usually plant busy lizzies in this but as the girls in the Garden Centre informed me the entire crops nationwide were wiped out with mildew, I decided to try some petunias & lobelia this yearThough I won't get as long a flowering as I do with the busy lizzies, I am sure they will give me a nice show of colourAnge & Judy both requested two Pinkeeps in Country Colours please. These are made from cut down wooden coffee mug trees, with a round baking tin screwed through the centre.The paint colour is a Resene testpot Persian Red ... this deep plum colour goes nicely with the muted tones of wool feltI embellished with some rusty tin accents.Still continuing to work my way through my Orders ... a lovely customer who is rather fond of anything in the vintage linen line ordered 6 covered coathangersI made 5 of these from vintage linen pillowcases & the sixth one (bottom lower right) was made from a vintage linen table runner.I attach a small lavender bag to the hanger which I fill with my own homegrown dried lavender.I bagged up & posted off a large Order of both my Citrus & my Cottage Garden Potpourri's ... these are destined for The Farm Shop at Gordonton where they are sold on behalfWhile waiting on a car repair last week I wandered along to the Hospice Shop ... this sweet little silver tray came home with me ... a good buff up with Silvo & it totally transformed itClick on the pic to enlarge it if you would like a closer look!I have potted up some succulents & baby's tears in some small glass jugs & sat them on my new/old trayMy other treat last week was this dainty Latte Mug which I purchased from The Hummingbird.  It is just the perfect size to fit under my coffee machine & keeps my coffee piping hot ... just how I like it 💙It was a bit of an added bonus when I turned the mug over to see that it is in fact, Green Gate 💚! On a not-so-positive-note my naughty feral cat Blackie went awol for one night & two days last week.He turned up home as if butter wouldn't melt & then proceeded to sleep for an entire day.  I informed him that my hair didn't need any more reason to go grey & that I was seriously considering fitting a hidden camera on him!!!He did not take a scrap of notice of One Single Thing I Said !! 😞Thanks So Much for your visits today dear friends,Be good & kind to yourselves & to each other this coming week,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the feral furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "The Craft Market", "date": "Wednesday, November 14, 2018", "text": "Mid Week Greetings dear friends & readersWell, I survived the Craft Market - Phew !!Before I share my photos I just wanted to say a huge THANK YOU to you all ... I received So Many comments, emails, instagram & text messages wishing me luck for Saturday ... you are all So Very Kind & your good wishes carried me along on the day.I have been asked by so many to share photos of my stall so here goes ... in no particular order.(you can click on the photos to enlarge them if you wish to have a closer peek)After listening to the rain all night long, the sun came out & so did the crowds of shoppers ... it was wonderful & a really festive atmosphere too.My Christmas crafts went down a treat ... I am not 100% sure but I don't think there was alot of actual Christmassy crafts at the marketI am pleased I took this photo (above) because shortly after this, a lady tipped her entire cup of hot coffee over this chair!!  I could not quite believe it!!  I am so thankful that a friend was passing & took the chair squab home with her & immediately soaked it in Napisan for me ... she certainly saved the day !!I sold completely out of babies tears plants ... I took 12 with me & bought none home 😃Although this was my best market day sales-wise, I still seemed to have alot of items to bring home with me at the end of the day.Here I am serving my friend Jenny.I had a lovely neighbour - my friend Julie from Bo & CoWe have been \"neighbours\" at this market for 3 or 4 years now & we were both so thankful for the fine weather as we have sat here before in wind & rain & wondered if perhaps we might both be a little bit insane !!Some random photos of the lanewaysYou can just feel the people enjoying the sunshine & the clear blue skiesAnd if you click on the arrow below you can watch a video that a man has composed of the market day.The very next day (well few days in fact) I felt exhausted ... nothing on my body wanted to function properly & I felt so foggy in my head.BUT ... if I want to finish all my Orders by the end of November then plod on I must . . . . . .Angela wanted a \"Santa Sack\" filled with goodies, but weighted really heavily that she could use as a doorstop at ChristmasI had this one lovely panel left over that I thought would be ideal.I filled a large calico bag with fine gravel to sit in the bottom, then some wadding, then made a calico covered cardboard \"base\" on which to hot glue the toys to.Angela was delighted with her Santa Sack 😊My dear friend Sandy had bought a felt Advent Calendar for her grandchildren but wanted \"something\" smallish to sit in the pocket that could be moved along each day, counting the days til Christmas.As the calendar had a snowman on top, I suggested making up one of the snowmen I made for the Christmas Bags in this postI sat some heavy books on his tummy to flatten him down a bit so he would fit nicely in the felt pockets.Sandy has just collected him this afternoon & sent me a photo of him in the pocket 💗Thank you for staying with me through this photo-heavy post dear readersI am off for a little lie down & a nap I think ... rather like someone above!I hope the rest of the week treats you well dear friends,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "The Final Stretch", "date": "Thursday, November 8, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI am on the final stretch as I head towards the Craft Fair this coming Saturday.I will be at Site 31 so please do drop by if you are coming to the Fair, & if possible, please bring fine weather with you 😉!!This final week has been very much about finishing up items, labeling & pricing, packaging ... & also making up the potpourri's that I love to createOver the weekend it rained & was cold & wintery again ... I lit the fire & informed The Mr there would be no meals eaten at our dining table that day as I commandeered it for my citrus potpourri mixing & making.The heat from the fire took the lovely citrusy fragrance right through our little house.I managed to fill 25 bags with the mixture I had made upMy roses have been a little later flowering this year so I have been unsuccessful with air drying the beautiful red Dublin Bay rose I always like to use for my Cottage Garden Potpourri.As a last resort, I decided to use my dehydrator to dry them ... this took only 2 hours to crisply dry the red rose petals.I was able to fill 18 bags with the Cottage Garden Potpourri which I was thrilled about. Raglans main street is lined with these wonderful Palm TreesOne fine day in the middle of last week, The Mr suggested we take a drive out to RaglanI did not need persuading as I was, once again, very close to tossing my sewing machine out the window!!!Raglan is a small Coastal town that, despite becoming increasingly popular,  still retains that quaint old town feel to it.I LoVe Raglan ... it is a wonderful place to visit & I also enjoy the picturesque drive out there ... it is about an hour from us here.Even though it was the middle of the day, we always like to buy fish & chips at Raglan - the fish is Sooo fresh & tastes completely different to what we buy back here.I always cart my tomato sauce with me as I love my fish dipped in tomato sauce.We ate our lunch on a grassy verge down by the sea & let the wind \"blow the cobwebs away\"!It was a great visit & just the distraction I needed to get me motivated again.My veggie garden has been a constant source of pleasure for me these last couple of months, after being dormant for several winter months.Every night I pick something & cook for our tea - this broccoli is one of my favourite varieties  (Green Dragon broccoli) Two weekends ago - Queens Birthday weekend,  I planted tomatoes, courgettes, several different varieties of lettuce, two pumpkin plants, apple cucumbers, capsicums & basil.I try to pick a couple of leaves of silverbeet or spinach & toss in with whatever I am cooking most nightsFreshly picked Broccoli & Cabbage above - will be in tonights stir fry dish.A couple of nights ago, while sitting stitching on the couch, I snapped these photos of the furry onesI was amazed how in the space of about an hour, they changed positions so much, but still remained tucked up close to one another.This was especially cute seeing as they had had a fur flying fight about an hour previously! Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friends,I will be back next week to let you all know how the Craft Fair went  With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A (rather large) Tilda Skating Angel", "date": "Tuesday, October 30, 2018", "text": "Good Tuesday Greetings dear friends & readers!Earlier in the year my lovely friend Shirley loaned me her copy of the book Tilda's Winter DelightsThe book is filled with gorgeous things but the one item that was a \"have-to-make-one-day\" was on Page 6 - the Skating Angel.Oh how I adored her!With Shirley's permission I copied off the pattern, tucked it away & promptly forgot all about it!After I closed my Craft Cottage last April I was tidying & sorting some leftover items ... this vintage faux fur wrap was amongst the items.  I looked at it long & hard & remembered about the Skating Angel.  This might be perfect for her I thought?The man in my local photocopy Centre very kindly enlarged the pattern for me by 200 % ... I wanted to make a decent sized Angel !As with several of the Tilda doll patterns, the clothing is built into the body as you sew ... there is no body & then dressed with clothes on top.I must admit I found it somewhat tricky working with the thick fur fabric & I was thankful for my years of teddy bear making experience, which certainly helped.With quite a few stops & starts along the way ... she slowly came to life ...She has spent the last month sitting on a slipper chair in my lounge - not quite complete until just yesterday . . . .The Mr finally made me some \"ice skates\" for her boots ! 💗Though she is destined for my market stall ... let me tell you a tiny secret ... I would be more than happy to keep her !!!I cannot decide whether to tuck some greenery & berries into her arms to make her a wee bit Christmassy ???Please do let me know your thoughts dear readers (Incidently my Skating Angel measures 82 cms long)I pulled out my Granny Chic book from the shelf last weekI had purchased some barkcloth fabric from Trademe & wanted to make some roundie cushions .... they turned out great!When The Mr overheard me threatening to throw my sewing machine out the window last week, he suggested I take some time out & go for a walk in the fresh air (!!**??)I took my camera around the garden & was pleasantly surprised to see that, despite my utter neglect these past few months, it has sprung to life & is looking rather pretty in parts.The granny's bonnets & foxgloves always put on a wonderful show despite customers always assuring me they were weeds!!As I sit typing this today the rain is bucketing down ... typical spring weather!At least the garden is getting a really good drink.Someone who shall remain nameless, has decided that since she is resident baby of the family she will take herself off to the Cot for the afternoonRemind me to change the sheets before Sid comes on Thursday ! 😉Have a lovely rest of the week dear friends,Thanks as always, for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Rather ( VeRy!! )  Unusual Prim Santa !", "date": "Tuesday, October 23, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersApproximately 18 years ago now I bought a Santa Pattern from this Patchwork Shop in Rotorua.The pattern is called Olde Thyme Nick & was produced by Kathi Campbell of Heart to Hand designs in 1996!As Christmas approached every year, I would get the pattern out, glance at it, then promptly file it away in the too hard basket!This year I decided Olde Thyme Nick was going to come to life 😊!I think I was possibly put off because his body is not sewn & then stuffed as I am used to, but rather constructed from wood blocks & dowels (broom handles) & wire!This is his initial construction above ..... Yes - this did require some input from The Mr!His dowel (broom handle) legs & body are then well wrapped in wadding.It was fortunate I had good supervision for this task in the shape of Miss Pippi who ensured I covered the dowels thoroughly!Unfortunately she was there again when I cut out his trousers, helping to press the fabric!The pattern came with 5 wooden button shapes which were to be handpainted ... this was a slow process.The pattern included instructions for the button painting, colours etc.For his coat I handstitched a primitive wool felt \"tree\" & then sewed the buttons to the branches.This is him slowly coming together below ....It was at this stage that I rather promptly lost interest in him.I had made 2 hands but Pippi ran off with one one went missing (!!) so I had one hand attached, his coat & boots but still no head.I felt the head pattern looked too small & couldn't seem to get the dimensions right.I put Santa in the corner of the room & there he sat for almost 3 weeks while I went off & made other things 😉I made some sets of Christmas mug mats, scented with cinnamon & whole cloves ....I downsized some stitcheries from Jenny of elefantz stitchery Club & stitched them using Cottage Garden threads, then I framed them in these cute Rosalie Dekker wooden frames.I made felt matchbox mice .... 6 altogether!The Mr asked me - what are you going to do with that funny looking headless Santa?  I said \"put him in a corner in the back of the sleepout!\"He encouraged me to continue on with him so I reluctantly made up his head, which still seemed too small to me . . . .. . . . but once the beard & hair were on, it was the perfect size!I made him a hat with a rusty star & then laced up his boots with leather thonging.He is screwed to the base board, a nice thick piece of native Rimu I pinched found in the Mr's wood shed !I stitched a rusty bell & a primitive tree to his hands.I made him a wool scarf ... he was coming to life at last!Olde Thyme Nick was finally finished!And I am So pleased I persevered with him 💝Here I am standing beside him ... he is 44 inches tall & comes to just above my waist, so he is one tall fellow!He is going for sale on my craft stall ... I think he will need his own special spot to stand there in all his glory.I hope someone buys him & gives him a lovely Home.Wishing you all a lovely week dear friends,Thanks so much for stopping by today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I have made these in past years & they always go very well.  They are just sewn using fabric remnants from my stash, a cinnamon stick tree trunk & I also scent these with clove oils.Along with the stitching, there has been a bit of painting going on here ......This orange chippy chair was hauled out of the back of my sleep out - yet another Op Shop treasure!I gave it 3 coats of cream wall paint (Resene Clotted Cream), however when I went to sand/distress it - as I did consider might happen - the orange paint showed through in lots of places.I was disappointed but as time was against me, I decided to simply embrace the orange & found some doileys & linens in my stash with red & orange colourings in themI made a chair pad using these colours & tied it with some satin ribbons to the sides of the chairThen I mod podged some paper doiley hearts to the chair backI am thrilled with my chippy upcycled chair now 💖Sally very kindly gifted me a wooden magazine rack ... again I have forgotten to take a before photo!I loved the little heart cut outs in each end!Over the weekend, in the spring sunshine I gave it 3 coats of cream wall paint & then a light distress.I mod podged doileys onto each side & end, & then pasted some Cath Kidston wallpaper to the inside base of it.This is going for sale at my November stall.I finished painting/distressing a dark wooden mahogany table for my friend Gail.Then I washed up all my paintbrushes & gear & have put it away til after my market stall.Last Thursday when Sid came for the day I decided to make him a sandpitI tipped all my rolls of ribbons out of this plastic container & then filled it with some leftover sand that I knew we had down in the depot yard.The little wooden stool he is sitting on & the wooden tray to his left are both Op Shop purchases - destined to be upcycled, but somewhat delayed at this stage due to His Lordship finding them quite perfect for his toys!!! 😉Thanks so much for your visits today dear friends,I hope the week is good to you all ... be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "(Christmas) Stitching & Painting ................................................", "date": "Saturday, September 29, 2018", "text": "Weekend Greetings dear friends & readers!!Though I have been absent from blogland I have not been idle & have been making good progress on creating for my November market stall.The two Christmas bags above got the last stitch in them last night ... the pattern on the left is from the Lynette Anderson book  \"Stitch It For Christmas\" & in the book, it is made up into a wallhanging. The bag on the right is an old Country Friends design by Wendy Briggs, which I have stitched several times before.This one is done using Cottage Garden Thread \"Mistletoe\".I embellished the bag on the right with some Christmas buttons I found in my stash.The bags are fully lined & are backed with a striped ticking fabric. The two stuffed stockings above are an old Mogs designs pattern  ... I make these up most years as I really love the design & they are fun to put together.  The reason one of them is smaller is actually a mistake ... I forgot to use the enlarged pattern & by the time I realised this, I had stitched the design so I went ahead & made up a smaller version.These handsome fellows below are A Tilda pattern from the book Homemade & HappyThey are called the \"Hanging Reindeer\" on page 28. Though I love them 💕 & am delighted I have made them ...... I am So Pleased they are finished!!I thought they would be sooo simple to make! No clothing to make, just teadyed calico bodies ... but I must admit turning & stuffing & shaping those long skinny limbs was no joke at all!!My grandson Sid & I went for a long walk last Thursday to hunt out some branches suitable for their antlers.Anything I happened to come across initally was soon demolished by Sid, but I eventually found some blossom tree branches that I was able to remove the buds from.This little verse I found on the internet made me smile as I have indeed, accidently dipped my brush in my cuppa!!I bought this white cane mirror home from the St Johns Op Shop to revamp.I removed the tatty artificial flowers with my hair dryer but unfortunately alot of the glue had hardened & gone down into the cane.  It was a nightmare to try & remove!  A google search suggested isopropyl alcohol so I went to Bunnings & purchased a bottle.Rubbing it on the hard glue did absolutely nothing at all so I am wondering if perhaps you are meant to drink it when it fails to work??!! After a good scrub to remove the dust, I painted it with my chalk paint Pale Duck Egg ... & then sanded the worst of the glue & gave it another coat.It is certainly an improvement ... these items belong to the St Johns Op Shop & will be offered for sale.Now that I look at my photos I can see it is almost an Art Deco style in its shapeI have finally finished the wardrobe I have been working on for the Shop.I completely forgot to take a \"before\" photo but it was old dark wood with a shiny lacquer on it. It got sanded, two undercoats & two top coats .. the colour is a pretty pink though my photos are certainly not doing it justice. As you can see below, the door, shelf & railing were removed so I could wallpaper inside the wardrobe.I was happy with the end result but rather relieved it was all done & dusted!The wardrobe is being priced for sale in the shop. While I was sitting at the table today stitching some tiny Christmas trees, I had my usual assistant - Miss Pippi.She often commandeers my threads but I did smile to myself when she fell asleep on the perle cotton while trying to hide it from  me. Thanks So Much for stopping by today dear friends,I shall be back quite soon to show you a beautiful Angel I am almost finished! 💗 I hope you all have a wonderful weekend With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "\" To Create Something New From Something Old \"", "date": "Tuesday, September 18, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersOur Craft Group challenge for this past month was \"to create something new from something old\"As is usual for me ...... I left mine to the very last minute!!I knew the meeting was on Monday so over the weekend I pulled out this wooden builders trug, purchased on my last trip to Mums at the Hospice Shop for the sum of $2, due to the fact the wooden handle had come out & was loose.I soon glued & screwed it back in, & then decided to give the trug a coat of chalk paint.I left the base unpainted as I planned to line this using a gorgeous Tanya Whelan fabric that I had on hand which matched the paint colour beautifullySome embellishing then took place to cover the several tiny faults in the trug's woodEven crochet doilies got mod podged on each end!Though the photo is showing blue, the colour is actually a gorgeous soft green called \"aquamint\"I then mod podged some Tilda sewing cards onto the front to give it a \"sewing theme\" .... I thought it would be ideal for carting sewing projects around in & plan to put it on my stall for sale at the Christmas Craft Fair.I hosted the craft ladies at my place yesterday so I baked an apricot slice & a lemon drizzle cake ... unfortunately the lemon glaze drizzled off the cake & onto the plate !!!Sharlaine's project was to take an old frame + a vintage doiley & make it up into a picture using some other small embellishments ... I loved how she fashioned the vintage doiley into a dress.Maureen had taken a coathanger destined for the bin,  padded it & added satin, a doiley & some silk flowersI really loved Gail's project ... she had rescued a broken porcelain dolls body from the Op Shop where she volunteers.The dolls head was smashed in, so she removed the remains & found a tattered rabbit soft toy destined for the bin, then attached the head & made clothing for it.  It reminded me of something you might find if you fell down the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland 😉  While I had the paint brush out over the weekend, I upcycled this vintage Singer Sewing Machine drawer, gave it a lick of paint & lined the base with Cath Kidston wallpaper.I have been gathering together some oddments of vintage china cups & saucers & finally got around to making up a dozen vintage teacup birdfeeders, in readiness for my stall.I have bagged up 12 cellophane bags of Wild Bird Seed & like to pop one in each cup when I sell them.Sid was delighted last Thursday, when the cows were in the house paddock for a change.  When he wasn't digging in my veggie garden, he happily stood at the fence watching them ... he just adores cows! 💜Meanwhile a certain furry Miss had built herself a small fortress on the couch & climbed in ... no doubt hiding from Sid who is fascinated with her!Have a great week dear friends ... don't forget to be kind to yourselves & to each other! 💕Thanks so much for your visits today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "An Olde World Santa ......  (Catch Up #3)", "date": "Sunday, September 9, 2018", "text": "Sunday Greetings dear friends & readers 💜Welcome to the last of my \"Catch Up Posts\"This half made Santa fell down recently from the very top of my craft room wardrobeEven Blackie was none too impressed !!!It had been acquired by me quite some time ago, when I happened to turn up at one of my friend Gails clean outs! It seems she had begun to make this Santa, gone no further & lost interest ... so home it came with Steptoe Yours truly 😉There was no pattern for the Santa ... he had been made over a Coca Cola bottle filled with gravel to weight him.Now I knew from past experience, once I dressed him & put something in his arms - he would topple forward.So some surgery was performed on my ironing board - I removed some of the wadding & put in more fine gravel to make him really uprightI wanted to make him a long coat from some dark red fleece I had & trim it with fur.I found an old op shop cardigan & used the last remaining sleeve to make him a long pom pom hatThe ribbing from the cardigan sleeve fitted nicely around his head & I made a large pom pom using the fur.I removed all the hair & beard that Gail had used & replaced it with some beautiful soft hand-dyed mohair fur ... he begun to take on his Olde World Santa appearanceI tucked a bundle of greenery & pip berries into his arms but I felt he needed a sack or a stocking ......I found some lovely old Christmas panels in my stash so I went about making him a large Santa sack ...I keep a good selection of small toys & decoration bits & bobs on hand for filling my Sacks & StockingsI boxed the base of the sack but then decided to weight the bottom with fine gravel as well ... I am pleased I did this as it sits nice & sturdyI filled the rest with wadding & then covered a thick piece of cardboard with calico to sit inside the lip of the sack ... then I hot glued all my toys & decorations to this.I love him 💗& he sits so sturdily he could even be used as a doorstop.Olde World Santa is going on my craft stall.Last week I came across a box of vintage Agee Jars in the sleepout, so thought I would whip up some string jars for my stall.I haven't made these for several years now but they came together nicely with all the bits & bobs already in my stash.I had homespun fabrics in green, red & blue so made one Jar in each colourway.I was still putting my string jars together on Thursday when I had Sid for the day so he spent a happy half hour playing with my bag of ring seals & lids ... just goes to show you don't need expensive toys to keep them amused!When I wrote in my last post about the shelf I had painted/upcycled for St Johns Op Shop I also came home with this large wooden mirror.A clean + two coats of the same grey chalkpaint (Half Absolute) & it totally transformed it!I just scuffed the edges lightly with my fine sandpaper.(these items are not mine but are for the St Johns shop to sell)As you can see, one has not even budded yet & I don't think it is going to.This year has been my first ever attempt at growing hyacinth bulbs in \"bulb forcing jars\".  I must confess they are not flowering yet & it seems to have been a long, slow & painful process to get them this far.  If anyone has ever had success with this & can offer any tips I would greatly appreciate it?Though the sun is shining today dear friends, there is a bitterly cold wind blowing,But this is typical spring weather for us here!Wishing you all a lovely week ahead ... be kind to yourselves & to each other,Thanks so much for coming back to visit me here again today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

(Catch Up #2)", "date": "Wednesday, September 5, 2018", "text": "Mid-Week Greetings dear friends & readers!I picked a bunch of my white daphne yesterday before our wild weather battered the last flowers from the bushIt smells divine 💗When I made the White Peace Angel in *this post* I mentioned that I had made up two Angel bodies & would like to make a cream version This was also prompted by the discovery of these two items above ...  a Christmas decoration droplet & a vintage pearl earing ... I felt these would be perfect adorning my cream Angel.This time round I did remember to paint the shoes before clothing the Angel!Her shoes dried quite quickly by the fire.I found two cream lace table mats in my linen stash which were the perfect size for her bloomersThe vintage earing became a brooch for my angel, I stitched the christmas droplet in her hands & trimmed her shoes with some braid & dainty gold roses.  I also made her a Halo but added gold sequin stars this time round, not silver.For her wings I cut up the same bunch of glittery silk flowers & leaves as my white Peace Angel & fashioned her a large pair of wingsThe Pattern I used is Charlotte Angel by Rosalie Quinlan DesignsBeautiful Cream Angel! 💖I love her just as much as my White Peace Angel ... I am wondering ... do you have a favourite??The lady that manages our local St John's Op Shop, recently asked if I would teach a few of the volunteers some painting/upcycling techniquesI told her Yes but assured her I was certainly No Professional when it came to these matters!I have been going in most days for the past week & working on a vintage wardrobe which I will show you in a future post.On Monday I bought this tatty looking shelf home with me - I decided to upcycle this at home by the fire.Before painting I masked the 3 tile squares.Jan had given me some grey chalk paint & I gave it a couple of coats in between doing a zillion other thingsThe Chalk Paint is Da Vinci's  & the shade is \"Quarter Absolute\"A bit of a light sand at the end & Viola . . . . Such an improvement!I was too lazy busy to remove the hooks but I felt they looked great with a paint & then just a quick scuff at the finish.I had been feeding chooks & pets for neighbours that were overseas ... I liked to take Sid down there with me as he seemed to enjoy the chooks, ducks, horses & cows.A bonus was that the chooks were laying this time round - so we got to gather fresh eggs every day!Sid very much enjoyed his home made scrambled eggs (incidently eaten using fingers & NOT the spoon!) Just look at those gorgeous bright yellow yolks! 😊Two weekends ago my daughter in law Sarah & I went to this beautiful cafe for a High Tea.My son had gifted us both a voucher for this treat back in May for Mother's Day.This was a first experience of High Tea for both of us & we very much enjoyed the whole process. You get to choose your teas from a selection of 10 different onesFirst you are given sandwiches & tiny savouries & then you get a different tea to enjoy with your sweets.Sarah & I chose Tokyo Lime Green Tea for our savoury course & then Berrylicious Tea for our sweet course.When you leave you get to choose a handmade chocolate & a bookmark ... just delightful & such a treat! 💕In fact I enjoyed the teas that Sarah & I choose So Much that I went online this week & purchased the very same teas from *this Store*I have shared them amongst us both,  & made up a little gift package to present to Sarah as a surprise.Thanks So Very Much for staying with me here folks,I hope the week is treating you kindly?I shall be back in a few days with Catch Up #3 .... if you are still with me 😉With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Painting & Papercraft ............ (Catch Up #1)", "date": "Monday, September 3, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Welcome to Spring!My absolute favourite season of them all !! Tho' if you could see our weather as I sit here typing this, you would surely be saying \"we think Julie, perhaps you may need your head examined just a tad?!\"I have been busy with creative pastimes but have been remiss in my blogging efforts so have decided (again) to schedule a series of Catch Up Posts as I did back in July.Today we have Catch Up # 1 😊Longtime readers of my blog will know I use the French Doors at the end of my lounge as a little glasshouse to grow my babies tears in front of ... in fact all houseplants do well there.I have been potting up lots of babies tears in old china containers to sell at my market stall in November ... I am hoping to have them well established by then.These two wooden book racks/shelves were languishing in my sleepout for a few years quite some time.I bought them inside last week & gave them a wash & a paint, both with leftover chalk paint. The left one I painted in Pale Duck Egg & the right one in Robins Egg.I found some vintage Cath Kidston wallpaper in my craft wardrobe ... I had purchased this from my friend Catherine's online store last year.I decided to wallpaper the book racks tho' to be honest, I was none too sure what I was doing.I found some old wallpaper paste & tried to just use remnants of the vintage wallpaper.Miss Pippi however, assured me she knew exactly what to do & would \"supervise the task from her basket!!\"(Miss Pippi, who has the attention span of a flea, quickly grew bored & had frequent little naps while I toiled away)In the end I was delighted with the finished results ... I fussy cut some of the leftover flowers & glued them on the backs of the book racks & also odd ones on the outer sidesThe \"Robins Egg\" shadeThe \"Pale Duck Egg\" ShadeOnce they were dry I gave them a coat of modpodge to seal the papers & then waxed the rest of the wooden chalk painted areas.My dear friend Sandy had this red wooden stool for quite sometime, but found as she no longer used this colour in her decor,  it was put away out of sight.  She asked me to paint it for her & had a vision of a \"french navy colouring\" ... Sandy gave me a handbag of the exact colour she was visualising & I trotted off to my local Resene Colour Shop for a colour chart.We both agreed on a gorgeous blue shade called \"Bunting\" ... I am always delighted when I love the names of the colours I am working with, fickle person that I am 😉Sandy's stool got 3 coats over a period of several days by the fire ... our weather has certainly Not been outdoors painting weather!When Sandy took it home I realised I had forgotten to take an \"after\" photo so I asked her to please send me some through when she had it in its new place.Oh My! I was Not disappointed!   It looks stunning as I'm sure you will agree!I confess I have been casting my eye around my Home to see what I can paint in this gorgeous Bunting shade!Last Wednesday, while it poured with rain (again!) I sat at my worktable & cut out Tilda paper angels which I had had Laser copied onto thin card.I gave them all doiley dresses & adorned them with lace & flowers ... I strung some sets of 4 up as bunting & then kept some single ... these are destined for my craft stallI think I will package some up in cellophane bags ... I am hoping they may sell well as otherwise I am going to have alot of paper angels strung around my Home!!Yesterday morning I drove over to Tirau to meet up with my friend & fellow blogger Sue from the blog KiwikidsShe is over from Australia to visit with her Mum who lives in Tauranga.Sue & I met up at a lovely local cafe that we have frequented before ... Alley Cats CafeWe had an enjoyable morning tea & the time whizzed by as it always does when we catch up ... as we were leaving Sue presented me with this gorgeous parcel of goodies - a magazine & some mouth watering fabrics!Thanks So Much Sue ... I am still drooling over everything, you are So Kind!!Thank you all So Much for staying with me friends. I will be back in a couple of days with Catch Up Post #2 In the meantime, I will leave you with my two furry friends tucked up on the couch this wild wintery Waikato afternoon!Cheerio for now & thanks so much for your visits,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Chair for Sid", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers from a wet wintery Waikato!Last week I spent about half an hour out in my woodshed seaching for a bag of pinecones I was sure were out there.I did not manage to find the pinecones but I did come across this wee wooden childs chairNow even though I currently have a gazillion things on my \"to do list\" - I decided then & there I wanted to revamp this chair for Sid, my youngest grandson. I took it outside to the wintery sun & gave it a good scrub & a bit of a scrape down where it had originally been varnished.It was a good solid wooden chair, built really strongly.When painting in winter it always pays to warm the wood up first - makes for a better paint application!I decided to stay with a black/white colour theme in keeping with the decor in Sid's home.I purchased 2 Resene Testpots ... Wan White & Just BlackThe black went on really easily & covered well ... I had some issues when I masked the black to do the white rungs & the masking tape removed some of my black paint 😖Lots Some touching up was required ... I was pleased with the end result however!Now ....  I needed a small cushion for the seat part!This fabric in my local Patchwork Shop was just perfect as Sid is very much into farm animals & especially Cows!Also it was the exact colourway, so I purchased a fat 1/4It didn't take long to run up a small padded cushion which can easily be removed if desired.I took the chair around last night to show Sid & his parents ... this photo came through later in the evening which just made me smile so much!My dear little grandson was delighted with his new (upcycled) chair 😊There has also been some more coathanger covering going on here at ThreadbearI covered another 4 coathangers with some vintage wool blanket scraps & embellished them with crochet bits & bobs from my stashThese ones (& the two below) will be used as stock for my Christmas StallI have never sold these before so am hoping they are well received.The top one above is an upcycled vintage embroidered pillowslip & the one below is from a vintage tablecloth ... the other edge was stained & torn but this edge was in immaculate conditionI like to sew up a little lavender bag & attach to these dainty onesI have been continuing on with knitting the Pot Scrubby's that I wrote about in this postIt states that one ball of Wash Knit Yarn makes 4 scrubby's so I am hoping this is accurateThese are made from a free pattern available * here *Well dear friends, time to fill the wood basket again!It is a wet & wild day here at Threadbear HQ & a certain little madam fairy is tucked up on the couch .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  while Blackie has prime position by the fire & is currently wondering if I can manage to keep putting wood on without disturbing him too much!!I hope you are keeping warm or cool where-ever you might be?Thanks so much for stopping by to \"visit me\" here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A White Peace Angel", "date": "Tuesday, August 14, 2018", "text": "Wintery Greetings dear friends & readers,While cleaning out the large wardrobe in my sewing room I came across two items that inspired me to create a new AngelThe Christmas decoration on the left was purchased last year from the \"bargain bin\" in the Christmas Heirloom Shop ... it was marked down to $7.The bunch of glittery silk flowers/leaves were passed on to me by my friend Gail ... unsold product from when she closed her Gift Shop ... the first thing I thought when I saw them was \"angel wings\"So I felt inspired to create an all white Angel & decorate her using these two items She came together rather well using fabrics & trims I already had on hand ... I used an older Rosalie Quinlan pattern called Charlotte, though I have decided to name her \"Peace Angel\"The christmas snowflake decoration sat perfectly in her hands &, after dismantling some of the glittery leaves & removing the bobbles, the \"wings\" worked out just as I had envisioned.I hung her on my door for a day or two to walk past her as I like to do with my dolls ... often another idea will come to me - which is exactly what happened!I decided she needed painted shoes ... I didn't like her bare feet.Deciding to paint shoes at this stage is somewhat tricky ... also not having any pale grey paint on hand can be a bit tricky, so I tentatively mixed the white & black paints I did have until I was happy with the colour.Although I loved her hair & her silver bows,  I felt she needed some sort of halo. Halo's are rather short in supply around here so ...... I needed to construct one. I found some welding wire in the Mr's shed which I bent into shape & hot glued some silver sequins onto it.I was happy with her pale grey shoes which I trimmed with some lace & dainty silver bows 😍I am delighted with her Halo & felt it just finished her off nicelyMy Peace Angel measures 75 cms tallBeautiful Peace Angel 💜(I am pleased I cut out two bodies as now I would like to make a Cream Angel.)Miss Pippi was ecstatic last week when I came home with a brand new ball of knitting cotton that she somehow decided was just for her!!I have been enjoying making up these Waffle Knit Dishcloths & because there are 4 rows to a pattern, they seem to grow quite quickly.The pattern is a free download from *here* if you should like to have a go yourselfOver the weekend we had two glorious days where the sun shone & the washing dried on the line for a change.I managed to spray paint some coathangers out on my brick path in the sunshine.(these are to create some more wool blanket coathangers)As the Mr was away riding Moto X I even took my lunch out onto the deck & drooled over a magazine on loan from my friend Sally.Today however, we are back to arctic temperatures & the two are nestled in their basket on my work table, the fire is roaring & I have just rung & ordered another load of firewood to be delivered!This morning I made Oaty Ginger Crunch ... I can put the kettle on if you would like to pop by for a cuppa?I hope the week is treating you kindly dear readers,Thanks so much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Home Again", "date": "Saturday, August 4, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers.Another month has slipped on by & we have only one month of winter remaining before we welcome my favourite season - Spring!I had a good trip down to Mum's but it is always lovely to be home again ... these two below missed me & as well as refusing to eat, fat blackie went missing for a day & a night while I was awayHe has slept most of the time since my return, so I am guessing he covered a fair distance in his wanderings.I had a large box of junk unwanted treasures in my car to deliver to one of the Op Shops in Mums town ... I knew Mum had a few things to add to this box.These two items below were on the top of the box ... they were miniature clotheslines that had been for sale in my Cottage for a very long time.Just prior to my journey I pulled them back out of the box as I had an idea for them 😉I had this lovely Christmas panel in my stash so - upon my return home - I made each clothesline a simple hanging \"quilt\" from one of the squares in my panelI tightened the strings & gave the wood a polish with a slightly darker oil - they came up well.I attached my \"quilt\" with some festive pegs, then made 2 small buntings from hessian scraps & filled the cane baskets with greenery & pip berries.I attached a wooden \"flag\" to each pole with a small brass nail.I thought they turned out rather well & would look lovely adorning a small Christmas table.Hopefully they will sell at my craft stall.Just prior to my trip away, I put the finishing touches on another (condensed milk tin) flowerYou can read about my first attempt at these flowers * here *This one was made in some pretty Tilda fabrics in green/blue tonings I now have two flowers for my craft stall but if they don't sell, I am quite happy to keep them as I love them both 💗My friend Donna had made me this gorgeous handknitted & felted pot for my birthday & decorated it with felt pom pomsMum gave me some birthday money so I purchased a shiny, healthy Peace Lily on my trip home which just sat perfectly in the pot.Though there was definately no time for any shopping this trip, I had to spend time waiting for a prescription for Mum at the one & only Pharmacy in her town.  This just happens to be beside & opposite a large Hospice & SPCA shop ... so of course, I felt compelled to go for a quick squizz!These treasures above were from the Hospice Shop ... doileys, mother-of-pearl buttons, a wooden trug & a good novel - & below were my finds from the SPCA shopI could not leave these epp flowers & hexies behind ... someones lovingly stitched handwork ... all for just $4 a bagfullThese dainty little dishes were $3 each ... Oh how I love them so ... they remind me of cross stitchI have put backs on each of them & hung them beside my Tilda Angel so I can look at, & enjoy them 💗Speaking of gorgeous vintage treasures, my dear friend Sally has opened an online store Hollyhock VintageYou can visit Sally to have a browse at the shelves of her store or go Here to visit her facebook page ... she has some very tempting pieces in there that I could just see living at my Home !My sister in law Leonie gifted me this beautiful soy Kearose Candle while I was down at Mums ... I had helped her with a large cleaning job & she wanted to thank me.The fragrance is French Pear + Vanilla & it smells so divine burning in my lounge.Finally dear friends, 3 days before my trip away, I got to spend the morning at my eldest grandsons Daycare for Grandparents Morning.It was a wonderful time ... he is a busy little boy & was quite delighted to show Granny all the activities.Just wonderful & such a special time 💜Thanks so much for your visits today ... it is always lovely to have you stop by,Wishing you all a wonderful week ahead ... be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Candle Mats, Christmas Angels & a Pathfinder Vest!", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI did not mean to be so long between blog posts but life, & a visiting relative, just kind of got in the wayEarlier in the week my lovely friend Sally (the florist) popped by for a visit & gave me these gorgeous flowers which are still looking picture perfect todayThey are such a wonderful splash of colour these gloomy winter days.After my last post where I wrote about the candle mat I had made  I sat at my work table & decided to cut out another one .... Miss Pippi very kindly helped me choose a colour schemeAlthough the pattern for this mat had Bee Skeps on it, I decided to try & make it a little more christmassy, so appliqued wool felt hearts in place of the Bee SkepsI also added some rusty tin stars to my hearts .... these candle mats are definately becoming addictive 😉Prior to my Uncle arriving, I found 2 doll bodies I had cut out last Christmas ... these are the Rosalie Dekker pattern \"Linen Angel\"I finished the doll bodies off & made them some clothing using Tilda fabrics.  I found 2 felt star christmas decorations which I added a small Tilda heart to & attached these to their hands.As I wanted to make them just a little christmassy I wired up some small berry picks ...... I decided to just slip these into their arms with the thought that they could be removed & the Angels left out all year round if desired.Sweet little girls that they are !I have finally finished my rose pruning for the year !I gathered lots of rose hips & have been drying these for potpourris ... I do LoVe rose hips!Whilst outside I gathered bowls of citrus fruit as The Mr had somehow knocked a branch off the lemon tree while mowing!I made another citrus slice but the rest of the fruit has been shared with friends & family .... & eaten!My friend Desiree ordered more herbal mothball sachets when I next made a batch, so I made up another 20.Although I had the mixture ready, it was sewing up the muslin bags that took the time.The whole house smelt lovely & fresh & minty while I was filling the sachets.Approximately 2 months ago I ordered The Pathfinder Vest Pattern from the TwigandTale website with a view to making Sid a vest.When I downloaded & printed off my pattern I saw that it was 61 pages long due to the fact that this can be made up to fit sizes 1 to 14.Though I had measured Sid, I had somehow lost my measurements & didn't know where to begin.I \"filed the pattern away in the too hard basket\"Finally last week I got the pattern out again & with a clear head, had a good read of it & then proceeded to cut out the size 3 ... I guessed this would be on the largish size but would fit him a little down the track.I finished the pattern quite quickly ... Lisa's instructions are always so clear & concise ... I tried it on him yesterday & quickly sewed on the toggles.I was so thrilled that the vest fit him perfectly.Incidently the entire vest was made using fabrics & vintage wool blanket remnants already in my stash, including the wooden toggles ... the only thing purchased was the pattern.We had a little \"modelling session\" inside but decided to go to the Park in the afternoon to give it a proper test run.What delighted me most was that Sid seemed quite happy wearing the vest & not at all finicky about having it on.Because it was a cool day, the vest kept him snug & warm & he was even happy when Granny put the Pixie Hood up 😊I hope you all have a lovely weekend dear friends,I am off to Mums for my 3 montly visit so will \"see you all\" on my return,Be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I would reply ... with the very best of intentions ... but somehow never quite got there.This year with the closure of my Cottage, I decided it was a priority.So last week I put on my big girls panties & drove myself 5 hours away to visit my friend in Northland.This was my room at Leeanne's beautiful Home ... & even though I tried really, really hard ... I did not manage to smuggle the quilt on the far right into my car & bring it home!!Her Home is a testament to her amazing creativity & is filled with handcrafted treasures everywhere you look ... I felt right at home 💜Simon, Leeanne's cat, who sometimes features on her blog, joined us when we sat by the fire stitching & chatting.  He blends right in when he sleeps on the giant biscornu Leeanne has made him from vintage wool blankets.The Country Yard ..... the most beautiful patchwork shop set in stunning groundsHigh on my wish list of things to do & see, was to visit this gorgeous Patchwork Shop hereKerryn, the Owner has been to my Cottage a number of times & I had always wanted to visit her beautiful shop myselfThere was so much eye candy everywhere it was hard to take it all in.(& yes, some purchases definately came away with me)Early the next morning we drove up the Coast to a beautiful spot Helena Bay Gallery & CafeYou can just see the coastline in the distance of my photo ... though the air was crisp, we sat outside on the deck & had delicious coffee & cappucino cakeNext door to the cafe is a stunning Gallery filled with local artisans work. I always like to bring a small momento home with me, so I purchased the red pottery heart above ... it sits perfectly on my small \"heart wall\" at HomeBack in the city again, we decided to do a trawl of the local Op Shops because ............ well,  just because ............I gathered a small collection of junk treasures in the Hospice Shop ... some for making into birdfeeders & some for candlemakingBut my \"treasure of the day\" would have to be this cute little vintage enamel Tala Pastry Cutter set ... complete with all 4 sizes of cutters ... for the princely sum of $5 ! 😊I knew it would look perfect sitting on my enamel breadbin with some other junk vintage treasuresWhile sitting stitching/chatting at Leeanne's I worked on this wool felt candle mat ... I had cut it out before I left home.The pattern is by Barri Sue Gaudet of Bareroots designsI love how it turned out & LoVe the primitive colours! I keep these glass containers for my candle making - they are great for tipping any leftover soy wax into - so I wrapped one with some pip berries & added a tealightI hope to make some more of these for my Christmas Craft Stall.And my final completion has been another two cotton dishcloths ... these are made using leftover yarn & are destined for the present box.Well dear friends ... that's me ... all caught up! 😉I hope you have a wonderful weekend & the coming week brings you only good things,Thanks - as always - for your visits to my blog,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Teaching & a Birthday (Catch Up  #2)", "date": "Wednesday, July 11, 2018", "text": "Happy Wednesday to you dear friends & readers! Today is Catch Up Post # 2  😊Thank you all So Much for the lovely comments you left on my last post .... I appreciate each & every one of them!!You may remember in this older post where I had been asked to teach a handcrafted item to a small Rural Women Group this coming winter.I decided to make the felt mice below - an easy handstitched item achievable in an afternoon - I half filled their bodies with dried lavender to make them fragrant.The Craft Day was held on June 29th in my small rural town .... 15 ladies attended.A week prior to this I sat down & prepared all my kitsets ... I kitted up a range of both the cream & the pink mice.Remembering everything I have to take is always a bit of a mission with these classes.As I found myself unusually rather organised for me ... I decided to make up another couple of class samples ... this time in a Christmas themeOne wet, stormy morning I sat at the work table & handstitched my Christmas Mice while my staff members Supervisors napped on the job!!I think the Christmas versions turned out wonderfully & even though I added the dried lavender to them, I think you could just as easily omit this & then scent them with some Christmas Pine Oil.  🎄All made using up scraps & bits & bobs I already had in my craft stash.This year I was able to take part in the full days craft activities... we made Christmas Cards in the morning under a lovely tutor, Irene.Some of the ladies working away happilyThese are my 4 cards below ... there was some stamping/embellishment on the inside also My photo does not do them justice, they are actually a 3D  layered effectThough I remembered to quickly snap a couple of pics while the ladies were crafting their mice, I did not get a chance to photograph everyone's creation at the end, as some of the ladies left earlier than othersIt would've been nice to show the 15 completed mice all lined up on the worktable.But the ladies had a fun day & all really enjoyed themselves - when the afternoon sun came into the old Church Hall, the scent of lavender was divine! On the last day of June I had a Birthday .... 58 years around this clock of life !!My wonderful Sons & Grandsons .... that is me to the right holding my grandson Sid.Though we had planned a picnic morning tea in our local Park, the white-out frost put paid to these plans so we went to my youngest son's home instead.My dear friend Carolyn was up this way so she was able to come to our morning tea & presented me with a beautiful homemade (carrot) birthday cake.I was also lucky enough to receive some gorgeous handmade gifts from friends ... spoilt indeed!!My first attempt at a scrubbie .... apparently you can get 4 from 1 ball of yarnAmongst my friend Donna's gift was this fascinating yarn ... it felt like it had a bristle thread running through it.A quick google search & I was able to find a pattern to knit up a \"scrubbie\" ... (a pot scourer)You will find the free link here if you should like to have a go ...or here are some other free patterns to knit using the Washknit yarnThe Mr presented me with a Coffee Maker ... I must admit one of these had long been on my wish list .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  though my coffee making skills are improving I think it's only fair to say I have quite a wee way to go yet !!!The Mr is milking at present (we autumn calve) so he is gone by 5 am. On the days that I have Sid I like to get up & get the house warm before he arrivesHer Royal Highness resting by the fire !! Someone else thinks the fire is entirely for her benefit of course!!  Have a wonderful day dear friends - thank you all again for your visits!I hope to be back before Saturday with Catch Up #3 (my last catch up post) With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Tin Cans & Tilda  (Catch Up #1)", "date": "Sunday, July 8, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersWelcome to a bright shiny new week AND a shiny new month!Though I have been tardy in my blogging of late, I have definately not been idle.  I have been busy creating & taking photos as I go so there is lots to share with you.However in order not to be too photo heavy I have decided to schedule a series of \"catch up posts\" for this week ... today is Catch Up #1  😊When I wrote about presenting the Craft Group Ladies with a basket of tins to create with ... I saved what was left over for myselfFrom the bottom of the basket I removed 3 small catfood tinsI knew in my storage cupboard I already had the wooden mug trees above (50c each from the Op Shop) along with the old tin baking dishes, also an Op Shop findI disassembled the mug trees outside & cut them down to size, then with the Mr's help, I screwed the baking tins to the top along with the cat food tins in the centre - see photo belowOnce I had them together I painted them, but half way through I found it was far easier to unscrew them to get a good covering, particularly in the top part(all my paint was just using up leftover chalk & test pot paint)Before screwing them back together again I traced a cardboard shape for my cake tin base, added wadding & covered it in Tilda fabric, glued lace to the outer edge, then hot glued this into my base.Once I screwed the catfood tin back in again it gave it a nice padded effect.  I filled the catfood tins in the centre with wadding & added lace trim before gathering a large circle of Tilda fabric & gluing this into my tin Voila ...... a pincushion !!   (or three)I embellished with some wood cutouts, ribbon & key charms.I can't choose a favourite colour ..... is there any particular one you prefer I wonder??These are going to be stock for my Christmas Craft Stall.I knew July was going to be busy for me so I kept going with my \"tin can creativity\" while I was on a rollI took the last remaining condensed milk tin & filled it with some oasis scraps I had on hand ...... then I covered the tin with some scrapbooking paper, also in my stashI fashioned 12 petals from Tilda fabrics & hot glued them to a barbeque skewer to make a flower When I decided to add 2 leaves, they wouldn't sit upright so I painted them with a PVA & water mixture, which gave me the desired effectI poked my skewer into the oasis then glued some sphagnum moss to cover this.I really like this pretty Tilda flower & hope to make some more for my stall.The Electrician came & (finally) fixed the broken light fitting in my sewing room ... Oh how wonderful it is to use the light again!!I wanted a new lightshade but the Mr assured me there was no money in the budget for this!!I knew I had this old shade in my sleepout - another Op Shop treasure - so I bought it inside & removed the tatty, torn fabric off the sides .... well to be honest the fabric more or less fell off all by itself !!I wound some pretty fabric around the frame of the shade & then glued a beaded trim to the bottom that I already had in my stash.I LoVe this simple but effective lightshade So much !!!  ❤Lastly dear friends, I stitched an Order for my friend Sandy.She wanted Hottie Covers for her grandchildren with their names appliqued on. Sandy was delighted when she collected them & they are winging their way South to colder climates!Thanks for staying with me through this lengthy post dear friends,I shall be back in a couple of days with Catch Up #2   😊I shall also get around to visiting you all at your blogs at long last.Take care of yourselves & have a lovely week ahead,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Sewing Day ", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2018", "text": "Wintery Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersThis time exactly a week ago - for the first time since I closed my Craft Cottage - I had a sewing day!How wonderful it was!!To me ... a sewing day is when you find yourself in the sewing room really early in the day  You choose to do nothing else in the house except the dishes (sometimes) ... you don't have to be anywhere  or do anything for anyone else!All you have to do is create ..........  & feed yourself!!These days for me are few & far between!My dear friend Leeanne had given me a small pile of linen items last year to use in my sewing as they were superfluous to her requirements.Amongst the items was this long wrap around bistro apron ...  made of raw linen with these words embroidered on the pocket -Claire Wilson's Country Kitchenfor all culinary purposesOriginal Forest County PotteryEst 1873For reasons I have no idea of  .... I decided it had a certain french flair to it.So I decided to sew it up into a large square cushion with a buttoned backI had some large wooden french style buttons that were perfect for the back closureWell the Eiffel Tower is quite definately French !!I stuffed it with an oversized inner & then - because of the french feel - I tucked a bunch of my dried lavender into the pocketSimple & unfussy but effectiveI was late picking my lavender this year .... late February in fact.I plonked it on my outside basin & then never quite got back to it ... when the wetter weather came along it got moved up to my deck table.Early last week winds blew it every which where, so I gathered it up, sat by the fire & rubbed the stalks into a brown paper bag while Sid slept.From the remnants of the apron I decided to make some lavendar hearts .... I machine embroidered the words \"Joy\", \"Peace\" & \" I 💗 Home\" onto pieces of the raw linen before sewing up my lavender filled hearts.I managed to get 12 hearts from the leftover scraps - I attached a vintage button & some linen thread to hang them.I am having a stall at my local Christmas Craft Fair this November - as I do most years - so these items will be good stock for my stall.After lunch I sat by the fire & finished off these felt sewing machines - this is a pattern by Betz White .... the same one we made last week at our craft group get-togetherI already had 3 completed but was able to finish off another 5 .... again these will be for my November stall.Earlier in the week I managed to finish off a birthday gift for a special friend & send it on its merry way to the far North.Two more covered coat hangers & a soy candle made in a vintage enamel basin that was tucked away in the back of my sewing cupboardThe Black Rose is a new fragrance & smelt rather beautiful!This coathanger below was made from a vintage pillowslip - I used the embroidered edge to cover the coathanger as it was so pretty, then added some gathered lace & trimI made up a small square lavender bag & tied this to the top using the leftover pillowcase fabric .... just a little embellishment  💝Well dear friends, winter is really making its presence felt here in my little corner of the worldEveryday I am thankful for the fire & how it warms the house.I hope you find some time in your week to do the things that bring you pleasure.Thanks so much for stopping by today .... keep warm or cool where ever you areWith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Chasing My Tail !!!", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2018", "text": "Monday Greetings dear friends & readers,A bright shiny new week & a shiny new month!It has very much felt like I have been \"chasing my tail\" for most of last month & this one too!Blog posts have been few & far between & time slips by in the blink of an eye!I decided to just do a photo upload & try to pop a few words in here & thereWith my dear friend Leeanne coming for the long weekend, it was the perfect chance to try out a new recipe Scroggin Slice turned out to be divine!*Here is the link to the recipe I used*Photographing really dark today for some reasonLast year Leeanne very kindly gifted me a length of pretty pale blue fabric with pink roses on ... it reminded me of Cath Kidston fabric.I had a blind made up for my sewing room & then decided to make a simple runner for the chest of drawers in there.I wanted to practise some of the quilting skills I had learn't in this postI also wanted to add a simple lace peeper to the edges while binding it, & having Leeanne here was the perfect opportunity to get some assistance with this I am so thrilled with my runner & although I still have a very long way to go with my quilting, I was really happy with the end result.On the morning of Leeanne's arrival, Pippi & Blackie rather kindly bought a mouse into the house & released it!!After spending over an hour trying to catch it, I gave up & set some traps.I was relieved to catch it the 2nd night but still cross with Madam Pippi .... she reminds me of a small naughty child .... when you see them sleeping you can (almost) forgive them anything!When my friend Sally purchased the two slipper chairs in this post she also acquired a large squab covered in the same fabric.I made up two rectangular cushions for each of our chairs using the Sanderson fabric.  While delivering Sally her cushion I admired these two vintage needlepoint pictures leaning against the wall in her hallway.Sally VERY kindly gifted the two pictures to me!!I am still undecided about where to hang them but am having alot of fun deciding!!Over the weekend I stood in my kitchen & made another batch of soy candles in vintage containers ... these ones are Lime, Basil & Mandarin ... they smelt beautiful!I also baked more slices as it was my turn to host the craft ladies here todayI made another batch of Scroggin Slice as well as a Citrus Slice as our citrus trees are laden with fruit at the moment.There were only 5 of us today so we made simple felt sewing machine decorations .... a pattern by betz whiteWe all drooled over Maureen's felt needlecase - a Holly Hobbie design she had embroidered & made herself.To give the ladies \"a challenge\" for next month I had been collecting tins in various shapes & sizes They were all to take one (or more) & do something creative with it before next months meeting.I look forward to sharing the results with you dear readers.Well its rainy & icy cold here today, so these two have already retired for the night!Have a wonderful week dear friends, where ever in the world you may be.Thanks so much for stopping by today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Birthdays ................................  & \"A Dirty Pour\" ", "date": "Monday, May 28, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersThe birthday gift making continues here at ThreadbearThese two wool blanket coathangers were stitched up & posted south last week, for a dear friends birthday.My eldest grandson Alec turned 3 on May 18th.I had purchased his gifts awhile ago but wanted to make him some wool blanket slippers to keep his feet warm this winter ... his foot measures 6 inches long - I was able to make these up using fabrics from my scrap bagThese are made using a great pattern that I purchased from twig and taleWe had a wonderful birthday celebration with some daycare friends, Alec's cousin Sid, a new bike & a \"Finding Dory\" cakeOne of Alec's requests for his birthday was a batman cape .... this photo arrived in my inbox a couple of nights ago  I LoVeD the pose & can just imagine the appropriate noises that went along with it!I have been using up all the remnants of cotton/bamboo in my knitting bag, making up very plain & simple dishclothsThese are enjoyable (& uncomplicated) to knit in the evenings when my eyes are tiredI finished another one while watching the Royal Wedding last weekend .... unfortunately I had a little helper on the couch with me .... The Mr snapped these pics of her \"assisting me\"That is me wearing my pink fleecy dressing gownMy friend Gail rang to tell me our next Craft Group Meeting challenge would be to create \"a dirty paw\"!!I knew this was a form of artwork so I decided to google it.While I was busily searching for dirty paw it never even occurred to me that I should be looking for dirty pour !!I should be honest & say I was none to enthused about this challenge but how wrong I was!!It was honestly So Much Fun!We all had to choose 4 - 5 colours that we wanted to use, then these were poured into plastic cups along with glue & FloetrolThe cup was then VeRy carefully tipped onto our canvas'sIt was so fascinating seeing all the different colour combinations & the effect at the endThe canvas's take approximately a week to dry!You can see above all the very different canvas's .... I should say the dirty pours!And this one below is by Yours Truly - just waiting for a coat of clear lacquer on itWhile Sid played happily in my pot drawer last Thursday, I made up another batch of Liquid Laundry Detergent from the recipe in Rhonda's BookI always sit my bucket in the bathtub overnight to let the mixture really thicken, before dispensing it into my (Op Shop) collection of glass decanters the next day.Speaking of Op Shop treasures .... this sweet little glass/silver dish came home with me from the Church Op Shop last week for the princely sum of 50 cents!It was certainly NOT this colour when I purchased it but a good rub with silver cleaner & it came up shiny.I had been looking for something to display some small soaps in my bathroom for a very long time & this was perfect.Though the cat basket has not been on the table since last winter (& I assured The Mr it would NoT be put back there again!!) a certain little fairy has won yet another round!When The Mr saw this he just shook his head & said nothing!Have a wonderful week dear friends - be kind to yourselves & to each other,Thanks so much for your visits here today,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Pretty Things", "date": "Friday, May 18, 2018", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersGosh, where did that week slip away to I might well ask??!!Making pretty things is something I really enjoy.In fact, if I could, I would make pretty things Every Single Day!  My friend & longtime customer Christine, called for a visit & showed me a photo on her phone.The photo was of the cushion below which Christine had found on the internet while browsing for a cushion for her grandaughter who was turning 4.She asked if I would be able to make a cushion very similar but her instructions were for me to add pink satin ballet slippers along with the tutu.Christine requested that the cushion be pink/white, pretty, possibly 3 dimensional & have the wee girls name on it (Hayley)Also Hayley LoVeS hearts so could I somehow include these please. I began my applique - still not quite sure what I was doing but just trying to \"wing it\"Luckily I found some pink fabric in my stash covered in hearts which I used to applique Hayley's name.I use a long length of white tulle & gathered this to make the tutu appear 3 dimensional, then added some tulle flowers I already had on handMy local sewing shop had no diamantes in stock but I did find some sparkly sequins that gave the same effectI could find no pretty pink ballet themed buttons for the back closure so I found some wooden heart discs in my craft drawer & spray painted these white, before drilling tiny holes to make them into buttons.I thought they worked out just fine.Christine was absolutely delighted with her cushion & I have yet to find out what the birthday girl thought of her gift.The challenge for last month at our Craft Group get together was to make a mannequin using an Op Shop candlestick as the base.Our instructions/pattern were were from this website *here*In the bargain box at my local Church Op Shop, I found this old brass candlestick for the princely sum of 20 cents!I painted it with 2 coats of chalk paint - vintage white, & lightly sanded the edges. Though I was really looking forward to doing this challenge I have to admit I did not enjoy it at all.I could not get my mannequin shape right & she ended up looking more like a grid iron player on steriods, even though I had 3 attempts at stuffing & unstuffing her!!Many times she nearly sailed through the air !! To disguise a shape that I was not happy with, I overdid it with my embellishments.I drew her waist in tightly with ribbon then hid this under some tulle & added lace & pearls & anything else I could find The View of the BackOnly four of the ladies took part & here are our different versions aboveThe mannequins are originally made to be pincushions but I think they would be equally as nice used as brooch holders or jewellery stands. - Not sure how that next photo sneaked in there sorry friends -While Sid slept yesterday I quietly cleaned out a sewing room drawer. I came across this old tissue box holder, unused for many years & due to the glue hardening the lace & ribbon came away easilyI used my hairdryer on each corner to soften the glue until I was able to lie the box shape out flat.I had a small piece of this gorgeous Tilda fabric \"rabbits & roses\" which I used to make a new cover for my tired old tissue box A few trims & lace & it now looks so pretty & useful again.Thank You all So Much for your visits today dear friends.Its Friday here & I am very much looking forward to the weekend as we have a 3 year old birthday to celebrate & 3 is Very Important Indeed!! With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "My New (Old) Chair ........................ & Friendships ............................", "date": "Sunday, May 6, 2018", "text": "Sunday Greetings dearest friends & readers,My friend Sally must surely be one of the luckiest Thrift Shoppers I know!She just seems to have the knack of being in the right spot at the right time - & scores the bargains!Sal managed to purchase two vintage slipper chairs with Sanderson Linen covers at our local Hospice Shop a couple of weeks ago, in pristine condition!When she sent me a photo of her new acquisitions I cheekily told her that should she ever wish to \"move one of them on sometime\" then I would be happy to assist!As luck would have it, Sally decided one WAS superfluous to requirements & I was able to purchase it from her.I adore my new-to-me chair & although it was destined for my bedroom, it has yet to make it past the lounge!I just have One small rather large problem with my new slipper chair . . . . .It would seem that someone else adores it also ...... so much so in fact, that when he is Not sleeping on it, there is now a definate dent in the seat!The soy candle is Green Tea & Ginger fragranceApril & May are busy birthday months for me ...... I have 10 friends & family members celebrating birthdays.For my friend Donna, who loves upcycling & repurposing, I made this wool blanket coat hanger & soy candle in a vintage enamel dish.These have already arrived at their destination & were received with great delight!Though I think I could easily be in the running for \"world's slowest knitter\" I did manage to finish off another two cotton/bamboo dishcloths this weekend.These are destined for the present box & another one is now cast on my needles. On Friday afternoon I spent time in my kitchen making chocolate truffles.My friend Sandy had invited me to a \"Pink Ribbon Morning Tea\" at her home the following morning.Sandy had decided it would be a nice idea for a group of friends to get together to celebrate the Journey back to wellness of our dear friend Pam, who has battled cancer not once but twice now.I thought it was such a wonderful idea.On the Saturday morning I loaded up my car with flowers from The Hummingbird - I had asked Sally to make up a couple of posies for both Sandy & Pam with some touches of pink.The scented stocks that Sally popped in the posies smelt just gorgeous!Everything that my friend Sandy turns her hand to is done with such love & attention to detail & I knew her table setting would not disappoint.  There was very much a pink theme & we dined on club sandwiches, savouries & pink cupcakes - all homemade by Sandy. We drank elderflower wine & coffee & chatted away until suddenly we realised ........... it was 2 pm !!Some flowers in Sandys dining roomAs I drove the half hour home, I reflected on how lucky I was to be able to do something like this & spend time with girlfriends.On my last visit to Mum's I purchased this wooden plaque in a Paint Shop ... I loved the saying but of course once I got it home, I had to embellish it!!!I tizzied it up with a Tilda fabric bunting & a small crochet flower.The nights are colder now & its time to make blanket nests on the couch!!These two above popped in to my mind when I purchased it!To use up some of the feijoas I gathered last weekend, I made a Feijoa & Coconut Cake this morning.I love making this recipe when the feijoas are in season.Well dear friends, I hope the coming week is good & kind to all of us & that May is a good month for youThanks so very much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "These Autumn Days .........................................", "date": "Sunday, April 29, 2018", "text": "Greetings dearest friends & readersThese autumn days seem to just pass by in a blur of activityThere has been lots of gathering & harvesting going on here at Threadbear Last week I picked my pumpkins, the last of my tomatoes as well as a basket full of walnuts - there have been two more baskets collected since this photoThis bag full of feijoas was gathered while visiting my grandson Alec - I hope to stew most of these for the freezerI picked the last of my hydrangeas this week before they turn brown for winter - I give them a good drink in a bucket of water for about a week, then hang them to dryI just adore their muted vintagey colours.To satisfy my (endless) sweet tooth, I baked a tray of Citrus slice as well as The Mr's favourite - Weetbix sliceYesterday the winds blew & the rains came down! Just prior to this I noticed the last of my roses still in bloom so I picked the remaining flowers to enjoy indoors.Last Wednesday was Anzac Day & I thought of my dear Dad, gone 17 years now.Dad served in both the Army & the Air Force as a young man, getting his oldest sister to send a telegram confirming his date of birth but Dad falsely gave a year earlier so he actually joined at just 17, instead of the 18 legally required. I always light a candle for Dad on Anzac Day.My daughter in law Sarah & I took Alec over to the City & caught the end of the Parade, then we visited the Cenotaph to see the wreaths laid for the fallen soldiers.It is always such a poignant sight.This delightful Children's Park is right next door so we spent some time in there with Alec & had a picnic morning tea.Though he started off fully clothed, it wasn't long before the outer wear came off & in the water he went!Then on Thursday I took Sid out to the farm to see the autumn calves ... he has learnt to say \"Mooooo\"Though there has been very little creativity going on, I did manage one completion.I think it's fair to say that when my friend Sally gave me this vintage needlepoint to make into a cushion for her, my heart skipped several beats! Though the edges were very frail, the needlepoint itself was in immaculate condition.I knew I had THE perfect piece of vintage black wool fabric in my stash to back it with. It took a HuGe amount of stuffing to get it nice & tight .... I shall be sad to hand it back to Sally 😢Thanks so much for stopping by today dear readers,I have the heater on & am off to make a cuppa .... these two are tucked up in their rightful positions for the evening! It feels like it's going to get chilly!Have a wonderful week dear friends,With much love & friendship to you ALLJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Men's Ties, Sphagnum Moss & Twine !!", "date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2018", "text": "Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersOur little craft group met up again on Monday at Sharlaine's HomeAt our last meeting Gail tipped out a bag of men's silk ties onto the table & we were all to choose one, create something with it, & bring it to our next meeting.I chose the Christmas Tie below .  .  .Upon arriving home .... I did wonder what on earth possessed me to choose this one !!I thought I might try to make a small size Christmas bag from it so I unpicked the tie & tried to frame it somewhat using matching fabrics that I already had in my stash I think its fair to say that at this stage above, I still really had no idea what I was doing .... but I wanted to use the point of the tie as the bottom of my bag.I used some co-ordinating fabrics to patchwork a back for the bag & then quilted this.  I used the plain dark blue end of the tie as a handle - the bag is fully lined with calicoIn the end I was pleased with how it came together ...... I attached a cute Nikki Tervo ceramic button that said \"I 💝Xmas\"I thought this was an ideal size to use for a Christmas Gift Bag I attached a tin bell to the very bottom point The ladies had all made quite different items from their Ties ... Liz had made a turtle as her tie had tiny turtles printed all over the silk, Gail had made a cute Winnie the Pooh bunting & bear from hers, Joyce had fashioned a silk flower brooch & Sharlaine had framed hers in a hoopSome of the ladies (excluding yours truly) had made some more velvet pumpkins following on from  our last get togetherI thought they were all really beautiful but I just LoVeD Sharlaine's sewing themed pumpkin below !!For our meeting on Monday we had decided to have a go at Kokedama Kokedama is a style of Japanese bonsai, where a plant's root system is simply wrapped in sphagnum moss and bound with string, transforming it into a sculptural art form. Loosely translated, 'koke' means moss and 'dama' means ball.Mar 27, 2014Sharlaine had tried this before but none of us other ladies had.I have to say, I really really enjoyed it & shall definately be making more! As we all used differing thicknesses of twine the end results were all quite different but effective! These are our first attempts above & this is my own little cutie below .... I am hoping to make a simple string hanger for it as they look wonderful suspended.I had a good trip down to Mum's to celebrate her 89th birthday & then the following day I took her to the crematorium where my Dad's ashes are scattered in the Garden of RemembranceMum & I take either silk or fresh flowers each time & it is wonderful to see the plaque & flowers are left untouched each visit.Upon my return I had some surprise mail arrive from * here *I found Alice Caroline fabrics on Instagram & fell in love with their gorgeous Liberty selection so I ordered some fat 1/4's I have had this pattern below for many years quite some time now & hope to make Miss Maggie up with a Liberty print dress & ears.Though Taranaki was cold & stormy while there, I have certainly returned home to much lower temperatures.I don't want to light the fire just yet so am making do with the heater but it's pretty much \"first in, most warmest\" !!I purchased a couple of Op Shop treasures while away but will save those for another day as this is rather a photo heavy post.I shall leave you with this little collage I put together last week.I have Sid every Thursday & Miss Pippi has informed me she dislikes Thursdays! Though she Is allowed inside, she refuses to come in while Sid is here so this is what goes on all day long .... something of a Mexican Standoff!!A Mexican standoff is a confrontation amongst two or more parties in which no strategy exists that allows any party to achieve victory.WikipediaIncidently in the top photos she is sitting in my flowering window basket!!Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friends,I hope the rest of the week goes well for you allI shall try to get around & visit you all at your blogs as our internet has been rather contrary again!With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},

Though I already had the black bag on the left, the other two vintage embroidered purses were such wonderful finds .... $5 each which I was happy to pay, at my local Hospice shop.I now have the beginnings of a new collection of sorts !! I have long admired the groupings of frames that you see on pinterest & have pinned some to my pinterest boards .... I love the stark simplicity of them.When I helped my neighbour Leah with her garage sale last year I came away with some oddments of broken frames that she was going to toss out.These two below were in the Habitat for Humanity Op Shop last week - one was $7, one was $5 However they were both in the half price bin so I got the two for a mere $6. When I came home & removed the glass & backing from the silver rose frame, it was actually broken in 3 areas .... the arrows show where the cracks are.  I didn't notice the cracks before as the tightly fitted backing was holding it all togetherI quickly squeezed some glue into the cracks & hoped when I painted it I could disguise the joins I spent a couple of pleasant days painting the assortment of frames out on my decking table - they each got about 3 coats.I used chalk paint Vintage White, which can easily be applied to any surface, including the brassy metal framesWhen I proudly showed the Mr my display his words were \"well when are you going to put pictures in them then??\"I love my little frame display ...

On Tuesday (& Wednesday) I finished a dolly I had started about a year ago now.She is a Rosalie Dekker design ....  \"Linen Angel\"I dressed her in Tilda fabrics & fussy cut a piece of vintage linen to make her a little heart - the porcelain rose adorning the heart is off an old broken brooch.This wee Angel stands at just 25 cms tall & has wooden wings.I am so pleased I finally finished her.Each Thursday now I look after my youngest grandson Sid, for the day.He is such a delight & loves his marmite toast fingers eaten in Granny's kitchen.On Friday I got up early & drove to the other side of Hamilton city to attend a class at this delightful shop below I purchased my Janome sewing machine from this shop so I receive their online newsletters.When I saw a basic Learning to Quilt Class advertised I knew I wanted to attend.  When I rang to enrol I told the lady that I did not even know how to fit my machines walking foot!I just wanted her to be quite clear that I would be the class dummy! I really enjoyed the class but found it very intense.Above are my samples of the different techniques we learnt in class.My favourites are the two below .... flowers & fans .... I really enjoyed doing these as did the lovely lady sitting next to me. When the Class finished at 3 pm & I walked back to my car, I noticed a Salvation Army Op shop just across from where I parked so I wandered in to have a browse.This lovely glass pedestal stand was only $2 ... & even had the French Country Collection sticker still on it!I had an idea for this stand  .   .   .   . Though I purchased the cute wire cloche from The Hummingbird last year, I had never actually done anything with it!I was growing a sweet little baby's tears plant in this china sugar bowl & thought the cloche might just fit over the topAnd then the glass pedestal stand just gave it that little bit of height that it needed! Perfect ! Yesterday, Saturday, I was at the supermarket early purchasing goodies to make up some Gift Baskets for The Mr.He is President of our local Moto Cross Club & each year they hold their annual prizegiving event.They postponed their December event due to folks having so much on at that busy time of year, & re-scheduled it for today.  The Gift Baskets are for the ladies that help out at each event with sign on, lap scoring, flag marshalling etc ... they do an awesome job. You can see by my little collage above, that I had considerable trouble actually getting the goodies INTO the baskets themselves!Due to a certain ginger helper who decided by the time I took the last photo, to actually lay down & have a wee sleep in the darned basket!And Yes, I was tempted to toss some cellophane & ribbon around that particular basket & send it on its way!! Finally last night, with no 4-legged helpers around,  I got them all finished!Thanks so much for your visits today dear friends,I hope you find some creative time in the coming week for yourselves,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

The first year it bore no fruit, the 2nd year I picked 8 apples from it, the 3rd year I picked only 6!Last winter every time I tossed citrus food around my fruit trees I would toss a generous handful around the Apple Tree.This is the result . . . .As the branches were so laden I picked all of the fruit last week - I did not bother counting them all!I have been stewing & freezing apples galore - plus I took a large bag full down to our local Sharing ShedThough my veggie garden looks a sorry sight & I am ready to empty it before my winter planting, it is still producing steadily .... tomatoes, capsicums & even the odd cucumberI have been enjoying one of my all time favourite lunches, avocado, tomatoes & basil on toast with a generous dousing of black pepperAn old friend called in on her way north for a cuppa & a catch up.She came bearing 2 pieces of Citrus Slice purchased from a cafe on her journey .... it was Sooo delicious &, as is normal for me, in the days that followed, I became fixated on citrus slice! A quick google search & I managed to find a recipe that I felt closely resembled the one my friend had bought.As I had some windfall oranges & lemons I baked a tray of the slice, which was indeed delicious with that real burst of citrus.I used this recipe *here* if you would like to try it.My friend Gail fell in love with the chair planter I made for her sister JoyceShe had a small wrought iron stool similar to the chair I had used, so I offered to paint it green for her, along with a small corner table she had .... once again Resene Amulet.It is really enjoyable painting out on my deck area these early autumn days while the weather is no longer hot but still pleasant.I have been asked to teach again this winter at a Rural Woman Craft Day ... you can read about the craft I taught last year in this post hereMy instructions were to teach a handcraft that preferably could be made with no sewing machines, completed in approx 2 hours & something pleasant or appealing to \"ladies of the older generation\"I struggled to come up with ideas this year but some time spent browsing Pinterest helped me quite a bit I decided upon these handstitched felt mice which I will be making into kits for the ladiesTo stabilise them I filled the base with wheat, the top of their heads/facial area with wadding, but through the middle I filled them with dried lavender.Needless to say they smell rather lovely!   Jojo Moyes is most definately one of my favourite authors Ever.I especially loved her series Me Before You & the follow up, After You  I was beside myself with excitement when I read she had written Book 3 in the series, Still Me, with more of Lou's adventures.I can thoroughly recommend this book & once I had begun I could not put it down!Thanks so much for your visits today dear friends,I shall leave you with this photo of Blackie taken yesterday morning - I was late getting them their breakfast so he huffed off & caught his own!He is looking annoyed in the photo, probably because Miss Pippi is on the path just to the left of the photo, doing star jumps!!  No doubt thinking the rabbit is all hers!!Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends,Be good & kind to yourselves & to each other,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Baby Annie Golly, by Angels in DisguisePlus I already had the cheery red spot fabric that I thought would be perfectIn my sewing room I found this tiny teddy with a a stick up his jacksy - once I had removed the stick, he was perfect for a small toy to hold in Baby Annie's hand   She is such a sweet pattern this girl & always makes me smile I managed to finish the english paper pieced cushion that I wrote about in my last post I made a button closure for the back & gave it a rather large size cushion inner ...... I like my cushions to be really plump & tightly stuffedI felt deeply saddened when I read last month (on Instagram) of Rosalie Dekker's passing.  I had the immense pleasure of meeting Rosalie 7 years ago when my family paid for me to attend her stitching retreat at the base of Lake Taupo for my 50th birthday.I remembered last week that we had stitched a redwork stitchery on handkerchief linen at one of her classes, so I hunted mine out.Though it was complete I had never done anything with it. Rosalie had mounted hers on a canvas but I decided to make mine into a cushion (Yes another one!!) I stitched a flange style cushion & once again, stuffed it with an oversized inner.I remembered then that I had also completed a doll on my return from retreat ....a kit that came with our patterns to make a doll called PoppyPoppys dress was also made using handkerchief linen ...... I removed her clothes & gently handwashed them to give her a freshen upShe now completes the little vignette on my two seater couch & NO Pippi .... this is Not a perfect resting spot for you! One of the things I hoped to get to do this year was to attend the small crafty group that my friend Gail runs monthly ...... the numbers have dwindled to just 5 now & last year, I only managed to attend once.Last Monday Gail decided \"we\" would make velvet pumpkins ...... it was a very pleasant morning indeed & at the end of it, I snapped a quick pic of all our pumpkin efforts (Mine is the top left hand side one)Though my photo doesn't do it justice, the velvet is actually a deep rich burgundy colour.I love the feel of autumn in the air & took my morning tea out to the deck last Wednesday .... I had picked up my latest copy of Simply Vintage magazine as well as baked a Tan Finger SliceSmall treats but Oh So Very good for the soul !After a summer of running around chasing each other, much hissing, spitting & bits of fur in the air ...... these two have decided they are friends again & have begun tucking up together in the evenings - another sure sign there is autumn in the air! I love seeing them tucked up together - one part of each always has to be touching the other Though I often hear them running through the house about 4 in the morning (!!!), they generally will sleep like this for hours.Thanks so much for your visits today dearest friends,I hope the coming week is good & kind to you allWith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I find this is a great filler for the bags of citrus potpourri I make up & sellHere are the girls enjoying their fresh break of millet while I put up a new electric fenceMy photo above shows the seed heads on the plant & then the bunches that I hang to dry at homeThe covered area just outside my lounge is nice & dry with good air circulation & the bunches dry really well just hereMy dehydrator has been working overtime while I dry trays of oranges off our treesAlthough I am no longer selling my citrus potpourri in the Cottage I am supplying this lovely Farm Shop with itThe house smelt delicious this weekend while I bagged up another 20 bags to send over to them I took a large handful of the fresh mixture & filled the vintage scales that sit on my kitchen bench for a splash of colour Each New Year I begin knitting some new cotton dishcloths for the kitchen & take the older tatty ones as cleaning rags ... this is a tip I learnt from Rhonda's booksI enjoy the repetitiveness of the garter stitch at nights when my eyes are too tired to do anything more intricateI stitched a simple bookmark on linen to go with my friend Joyce's 70th birthday \"chair planter\"The pattern is an early design from Jenny's Stitchery Club ... I hope to stitch up some more bookmarks for my present box.I have been picking & drying this years statice .... usually this would be hung for sale in my Cottage but this year I get to keep it for myself !  I found an old wooden bucket in my sleepout to display the dried bunches in. It's always a \"lucky dip\" when I grow statice & this year I didn't get any yellow, but I was equally as happy with the colours that did grow Now if I can just keep Miss Pippi from re-arranging it all, then all will be well !! 😺Thanks so much for your visits today dear friendsI hope the coming week is good & kind to you all & that you find some creative time in amongst the busy-nessWith much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I honestly had no idea of what I was wanting to createAs I pondered this, I had some help from Miss pain in the Pippi .... who tried to help me with my placementWhen it became apparent I was still not-quite-sure she went & got Blackie to come & give his 2 cents worth !!!(Can you just get a teeny inkling of why it takes me so long to jolly well achieve anything around here friends) In between trying to decide my placement an idea occurred to me ...... why not have them spilling out of a large flower pot??!!I found a woolen offcut & vliesofixed & blanket stitched a flower pot base -  this gave me a good starting point I spent a couple of days happily hand stitching my flowers & leaves onto my cushion Then I stitched a button closure for the back using odd buttons from my stashMy sewing machine decided it did not wish to sew button holes that day & very nearly went sailing out the window !!!! (the machine that is, not the cushion !!)As I like my cushions to be stuffed really plumply I ordered an extra large size inner for it ... the cushion is a generous size measuring 48 cms square.I am thrilled with it & it sits comfortably alongside my barkcloth cushions on the dining room couchAnd Yes, I have just finished picking all the cat hairs out of the completed article!!! 😏 Still on the subject of flowers ... I planted this $5 Op Shop Vintage suitcase a couple of weeks ago ... it is to be a birthday gift for a friend next week ... I lined the case with a black rubbish bag prior to plantingI am hoping that by her birthday the flowers are spilling out merrily & putting on a lovely displayThough much has bolted to seed in my veggie garden this hot dry summer, I still have an abundance of tomatoes, cucumbers & courgettesThis was my mornings pick, along with 2 red capsicums that were readyFinally dear friends, my lillies are putting on a wonderful display around the far end of my house ... when I water in the early evening, their fragrance is heavenly Thanks so much for your visits today dear friends,I hope you are managing to stay warm or cool wherever you are in the world.With much love & friendship to you AllJulie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I used this recipe *here* It turned out lovely & moist, with a real hit of citrus - just the way I like it!Well dear friends  - it is a time for change in the wind !!After a great deal of consideration, to-ing & fro-ing & long talks with The Mr, I have made the decision to close my Craft Cottage. There are a number of factors contributing to this but I feel in my heart this decision is the right one.This would be my 15th year of running my little Cottage.I plan to have a half price sale for the month of February & then close the door.What I don't plan to do however - is stop creating!Creating & crafting is what I LoVe!  For the future I will look at possibly opening a small online etsy shop in which to sell my work.I will still keep blogging & life will continue much the same here at Threadbear ....................No doubt the antics of these two below will continue ....................

Next I decided to tackle the stitchery mini quilt I was lucky enough to receive several \"tea gifts\" for Christmas ... this one was a Harney tea & the flavour is \"Holiday spice\"I very much enjoy stitching Jenny's patterns Although my original intention had been to sew it up into a small wall hanging as per the pattern .... I came across this wooden boxed frame that my friend Sally had recently tossed my way  . . . .  so off on a tangent I went & changed my plans entirely I realised the stitchery panel would fit rather well in the frame. Luckily Sal had already chalk painted it so I re-attached the glass, then lightly sanded the frames edges to distress it My stitchery panel fitted perfectly inside I decided the frame now needed something to hang from the hooksSo once again ..... off on a tangent I go - & make a trio of hearts & a small felt sewing machine NoT in christmas colours this time !     However .... now it needed something to sit on the topIt was while I was browsing *this Tilda Book* over New Year that I came across the sewing machinesThats it !!!   I stitched up the small size machine in Tilda fabrics & fussy cut a piece of a vintage linen to sit under the needle  I took a small wooden spool, wrapped it in Tilda fabric & glued a felt ball to the top ... a mini pincushion to go with my sewing machine !!I think that tangent was rather worthwhile because I am thrilled with my little sewing vignette 😊(Photographing rather pinky/yellow for some reason?!)When Sally has her \"de-clutters\" she is definately the sort of friend you hope will keep you in mind!This vintage stitchery panel also got tossed my way -  I LoVed it ... I think it is stump work embroidery?Yesterday I trimmed & backed it with a pretty muted Tilda fabric, then stuffed it tightly & made up a small plump cushion to sit beneath a vase of last years dried hydrangeasI LoVe the colours & look forward to drying this years hydrangeas soon.We had a wonderful Christmas - well two actually as we had one with Alec two days before the 25th. We gave him a toy chainsaw for christmas - & little Sid loved his stocking but, as I fully understood, was far more interested in the wrapping paper than anything much else !!

{"title": "A Special Angel Doll for \"Bob\" .  .  .   & A Happy New Year !!!", "date": "Monday, January 1, 2018", "text": "Happy New Year to you all dear friends & readers !Welcome to a bright shiny New Year . . . . a New Year always reminds me of a fresh clean sheet of paper & a newly sharpened pencil . . . . maybe a chance to do some things a little differently this time around - perhaps make some subtle changes ? My lovely neighbour Jenny came to my Cottage just after the craft fair in early November.She had seen a primitive doll that had caught her eye & had an idea brewing around in her head.(This is the doll in the photo below with the arrow pointing to her)The pattern is by Sun Valley Primitives & is called \"Raggedy Angel.\"Jenny's stepdaughter Emily lives in Australia & owns a vintage caravan which she has fitted out as a mobile hair & beauty salonEmily has named her caravan Bob ... which stands for \"Beauty On Board\"Jenny wanted me to make a Primitive Angel doll that Emily could hang in Bob She emailed me a couple of photos so I could get a feel for the style of the caravan & thanks to the wonders of facebook .... I was able to do some research on the interior aesthetics of it all.   Jenny had put a great deal of thought into this gift for Emily & was quite specific in her ideas.Her requests were for a doll the same size as Raggedy Angel, not painted striped legs but more stocking style with perhaps some painted flowers, a shorter dress not with a felt christmas tree stitched on but possibly flowers again, the same colour hair but tight curls (to match Emilys hair) & definately a raggedy style faceShe wanted the doll to have some things in her arms that could be interchanged for different seasons ... for example some berries/greenery at christmas time.After much research on the caravans interior, Jenny & I decided on a pale-ish green fabric to compliment the many plants that Emily has, & the fresh, clean, natural palette.I began by cutting out some wool felt flowers & blanket stitching them to the lower part of the dressI sewed some legs in a stripey fabric & then handpainted black boots onto the foot areaMiss Pippi oversaw this part of the construction !!!Rather than paint flowers on (as Jenny had suggested) I felt more confident hand sewing tiny lazy daisies around the stocking part of the legsAfter I had hemmed the dress I added a gathered black tulle petticoat to give it some extra dimension ............ & left the bottom of the petticoat just peeping out. Next came the challenge of the curly hair - thankfully I had some hand dyed Jute left over from the previous Prim Angel that I could use I found a great tutorial *here* about curling dolls hair, but instead of using just water as suggested ... I used a PVA/water mixture as I was concerned about the curls dropping Winding the strands around knitting needles & waiting to dry was a labour intensive project but gave me exactly the look I was after  -  tight bouncy curls, just like Emily's hair Next came the issue of what to sit in her arms?I was able to click/save the image of her logo & print it off onto some calico with freezer paper ironed to the back I cut out a raw linen heart & blanket stitched the Bob logo to my heart shapeAfter I stuffed the heart I found (online) some miniature comb & scissor charms which I stitched to the top, then attached the heart to the dolls hands Thankfully I had one set left of the corrugated iron wings I use for this Angel - although these are detachable, I think they definately finish her off - anything smaller would look quite lostThis is how she looked without any embellishments I had fun playing around with some bits & bobs to tuck into her arms behind the heart ... chalkboard signs, small silver nail scissors, some christmas berries & greenery, rusty stars etc ... all removable This is how she looked with all her added bits &piecesI must confess I felt quite nervous about Emily receiving her .... dolls are such a personal thing & you tend to either love or hate them, there is seldom any real middle ground.So I was relieved on Christmas Day to receive a gorgeous text photo from Jenny of Emily holding her doll, smiling & giving the thumbs up, & a message to say \"she adored her & can't wait to get her home to hang her up in Bob\" May the year ahead be a good & kind one to all of you dear friends & may you find some time in all the busy-ness of your days to take care of yourselvesThanks So Very Much for your visits here today,With much love & friendship to you All,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

Though it is not really showing up, the gold fabric I used for his name has little silver stars dotted over it.Sid's stocking is now filled with his Christmas gifts & sitting under the tree ... only 3 more sleeps !!Each month when I do my big grocery shop, I always buy an extra bag of cat biscuits & drop into our local Animal Care Shop on my way home.I try really hard to just drop the biscuits off & not look at any stock as the Shop is also an Op Shop !This week my willpower failed me as I spotted at the door, a box of silver oddments - all $4 each.This little silver bucket dish above came home with me ... a rag, some Silvo & some elbow grease ... & it came out sparklingFilled up with some dried rose buds, I LoVe it !!My daughter in law Nicole is one Very Talented person.Everything she creates is made to perfection with such detail.She decided she would like some artwork for Sid's room so she set about stitching the lyrics from a song she loved The Song is Agostina by PuciferEach individual felt letter handstitched on to calico, & then framedAs you can see ....

Christine wanted it as near as possible to the previous one so thankfully, I had enough of the dark red fleece left overMy favourite part of making these little guys .... making & filling the Santa sacks !!! 😊💛I enjoy fossicking through my crafty bits & bobs to find an assortment of stocking fillersI have made so many Christmas decorations for Chris now that I always feel confident she will love what I come up with.Her 2nd request was for some miniature Santa hats in particular colourways (white/black trim .... cream/fawn trim) to adorn a collection of miniature teddies AND .  .  .  .an assortment of candy canes & Santa sacks to tuck into the hands of a bear collection that she uses in her christmas decorating Chris has tried using other \"themes\" in her christmas decor but always seems to come back to the country style.It is interesting that I took the above photo because when Chris came to collect her order there was One white Hat Missing !!!  To this date, it has NoT been found & I sewed up another one yesterday ..... but I think it fair to add that a certain ginger 4-legged being was looking decidedly guilty !!!!!And I imagine when Christmas is Over ... I just might find it tucked away somewhere !!! I spent a pleasant evening painting calico candy canes at my dining table - I like to mask the stripes first as I seem to make a right mess of them if I don't !!I think these turned out so sweet, I am hoping to make more of them next Christmas to sell as tree decorations.Maureen asked me if I could make her a pair of oven mitts in Kiwiana fabrics, preferably blues & greens please.I knew I had some pukeko fabric left & luckily had just enough to make her a set - I used heat resistent wadding on the insides.Maureen was delighted when she collected them ...... but I think it would be fair to say - with the hours they took me to make - I never wish to make another set again !!!There has been a bit of Christmas decorating going on here at ThreadbearThe Mr & I put the tree up last weekend & I decorated itThis year - instead of putting the fairy up on top of the tree .... we decided to leave her underneath !!!! Each Christmas I buy myself one new special decoration - just something small & inexpensive to add to my collection.This sweet little tin Angel came home with me from The Hummingbird last week when I went there for coffee with a dear friend who was staying. She sits on my egg box in the kitchen, watches over me & makes me smile !! Lastly dear friends, I just wanted to share these 2 photos of my delightful grandsons ......I LoVe 💝 this one of Alec decorating the Christmas tree & think it would look perfect on a card . . . . Last week I looked after beautiful Sid while his parents attended a funeral .... he loves to sit in my kitchen enjoying a gingernut biscuit .... I call him the gingernut kid !!Thanks So very much for staying with me through this lengthy post.I hope the lead up to Christmas is going well for you all.Remember to be kind to yourselves & to each other,With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Catch-Up Post", "date": "Friday, December 1, 2017", "text": "Friday Greetings dear friends & readers, The Mr asks me every morning what are my plans for the day .... this morning was no different.\"I hope to finish up a couple of orders & then I am going to do a blog post before the month ends\" I said \"Well I hate to burst your bubble\" he replied \"but today IS the 1st of December\"No!!  Surely Not!! Where on earth did November disappear to ??  The past almost-three-weeks have gone in the blink of an eye !!Mum came up for her sister's funeral along with my brother & his wife - Mum stayed on a few extra days to catch up with grandsons & great grandsons .  .  .  .Mum with her great-grandson Alec Mum with her great grandson Sid.  .  .  .  & then I took her home again & stayed on for a few days. Although we were only 10 days out from the official first week of summer - there was snow on Mt Taranaki & I was glad I tossed in a pair of sweatpants to take with me.My sister-in-law bought a chair squab up with her & asked me to cover it in anything blue please Miss Pippi very kindly assisted me by falling asleep on it to give it a good press & save me the bother of having to iron the fabric !!There have been several Orders crossed off on my list but still more are appearing ....  My sister in law has 2 young friends having babies & asked me for a pink & a blue wool blanket softie to gift to them  I embroider their faces so there is nothing chewable on them & they are fully machine washable These felt mice in stockings were for an order to be sent to the U.K. before the overseas post closed at the end of November.I took them to Mums & managed to finish them - they are 100% handstitched, & I am now working on another 6 for the Cottage. My friend Pru was cleaning out a cupboard & found this piece of raw silk that she had done some silk ribbon embroidery on many years ago ... she asked if I could make it into something to gift to her daughters in law I was able to stitch up a decent size lavender bag for each girl & fill it with my homegrown lavender.Last December Carol inquired whether I could make her a Santa the same as her niece had bought from me. The pattern is called Prim Olde Santa & is a design by Kerry Daly of Primitive Country Treasures Unfortunately, as it was mid December, I simply ran out of time but I remembered about her request & rang recently to inquire if she would still like one?He is a beautiful Santa & one of my all-time favourites - I just love every single thing about him & even though he is alot of work, next year I hope to actually make one for myself !! I was pleased to be able to give it to Carol early so she could enjoy him for the whole of the festive season.When my neighbour Leah gifted me all the junk treasures left over from her Garage Sale a plastic bag of candles was in amongst it all.I wanted to do something with the candles as they were still in new condition. I found some old music pages in my sleepout & wrapped this around them, then added some cotton lace to each set. I tucked a vintage image into each candle bundle, then tied them up securely with some cream tulle, lace & pearl trimI had a customer yesterday say to me \"these are just gorgeous .... what do you do with them ??!!  So I told her .................... you sit them there & they look pretty & you enjoy them! 😉 Or you can burn them ...... or you could gift them !! Lastly dear friends, I have recently joined Instagram.A couple of  local makers & myself are having a little giveaway which will be drawn this Sunday eveningThe prize consists of a Christmas top, a NZ print & my felt mice - all handmade by local artists. This is entirely free to enter so just pop along to the link *here* if you would like a chance to go in the draw.Thanks So Much for staying with me through this lengthy catch up post.I wish you all a great weekend ahead & hope it is filled with special moments,With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Teddy Bears & Craft Fairs .............................", "date": "Monday, November 13, 2017", "text": "Monday Greetings dear friends & readersExactly a week ago I tidied up my sewing room & covered up my machine ... I decided I wasn't going to make any more stock for my Christmas Craft stallRight after making that decision I noticed an old box way up high on the top shelf An inspection inside the box revealed two vintage bears - given to me by my friend Gail a Very Long time ago as she no longer wanted them .... they had been part of a collection of handmade vintage bears she used to stock in her Gift Shop many years agoI studied this one for awhile & decided I might be able to do something christmassy with \"him\" perhaps??To begin I made him some pants, then a coat & matching Santa hat using some deep red coloured fleece I already had in stockThe wadding style fabric I used to trim his coat & pants was white but a quick dunk in parisian essence soon turned it the nice vintagey cream shade I was hoping forNext I made him a bag using a panel of lovely Santa fabric I had in my stash - I sewed the bag to his handsIt was at this point that I realised he was probably going to be a \"hanging Santa bear\" to get the full effect of his Santa sack which I planned to fill with goodiesI gathered some goodies to put in the bagIf you were ever to pop in to visit me unexpectedly,  this is what you might find on my dining table ... I decided the wooden golly needed some hair & the merry christmas sign needed to be attached to a black stick !Painting the golly hair with PVA glue so it sits upright !!!I like my Santa Sacks to be stuffed really fullI was thrilled with how \"he\" turned out .... but thought he looked lonely, so I decided to make the other vintage bear (pictured below) into a \"Mrs Santa's helper\" !!I sewed her a dress using the same deep red fleece & tea dyed more wadding for her trimsI have NO idea what Miss Pippi was doing here but I think its safe to say, she was Not checking my sewing !!!I found part of a broken felt christmas swag which just seemed to sit perfectly in her hands .  .  .  .Isn't it a GOOD thing I keep all these old junk broken bits & bobs for use \"one day\" !!??.  .  .  . & then a sweet Boyds Bear brooch at her neck - I gave her a bow in the same fabric as \"his\" pantsDon't they make a great couple ???(& they were my very first sale at the craft fair on Saturday)The Christmas Craft Fair was a great success in that the rain stayed away & the crowds came out to shop.Unfortunately the wind was so strong I witnessed a couple of gazebos get blown over!It made it impossible to do any nice displays & instead I just plonked my work down & hoped for the best!!A great deal of the day was spent retrieving things that blew to the ground!!I have borrowed the photo below from the i-site website ... you can click *here* for more photos from the dayMy stall is the blue gazebo right by the arrowMy neighbour was the same as last years fair - my friend Julie from Bo and CoYesterday was spent sorting & tidying & repacking the CottageTo be honest, today I feel more shattered than I did yesterday!!I have family arriving to stay for a funeral in the Bay of Plenty later in the week & a house that currently resembles a bomb site!!!And these two below .  .  .  . are no help whatsoever !!Resting up after a busy weekend of .  .  .  .  .   resting up !!! 😻Thanks So Very Much for your visits today dear friends,I hope the coming week is filled with good things & great moments,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Country Friends Angel & A Bowl of Gingers   ..........................................................", "date": "Saturday, November 4, 2017", "text": "Greetings dearest friends & folkWelcome to another bright shiny new monthExactly one week to go now until my local Christmas Craft Fair If you are in the area on the day, do pop by & say Hello ... I am site No 76Lets hope for some fine weather for the day Please ..................... !!!!This Country Friends Angel doll started her life quite sometime agoI think it would be fair to say we are talking years here, rather than months !! Like many things here at Threadbear, she sat as a half completed dolly, wearing a pale blue floral skirt in the \"one day pile\"(The pattern is called \"Christmas Angel\" & is an old design by Wendy Briggs of Country Friends)When I came across her again I decided she should indeed be a Christmas Angel & so removed her blue skirt & made her one in christmas fabric instead ... bright red poinsettia fabric !The original pale blue skirtThough I have forgotten to take any photos as I progressed, I completed her but still felt something was missing ??Perhaps she needed to be framed ??I found an old \"welcome\" picture frame in my sleepout, removed the centre & then, with The Mr's help, stapled chicken mesh to the back of the frame ... she might look okay in this I thought Yes she fitted perfectly but still .... something was missing .... I sewed a rusty star wreath to her hands then wound some berries around the wreath & hung a wooden folk art christmas decoration from itI glued an old key to the frame & then I decided to add the christmas berry swag .... I think this just gave her that extra festive christmas zing somehow ....I am thinking of including the blue skirt with her ... that way the red skirt, the wreath & the berry swag could be removed & she could stay out all year round in her frame wearing the blue skirt.What do you think dear friends - would you do this ??? (The berry swag is wired to the frame .... so easily removed if necessary)Another item in the \"one day pile\" was this plastic bag full of gingerbread men/women christmas decorations. These had been purchased many years ago when I worked at the Gift Shop & would've been bought in the New Year sale when all the christmas stock was down to half price I just loved their happy, smiley faces & had always planned to make up a small \"gingerbread collection\"A friend had given me a cream porcelain bowl with a chip in the rim & I had put it aside for this very idea .... Using Cottage Garden thread \"waratah\"  I stitched a small primitive pillow which I filled with crushed walnut shells I made some primitive candy canes & a calico gingerbread man shape which I painted with a strong coffee mixture ... he smelt delicious ... I coated him in a pva/water mix to stiffen him All my bits & bobs fitted perfectly in my (chipped) bowl & I added some greenery, berries & a bundle of cinnamon sticksI didn't have any gingerbread smelling oil so instead I sprinkled everything liberally with cinnamon oil Lean in real close to your screens & take a big sniff !!To say it smells divine would be an understatement !! 😊A long time customer phoned to ask me if I would be at the craft fair this year & if so, would I have any golly teatowels for sale??I realised I had not one single teatowel left in the Cottage so this week I managed to applique 6 golly teatowels & 6 angel onesThese items usually sell well for Christmas giftsA small Christmas display created in the Cottage mid week I was lucky enough yesterday to spend some time with my delightful grandson Alec ... ... who was so proud of the very colourful \"worm\" he created at daycare!!Alec is now 2 1/2 & is talking very well - even his Granny can understand him now !!

{"title": "A Revamped Santa Bear .... & a Junk Journal", "date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2017", "text": "Good Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersSometime late last year my friend Gail was having one of her throw outs declutters Bearing in mind my \"Steptoe inclinations\" ... I happened to drop by to assist her !! I rescued this funny looking chap above from Gails rubbish heap & bought him home with me. He had begun his life as a teddy bear plastic bag holder & then my friend Gail had turned him into a doorstop, which she then dressed as a Wizard in this blue & purple sparkly cloak.I think he even had a wand at some stage! Once undressed I gave him a gentle sponge & brushed his fur - he came up really well & has the loveliest faceEven Miss Pippi was none to sure about him but she was being very nosey brave !Using the Wizards cloak as a guide, I sewed him a new cloak from some burgundy fleece I had & trimmed it with some cream furI made him a Santa hat with a cream pompom on the end.He was coming to life again !!Next I made him a beautiful vintagey looking Christmas stocking using some fabrics left over from last christmas & filled the base of it with waddingI sewed this to his hands as I planned to fill the top of the stocking with toys, bears & gorgeous goodies However  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  . just the weight of the stocking alone was enough to make him topple forward, let alone when it was filled with goodies !!!No matter what I did he kept ending up face down !!!In disgust I took him to bits again.I went down to the corner of our road (after hours!) & half filled my bucket with some new fine gravel that had just been loaded thereBack home again, I removed the lower part of his body stuffing & filled it with the fine gravel inside a bag, then packed the rest of him with more stuffing His figure kind of resembled mine some days !!But he stayed good & upright (& heavy) This Santa Teddy will be going on my craft stall at the Christmas Fair next monthHere he is completed, with his stocking filled to the brim ... some small teddies & vintage christmas ornies, some berries & greenery & some ornies tied to the stocking as wellA gorgeous Boyds Bear Christmas brooch at his neck ....When I asked The Mr if he was most impressed with the way I made him more sturdy ... he just gave me a long look & said \"don't forget to add a note with him to say that when they no longer want him, they can take all the gravel out & use it to resurface their driveway !!!\"Indeed !!!  😯We had some lovely sunny spring days last week & I was able to take my sewing outside to the deck table ... I had been making up some more little christmas tree ornaments with cinnamon stick trunksI made another dozen - these are fun to make using up scraps of fabric & they sold really well last yearI just need to scent this batch with my cinnamon/clove oils.When I wrote the post about my (new) vintage Edith Holden book  my friend Chris from Australia left me a lovely comment saying she would like to show me what she does with Edith Holden books I was most fascinated !!I waited patiently for Chris's email to come through showing me the photos of her workImagine my surprise when instead a parcel arrived all the way from Victoria, Australia - beautifully wrapped in a doiley & polka dot ribbon.Inside was this beautiful journal handmade by Chris using a vintage Edith Holden book Chris had covered the Journal in a teddy bear stitchery & the theme was teddies & gardeningChris had written a lovely letter explaining to me about junk journals, which I had not heard of before.My photos really do not do justice to this gorgeous journal - there is so much detail that everytime I open it, I find something new !!Tags, charms & embellishments everywhere ....I have it sitting by my lounge chair & I enjoy picking it up each evening & just savouring the pagesThank you So Very Much Chris for your kindness & your generosity... it is something I will treasure always 💓Finally dear friends, I wanted to mention a book I have just finished reading from my local LibraryI love it when other bloggers recommend books they have enjoyed & often make a note to read them.  I saw the DVD of this & then read the book & I just LoVed it from beginning to end! It is an amazing story & I would thoroughly recommend it.  Thank you So Very Much for your visits here today,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Revamping Raggedies", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2017", "text": "Happy Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersLast week while reaching way up into the top of the spare room wardrobe for a lightweight blanket for Sid's cot, this pair of Raggedy Anne & Andy dolls fell down on my head .  .  . As I hastily tossed everything back up there, I suddenly glanced at the raggedy dolls - \"ah yes .... I remember you\" I thought ....I think I could do something with you two 💕 ....That is their strips of fabric hair shown lying beside each one !!I had originally purchased the dolls through the Gift Shop where I previously worked.  I enjoyed them for many years but when they began to fade, they were put away out of sight in the \"one day pile\"The worst part of the fading was their raggedy hair which had faded to pink in some places - I managed to remove this easily enough & then gave their faces a spray with parisian essence to give them some colour back again Each dolly was given a gentle sponge bath & when dry received new chunky wool hair ....Even this alone brightened them up SO much !!!I decided to tackle Raggedy Andy first ....I made him a primitive looking Santa sack & stitched this to his hands .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  then proceeded to fill the sack with all sorts of goodies .... a teddy, a gingerbread man, cinnamon sticks, greenery & pip berries & some primitive looking candy canes which I striped with my burgundy fabric paint While I had the burgundy paint out, their wooden bases got touched up a little ....I also made him a Santa hat - keeping to the muted country colour scheme - & stitched a rusty bell to the end I love embellishing & adding rusty stars & bells to things ... I often have to stop myself getting rather carried away & overdoing it !!Next came Raggedy Anne . . . .I loaded her arms up with goodies .... a rag doll, a golly, a wooden heart, candy cane, berries etc & tied a big homespun bow in her hairI have decided to call my pair \"Santa's little helpers\" ... I think they will look wonderful on my stall along with my Snowmen & other christmassy crafts\" SANTA'S LITTLE HELPERS \"This Christmas Garland was another finish this week .... this pattern is called \"Celebrate Christmas Swag\" by Tracey North from \"I Luv Country\"   .  .  .   stitched in Cottage Garden thread \"mistletoe\"   I chose to blanket stitch mine onto dark red felt & attached a small rusty bell to the corner of each squareI used torn strips of dark green homespun to tie each square  together(not photographing very well today unfortunately) Last Christmas - among the gifts I gave my son Kayne & his wife for their soon-to-be-born Son - was this photo of Kayne taken at Cherry Island & wearing a smocked romper suit I had handmade for him, 32 years ago when I briefly attempted learnt to smock.Along with the photo I gifted them the romper suit as it was still in pristine condition !They sent me this photo just yesterday of my grandson Sid wearing the actual romper suit 💗Sid is currently experiencing his first holiday with his parents in Rarotonga & this was taken on the beach - he has the same serious expression his Daddy used to have !! And then this photo came through this morning ... there is no bath tub in the unit but not a problem ... he just gets bathed in the kitchen sink along with the dishes, & doesn't mind one single bit!!!Just delightful !!!

Dear Blackie .... with his ample proportions squeezed into the baskets !!  I planned to line the bottoms so I painted everywhere except the bases .  .  .As I was using a gorgeous Sanderson linen to line the oval basket I found a lovely wide vintage lace to compliment it.I knew it would \"flop\" when I inserted it in the basket inner, so I sat it on an old towel & sprayed it with cheap hairspray (which I keep on hand for just this reason) .... over the course of an hour, everytime I walked past the towel, I gave it another blast til it felt like it had enough body in it ....I was really happy with the end result & the lace sat perfectly upright in the basketThese are going for sale in my Cottage as workbaskets ... though the bottom one would also make a lovely waste paper basketI managed to stitch up another dozen wool blanket hearts filled with my homegrown lavender .  .  .  some of these have gone to a lovely Farm Shop that I supply with my handwork, along with a dozen bags of my citrus potpourriThis sweet Christmas Angel was another completion - the pattern is called \"Love Blooms in Christmas Hearts\" by The Chook Shed, & is out of a very old issue of Australian Patchwork & Stitching Magazine. (Vol 2 No 3)As I wanted my angel to be a decent size, I trotted along to my local photocopy centre where they increased the pattern by 200 % for me As she is unstuffed, she is a wall hanging Angel only .... I think they are called \"flat dolls\"The banner in the original pattern reads \"Love Blooms in Christmas Hearts\" but I changed my wording to \"Christmas Wishes\"I begun the stitchery for these stockings below while Mum was still with me.I used Cottage Garden thread \"Mistletoe\" which I was able to purchase online from my friend Kerryn's gorgeous shop The Country YardAgain a very old pattern by Melissa Duncan of Mogs DesignsLast month a beautiful surprise package arrived from my South Island friend Therle ..... gorgeous x-stitch, a lace pouch & beaded tassel .... all her own creativity.  The  pouch was stuffed with lavender scented wadding, still smells divine & looks perfect hanging on my Oak Dresser handle.Thank you SO much Therle for your thoughtfulness - your work is exquisite!A longtime customer Ruth, dropped by last week with a box of old fabrics & lace for me .... Ruth sometimes donates bits & bobs to me & anything I won't use I pass on to either the kindy up the road, or Alec's daycare centre.I was busy minding Sid at the time so just parked the box in the corner  I swear within the hour a certain little ginger being had taken up residence amongst the lace & fabrics ... thank you most kindly Ruth from Pippi for the \"new bed arrangement\"  !!And thank YOU dearest friends & readers for stopping by today,I hope the week is treating you all kindly,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

I do not know who the pattern is by so please let me know should you recognise it so I can give credit to the designerTheir woolen hats are from the sleeves of a 50c Op Shop Jumper!All the Snowmen are weighted in the base with a bag of fine gravel which I stole pinched borrowed acquired from the metal pit just down the road from me !!This fellow above & below is called Snowbells & is a pattern by Margaret Hart from an old copy of Homespun Magazine (Vol 6 No 4)These little fellows were the reason for Sue & I to visit The Christmas Heirloom Shop in my last post as I was wanting the artificial christmas greenery & berries to embellish my Snowmen.This particular one had snow already painted on it & was just perfect for Snowbells. My last fellow is called \"Chilly Willy\" & is a design by Mary Wright ... again out of an old Country Craft Magazine (Vol 13 No 3) When Mum was staying with me I spent quite a bit of time going through my old craft magazines looking for Christmas inspiration.I have altered this pattern somewhat from the original ... I haven't painted a snowman on his body, I have appliqued the jacket rather than embroidering it, I have given him a rusty tin bucket holding christmas berries & greenery, along with a wooden snowflake button on his scarfMost of all I LoVe the bird that has made a nest in his hat !!(& Yes, that IS a real birdsnest that I found fallen out of a tree last month) Here they are all lined up along my candle cupboard - all looking very festive indeed.These are all going for sale at my Christmas Craft Stall in mid November.In between the showers & the winds, I have managed to plant up some bike baskets with snapdragons, petunias & impatiens ... our grounds are covered at present with fallen cherry blossom petals that remind me of confetti.This time of year my little collection of baby's tears plants are coming along well down the end of my lounge ... I find the dappled light through the french doors is a great growing area for them Some vintage teapots received a doiley embellishment mod-podged onto them & a pot of babies tears ready for sale at the Cottage ............ & this sweet little china jug - gifted to me by my friend Joyce from the Church Op Shop.They were tossing it out due to a hairline crack inside but I thought it looked perfect with a dainty baby's tears growing in it.Well dear friends - I am off to work on more Christmas Crafts - & fill the wood basket!I hope the coming week is good & kind to you AllThank you all So much for your visits todaywith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

My veggie garden on the other hand, has been amazing with all the growth .... planting by my moon calendar along with copious amounts of worm tea have given me a bumper spring crop of so many different vegetablesLast Easter in the pouring rain, I remember planting 5 pots of bulbs - hyacinths & a variety of tulips  Nothing happened for a very long time & I began to despair but I have a riot of colour now that the tulip bulbs are in full bloom on my deckSome of these were old bulbs I lifted & gave fresh potting mix, & others were new bulbs I had been giftedBlogging friendships .........  Earlier this year I wrote about meeting up with Sue from the blog KiwikidsWe had a wonderful time together so when Sue wrote that she was coming over to put some help in place for her elderly Mum & would I like to meet up again, I jumped at the chance.We decided to meet up in Tirau, a good half way point & a pleasant spot to have some lunch together.I remembered there was a Christmas Heirloom Shop in Tirau so after a lovely lunch we wandered up the hill to browse in the store The Shop Owner took this photo of Sue & I amongst the trees !! Sue & I in the Christmas Heirloom Shop ..... I could've bought one of every thing !!!!!You can read Sue's post about our visit hereAbout 3 days after our get together an unexpected package arrived in the post.Imagine my surprise when I opened it to unfold this gorgeous play quilt that Sue had made for my grandson Sid !! It just so happened I was babysitting Sid at the time so he got to \"test drive\" the beautiful new quilt covered in gorgeous Boyds bears .... you can see by the photos how delighted Sid was !!!Thank You Sue for your kindness & this most wonderful gift.Another blogging friendship that I so enjoy is with my friend Willie He leaves wonderful comments on my posts & often sends through emails about the things he loves the most ..... cats, pink, family & lemon tea !!It was on Willie's recommendation that I purchased the following book ... I Could Pee on This!!  A humorous compilation of poems relating to cats & Yes indeed, I am sure Miss Pippi is featured in quite a few of them!! Willie has just celebrated a special birthday so I sent him this e-card featuring 2 of his favourite things, cats & pink !!I first saw a vintage copy of this next book at my friend Sally's house & fell in love with it ...

(shortcut)", "date": "Thursday, September 14, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Thursday to you all !!When I set up my little Craft Cottage 14 years ago it was done on such a \"shoe string\" budget !!In fact, it was more like a \"broken rubber band\" budget to tell the truth !!I needed a shop counter so my son's old desk was to serve the purpose until such time as I could afford a \"proper counter\" . . . . . .The desk got a speedy lick of paint (\"marzipan\") leftover from the cottage walls  ... & some stencils were hastily painted on the front.Fast forward 14 years later & that old desk was still in use & has never been upgraded !!It was looking tired & tatty -  rather like the shop owner!!!I had neither the time nor the energy to spend repainting it so I bought it inside & decided to cover the top with some oilcloth that I had rolled up in a cupboardFirst I glued a covering of thin wadding to the top of the desk to give it a slightly padded effectThe Mr helped me staple the oilcloth tightly to the topThen I ran a length of curtain wire along the top & made up a curtain using the green polka dot fabric I had leftover from making the baby bag for SidLuckily I had just enough fabric to make a nicely gathered curtainAfter 14 years of being behind the door, I have moved my counter so it is more on display nowI often make curtains up to quickly hide or disguise the backs of units that are facing outwards in my Cottage You can see below I have done the same with a small wooden shelf that faces end outwardsThough this fabric looks like Sanderson, it is actually an old thrifted duvet cover that resembles a Sanderson printAnd then the little apple box revamp that I showed you in my last post just sits perfectly on the end of my counter to use as a small shelf for the things I need to keep on handI hope plan to re-open my Cottage next week so I look forward to showing you some snaps in my next post as some of you have asked for photos of some displays in the Cottage.Frequently throughout the year I keep a large cardboard box on hand & randomly toss things into it as I clean, tidy & sort cupboards etc ...When the box is full I make a trip to the Op Shop to deliver it.I had tossed 2 tall red spotty coffee mugs & this small matching lidded dish into the box while Mum was with me.I had an idea the other night & retrieved the mugs & the dish back out of the box againI found 2 red teatowels in my stash & appliqued them with the words \"bake\" & \"cook\"Then made up a soy candle in the small round dish, scented with orange & clove fragranceThese few little items made up a lovely bright & cheery vignette in my Cottage Changing displays & coming up with fresh new ideas is constant & ongoing in the Cottage I like to start each new season with a fresh order of soaps in different fragrances ...... usually I take any leftover soaps for The Mr & I to use up, but these stragglers still smelt beautiful so I decided to run up some fabric bags to pop them into using my Tilda scrapsI thought they looked so attractive presented in their little fabric bags & they smell divine .  .  .  .I hope the week is treating you kindly dear readers & you are managing to keep warm or cool where ever in the world you might be?Our spring temperatures here have been so bitterly wet & cold that we ordered more firewood at the start of the week.It was the kind of day that made you want to just tuck up somewhere cosy & let the world pass you by . . ..  .  .   rather like a certain little fairy that I know !!!Thanks so much for your visits today Be kind to yourselves & to each otherwith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Five Small Projects .......................................", "date": "Wednesday, September 6, 2017", "text": "Good Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersFive small projects have been completed this past week at Threadbear Cottage .........................I mentioned in my last post that my neighbour Lea had gifted me a large pile of junk unsold items left over from her Garage SaleThis cute wooden \"what not\" & the tray below were two of the items .   .   .   .   ..   .   .   . as were the two oval frames below .  .  .  .After I had given them all a scrub & a warm up by the fire, I then gave each item 2 coats of pale duck egg chalk paint.When dry, I lightly distressed the edges of the \"what not\" & also gave it a good coating of waxI think it looks rather \"french country\"perhaps?In my scrapbooking bits & bobs I found this string of cute paper butterflies & circles which I modpodged onto the tray.The inner base of the tray was given 2 coats of modpodge to make it wipeable & then I thoroughly waxed the outer & underside The frames were also lightly sanded & then I mounted some wallpaper remnants left over from the  fifth project below ... This wallpaper is Cath Kidston, which I purchased last year from my dear friend Catherine's trademe store All these items above are going for sale in my little Cottage.The grubby old apple box above was pinched acquired from Mums shed on my last visit ... it too needed a really good scrub & a warm up by the fireLast week the sun made a brief appearance for a few hours so I was able to paint it outdoors while Miss Pippi slept on the table beside me.I only painted the inside edges as I planned to line it with some Cath Kidston wallpaper ..... the same wallpaper as I used in my nail box upcycle in this post here Miss Pippi very kindly warmed the interior of the box up for me before I lined it with the paper !! Miss Pippi's help is unfortunately - entirely non negotiable - in other words, she is there whether you want her to be or not !!! The finished apple box .... which is going in my Cottage as a free standing shelf ... I will show you in my next post.A longtime customer Paula, dropped out two of her childhood bears for repair while Mum was still with me .  .  . I am annoyed I forgot to take a before photo as they were indeed a sorry sight .... no eyes or noses, one was arm less & many holes & tears in them both!Here they sit waiting for Paula to collect them & take them home.My friend Sally arrived for a cuppa last week & presented me with this cute little box of goodies \"Happy Belated Birthday\" Sally announced !!Beautifully wrapped inside was one of Sally's handmade dreamcatchers, which I just adored along with two vintage pomanders to add to my collection I remembered about the vintage tray I had purchased on special from Ethel Anne's so I gave it a polish with some Brasso & sat my collection of china pomanders on it .  .  .    *** Just simply perfect *** Though it is now spring here in our hemisphere, the weather is telling us this is not quite so just yet !!!I hope the week is treating you kindly - thank you so very much for your visits today dear friends with much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Good Neighbours, Mums & Op Shop Treasures", "date": "Wednesday, August 23, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers Just trying to squeeze in a post before we wave Goodbye to August . . . I did not mean to be gone for so long !!!After 16 years of living across the road from me in our rural community, my neighbour is moving to town.Lea has been a good neighbour ... the kind that is always there if you need them but doesn't live on your doorstep.Immediately after selling her property, she left on a trip to her homeland of Holland ... she issued an urgent plea for some kiwiana teatowels to take with her as host gifts Luckily I had a good stash of brightly coloured teatowels & was able to embellish some for her ... I do love the kiwiana fabrics, especially the native bird ones.Wrapped in cellophane with some ribbon embellishment, these were ideal as they sat flat in the bottom of her suitcase.Lea held a Garage Sale two weeks before moving & I was able to lend her a bit of a hand in setting it all up.She presented me with a stash of unsold junk treasures when it was all over ... these two items below were some of the treasures ...Lea had made this ceramic casserole dish herself many years ago at a night school classI decided to plant it with some small succulents I had in my garden .  .  .In the $2 shop I found tiny wooden mushrooms which I hot glued onto some wooden skewers .... I felt they complimented the mushroom themeLea was going to toss this wooden frame with no glass or back - but I grabbed it instead !!I removed the wire, painted it pale duck egg & then lightly sanded the edgesI screwed a tiny hook inside the frame & added a $2 shop glass tealight holderI found a scrap of white vintage lace which I dunked in my cold cup of tea !!! Then I popped some dried lavender & a scrapbooking butterfly into the jar . . .These two items are going for sale in my Cottage(if I ever manage to get it open again that is !!!!)A surprise package arrived in the mail from Kiwikid Sue - gorgeous doilies & thread - totally unexpected & SO delightful !!Mum .  .  . After Mum had been living with us for a few weeks & she begun getting good food, rest, love, care & the right medication, her health began to improve dramatically.This improvement in her health, naturally bought with it her desire to return home again.Mum has lived in the family home for 55 years, it was her greatest wish to return there to live.I began to make inquiries with the appropriate agencies to see if I could implement this for MumThe short version of a very long saga is that I have taken Mum home again.I stayed with her for a week to ensure that all the help I had organised was put in placeAlthough I came up against some strong opposition within my family, I feel in my heart I have done the right thingA small highlight of my week down at Mums came about when I took her for a hair appointmentKnowing I would have a 1 1/2 hour window of time available I contacted my friend Carolyn who travelled down to meet up with meI gave her the choice of us going for a coffee or a meander around the Op Shops . . . thankfully she chose the Op Shops !!!This little outing with a friend was such a bright spot in what was definately a difficult week . . .These items above were some of the treasures I found on our jaunt -the small glasses to use for candlemaking were just 4 for 50c.The tablecloth above was definately my bargain of the day! Huge in size, handmade with dresdens appliqued onto it, in immaculate condition .  .  . & all for the princely sum of $2.50 at the S.P.C.A shop !!My last bargain to share with you (again at the S.P.C.A shop) was this bag of teeny tiny hexies ... someone had lovingly handstitched all these tiny hexies - 26 of them.This find made Carolyn & I stop in our tracks & have a bit of a discussion about whether or not our handcraft stash might very well end up someday in an Op Shop ??!! Doesn't bear thinking about !!!Finally friends, for those of you that asked for the hedgehog instructions in my last post .... as I am unable to get my scanner to work I have photographed it for you - just click on the picture & it will enlargeIf you wish to give your hedgehog some knitting as Miss Pink has in my photo below .  .  ..  .  . just cast 8 stitches onto a pair of small size needles, knit a small square until you are happy with the size, then slide the piece onto a pair of toothpicks to which you have glued a wooden bead to each end.No I do not attempt to knit the piece using the toothpicks!!Please don't hesitate to contact me should you have any difficulty with this pattern.Antique Pansies planted at Easter time happily flowering away on my deck.Have a lovely rest-of-the-week dear friends,Thanks so much for your visit today - I am slowly getting around to visiting you all at your blogs again !with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Teaching", "date": "Friday, July 28, 2017", "text": "End of Week Greetings dear friends & readers, Very early in the New Year a lovely lady (Jean) rang to ask if I would be interested in teaching a craft class?The class was to be part of a Rural Womens Institute Craft Day, held yearly in the middle of winter ...  the ladies would learn card making in the morning & I was to take the afternoon class.I jumped at the chance & said \"Yes - definately!!\"As she ended the call Jeans words to me were \"the class is months away yet so you have plenty of time to think what to teach\"Me - being me .... promptly forgot ALL about it !!!*!!!Just before I had to go down to Mums Jean rang & asked me if I could \"drop off my samples please\"\"Oh yes, nearly finished\" I lied repliedRummaging through my craft cupboard a large bag of dried teasel thistle heads fell down .... perfect !!I hadn't made teasel hedgehogs for about 17 years .... now might be a great time to give them another whirl !!I quickly ran up my samples using fabrics I had plenty of in my stash  I named them \"Miss Pink\" & \"Miss Lavender\"Last week, before my teaching day, I spent a rainy day working at the table with Mum & Miss Pippi's help, putting together my kitsets  As there were no sewing machines at the venue, I sewed the lace onto the bonnets before kitting them upWhen I was almost finished, Blackie & Pippi had a brief conference to make sure I had everything in order & meeting with their approval .  .  .Jean asked me to bring 13 - 15 kitsets in a mixture of both colourwaysMy kitsets all ready to goI also had to type up a pattern & instructions, & then fill my car up with all the paraphenalia we might need to complete our hedgehogs, pretty much including the \"kitchen sink\" !!The mornings class had made two cards & then each decorated a candle using hessian, bark & miniature cones ... the ladies work looked wonderfulI had originally put my name down for the morning class but decided to pull out when Mum came to live here as I felt the entire day was too long to leave her on her own.The day was stormy & wintery so several of the ladies didn't turn up & I only ended up teaching 9 ... what fun, delightful ladies they all were too.Though I forgot to snap pictures while they were all working on their hedgehogs, I did remember to get a photo at the end ... 5 Miss Pinks & 4 Miss LavendersI took along my lavender & cottage rose oils & the ladies got to scent their bonnets at the end ... the classroom smelt rather heavenly.Let me know if you would like the pattern for this little sweetheart & I can scan & copy it, & add it to my next post?On an earlier visit to Mums - last March in fact - I brought home a large cardboard box filled with all Mums knitting wools & oddmentsMum can no longer knit due to her macular degeneration so she asked me to give the wool away for her.I decided to gift it to my friend Joyce for her crocheting & then Joyce could pass on any unwanted wool to the Church Op Shop where she works.To my surprise & delight, Joyce turned up last week & presented Mum with this beautiful knee rug she had crocheted from all the oddments of mohair wool that was in the box.It is beautiful & light but Oh So Warm & Cosy.My lovely friend Carolyn was up this way & we caught up for a coffee at the Hummingbird.Carolyn gifted me this cute little knitted vintage golly ... I thought he made a perfect companion for the golly Carolyn sent me in this postWe had a family lunch last Sunday when my brother & his wife travelled up to visit with Mum, & my boys & their families came to join us.I love this photo of Mum playing with Alec on the floor ... & then this one below is my older brother with Sid.It was rather special because my brother (who lost his arm in a motorbike accident at 20) doesn't hold babies Ever!!And yet both He & Sid looked most comfortable with each other ......Have a wonderful weekend dear friends - it looks like a wet one here - July has been such a wintery monthThanks so much for your visits today - you bring some sunshine to my world.with much love & friendshipJulie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

Thank you all So Very Much for all the kind & caring comments & emails you left me after my last postI would like to say Mum & I have been ticking along nicely but to be honest, it has been difficultThere have been lots of tears (mostly mine) & tantrums (mostly Mums) as we navigate our way through this tricky time  We continue to take just one day at a time taking very small stepsPrecious moments of stitching & creativity are such good soul food ..... & even though I emailed a dear friend threatening to throw my sewing machine out the window this past week .... I still managed to complete the little stitchery I was working on & make it up into a wallhangingAs I save every single scrap of Tilda fabric, I was able to use my offcuts to frame the stitchery panelThis gorgeous pattern is from Jenny of elephantz designReally hard to photograph on this dull day !!!I found an old black wire hanger in my craft drawer that was the perfect size so a quick warm up by the fire (the hanger that is - Not me!!) & a blast with a can of cream spray paintI always had the idea in my head that I wanted to hang this from the wall unit that I revamped last year in this postAs there seems to have been lots of sitting & drinking tea while I get Mum settled, I decided to pick up my knitting needles again.I found this ball of super soft cotton in a bag of wool oddments while at Mums ... so I was able to knit up a couple of small face washers with it ... & might still have enough left for one moreFor as long as I can remember there has been an Antique Shop on the corner of the main road, one block away from where my Mum lived in our family home    . . . Ethel Anne AntiquesWhile down at Mums recently I drove past this store many times on my way to errands & appointments.I noticed a big sign painted on her window  \"50% off all stock\" Gosh that sounds like me !!!!So - on my birthday to be exact - I took myself off & spent a good half hour browsing at all the goodies & droolingNormally these shops are well out of my budget but because everything was half price, a few treasures came home with meThe two china soup bowls were $7.50 each, which meant I got them both for $7.50 ... & the sweet little china butter dishes were $15 each, which meant I got them both for $15This tray was my bestest find .... not photographing terribly well but it is a gorgeous tray with copper surround & a doiley set under a glass top ... would be beautiful with some vintage glass perfume bottles sat upon it (a shame I don't actually own any)I was thrilled with my purchases & as Mum had given me some birthday money it felt even more special,On Saturday evening after Mum went to bed, the Mr & I stood at the kitchen bench & bottled the wine we had made with our grapes from the summer of 2016 !!This batch had actually sat in the glass demijohns \"brewing\" for a good 18 months !!(Incidently my stepson & his girlfriend walked the length of the city street they live on & pinched acquired glass wine bottles from folks recycling bins in order to gather the amount we needed!!!)We ended up filling 24 bottles which was quite impressive I thought .... & even though I was sorely tempted to drink/ taste test every single bottle .... The Mr would not let me !!!!!!!!Some advise please dear friends & readers .................I gently handwashed my wool felt penny rug in cold water & the colours have run badly as you can see belowMostly the black has run into the cream of the felt tongues .... does anyone have any suggestions of what I might use to \"un dye\" this mess ??Any ideas would be greatly appreciated as I am unfamiliar with any products that are out there but thought some of you may have experience with this.As I sit on the couch typing this post tonight I have lit my candle that I made in this post here .... the smell is lemongrass & green tea ... just the gentlest fragrance is wafting through the roomAnd these two - tucked up beside me on their granny blanket - never far awayHave a wonderful week ahead dear friends,I hope you find some creative time in your week as I hope toThanks again so much for your visits, your friendship & your kind words & thoughts,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A bit of a Curve Ball", "date": "Friday, July 7, 2017", "text": "Friday Greetings lovely friends & readersGosh what a fortnight it has been!!~!Sometimes when you feel you are ticking along nicely, not too many expectations on yourself & life in general, not thinking too far ahead, just focusing on the immediate task at hand ...... life can come along & throw you a bit of a curve ballThis is pretty much what happened to me in the last two weeks.If you look up the meaning of a curve ball you will see it states \"to introduce something totally unexpected, surprising or disruptive\" Mt Taranaki (Egmont) was indeed wearing her winter coat while I was down at Mums !!My dear Mum is most unwell.She has lots of things wrong with her .... things that have been brewing away for quite sometime but have gone undetected due to Mum not letting on.The outcome of all these things going wrong in her 88 year old body, is that Mum can no longer live alone in the family home.The short version of a very long week involving many Doctors consultations is that I made the decision to bring Mum back home with me.This Verse hangs on my Sewing Room Wall ... I have always loved it & thought how very true !!!(Click on the picture to enlarge it if you are having trouble reading it)This leads me to two questions ...... did I envisage myself caring for my aged Mother ??  Not really - No !Secondly ...... did my Mum envisage herself living with me here ??  100 % most certainly Not ! So we have quite a period of adjustment ahead of us both.  While Mum still believes \"when she gets well again, she will be going home\" ... I know this will not be the case.  But I cannot look too far ahead at the moment & am just trying to take one day at a time as I muddle my way through.There are only two things bringing a smile to Mums face these days .  .  . Her great grandsons Alec & Sid ... Mum had not even met little Sid until this weekAnd .  .  . the never ending antics of these two above !!While I was down at Mums another birthday slipped on by I was lucky enough on my return home to be greeted by some wonderful handmade gifts from treasured friendsMy dear friend Leeanne lovingly stitched me this beautiful cushion after me moaning telling her via email recently that I was \"over winter & couldn't wait for summer !\"My dear friend Carolyn sewed me this gorgeous gardening apron & filled the pockets with seeds & tools  I have always admired these handy aprons & never ever owned one (til now)And my dear friend Donna handknitted me this stunning selection of flowers & leaves & issued me a challenge \"to see what you make with them\" ....  along with the wonderful felted bird that was tucked into the parcel.Thank you all So Very Much my lovely friends ... your thoughtfulness meant the world to me. This little wooden Tea Chest was sitting in Mums shed along with some other things to be taken to the dump.As I consider myself \"the local dump\" (!!!) I bought it home with me & sat a delicate fern in it.And so dear readers, in times of uncertainty I find the one thing that always brings peace & structure to my life is creativity .  .  . It seemed appropriate then that I picked up my stitchery again .... a design from my friend Jenny of elephantz ... because Yes indeed, we all do need a home ! I hope to show you it complete in my next post.Birthday Basket of Polyanthus from my sister in law .... Op Shop basket .... just the way I like it !!!!!Thank you so much for listening today dear friends,I must apologise for not replying to comments or emails from my last post & I have not had a chance as yet to visit you all at your blogsI hope to remedy this very soon !!Wishing you all a wonderful weekend Be good & kind to yourselves & to each otherwith much love & friendshipJulie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Snippets from my week", "date": "Friday, June 23, 2017", "text": "Rainy Friday Greetings to you dear friends & readersMy neighbour popped in yesterday to ask me to feed her pets & stock while she was awayIn the course of our conversation she asked me \"have you had a busy week?\"\"Gosh yes, I have\" came my reply .  .  .  she paused, waiting for me to tell her what I had been up to .  .  .  . Not one single thing came to mind !!!!  What HAVE I done with my week I wondered to myself ??Thankfully a quick scroll through my camera gave me a few answers.After I made the bibs for my new grandson in this post here, my daughter in law declared them to be \"the best bibs ever!!\"I had quite a bit of flannelette leftover plus the remnants of the white bath towel still remaining so I ran up four more for herThis is a free bib pattern available from hereAs I was about to toss the odd offcuts of the bath towel out, I suddenly thought they might make some more burb cloths/face washers  So I managed to bind 3 more from the ends of the towel.These vintage scales were amongst the selection of goodies my friend Elaine tossed my way during her declutterI already have a black set myself which sit on the end of my kitchen bench & hold fruit, gourds or potpourri - depending on the seasonElaine & I (& Pippi) all agreed these could do with a makeover  I decided to paint them using my antique white chalk paintI very lightly & carefully masked the face of the scales -two coats later & a light scuff with sandpaper .  .  .I had intended to sit them in my bathroom holding the beautiful vintage bathcubes & soaps my friend Sally had gifted me when I did her Princess & the Pea Order Unfortunately they were too wide for the end of my bath so they now reside on the spare room dresserLooking ever-so-slightly Shabby Chic I feelThese next two items also got a makeover this weekThough I forgot to take a \"before photo\" (again Julie??) they were both heavy dark brown wood covered in a thick glossy varnish.They will both be used for what I call \"cuppa tea tables\" .  .  . the corner one below is to go beside the couch by the fire in my dining areaThe colour is Antique White Chalk paint ...... more of a cream than a white really.This little stool below is not quite finished, it has to have the paper doiley modpodged onto it & then a good coat of wax to make it all wipeable.It is very similar to the stool I revamped in this post here & will be used in the lounge as a cuppa tea table.The colour is not photographing well this grey day but it is Pale Duck Egg BlueI have been the lucky recipient recently of some surprise mail from bloggy friends ... a lovely friend from the South Island sent these beautiful delicate lace curtains to me to cut up or use in a project .... though they are old & fragile, just look at that stunning lacework on the bottom edgesThey were originally bought from a flea market in Paris many years ago ... they are the palest shade of grey, & I just love to hold them in my hands & think of the stories they could tell.After some email correspondence with my lovely friend Jenny of elephantz about the gorgeous flour sack teatowels she was embroidering on, Jenny very kindly offered to send me two \"to play with\"Jenny originally purchased several of these teatowels from the United States, they are the softest of soft.  I gasped when I opened the parcel & some of Jennys beautiful handwork fell out ... an exquisitely embroidered bookmark.Thank you So Much ladies ...your kindness & thoughtfulness made my day in more ways than you can imagine.Well dear friends, it is rainy & grey here today ... time to fill the woodbasket For once in their lives, these two have the right idea & are tucked up in the warmthWishing you a wonderful weekend ....

{"title": "A lovely visit to a friend .....................................", "date": "Friday, June 16, 2017", "text": "End of Week Greetings dear friends & readers Working from home can often mean that the days run together somewhat & you frequently find yourself working on the weekends as wellIt is often hard to distinguish what day it actually Is !The other day,  feeling overwhelmed by the business & busy-ness of late - I got up early, loaded my car up with goodies & travelled 2 hours through the fog to spend the day with a very dear friendI had not visited my lovely friend Donna for well over 2 years - a visit was long overdue.Her home is called The River House because a river runs through at the very bottom of her section Visiting with Donna is always a tonic & a treat Her home is always welcoming & warm & cosy in winter with a roaring fire ... Donnas friendship is one of those that kind of wraps itself around you Upon arrival you are immediately given a hot cuppa & delicious homemade cake to eatIt was just so lovely to escape the endless distractions of home & just sit & chat .......... & then chat some more.When the rain stopped we put on our welly's & went for a walk up the river along the boundary of her propertyDonna's chooks & sheep  Donna is self sufficient & grows everything they need in her large veggie garden & fruit tree area ... though she has put many of her beds to sleep for the winter, she still had lots of veggies available for pickingLucky Girl .  .  .  .  Isn't this just the cutest little potting shed ??!!At lunchtime we sat out on the deck in rug wrapped chairs & ate bowls of steaming homemade soup with chunky bread while the winters sun made a brief appearanceDonna is a fibre artist & always has baskets filled with yarns & homespun wool dotted throughout her homeShe used to run a Gallery & Craft Shop from her Home but closed it a few years ago ... you can read an old post about her Shop hereIt was such a lovely visit though it felt like it went by in the blink of an eye.It is so very soul replenishing taking the time to visit with friendsLate last year, while popping in to see my friend Sally in town, I admired a large cross stitch leaning against the wall in her hallway.  Sally informed me she had purchased it from the Op Shop for $15, found she had nowhere to actually hang it & if I liked ...... I could own it for $15 !!I wasted no time rummaging around in my bag for some cash !!  I absolutely loved the picture, every stitch so perfect & so lovingly hand stitched .  .  .  .  what I wasn't quite so keen on was the shiny gold frame.Reframing it was out of the question so a couple of days ago I decided to paint the frame.I had neither the knowledge, the energy, nor the inclination to pull the whole thing to bits, so I simply masked the glass. This week we have had crisp, clear winters days with a few rays of sunshine so it was perfect for chalk painting on my deck table I had unwanted intense supervision to ensure I stayed on track !!It is now dry & hanging back up on my lounge wall .....I LoVe it !!!  And am So pleased I painted it. I think the pale grey goes perfect with my wallpaper as well as the cherub I revamped in this postI saw this beautiful verse on a friend's facebook pageI thought it was just delightful & thought it would be wonderful to get it copied & framed for each of my grandsonsThanks So Very Much for your visits today dear friends, May you have a wonderful weekend ... Yes its Friday again !! With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Productive Weekend", "date": "Wednesday, June 7, 2017", "text": "Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersIt was a long weekend here in New Zealand as we celebrated Queens birthday Weekend.The Mr was away riding Moto X, which meant that instead of spending time in my kitchen preparing & cooking meals ............... I got to spend time in the kitchen creating far more interesting things ................. 3 were Green Tea & Lemongrass, 3 were Calico fragrancesI had some soy wax leftover in a plastic bag which I was keen to use up, so I made another batch of soy candles. I realise now I had been adding the fragrance too soon, while the soy was still hot, & hence burning off alot of the fragrance.  I waited 10 minutes for the soy to cool this time & achieved a much better result.I had a new oil I was keen to try - \"Calico\" .... such a gorgeous fragrance!!Waiting to harden a bit & have the wicks trimmed downI also spent time making up another batch of homemade laundry liquid I hadn't actually used up the batch I made back in March but found that I had given lots away to friends to try.Plus I came across a further two cut glass decanters in a box of the Mr's junk things !!The two taller decanters on the right are the newly discovered additions This is now the 2nd batch of laundry liquid I have made ... I have so far learnt two very important things.Firstly, do not go off & leave it unattended on the stove (as I did) as it will indeed boil over & make one big huge gloppy mess !!Secondly, do not leave the milk bottle containers filled with it sitting on the kitchen bench (as I did) as your Mr might very well come home, grab it to pour in his cuppa & words will come out of his mouth that I simply cannot print on here !!!!!!!*********!!!!!!!!! As I constantly add lawn clippings to my raised vegie gardens, the Mr suggested I needed to add some lime to sweeten the soil before I did my winter plantingI drove out to the farm & came home with four 20 litre buckets of lime which I dug into to my vegie beds Then as my moon calendar told me it was ideal planting time, I planted broccoli, cauliflower, cabbages & a fresh punnet of silverbeet & spinach ... all good hearty winter fare.I also dug out some herbs that had become woody & replaced them with new ones. I found a Mothers Day Garden Voucher in my wallet, so off I trotted to the Garden Centre & purchased some potted colour pansies to revamp my cane pram for the winter This little miniature wheelbarrow was hiding abandoned under a tree so I planted it out with a punnet of pansies in \"antique\" shadesAnd my dear old parsley pig, which was lying neglected under the house, got a scrub & a fresh parsley plant to cheer him (& me) up a bit I recently finished a further 3 dishcloths from this free pattern here I took them to my friend Joyce who kindly crochets around the edges for me in exchange for a batch of my apricot fudge slice which she loves so much !!I used to have a small wooden stool beside the bed in my spare room, however during one of my frequent change arounds, I borrowed pinched it for somewhere elseI needed to find a replacement & this wooden table was in my sleepout - a $5 purchase from Hospice last year  The top was somewhat wobbly, but this was soon remedied with a generous squeeze of PVA glue underneath & a heavy weight sat on top for 24 hours. (No, not Blackie either .... I can hear you Willie!!!)I applied 2 coats of my chalk paint \"pale duck egg\" shade, then lightly scuffed all the edges Such a transformation from a tatty $5 table .  .  .  .  and .  .  . Just perfect for the space I needed it for !!!And lastly dear friends, I got to spend time looking after one of my favouritest little people on the entire earth My dear little grandson Sid, who is now a whole 9 weeks old & is pondering life in general !!  Happy Wednesday to you all dear friends May you have a wonderful day ... thank you for stopping by here todaywith Much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Last Orders ...................& a Cat called Bob", "date": "Tuesday, May 30, 2017", "text": "Wintery Tuesday Evening Greetings dear friends & readers,I have been trying to finish up the last of my Orders before I close my Cottage for the Winter periodThis coming weekend we celebrate Queen's Birthday Weekend  & I will be closing just after that & reopening again on ................................well I am just not too sure at this stage!!!Well not quite yet ......................but soon !!!!After I finished Pru's order she was so delighted she called in again with a request to complete a couple more items for her .................This beautiful piece above was Aran stitch embroidery that Pru had done many years ago ... she wanted it made into a cushion with a zippered back & a zippered inner as well.This large crochet piece had been done by Pru's Nana & she asked for it to be backed & made into more of a supper cloth size.When I made the two runners for Pru, there was still a small collection of doilies remaining so she asked me to make up a flower design with these & stitch onto a 1 mt x 1 mt square cloth that she could use on her dining table.I was relieved to see the completion of Pru's order as I had endless trouble with the foot of my machine constantly catching in the crochet pieces My friend Marie rang me to ask if she could pop out & buy some more mothball sachets.Upon checking in the Cottage, I realised I had not one single one left .... it was easy enough to quickly run up some muslin bags as I already had some mixture on hand ............You can find the recipe at the bottom of this post *here* should you wish to make some yourself.I was lucky enough to win these 2 old sewing machine drawers from a Trademe auction (incidently the auction finished at 12.22 pm at night so I sat up til that hour to ensure my $12 bid won, which it did. The Mr assured me I was \"the only fool sitting up at that ridiculous hour bidding on a broken drawer anyway !!!!\"I chose to upcycle the one with the base intact firstTwo coats of cream wall paint, a quick scuff of the edges, then I lined the base with a remnant of the wallpaper from my last postI had a plan for this pretty drawer .......................I am ashamed to admit my lovely cotton laces spend their life languishing in a tangled heap in a plastic supermarket bag tossed in a corner of my sewing room ... I had seen a wonderful idea on Pinterest of winding the lengths onto old wooden clothes pegsI was certainly NOT short of wooden pegs so I spent a pleasant rainy afternoon ironing all my lace lengths out, then winding then onto some old wooden pegsWhat enormous delight I felt in a simple afternoons task !!!!Thank you for your lovely comments on the Nail Box upcycle in my last postI chose to use the box as a shelf in my sewing room - it was the perfect size to house my collection of Extra Curricular Magazines, & my jars filled with vintage bakelite buttonsI had purchased these small swing tags to attach to gifts but I loved the vintage prints so much, I couldn't bear to part with them, so I strung them along the shelf as a bunting ................................. & my new/old drawer gets to sit alongside my new/old shelf !!I think it was over at Betty-the-Wood-Fairy's blog blog I first learnt about the book A Street Cat Named BobAfter I had read the book myself, I ordered copies for my son & stepson for Christmas.  I well remember their faces when they opened the parcels ... total disbelief!!  It was my son Kayne who found to courage to say to me \"actually Mum I think you might have given us the wrong gifts - this is a kids book?!\"  No its not I told them both - read it & let me know what you think.The books have been read & enjoyed & shared amongst many family members & friendsI was so delighted last week to be able to see the Movie that has come to my small town.  I just loved it & found that even though my eyes filled with tears frequently, I smiled alot of the way through also.It is the real cat Bob who plays his own part in the movie !!I encourage you to see it if you get the opportunity - it IS wonderful & just re-affirms my long held belief that our pets come to us for a reason & often-as-not ...... they choose Us !!Long time readers of my blog will know that Blackie chooses the most unusual sleeping places including the ironing board & wrapped around the sewing machine to name just a coupleHis latest sleeping place is stretched out along the back of the T.V. ... this is rather ridiculous really but what is completely pathetic about all this ... is that the Mr & I sit there with the sound almost on mute - trying to lip read the T.V - so as not to disturb His Lordship!!!You can certainly see why Blackie chose to live in this house!!!Have a wonderful week dear readers & thanks so much for your visits today,Be kind to yourselves & to each other,with much love & friendshipJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Four Baskets, One Nail Box & a Cherub", "date": "Tuesday, May 23, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI have just now taken a batch of delicious banana & choccy chip muffins from the Oven The kettle has just boiled .   .   .   would you care to join me in a cuppa & I can pass you a muffin through the screen?The four cane baskets pictured below caught my eye in the St Vinnies Op Shop last yearThey ranged in price from $2 to $4 ... however when I took them up to the counter & told the man I would like all of them please ... he kindly informed me I could have the 4 for $10 !!What a bargain !!  I had an idea in mind for these baskets.But first -  a paint job !!!It was very much a case of using up what I had on hand ...  the two cream ones got spray painted with my can of cream paint, the candy pink was a new can I had not tried out yet ... & the good old green Amulet got painted on by hand.  (I have found from experience you always get a far better coverage by spray painting cane work)Next job was to line the 4 baskets ... this was done using fabrics from my stash that complimented the paint coloursThen I made 4 little pincushions & matching needle cases for each basketI stitched a small scissor charm to each needlecase, I added some pins to the pincushions & popped some needles in the needlecases .  .  . .  .  .  then added a label to each basket as Yes Indeed, people actually DO say \"these are cute, but what do you do with them?\" !!!Four Sewing Workbasket Sets - all complete & ready for saleThe Mr has been under the main house at the farm fixing a broken water pipe for the tenants He found two items under there that he thought I might like . . . the Mr knows me well enough now to know I get rather excited about any random junk treasures he brings home This old wooden nail box, which someone, once-upon-a-time had painted the palest lemon colourI scrubbed it well, let it dry & then gave it 2 coats of my chalk paint \"pale duck egg\"I dried it thoroughly by the fire between each coat.  I had an idea for the inside of this nail box so I contacted my dear friend Catherine as I remembered she sold beautiful Cath Kidston wallpapers on her SunshineVintage siteThe beauty of this is that you are able to buy 1 metre lengths which is just perfect for those small upcycling projectsI was so very excited when my 4 different choices arrived in the post!!I had no wallpaper paste on hand & was too lazy busy to go & purchase some, so I just used modpodge, which worked out fine.I used it to adhere the wallpaper but did not coat the outside of it as I loved the vintage feel of the wallpaper itself.For some reason, this tatty old nail box with its fresh paint & vintage wallpaper brings me so much pleasure whenever I look at it ... I shall show you next post what I end up using it for.This poor neglected cherub was the other item The Mr pulled from under the farmhousePoor little cherub with its broken wing !!!I scrubbed her (or him) & removed the family of spiders that had taken up residence in her crevicesI sprayed her with bleach to kill the mould, then when dry I painted her with a small testpot of chalk paint I found in my drawer - the stone grey colouring being ideal .  .  .I was thrilled with how she turned out - broken wing & all - I shall enjoy her inside for now & perhaps pop her in the garden when summer comes.Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friends,I hope you all have a wonderful week - be kind to yourselves & to each otherI am off out to The Mr's shed to hunt for nail boxes !!!! 😉With much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "Sewing for a Tractor-Mad Little Boy", "date": "Thursday, May 18, 2017", "text": "Good Thursday Greetings dear friends & readersBefore my Grandson Alec ever learnt to say Mummy, Daddy or even \"No\", the sound he would frequently make was \"atta\"When I would babysit him he would climb onto the wooden lid covering the Spa Pool, stand on tip toe, & point his tiny finger over the very top of the hedge to the surrounding hills saying \"atta\" over & overMy Son pointed out to me that the tiny dot on the top of the very farthest hill, was in fact, the farmers tractor.This developed into the word \"daktor\"  ....... always said with such drama & relish ...... \"daktoooooorrrr\"Therefore, on a recent shopping trip to my local Patchwork Shop to purchase craft glue, her gorgeous array of tractor fabrics stopped me in my tracks somewhat .... & I immediately thought of little AlecThough I had not a clue what I wanted to make with them .... some purchases came home with me.  As Alec turns Two this month I thought these fabrics might inspire me to make him some birthday gifts.The first thing I decided to make for him was a name bunting .  .  .both my grandsons are blessed with short names, so this didn't take up too much time NOR fabricI had bought him a farmyard book awhile ago when Paper Plus had a book sale.  This was tucked away in my cupboard so I made up a little Book Bag to pop the book in to ...I made the bag reversible & used another of the tractor fabrics to line it with I also have a couple of tractor matchbox toys hidden in my cupboard which I will tuck into the book bagAt the end of last winter my friend Joyce had given me a large bag of brand new fleece fabrics in very boyish colours.I remembered about the fabrics & thought I might make Alec a tracksuit that I could embellish with the tractor fabrics.There was just enough of this lovely soft royal blue polar fleece to make a sweatshirt & I added a pocket & lined the hood with the tractor fabrics.This bottle green made up into a complete tracksuit which will be cosy & warm for him this winter.(Often when I am out babysitting Alec, you will find me with the roll of greaseproof paper tracing off his clothing to make patterns)With the last square of fabric I was able to make a chair pad for this wooden childs chair. I had originally intended to give this to Alec last Christmas but decided he was still too small for it then.We have a small birthday party planned for this Saturday & I have offered to help my daughter in law make an Elmo Cake !!!My friend Pauline lost her Mother in law recently & inherited a large stash of her doilies & vintage linens.After showing Pauline the order I did for Pru in my last post she asked if I could make her a runner using up as many of the doilies as possible.Pauline presented me with the collection of doilies aboveI was able to use up all but two small crocheted ones in the vintage runner I made above .... this beauty measured 60 cms x 1.70 when complete.  Pauline has a large (newly purchased) native timber dining table & this runner will look stunning across it.Poor Miss Pippi has had a traumatic morning .  .  .It would appear that the Electrician that came out to repair our alarm & security lights left his Van door open & a certain furry ginger being climbed in & took it upon herself to curl up & go to sleep.Unfortunately he did not notice this until he was nearly back to town again - he was most unimpressed that he had to drive all the way back out here to return her & mentioned that he \"should charge me 2 lots of travel fees\" !!!I apologised sincerely, thanked him profusely, agreed with everything he said & offered him a cuppa or something stronger ??!!Imagine if he had just opened his door & let her go ..... doesn't bear thinking about.Here she is currently asleep on a freshly folded pile of clean laundry - resting & recuperating from her trauma.The Mr commented that she will \"not do that again in a hurry\" !!??Me ... I am not so sure ... this IS Pippi we are talking about !!!Thanks so much for your visits today dear friends,I would love to just share with you the gorgeous photo that popped into my inbox when I went to check emails this morningMy youngest grandson Sid - 6 weeks old now !!!With much love & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Miss Pippi x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Pru's Order", "date": "Thursday, May 4, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Welcome to May (already!!!)After I had completed the Princess & the Pea Order & delivered to my friend Sally, I sat at the table the following morning sipping a hot cuppa & a thought occurred to me ......................for the VERY first time in about 18 long months .......... I had absolutely NO orders to do !!!!!!!!!!!As the Cottage was well stocked (& quiet) I could actually make something for myself ........... a doll perhaps ???Imagine the possibilities .......................No sooner had I finished the last sip of my coffee than Pru drove in my drivewayPru calls into the Cottage from time to time & buys the handmade organic soaps that I sell .... it was during her last visit that we shared a conversation & Pru mentioned that she had this large pile of doileys that her late Mother & Nana had crocheted & what could she do with them??I explained to Pru that I had made vintage table runners before using up old doileys & linensThis was the beautiful pile of vintage doileys Pru presented me with ... they had been crocheted many years ago by her late Mother & Nana.  The two heavy damask tablecloths were almost 100 years old & still in wonderful condition.Pru's instructions were for a tablecloth 1m x 1 m square using the white doileys & then 2 runners using the cream crochet doileysNo problem ..................................Although it is photographing cream, this tablecloth is in fact, pure white - very heavy too - but beautiful .... & would look gorgeous folded up on the end of a single bed I thought !!The smaller of the 2 runners measured 115 cms long x 40 cms wide . . . .. . . . & then the 2nd runner measured a whopping 2.20 cms in length & sure used up a large amount of the doiley pile !!!!This was to sit on a long antique wooden cabinet that Pru has .... I am sure it will look stunningShowing some of the doileys up closeWhen I am working out the placement on anything like this, I like to have it on the table & walk past it over a day or two as I frequently change my mind & re-arrange the placement until I am happy with it.When it became apparent that Blackie intended to \"assist me with the placement\" - I decided to put up a trestle table to keep them off what I was working on .  .  .  ..  .  .  . as you can see above I was none too successful in that endeavour !!!!!!!!!(Sorry Pru)The 2nd bag of goodies that Pru wanted completed was the hardanger embroidery above, the Thomas the Tank Engine cross stitch & the piece of silk ribbon embroidery - all her own handworkAs per her instructions I made the hardanger piece up into a cushion with a zippered back closing -  to sit on Pru's bedThe Cross Stitch was to be cut down, backed & made into a small plump cushion for her grandson ... who adores Thomas the Tank EngineI was able to back the silk ribbon embroidery piece with some pale pink linen I had in my stash & stitch it into a pretty lavender pouchLast, but by no means least, was this beautiful calico quilt that Pru had begun some 20 years ago.  It was to fit a king size bed, to have the silk ribbon rosettes in the centre, the ruched calico around a scalloped edge on the base & be backed & quilted.Pru had long ago given up on this piece & it had sat in the back of her closet all these years.She instructed me to cut the centre panel out & hem it & edge it with the cream french lace that she had purchased to use on the quilt.As it had a dainty eyelet edge separating the centre panel, I cut it a couple of inches below this & then hemmed it as I really liked the effect.  Pru is very much looking forward to using this on her table now.Thank you So Much Pru for trusting me with your beautiful vintage linens.When we did our lounge extension last year, this folk art Watering Can somehow ended up in the garden & then got tossed under the house when we were endeavouring to clean up.I fished it out this week, gave it a scrub & a dry in the sunshine, then I removed the centre lip as I planned to sit some hydrangeas in it that I had been dryingI especially love the colours & tones of my hydrangeas in autumn & am hoping they don't fade too quicklyWe had our first fire last night & the house feels cosy again.These two got the prime seat & soon radiated towards the warmth. I hope the week is treating you kindly dear readers .  .  .  I am off to bed for an early nightThank you so much for your visits herewith much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "The Princess & The Pea .  .  .  .  .   * Tilda Style *", "date": "Thursday, April 13, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Easter to you all !!!A couple of months ago I received an email from my lovely friend Sally.The email went something like this \"Julie, I have bought an old wooden cot from the Op Shop & I wanted to do a Princess & the Pea theme with it ...... would you make me the Princess please?\"As you can imagine, I was most fascinated !!!So Sally arrived out to visit me with the gorgeous Tilda book above, she had on loan from our local Library.And the scrummy array of Tilda fat 1/4's pictured below . . .As luck would have it - Sally even had her own crown !!!It was about now that I had to confess \"you know Sal, even tho' I have heard of it .... I don't actually know the story of  The Princess & the Pea\" !!!Having raised sons, the opportunity to read them this particular fairy tale just never arose.So Sally gave me a brief rundown of a shortened version of the fairy tale about them hiding a pea in the mattresses to see if she was in fact \"a real Princess\"Originally the order was just to sew the Princess in the book - this however, grew to me offering to make the mattresses as well.My friend Sally is one VeRy clever lady ... & more than capable of doing this order herself.  But she has just this year undertaken an intensive floristry course, so I decided to whip a coat of paint on the cot while I was busily painting something else ...As mentioned in my last post, I lost all my \"before\" & \"during\" photos from this order when our computer died.As I had cut the front side out of the cot before undercoating it, I was able to just sit it back in place to give you an idea of the original red/grey colour & how tatty the little wooden cot wasOnce I had undercoated it a couple of times to cover the red, I affixed a piece of flat wood slat to the side with a couple of screws.Front View                                                                          Back ViewThen I proceeded to paint the entire cot white & make the mattresses.  Some of them I boxed the corners & stuffed more thickly, others I just left thin, as in the pattern bookNext I decided to make the pillow & the little quilt - I absolutely LoVeD the fabrics I chose for these ...It was a last minute decision to add a little frill to the edges of the cot quilt (I am so pleased I did this)My next task was to drape the cot with some netting offcuts I had found in my stash .  .  ..  .  .  . I was able to cut them to length & bunch together at the top - this sat quite snugly once I slid the crown over the wooden slat piece I worked on this project over the course of a few weeks, leaving it at times to work on other orders or baby sewing.Everytime I would bring it out to continue with, my own real life Princess would take it upon herself to be a pain inoffer her input !!!!Whenever I would stack the mattresses in the cot to work out their placement, she would have much delight in rearranging them for me (Sorry Sal)During the course of this order, on a daytrip to Rotorua, I was delighted to come across a small felted ball for 50c in a craft shop .  .  ..  .  . which was perfect for the Pea.Unfortunately the Pea in question went missing for about 3 days when a certain 4 legged ginger helper decided it made the most wonderful play toy !!!And finally ...... I got to make the Princess !!!Sally had chosen which Tilda fabrics she wished me to use for the nightie & stockings ...My one specification was that I wanted to give her \"proper hair\"I did not so much like the painted-on-hair in the pattern book.I photocopied a piece of the fabric onto medium weight cardstock & made her little crown with thisThe pea got tucked under the edge of the mattresses .  .  . The miniature vintage china cup (found in my cupboards) was perfect for the chamber potViola .  .  .  the Princess & the Pea - Tilda Style  Sally was delighted .... she has promised me I am allowed to play with this set each time I visit her .... so long as I have adult supervision & have washed my hands first !!!!!! 😉Wishing you all a safe & happy Easter dearest friends & readersWith Cyclone Cook bearing down on us here it is looking like we could be in for a rather wet Easter breakI have the furry ones tucked up safely inside, a new wax melt in my oil burner, & a good supply of choccy eggs stashed away .... I think I will be safe & sound !!!Thanks so much for your visits here todaywith much love & friendship to you ALLJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "Sewing (& Waiting) for Baby", "date": "Monday, March 27, 2017", "text": "Rainy Monday Greetings dear friends & readersLast weekend I came across my scribbled list of all the things I wanted to make for my soon-to-be-born grandson, & flew into a bit of a panicVerrry little time ...... still lots to make !!!!When my friend Sally gifted me the gorgeous Peter Rabbit fabric above, I immediately knew I wanted to make a Baby Bag & then fill it with some handmade goodiesA quick google search for diaper bag patterns & I came across this one here that I really liked .... a decent size & not too fussy.The bag came together quite easily - I tried to use what I had on hand & not have to purchase anything.The green polka dot was a perfect complimentary lining fabric & I had lots of help from a certain quality control officer to ensure my measurements were all accurate !!!The bag is fully lined & you can add as many inner pockets as you likeI purchased a few baby care products from my supermarket to tuck into the pockets.The one change I made was, instead of using fusible interfacing for the bag I used some thin wadding I had - I find the fusible interfacing too rigid & prefer the wadding which is more pliable.Of course - a label to complete the bag.Recently while on an outing to Rotorua I popped into Spotlight & purchased some flannelette on saleWhile chatting to the lady as she cut my fabrics for me, I asked her for some white towelling please to make bibs.She leaned ever-so-slightly across the counter & whispered to me \"go over there to those bins, buy a white bathtowel for $5 - its much cheaper & thicker than the towelling & you will get 6 big bibs out of one towel\"I was so very grateful & after a wash, it certainly did come up thick & fluffyAnother quick google search for free bib patterns & I used this simple one hereBibs still waiting to be ironedWhilst filling the bag with gifts - including the blanket & wheatie I made Here, I decided I wanted to make a little plastic zipped pouch for putting any wet clothes/nappy's etc intoI used the pouch gifted to me by my friend Claire in this post, as a guideThe pouch is fully lined with the plastic - the tiny Peter Rabbit print just seemed the perfect match for the bag & the cute animal bias binding came from my local woolshopfront of pouch                                                                                                          back of pouchFrequently on my trawls through the Op Shops I come across half rolls of wallpaper for 50c - this pale blue was one such find.I used it to sew up a giant gift bag to sit the Diaper Bag in with all the smaller parcels wrapped inside itReady & Waiting & now we just need baby boy to come into the world !!!In my last post I mentioned how I had visited my friend Elaine right in the midst of a de-clutterThis tray below was one of several items that came home with me ....I gave it a paint with my cottage cream wall paint, then I lightly sprayed the cane part of it as I find this gives better coverage than brushing ever doesMy plan had been to find some pretty floral paper serviettes & then mod podge the flowers scattered over the trayHowever, I had neither the time, inclination, nor funds to go traipsing around trying to find just the right paper serviettes .  .  . .  .  .  so the tray sat abandoned for a weekYesterday whilst rustling through a drawer, I came across a lovely piece of scrapbooking paper - pretty vintage squares which I cut out & decided to display as a bunting across the trayI mod-podged them on along with a small flat vintage lace to \"string them together\"I was thrilled with the result & now just have to decide whether the tray is going for sale in the Cottage .  .  .  or going on display in Julie's house!!!!Thank you so much for your entries into my pincushion giveaway & your lovely comments you left me.I am not drawing this til the end of the month so you still have time if you would like to enter.You can leave me a comment on my last post, or on this one here letting me know.Finally dear readers, although we are full swing into autumn here now, my lovely planted suitcase is still flowering merrily away on my deck - it has done so well this yearLobellia & Impatiens (busy Lizzies)Wishing you suitcases overflowing with flowers this weekWith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "Choosing an old fashioned kind of life .................", "date": "Sunday, March 5, 2017", "text": "Sunday Greetings dear friends & readers & Welcome to March !!\"Oh Julie you are such a Granny with your old fashioned ways & your repairing & recycling of just about everything!! \"These are the words my Stepdaughter has said to me on many, many occasions over the past years . . .  even long before I became an actual Granny!!Though they were often not necessarily spoken in a kind way - for some reason her words never bothered meYou see my Stepdaughter lives a fast paced city life, in a world that is black white & monochrome, everything is shiny, new & disposable. Whereas I live in a far, far slower paced world, filled with muted tonings, chipped cracked timeworn patinas, make do & mend.She would no longer wish to be a part of my world, anymore than I would want to be a part of hers.Her words echoed in my ears repeatedly this past week as I spent time knitting cotton dishcloths & making homemade laundry liquid, happy in my world. When Mum came to stay at Christmas she presented me with this large jar filled with grated soap ends.  \"You can do something with this\" she informed me \"you'll have a recipe tucked away somewhere\"I remembered a recipe I had come across in Rhonda's books & sure enough \"homemade laundry liquid\" appears in both booksI had all the ingredients on hand & spent a pleasant morning making up a 10 litre bucket fullI didn't think mine was going to thicken for some reason so I sat the bucket in the bath overnight .... by morning it was a good consistency & ready to pour into bottlesThe Mr had a large collection of heavy glass decanters he had inherited somewhere along the way ....As they were tucked away in a box, I felt they would be perfect filled with some of my liquid laundry detergent - I thought they looked most attractive & will keep the plastic milk bottles filled ready for use as the mixture requires a decent shake before using in your machine.As I was knitting away this week I realised I had not purchased a commercial dishcloth for about 5 years now.At the start of each year I give mine a good cull & take the thinner, worn ones to use as cleaning cloths . . .  this gives me a good excuse to knit up a new batchThis little bag came home with me this week .... 50c from the Church Op Shop ... I thought it would be perfect for carting my knitting around & plan to embellish it with some of the doileys gifted by Sue in my last postAfter knitting some darker coloured cloths, I am keen to try out these lovely new pastel shades next .  .  .This vintage wool blanket fell out of the sewing cupboard last week & gave me the inspiration to make a blanket for my new grandson - due later this monthAs Nicole plans to use a Moses basket I thought a pram sized blanket would be ideal.  I had seen a cute rabbit applique in an old Cath Kidston book \"Patch\" I had been browsing some months ago.I had some soft blue wool felt on hand that just fit the bill perfectly.It was so enjoyable sitting blanket stitching the wool felt rabbit on, then lightly stuffing in behind to give him a bit of puff .  .  ..  .  .  after I had finished the rabbit & carrot, Pippi very kindly tested it out for me to ensure the blanket had adequate softness & squashability !!!Thank You Miss Pippi  (I think)Though my original intention had been to bind it with some wide satin ribbon - after coming across this gorgeous range of fabrics in my local patchwork shop Darling Little Dickens - I decided to back & bind my blanket with thatI lightly quilted the top blue part of the blanket & added a row of satin hearts.From another fat 1/4 of the same fabric range I made a Wheatbag to keep babies bed warm when he is not in thereI tossed a small handful of lavender in with the wheat to make it smell extra nice.For all those lovely readers that commented & emailed me last week regarding the kitchen towel dresses - these next 2 photos are to show you them \"in situ\"Hanging on the oven door handleOpened right out on the floor !!!As you can see, they are double-sided.  So No, preferably Not for little girls to wear as I fear it could be just a teeny bit draughty !!!!Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends,Thank you so much for stopping by today - your visits are so appreciatedwith much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Kiwikid ........ & batches of things ............", "date": "Sunday, February 26, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersI had the most loveliest experience on Friday when I got to meet a fellow bloggerSue from the blog Kiwikids ... flew all the way across from Australia & came to meet me on her trip through our beautiful countrySue is travelling through New Zealand with her lovely friend Eve.We had a long lunch together, chatted away just like old acquaintances, then a wander around the garden & a browse in my Cottage.It had seemed like a verrrry long time ago since Sue first emailed me to say they were coming to New Zealand & arrange to visit.She bought me some beautiful treasures ...... a gorgeous bundle of lace doilies, a heavy crystal sugar bowl & dainty salt pot.I am thinking the sugar bowl will look rather lovely filled with a handful of my rose petal potpourri.Thank you SO much Sue & Eve for your visit ....  after corresponding via our blogs for a long time, it was wonderful to finally get to meet in person.You can read Sue's post about their visit HereThere has been some productivity on the sewing front this past weekA customer came out to buy a wheat bag from me & I had Not One Single One left in the Cottage !So I hauled out my large bag of wheat & made some up using a few of my Cath Kidston remnants - the customer wanted one as a gift for her brother so the Ford Vintage Car fabric was perfect.I found some handtowels in my sewing room that had been purchased on sale, so I decided to make some kitchen towel dresses like the ones I made for Margaret in this postI was keen to see how they would sell in the Cottage & am happy to report that 2 have gone alreadyThis pink spotty set was sitting around waiting to be embellished . . . so I appliqued a set of angels onto the teatowel, oven mitt & potholder .  .  ..  .  . & packaged them in cellophane ready for sale.I find February/March are always considerably quiet times in my little Cottage as school returns & bills from Christmas arrive, so this is always a good time to restock the Cottage with some basic items.And speaking of batches of things ................the latest batch of abandoned kittens went to the Animal Care Shop this week !!!Although it took me 10 days of feeding them, to quieten & encourage them enough to actually get them into the cage .... The Mr became rather concerned when he heard I had named them both !!!Yes we are a typical farm house & always have a selection of footwear at our doorways !!!!Little Sooty looked to me like she belonged on the back of a witches broomstick !!!                                    I wonder whats in here - curious Sooty                                           Little Sweep with his crossed front paws                                                                                                She was definately alot more friendly than Sweep, who preferred to stay at a distance.When the Mr took them into the Animal Care shop, the lady that fosters kittens took them home to quieten them even more before being rehomed.When they left I felt such a mixture of sadness AND relief .... but someone else was certainly happy to see the back of them & could rest easily again !!!Utter Princess that she is !!!I love this last photo . . . .   my beautiful natured, kind & caring youngest son Kayne, who drove 4 hours to visit his Nan, to repair her fence, repair her roof & take her grocery shopping, then drove home again.His Nan - who still can't quite believe you can actually take a photo with a phone that you can also talk on !!!!!***Kayne becomes a Dad next month & I am sure he will make the most wonderful Father.I hope you are having a lovely weekend dear friends & that the week ahead is good & kind to us all .  .  .Thanks so much for your visits here todaywith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Spare Bedrooms & Baby Showers", "date": "Friday, February 17, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Good Friday Afternoon to you all !!In early December, while cleaning the spare bedroom ready for Mums arrival, I decided to wash the blind that hung at the small top windowIn hindsight, I should've left well alone .... as the blind fabric completely disintegrated in the wash, being so thin & rotten.This called for a new blind !!!I had long admired this gorgeous fabric at MyStyle called Bird Trail Grey.As they had a reduction on their fabrics prior to Christmas I ordered the new blind to be made & it arrived just in time for Mums visit.I was most delighted with my new blind but somehow Mum didn't seem to share my joy & enthusiasm & informed me \"its just a blind Julie\"Recently MyStyle discounted their fabrics again, so I purchased another 1.5 metres of the same bird trail grey.We have this old bookcase-kind-of-thingy in the spare bedroom ... truth be told, this was rescued (by yours truly) from one of the cowsheds we used to milk in !!!!Upon rescuing it, I only ever scrubbed & oiled it, & it has lived in many rooms of our houses over the past 20 odd years - I find it perfect for storing craft magazines & my candle making supplies.It is rather an ugly thing so I thought a curtain might help to pretty it up a bit .  .  .  ..  .  .  . which I think I did achieve ??As I had a length of leftover fabric, I decided to make a runner for the other dressing table in this roomJust the perfect length too.I had finished this runner about a week ago & was doing my \"walking past it for a day or two thing that I do\"I felt it needed an embellishment on the ends ... so off I trot to my local Patchwork shop, who luckily had the perfect pink bobble trim.Upon decluttering the drawers in this dresser, I came across a lovely teatowel, a birthday gift from last year I seem to recall.This teatowel was from Mystyle & was the exact same bird fabric ... so I fashioned my teatowel into a small plump cushion for the bed ...And Yes - I added some pink bobble trim to the edges .  .  ..  .  .  after all, it was far too pretty to dry dishes with !!!I am pleased to report that Blackie has moved on from sleeping on my sewing room cutting boardUnfortunately I am NOT so pleased to report he has taken up residence on the ironing board !!!Here he is two days ago, keeping my new in-progress tablerunner warm for me !!!One of the things I love about blogging is that I look back on old posts & see I do the same sort of things throughout the different seasons .......At the moment it is rose petal gathering & drying time againI have large cane trays strewn with rose petals drying in my sleepoutI really enjoy making up batches of my cottage garden potpourri - some to send to friends & some to sell.I purchased a new oil \"rose geranium\" & the scent is just gorgeous .... I filled a glass dish with some to fragrant my spare room & the smell wafts all through the houseMy daughter in law's Mum & I are putting on a surprise Baby Shower for her this weekendNicole & Kaynes baby (son) is due late March.Nicole's Mum (also called Julie) is organising the games for the baby shower so I offered to do up some prizes.I packaged up soaps, candles, notebooks & facewashers from the Cottage & made up some matching labelsI also stitched up some handmade baby gifts to give to Nicole.These little rattles are a pattern from Amy Sinibaldi's book Sweetly Stitched Handmades   ( one for Nicole, one for the Cottage )Nicole mentioned she didn't have any winter cot sheets so I bought some soft flannelette & stitched some up .  .  ..  .  . along with some flannel baby shoes made from the remnants of my buzzy bee fabricMy elderly friend Margaret lives in a retirement Village, & likes to buy items from me that she can keep in her cupboard in case she needs a gift in a hurryThese 10 lavender coathangers were an order for Margaret that I completed yesterday.It was Margaret that ordered the 12 kitchen handtowels from me last Christmas in this post hereLast Tuesday was Valentines Day so I decided to make Apple Crumble - the Mr's favourite.Unfortunately the stewed apples I took out of the freezer, turned out to be feijoa's when thawed  !!!So I made feijoa & coconut cake instead & sprinkled icing sugar over a heart paper doiley The Mr informed me (as I knew he would !!!) that he would far rather have apple crumble than feijoa cake anyday !!!As I rounded the corner at the end of my garden last weekend the lillies coming into bloom caught my eyeWe have been lucky enough to have had some good rain this summer & they have lapped up the extra moistureThey smell gorgeous but I just cannot bare to cut them & bring them insideIt is raining again here today dear friends - I had a Resthome ring to cancel their visit & I was most relievedSo it has been a day for sitting at the table & stitching some projects while Miss Pippi tries her best to look cute & innocent.(but we are not fooled by her & her antics!!!)Wishing you a wonderful weekend dearest readers,with much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I now have five & three of them have been gifted by Joyce.I came across a glass dish for 50c in the Sallies Op Shop which I thought would be perfect to display my collection onAs the five of them just fit perfectly, I think my collection is complete now !!!We have had my Uncle staying this week - he has left today & Madam Pippi is happy .... she & her basket are back in \"their rightful place\" & order is restored againLady Muck sitting on her throne !!!!!!!!!Meanwhile Blackie, who does not especially like visitors either, decided to spend his time sleeping on my sewing table cutting mat, whilst my Uncle was here ......One grey day late last month my grandson Alec came out to the farm for a visit with his DaddyWe took him for a ride in the farm buggy which he thought was most exciting even though it poured with rain & the rain came in sideways !!!Alec speaks 3 words most clearly .  .  . \"No\"(usually accompanied with a shake of the head), \"more\" & \"Tractor\" (pronounced dactor)Thank you so much for stopping by today dear friends & readers - I hope February is being kind to you allI shall get round to visiting you all at your blogs now I am internet-able againI thought I would leave you with this photo of my old cane pram which is currently planted with Impatiens & thriving ...Happy flower-filled February to you allwith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Kitten Chaos & Calamity", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2017", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersIt has been rather a stressful kinda week here at My Threadbear Life .............(warning photo heavy post - go grab a cuppa or a stronger tipple perhaps !!!)Some despicable person dumped a very young mother cat & her 5 baby kittens at our depot yard while it was closed for the festive period.The first indication I had of this was when the skinny, starving Mum began turning up on our lawn at nights, wild eyed & hungry. I fed her, thinking to myself \"I am not quite sure that she actually is feral\"When the staff at the depot yard came back to work on Monday, they found 5 small balls of fluff tucked under a broken roller door at the rear of the buildingWithout thinking, they handled & cuddled the kittens .... that night the Mum moved them all ................. to under my house of course !!!!The kittens found a small gap at the base of my house & came tumbling out .  .  .Goodness me ............ how did that happen ???!!!5 hungry wee souls .   .  .Now I confess I have a bit of a wee problem .  .  .  whenever I come across anything abandoned like this .  .  .  .  I just want to keep them all, feed them,love them & give them a home.  My head goes foggy & my reasoning flies out the window .  .  . The Mr tells me that my eyes actually glaze over !!!During the course of the week I was lucky enough to find homes for all the kittens(believe me - this was down to sheer luck & Not down to good management !!!)This just left Mum  .  .  .  ..  .  .  . who begun to let me pat her as her hunger & malnourishment decreased a little .  .  .However - the day the last of her kittens went away, she became distraught, & cried & howled under the house for 2 days. Meanwhile I was inside the house crying & howling myself !!!!Eventually The Mr took her into town to our Animal Care Centre & gave them a generous donation to have her speyed & find her a good home with someone (who won't abandon her)Right in the midst of all that stress .... there was one ray of sunshine. My friend Sue came over for a visit from the city.Sue was the exact person you need in a situation like this ... not only is she friendly & cheerful, but also very confident as she has fostered kittens for the S.P.C.A herself.And Sue came bearing gifts . . ..  .  . wonderful Op Shop treasures that she knew I would Love !!Not only that, Sue took one of the kittens home with her .   .   .  my favourite one actually, the polydactyl one with the extra toesAnd very proud of his extra toe too !!!!!  Click on the photo if you want to enlarge it.You can read Sue's post about her visit Here & see the ummm - \"rather stressful & difficult\" life little ToeBee is leading - I have pinched borrowed a couple of Sue's photos belowThank you SO much Sue for all your help & encouragement with the kitten fiasco !!ToeBee with Sue's older cat BigSo the 3 kittens below all went to their separate homes on the same day This just left the ginger & the black male kittens remaining.I was worried about one going & the other being left behind so it was nothing short of a miracle when the girl came to collect the ginger boy, she agreed to take his brother too!!This is why I had hoped they would be kept together .  .  .Bless their precious wee souls.Enough kitten overload for one day ???!!!Hence there has been not alot achieved at Threadbear this past week.  As my sewing machine has gone in for a long overdue service, it was hand sewing projects only.I noticed the glass dish containing the wool blanket lavender hearts in my Cottage was empty .  .  ..  .  . as well as there being no mothball sachets remaining.I was able to rectify both these this week as I had some muslin bags already sewn up, just needing to be filled.You can find the recipe for the mothball sachets Here if you should want to make some up yourself)Way back early last year when we did our lounge extension, we were left with one end of a set of french doors spare.I masked up 3 of the panes & painted them black \"diesel\" - but then never did anything further with them.Our extension ended up having one long expanse of wall with no windows in it .... this was partly our choice & partly due to the fact the we (me) could find nothing we could agree on.I decided to use this false window to break up the bare expanse of wall.My son screwed it to the weatherboards for me & we dragged my old concrete washing machine tubs along underneath the \"window\".I then filled the tubs with red & white geraniums !!!Yes I know !!!   Yes I did say white !!!They just grew pink for some unknown reason !!!In hindsight I am pleased we didnt put a window in this wall - it keeps the room nice & cool & also gives me more wall space to hang things on.Thank you for staying with me through this lengthy ramble dear friendsI shall leave you with these pics of Miss Pippi \"paying me back\" for entertaining the idea of possibly adding more cats to our home !!!!!How dare I ???!!!She has taken up sleeping in my lovely Tilda lined suitcase as retribution !!Take that you terrible Mother you !!!!!!!!!Go give those furry friends a gentle pat & tell them you love themWith much love & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Miss Pippi x0x0x0x0"},

I have read mine already (yes - I know !!) & thoroughly enjoyed it, just as I knew I would.I LoVe Danielle's writing & after sitting chatting to her I can honestly report, she is a lovely friendly, very down-to-earth person with a great sense of humour.In the lead-up to Christmas - when I should have been concentrating on my orders - I decided I wanted to make myself a Tilda Tree just like the ones I made hereI had purchased a larger size rustic pot & traced off the largest tree pattern ...  I wanted it NOT to be Christmassy, but something I could leave up all year round.After walking past it for a few days (as I tend to do ...) I decided it needed some small cream bells hanging from the branches !!A quick google search took me to an etsy shop that had the exact cream bells I wanted for the princely sum of $3.50 for a packet of 6 !!Just Perfect !!!However ... when I went to purchase the bag of bells, etsy promptly informed me it would cost me $28.87c to post the teeny tiny package ALL the way to New Zealand !!I don't think so somehow !!!Time for Plan B ... whatever that might be ???!!!I found a rusty tin heart & spray painted that cream instead . . . ..  .  .  .  which will suffice until such time as I can be bothered painting fiddly bells myself !!Well dear friends - it is hot out today but there is a gentle breeze blowing through our deck area - Miss Pippi is asleep in her banana box & Blackie is in the cool of the wood shedHappy New Year & all that kerfuffle !!!!I am off to try this delightful tea that my stepson gifted me for Christmas . . . black rose tea which looks rather like potpourri but smells deliciousThanks so much for stopping by todaywith much love & friendship to you ALLJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},

{"title": "Craft Fairs and Teddy Bears", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2016", "text": "Friday Greetings dear friends & readers,The Craft Fair last Saturday was somewhat of a wet & windy affairI have pinched borrowed this photo from the I-site website & it shows the rather damp conditions.That is my stall under the blue gazebo where the arrow is pointing.I only got to snap a couple of pics of my stall & now that I look at them, I see lots of my crafts had blown overBecause I generally only do this one stall per year, I am rather ill-equipped for outdoor marketsI just use The Mr's Moto X gazebo which doesn't have any sides ... I think in hindsight, I would've been better with sides - they would've given me alot more protection from the elementsThough we only had one real wetting shower come through, the wind was constant all day long & lots of things blew over or hit the groundI must confess .  .  .   it felt like a rather loonng day.On a positive note, thanks to Sue who came over from Hamilton to say Hi, to Amanda who came all the way from Patetonga to collect an order from me, & also to all the people that stopped by to purchase or to say Hello !!It is always a great opportunity to catch up with customers both old & new.Amanda purchased a rustic Angel doll from me & sent me a gorgeous photo of her happily hanging in her beautiful new Home.My neighbour at the Fair was an old friend Julie ... who is currently running a business with her daughter Bridget called \"Bo and Co\" ... sewing beautiful girls clothingYou can read a wonderful interview about the girls new venture here at Cupcakes and BuntingMany thanks must go to Julie for coming to help me so many times when my creations hit the ground !!!One of my happy memories of the Fair is of an older gentleman leisurely browsing at all my crafts who took the time to tell me \"you have a real vintage country look to all your work\"His compliment made my day.The night before the Fair I managed to hastily put the last stitch in these little fabric trees ... a pattern from my Tilda book \"Homemade & Happy\"Though I had purchased the rustic pots a year ago, I had never done anything with themI used up some of my Lynette Anderson fabrics for the trees & the trunks are made using actual tree branchesI did sell the red one & hope to make some more of these - perhaps using some Tilda fabricsWhen I completed the black/cream doll for my friend Christine back in this post she asked me if I could please make her two teddy bears in the same black/cream colourways.The pattern Christine wanted was an old Teddyworks design called Simple Simon.It had been many years since I had made this pattern up & I must admit I had kinda lost my confidence a little bit along the way .... as you doTwo pair of pants, two bodies/heads & arms & legs ready to be assembledThis pattern is most unusual in that you make a calico body weighted with pellets, then joint the fur head to this.You then make the arms & legs from fur & these get inserted/stitched into the clothing at the finish.This makes him a very flexible bear indeed.I had some string mohair in a pale cream colouring so I decided to use this as felt it would go perfectly with the black/cream colour schemeSimon And SimoneAlthough the pattern is basically a boy bear ... I like to make a girly version too ... so for her I added a hair bow & some pretty embellishments to her jacketThe boy version I added a small bow tieConsidering what horrors they were to create ... I felt they turned out rather perfectly ... as did Christine when she collected them yesterdayAt the very end of the pattern this is what the designer has written ...\"He looks great sitting amongst a collection of bears ... he is extremely poseable & can sit in positions that most other bears can only dream of ... \"How absolutely right they are !!!Thank you So Much for your visit today dear friends & readersTomorrow its the Weekend !!!As I am fighting a headcold at the moment I plan hope to do Not too muchWith a lemon drizzle cake in the oven & the latest copy of Simply Vintage Magazine ... would you care to join me ???with much love & friendshipJulie & the furry onesx0x0x0"},

I rescued it from her rubbish pile & it made the perfect spot to display my tree orniesI have scented each tree with some cinnamon/clove oil so they smell quite delicious.I have finally completed the second trunk .  .  ..  .  . the rusty brown one in the backgroundOnce again, The Mr made me paint it with anti-rust protectant paint after I scrubbed it thoroughlyThen I used some leftover cream wall paint as an \"undercoat\" to give me a better coverage as I had decided to paint it  ...   Pink !!!Any painting projects around here are usually done under serious supervision .  .  .  & this was no differentI'm not sure which is the trickiest . . . cleaning the pink paint OFF the cat or picking the ginger hairs OUT of the paint work at the end  ???!!!I gave it 3 coats in the end .... all using testpots Resene Pale Rose & then once dry, I light scuffed up the edges a littleA hastily thrown-together display on topI am thrilled with my new/old trunk & an added bonus to this project is that I can now store some blankets & linen inside the trunk as well.Having been born wild, Blackie has always had a definate preference to be Outside during the day.  But this past week I have noticed him sneak inside & curl up a the end of my lounge by the French Doors where the afternoon sun streams in . . . amongst my potted baby's tears cuttingsMiss Pippi ???

{"title": "A stool, a rack, a trunk  .......... & worms that pee ...........", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2016", "text": "Happy Friday dear friends & readersA couple of weeks ago my friend Jan informed me there was an old wooden stool at the local Op Shop for only $5 !!I was on my way to babysit Alec so I popped in & purchased it on my journey.It sat in my car for 2 days before I took it out of the boot & bought it inside.When I looked at it in front of the fire that evening .......... I wondered what on earth was I thinking ????!!!!!!!The paint work in my photo looks quite okay .... but in reality it was decidedly tatty, chipped & tired looking.The seat was hideous & had no padding whatsoever - although it DID have about 500 staples holding it in place !!I removed the seat cover firstly (yes all 500 of them !!!)Next I painted the legs cream & then I found a large offcut of foam rubber to add some deep padding to the seatI covered the seat with some of the gorgeous Sanderson Oilcloth that I was able to buy frommy lovely friend CatherineThe edge of the oilcloth had the manufacturers details on it - rather like fabric does - so I cut these off & affixed them to the base.Somewhat of an improvement don't you think dear readers ??While I was painting the stool legs, I also painted this magazine rack which I hauled out of the sleepoutThough I forgot to take a \"before photo\" it was plain dark wood - rather similar to the one I did in this postPainting anything slatted can be time consuming & fiddly but I always especially enjoy the embellishing part at the endThe Mr arrived home from the farm last month with these 2 old tin trunks on the back of his UteI danced around merrily with much excitement & glee .  .  .The grey one is an old ammunition trunk . . .  it had been used to store gunpowder in.I did not ask The Mr how he disposed of the gunpowder - but I think I am fairly safe to say he did not toss it in the burning hole !!!!After a good scrub The Mr made me coat the entire trunk with anti-rust preventative paint ... this part of the revamp was boring, uninspiring & time consuming . . .Then I gave it 3 coats of my cream wall paint Cottage CreamAfter studying the top I decided to paint the cross part in red . . . I used my testpot Resene Persian RedAfter 2 coats of this I decided No - too dark/too brownish/ not happy !!So out came my nearly-dried-up-testpot of Resene PohutukawaMuch better .  .  . & much more the deep rich red I was visualisingI have not sanded/distressed the edges of the trunk yet ... I am still undecided about this as The Mr thinks I should leave it as it is.What do you think dear readers ??  Leave as is or sand the edges ??This tin trunk is going for sale in my Cottage but the largest sized one - yet to tackle - will be going in my lounge.I am not too sure what I am doing most of the time ... but I must be doing something right with my worm farm because those little worms are pee-ing like crazy !!!The set up of the worm farm is structured so that everything liquid that comes out of them goes right down to the bottom layerThis reservior has a tap on it so you can access the worm tea/juice which makes the most amazing food for your plants, pots & your vege gardenI had been asked by several customers if I would be selling any of this liquid gold so this week I was able to bottle some up for sale .  .  ..  .  . as well as using it continually myself on my plants & the garden.Thank you so much for staying with me through this lengthy rambleThe sun is shining today (for a change) & it is nearly The Weekend !!I hope it is a wonderful one for you ALL dear friends,Thank You all for your visitsWith much love & friendshipJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I embellished my angels heads with a twine wreath which I had threaded with a few pip berries.Way back in June, my friend Elaine gifted me this gorgeous linen teatowel below for my birthdayI LoVeD it  .  .  .  .  but decided it was far FAR too nice to use to wipe dishes with !!!So it sat in my bedroom for several months until I decided (last week) to make it into a cushion.I simply divided it into 3 parts ... a front, a back & a decent couple of inches for a flap to hold the insert in.Then I just sewed straight down the sides - right side facing OUTI quickly ran up a rectangular shaped insert using an old thin cotton sheet & stuffed it with waddingThe addition of 3 hot pink buttons & I think the back is equally as pretty as the front.Voila . . . a teatowel becomes a LoVeLy cushion to enjoy.Dear Blackie is another \"lovely thing\"     (Yes Pippi you are too but its Blackies turn today !!!)When I first rescued Blackie & bought him inside he was the wildest, hissy-est, spitty-est, clawing feral thing you could ever imagineOne attempt at patting him or a gentle word, & he would disappear under the bed for the entire dayHe still prefers outside to in  .  .  .  . but these rainy days have seen him have a bit of a change of heartI do most of my cutting out down on the floor & he likes to ummm -  \"assist me\"A young friend is having her first baby soon & I wanted to make her a baby giftAs they have chosen not to find out the babies sex as yet, I decided to go with non gender-specific bright colours to be safeI made her an Owl fleece cuddly rug, a bandana bib & a wool blanket rabbit rattle My young friend, the mum-to-be was delighted as she is a colour loving girlWhile I was making the bandana bib for the gift, I ran up another four from some soft flannelette that I had on handThis is a free pattern available from * here *I usually try to keep a few colours of the bibs for sale in the Cottage & also for my present box.If I ever need to do any intricate stitchery work now, I usually do it during the daylight hoursMy eyesight is no longer so great at nights ... but I do enjoy some repetitive stitching that's not too complicatedThese felt mice christmas decorations just foot the bill perfectlyI have been stitching 10 of them over the last couple of weeks, in the evenings while watching T.V.I have displayed them on this miniature tree, once again to sit on my stall table at the craft fair.Now I mentioned I had cut out 10 . . . . well I am actually missing two & I am quite certain that a small ginger 4-legged being might have some knowledge of this !!!And lastly dear readers - while we are on the subject of  Lovely things - I got to look after my dear grandson Alec three times last week He is such a delight as he discovers the outside world & all the adventures that it holds.I hope that your week is going tickety-boo & that the coming weekend is wonderful for you allBe kind to yourselves & to each otherThank you so much for visiting with me todaywith much love & friendshipJulie & the furry ones x0x0x"},

NOT the cat(tho' somedays the cat would be for sale .................. or even free !!!!!!!!)The men have been & removed the blossom trees that I wrote about hereConsidering the wet weather & the soggy ground, they did a great job of not making too much messThe very next day the Mr went out & purchased 4 new weeping blossom trees prunus something something ... & we planted them.They are a slow growing, later flowering, weeping variety that will NOT grow up into the power linesI now have 2 large piles of this below ... to spread on my gardens-  one pile out the front & one out the back  - I look back at my life & I wonder what happened in my life that I now get excited about piles of mulch !!!!????Perhaps I have a chromosome missing somewhere ...................During the past year - particularly once the Mr broke his leg ... I got waayyy off track with alot of thingsI feel as though I have spent most of the year just chasing my tailGradually I am getting back on top of things though it is a long, slow processOne of things I got way off track with was my vege gardenI let it go to weed & then when I did manage to weed it, I flung veges in willy-nilly with complete disregard for my moon gardening calendarAll my broccoli & cauli seedlings, my beetroot & several herbs bolted straight to seed - it was soooo dishearteningI am feeling good about my garden again now that I am diligently planting by my moon calendar - which tells me when to plants things that produce above AND below the groundI have lots of new veges coming along & we are almost ready to eat our first lettuces of the seasonThis little wooden bowl below was found in my craft cupboardI think it was left over from this old post *here* where I made \"little bowls of prim\"I loved it & wanted something to fill it .... but wasn't quite sure what ??I accidently tipped over a bag of Tilda scraps in my sewing room (I keep every single scrap of Tilda offcuts)  so this inspired me to make some Tilda hearts to fill my bowlI added a tiny mother of pearl button to each heartInstead of stuffing them with wadding I filled each one with dried lavender ... they smell heavenlyThe \"Home\" button is old & I think is a Nikki Tervo ceramic buttonFunny how something so simple can make me feel so happy The garden is coming back to life after winter & it feels like new things burst into bloom each dayIt is a pretty time of year & reminds me why I love spring so much.Thank YOU so much dear readers for stopping by today to visit with meYour visits & your comments are so appreciatedI hope the coming week brings you only good things,with love & friendshipJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Christmas .....................  And Candles", "date": "Wednesday, October 5, 2016", "text": "Good Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersAs we have had constant rain since I last posted ... there has been quite a bit of productivity from my Sewing Room.Now I know alot of you will be groaning when I mention christmas ... but it was time for me to finish some Santas that I began several months ago.I have rebooked a stall at the craft fair that my local town hosts each November opposite our beautiful rose gardens.Last year I found the christmas items on my stall were rather popular.This Rustic Santa above was my first completion ... he is an old  Woodcutters Daughter pattern (now Theodora Cleave)On the instruction sheet Barb has written \"I especially love this Santa\"  ... well he is one of my favourites too. I have made him a few times now for gifts & to sell, & I treasure the one I own myself.  ...........  I just adore him with his quilted teadyed jacket & his rusty tin embellishmentsNext Santa to be completed was this fellow called Prim Olde Santa by Kerry Daly of Primitive Country TreasuresThis guy is lots of work with all his toys & trims & attachments.The raggedy doll is gorgeous & I was able to find a lovely olde worlde christmassy fabric to use for the stockingI scented the cinnamon sticks in his stocking with a touch of christmas pine & spice oil & he smells rather divine.These two stitcheries were unearthed amongst my christmas patterns ... one was completed, the other just begun.I managed to finish stitching the last one ... Cottage Garden Thread \"Kangaroo Paw\" ... & made them up into little lined christmas bags.This is an old Country Friends pattern ... once again, I have made this a few times now & it's a favourite of mine.....  Simple ticking fabrics for the backs ....This gorgeous woven christmas trim - purchased from my local patchwork shop Stitchin Stuff  just yesterday - was perfect to complete the bagsEarlier this year as we embarked upon our renovations, I had to unpack several wallunits & cabinets in order to move them out of the lounge room,I came across some lovely teacup sets gifted to me & never ever used so I decided to try making some soy candles in them, as a change from the teacup pincushions I usually make.I purchased some soy candle wax & some wicks online ... & then .......  nothing further happened !!!They all sat in the spare room gathering dust !!!Last weekend I finally found the confidence to give it a whirl.I must be honest & admit I rushed with the first batch ... & paid the price for it.The result was several air bubbles in my candles & one of them cracked as well.   These ones will be burnt myself, gifted or sold as \"seconds\".The second batch I did a little more research, took my time & had a much greater success rate.I found it helped to warm the teacups just ever so slightly first.The first batch were fragranced using Mulled Wine & for the second batch I used Lime, Basil & Mandarin as I felt this suited the pretty green of the teacupsThis old 2 tier wrought iron stand - unearthed in the haybarn & repainted by moir - is perfect for displaying them on The next batch I plan to make will be scented with either orange cinnamon or lemongrass & ginger fragrant oils There is something so therapeutic about making soy candles - especially when the weather rages around outside ... you are tucked away creating delicious smells in your kitchen !!!Thank you dear friends & readers for staying with me through a lengthy rambleI hope your week is going well & that you are kind to yourselves & to each otherThank you for your visits todaywith much love & friendship & kindness to you allJulie & the furry ones x0x0xphoto at the bottom especially for you dear Willie cos I know you will mention they are missing today !!!  :-)"},
{"title": "Timeless Black & White ....... (or Cream)", "date": "Sunday, September 25, 2016", "text": "Rainy Sunday Greetings dear friends & readersI have been trying to do a blog post for sometime now & even though I had the photos .... the words just would not get themselves onto the page !!!My lovely friend Christine popped out for a cuppa & chatted with me about a new doll she would like me to make her.Christine is currently introducing touches of black & slightly off white into her beautiful home.She wanted me to make a specific doll for her ... a raggedy pattern called Sunshine - a Lil'blokes designBut she did not want ANY raggedy red in the dolly - just black & off white or creamLittle Miss Sunshine was such a pleasure to create for Christine ... I always love the timelessness of black & white Christine did not want raggedy red hair either so I used black perle cotton to stitch Sunshine's hair ... I wasn't sure how this would look but I think it really suits her with her monochromatic colour schemeAfter walking past her for a day or two & feeling that something was missing, I realised she needed a toy to holdThis little black teddy bear was in my craft bits & bobs so I gave him/her a cream bow & heart button embellishmentAahhh much better now she has a little friend for companyChristine was thrilled with her dolly & texted me to say she was most happy in her new home surrounded by other dolls & bears.You can read about other doll commisions I have done for Christine *here* &  *here*The garden is just coming to life after our long wet winter & lots of trees are bursting into flower - the magnolia below is in full bloom at presentWe have many cherry blossom trees on our property - 7 of the flowering cherry blossom variety prunus awanuiFive of them are planted running parallel to the grapevine, but these will be getting removed in a couple of weeks due to them continually growing up towards the power linesThis one out towards my Cottage will just be getting a heavy prune ........ which will be great because it shades my vege garden a little too much.You can see by my photos, it is still raining here ... these days are good indoor days ... with the fire roaring there are always painting jobs to do, even if it IS only Santa's bootsAnd as you can see ........ I have constant supervision ........ even though the Supervisor does get a little weary at times !!!After the topsy turvy-ness of our renovations, I somehow ended up with 3 broken lamps,  one of which required a trip to the electrician.This lamp here sits beside the couch by our fire & it is a great stitching pozzy on wintery nights.After repairing the switch I decided it needed a new shade, but I didn't want to shade too much light as I find it difficult enough to see at nights as it is.After removing the old cover, I wrapped the frame of the shade in lengths of cotton fabric & then when I was finished - it all needed a bit of a haircut trim.I added a sweet raspberry coloured bobble trim to the base but Oh it needed something more ...........Some crochet flowers would be a nice touch but all I had were these in a gawdy yellow colourHowever, what I DID have was a paintbrush & an old-nearly-dried-up pot of resene \"pohutakawa red\"I could paint them couldn't I ???   ..... Why ever not ???!!!I just glued the flowers on at random ... I love the effectJust simple & wonderful Thank you all for your visits this rainy weekend dear friends & readersI shall leave you with this photo I snapped this morning of the tui that visit us here now the blossoms are floweringMiss Pippi spends hours figuring out how she can taste test one !!!I hope you all have a wonderful week aheadwith much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "The Purple Cupboard", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers from Wintery WaikatoLate last year my friend Joyce & I were having a cuppa together & I was telling her about some of my revamps.Joyce works as a Volunteer at the local Church Op Shop.\"There's a cupboard at the shop you might be interested in\" she mentioned .... \"it's only $3\"My ears pricked up !!!  \"Yes please I definately would be interested\"\"It's kind of a wooden bedside cupboard\" she informed me \"you could paint it up - I'm coming out this way tomorrow, I'll drop it off to you\"There was only one small teeny tiny detail that Joyce forgot to mention .  .  .  ..  .  .   the $3 cupboard was painted bright purple !!!When she unloaded it from her boot & sat it on my deck, I thought The Mr was going to burst a foofoo valve !!!And so the purple cupboard sat at the back of the sleepout - abandoned & forlornThere were at least 2 occasions when I attempted to clean out the sleepout & The Mr dragged \"that hideous old purple thing\" over to the burning heap.But I would always drag it back again.It was in such rough condition that it would require a major overhaul in order to ever on-sell it again.Then last week when I was tidying up the Cottage decking an idea came to me.I dragged the purple cupboard out of the sleepout & set it up on my deck to paint.A rummage in the back of my craft cupboard & I came across 1 1/2 testpots of Hot Chilli red paint from Resene  .  .  . this would have to do !!After giving it two coats I realised I had completely forgotten about the drawer I only gave the cupboard a good wipe down - really it needed stripping, sanding & quite a substantial amount of workBut I had neither the time, the energy, nor the inclinationHowever once finished, the drawer painted & the wooden blocks (feet) painted & secured, it looked totally transformedThe 1 1/2 testpots were just enough to give it two thorough coats.  .  .  & the purpose of the newly painted cupboard I hear you asking ???Well, down the end of my lounge in front of the french doors, I grow my babies tears in little potsI find the warmth, the light & the late afternoon sun just perfect for getting them establishedPlus it is out of the way of too much foot traffic (especially the 4-legged variety)Note to self ......Julie finish scraping the paint from the windows !!!!!!Once these little pots are established I plant them up into vintage aluminium teapots & china cups to sell in the CottageThe purple little red cupboard would be ideal for displaying all these plants on the Cottage deck areaI needed something that wasnt too \"precious\" & that could take the odd splash of water spilt on itThe scrap of oilcloth was left over from a stool covering & was the perfect size for the top of the cupboardThese little aluminium teapots just need their doileys mod podged & they will be sealed & waterproofedI asked The Mr what he thought of the purple cupboard now but he declined to comment & just shook his head !!!???I have been the lucky recipient of some gorgeous gifted treasures this past monthKerry popped in unexpectedly with a \"care package\" she had put together for me with such thoughtfulnessThe delicate lime scented candle is still going strong but I must confess there are a large portion of choccies missing !!!!I was lucky enough to have a visit from my lovely friends Claire & her Mum Nancy, from Hawera.These girls were on their way North & we enjoyed a fun lunch together.Claire presented me with some thrifted treasures along with this gorgeous pouch she had made meI loved it so much that I added a wire hanger & it now hangs on my lounge wall (minus the choccy of course!!!)And Nancy, who was knitting in the car, presented me with a wonderful selection of her handknitted dishcloths - which I LoVe & use every single dayThen last week, while waiting on a warrant for my car, I wandered down to visit my friend SallyIt was such a surprise to be given a late birthday gift - some of Sal's beautiful handwork, a gorgeous stitchery in a hoop - which is also now hanging on my lounge wallThank you SO much girls - I am so thankful for all of you, your friendship's & your kindnessWe are experiencing an icy polar blast here in wintery Waikato dears friendsIt is definately weather for inside activitiesLast week when I looked after little Alec, we decided to make a start on some spring cleaning .... as you can see Alec was sooo helpful !!!!Thanks so much for stopping by to visit today dear readersI hope you all enjoy a wonderful weekend filled with things that bring you pleasurewith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A bit of \"a stool thing \" ...................", "date": "Wednesday, August 31, 2016", "text": "Greetings dearest friends & readers,Along with the \"bit of a thing\" that I have for nice soaps, scented candles & vintage wooden chairs .  .  .  I also happen to have a \"bit of a thing\" for stools .... especially slightly vintage ones !!On her last visit to the area my dear friend Carolyn cleaned out her sons shed.Amongst the assortment of treasures that she found in his shed was this old wooden stool with a missing *rung*Carolyn arrived one day & gifted me the stool .  .  . I soon found a piece of dowel exactly the right size to replace the missing rung.Then - as is usual with me - it sat for several months in my sleepoutI decided I needed a stool for the lounge that I could put my cuppa on at nights when I am sitting stitching (the coffee table is a fraction too far to reach & I am usually too lazy tired)After a good scrub down, I painted the stool with my testpot \"pastel rose\" .... a lovely soft pink shadeI had originally intended to stencil a doiley on the top but in the end I simply mod-podged a pretty paper doiley with 3 coats to make it wipeableIt is just perfect for my cuppa ... or even for someone to sit on should we require extra seating anytimeI \"rescued\" these chrome leg stools from the Implement Shed at the farm - there are two of themI removed the seat top off one stool & took in to my local upholstery man Shane, along with half a metre of oilcloth.Shane padded the top up a little for me & made a nice new covering for itA bit of elbow grease & the chrome legs cleaned up well enough so I added 4 new \"feet\" purchased from Bunnings .  .   then I popped it for sale in my Cottage.The stool was purchased just yesterday by a lovely customer who squealed with delight when she saw it !!I look forward to completing the other stool now.I have been cleaning out my sleepout & have uncovered lots of long forgotten about junk treasuresThis candle holder used to be in my lounge, but had been languishing at the back of the sleepout under the window & had gotten a little damp ... hence rust was appearing on the metal \"shade\"Luckily most of the surface rust came off when I scrubbed it, so I painted it with 3 coats of chalk paint - vintage white.To be honest, it was a fair \"sod of a thing\" to paint, especially the shade part of the candle holder, but I am so glad I persevered . . . A light sanding, a pretty pink fragrant candle,  a lace bow, & a key completed the transformationLikewise, this reproduction hat box was hidden at the back of the sleepout - I had forgotten there was a smaller version hiding insideI painted them both over several days, then lightly sanded them  - they seemed rather bland looking so after walking past them for a couple of days, I decided to embellish them with some cutoutsPippi helped me choose which images to use .  .  .Though she looks like she is asleep, she is in fact, studying the Images !!!!!!   Honestly !!!!!I mod-podged the images on to the hat boxes & then gave them two extra coats to seal them both (as well as repairing the broken handle on the larger one)Smaller size one above  .  .  .  .Larger size one below  .  .  .  .Just perfect for beside my wall unit & they can still be used for storage if necessaryThough my Dad has been gone now for 14 years, thoughts of him often pop into my head when I am doing my little painted revamps.You see Dad was a painter for most of his life.My grandson Alec is proving to be quite the painter himself & I often think how much pleasure Alec would've bought Dad had he lived long enough to enjoy him.These little photos came through from Alec's Daycare & the stories that accompany them tell of how he \"tries really hard to put the paint ON TO the paper & not taste it too much!!!\"Incidently the reason he is wearing two hats is because he has a tendency to also put the paint brush in his ear !!!!Bless you little Alec.Today our weather has been glorious & you can definately feel a touch of spring in the airI hope the week is going well for you all dear readersThanks so much for visiting here today & the lovely comments you take the time to leave mewith much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},

Honestly abandonment is one of the  very worst crimes - I would not ever want to catch anyone in the act, I doubt I could be held responsible for my actions.And as for my two . . . .Well, while Blackie could not have cared less, lets just say Madam Pippi is relieved that she no longer has any competition for \"baby of the house\" & is resting up due to her nose being so severely put \"out of joint\" !!!!Thanks so very much for your visit today dear friends & readers,I hope the rest of the week is good & kind to you all,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

{"title": "The Suitcase ............ with definate potential", "date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2016", "text": "Greetings from Wet, Wintery Waikato dearest friends & readers,I have been on a trip down to my Mums . . . most certainly not a pleasure trip .  .  . . . . more of a \"pick mum up & put her back together again\" kind of trip .It is horrible when your elderly parents have falls & accidentsYou feel so helpless & are left with all sorts of mixed emotions about them growing older & life in general .  .  .It doesn't help when you live 4 hours away either .Early last summer the Mr & I were cleaning out yet another shed at the farmI happened across an old suitcase buried under some bags of prehistoric pineconesThe documents in the suitcase were old, yellowed & more or less in tattersBut I thought the suitcase showed  definate potential underneath all that dirt & grime & rat droppingsThough I forgot to photograph the actual suitcase it was identical to this one above - which I use for display in my Cottage. I am annoyed at myself for not photographing it upon my return from the farm but quite honestly, it went directly from my car boot to the hose & got a good waterblasting & a scrub . . .. . . before it was shoved in the woodshed & promptly forgotten about for several months !!Around the time I was experimenting with chalk paint, I decided to give it a couple of coats of the pale blue testpot I had recently purchasedOnce again, it sat for several months in its unfinished state  .... just prior to my trip to Mums I decided to line the interior.I had earmarked this lovely Tilda fabric \"blue doilies\" as I thought it complimented the paint colour so wellIt was very much a case of make it up as you go along - though I did find a really great tutorial *here*I completed the bottom part & Pippi very generously tested it out for me for size, softness & squashy-ness, as well as checking that the suitcase clasps still tasted nice worked okay !!Upon my return from Mums I decided it was time to finish lining the suitcase .... otherwise I felt it was in danger of becoming yet another cat bed !!!!   Lining the lid was a little fiddlier but I did complete it . . .hmmmm . . . . . still I felt it lacked something  . . . . . ? ? ?I added a fine cord to the top & pegged some Tilda Sewing cards onto it with miniature heart pegs . . . . . . . then I tied a length of lace to the handle & a Tilda luggage tag . . .As the lid kept falling backwards, I added a length of braid to secure the lid when upI love my blue suitcase & look forward to filling it with some special treasures that do NOT include any fluffy 4-legged critters !!!!!!I was lucky enough to spend some time on the weekend looking after my favourite blue eyed boy - my grandson AlecHe is walking now & loves riding around on his little scooter that his Granny Julie bought him (from the Op Shop!!!)My friend Sally is one of the cleverest, craftiest, creative folk I know . . . she has recently opened an on-line vintage shop & it is a lovely place to pop by for a looksy* Here * is the linkI love browsing the \"shelves\" of Sal's store & look forward to the day she opens her own bricks-&-mortar store.I hope the week ahead is good & kind to you all dear friends & readers,I am off to brew a pot of tea & delve into this great book which arrived in the post today . . .. . . a treat for myself purchased using some birthday money from my Mum.Thanks so much for stopping by to visit today,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Large Tilda Doll", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,During the chaos of the last several months while we struggled through our renovation, I would frequently pull out my Tilda Books & read them .  .  .. . . try to breathe deeply & remain calm . . .I dream't of making a soft pastel Tilda doll for my new lounge room - a really large Tilda doll - perhaps an Angel ??In my Tilda's Studio book, I settled on the Pink Angel below but I still wasn't sure of what size to make herOne day while browsing a new Variety Store in our town, I came across some child's angel wings for the princely sum of $7  .  .  .   & so they came home with meOff  I trotted to my local photocopying shop with my angel wings & my Tilda book in handThe man in there is used to me by now - with my odd ideas & my grand schemes - he enlarged the pattern for me by 200%When I made the body, it fit the wing size perfectly . . . I was on my way !!!I came unstuck a little when it came to making the clothingYou see when I was at school learning maths, I was usually the one to be found down the back of the class with my fingers in my ears & my eyes shut tightLets just say \"I am mathematically challenged\"Trying to work out (& enlarge) all those tiers in the skirt gave me a headache ... it didn't help that I had some unwanted assistance along the way !!!I couldn't afford to just cut randomly into my precious Tilda fabrics, & then get it wrong . . . But we I got there in the endClick on the picture to enlarge it if you wishI so love my Tilda Angel . . . she is exactly like I pictured her in my mind's eye .  .  .  soft, serene & peacefulI must confess I was not a huge fan of the Tilda dolls hairstyle, but decided to stay with this very Norwegian look to keep her a true Tilda creation.The skirt - when finished, would easily fit a small childI had difficult understanding the instructions in the book for making the fabric roses - so I found this youtube video most helpful However, let me just ask you one tiny question ... have you ever tried making fabric roses, following a video whilst you have a small furry being on your lap trying to help you ???!!!It brings new meaning to the word patience !!I embellished her neck with a vintage brooch gifted to me by my youngest son a few years back.My Tilda Angel hangs on a wall in my lounge room beside some pretty thingsEarly last year when my friend Gail closed her Gift Shop I purchased this cushion from her at half the marked priceIt had been locally made & I loved itBut I didn't love the purple crochet \"basket\" holding the flowers.I stashed it in a bag & threw it in the top of my wardrobe & promptly forgot about it ...... until last week when it fell down & hit me on the head & reminded me it was time to do something with it.I unpicked the purple crochet \"basket\" & replaced it with a cream crochet doiley .... & while I was there, I replaced some of the brighter, gaudier flowers with softer coloursI love it all the more now & found the perfect spot for it on my couch.I have had another birthday go by dear readers - 56 years around the clock of lifeGoodness me !!!I received some really lovely gifts from family & friends . . .Oh how I adore my patchwork mini quilt (made by my dear friend Leeanne) bottom left. . . & enjoyed my day spending time with my precious grandson.But I think the thing that excited me the most ... something I have coveted for quite sometime now ... gifted from my eldest son & his family Yes - a worm farm !!!! Great excitement indeed !!!!(& hard to photograph on this rainy dull day)Thanks SO much for stopping by to visit me today dear readersI hope you all have a wonderful weekend & find some time to do something special for yourselveswith much love & friendship to you ALLJulie & the furry onesx0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Painted Book Bundles ............. A Simple Tutorial", "date": "Friday, July 8, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,As promised two posts back, I thought I would share today a simple tutorial for making painted book bundles.The books I used were 50c each from the Op Shop .... I like to use graduating sizes but you could use all the same size if you wished.Similarly I like to use 3 books, but you may choose to use more.I glue the stack of books together & then glue inside the outer covers also ... this stops them slip-sliding around when painting.Also I glue any rough or torn corners of the books cover or spine down - this creates a smoother finish after painting.I just used my cream wall paint but any water based paint will do ... testpots are wonderful for this.A little tip .... when I am painting anything during the winter months, I sit it by the fire for awhile before hand ... this warms the article up & allows it to absorb the paint easier ... if you don't have a fire, sit it by the heater, or even in your hot water cupboard for an hour or two.My stack of books took 3 good coats as I wanted to cover the red really well & kept seeing a slight pink tinge coming through.I painted mine over the course of a couple of days - be patient & let them dry thoroughly between each coat.When you are happy with the coverage, its time to lightly sand the edges to give it a timeworn appearanceI just use a medium grit sandpaper & lightly go over all the edges & the spine of the books.Now the fun part begins   ......   embellishing !!!!Firstly I glued a doiley to the top of my bundleThen I found a length of wire edged ribbon just enough to tie a big bowIn my craft stash I found a small birds nest & a bird ... so I hot glued these to the topThe $2 shops sell packets of small (fake) birds eggs ... so I added some of these to my nest.... then some ribbon roses to my bow ...I decided this was enough embellishment for my shabby chic book bundle  This got me thinking about all those prim lovers out there . . .you could easily tea dye your doiley quite strongly, cut a length of hessian, fray the edges & use this to tie a bow, then embellish this with some rusty stars or hearts & a key perhaps ???The possibilities are endless .  .  . Here is the pink shabby book bundle I made two posts backA couple of weeks ago I taught this simple tutorial to my friend Gails, craft group.  This is what the ladies had produced when they next met up . . .Liz painted 2 book bundles & used ribbon & buckles to create a \"belt effect\" to secure them  Gail also made 2 bundles - hers were more of a shabby chic styleI loved Joyce's one although my photos don't do it justice ... she embellished hers with a vintage card featuring lily of the valley, then crocheted a lace binding & a butterfly - simple & effectiveSharlaine had missed the meeting so made up her own version of \"altered book art\"All really lovely & diverse ideasMy friend Sally writes a blog that I love to visit over here at Covet & CoFor those of you living in, or planning a visit to the Waikato area, she has listed her favourite vintage shopping haunts ... if you wanted to pop over & have a read - Sally has a wonderful blog.Finally dear readers, Blackie has a \"revolving door\" attitude to this life & this \"home of his\"Though he has baskets & various vintage blankets dotted all over the house for him to curl up on ... he has taken to pulling the cover off my sewing machine & curling up right behind it on my desk (even tho' he can barely fit his rather ample derrier in the small space !!!)As you can well imagine - this makes sewing somewhat difficult ... & I have yet to find a way around the problem!!I hope you are managing some creativity dearest readers ?We are in the depths of winter here now in my little part of the world & it is nice to have some creativity to help keep me sane.I hope you will be encouraged to perhaps give the book bundles a whirl.cheerio for now . . . with love & friendship to you allJulie & the furry ones x0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Not Quite ................. but nearly ..................", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,Goodness - I did not mean to be away so long & I have missed you all.I have been lost in a blur of prepping, scraping, sanding, painting, wallpapering, re-sanding, re-painting . . . .  so it goes on  . . . .Although our lounge is not quite finished (but nearly), our carpet has been laid & we have moved some furniture back in so we are no longer camped in one corner of the room like squatters!!There is still much to be done .... but it is lovely to have our lounge room back again.One of my absolute favourite parts is the large picture window at the end of the lounge ... the colours are ever changing with the seasons & it is a pleasant part of the garden to look out on to.About a year ago I fell in love with the wallpaper that my friend Jane had used on one wall of her lounge.When I went into Resenes to inquire about it I described it to the saleslady as \"kind of like pastel coloured wood palings in the background with white things like fleur-de-lys on the foreground\" !!!She knew exactly what I was talking about !!! (phew)Now believe me friends - when you have not wallpapered for 30 years - despite what folks might tell you, it is NOT like riding a bike & you just hop back on & away you go !!!!Especially when your paper is a pattern repeat !!I just LoVe my wallpapered wall but I certainly would NOT want an entire room of it.The haybarn chair above that I revamped recently      .............................................. Cup of Tea anyone ???My other very-favourite-thing is the cabinet that I painted in this post hereI decided to fill it with some old mismatched china that I used to have stored in the cupboards belowI am so pleased I gave this ratty old brown unit a make-overWe have yet to hang some curtains at the windows(the curtains have arrived but I am waiting on the rods to hang them)Pink planter pot was another revamp ..... found lying around at the farmAnother little corner ... another revamped chair from here & table from hereAs the Mr's leg gradually heals, he has insisted on installing this ugly thing below in a corner of the lounge with a view to building up his strength as soon as the Physio tells him he is allowed to get on itNow surely there is only one thing a girl can do when they have to look at such a hideous item plonked in their new lounge room???Thats right .............. throw a quilt over it !!!!!!!Another little area of revamped items from here I have learnt a great deal from undergoing this lengthy renovation process but probably the 3 most important lessons have been :- (1) Although I was more than happy to just draw a few squares & triangles on a piece of paper, the Council required that we get proper Architect drawings done, due to the fact we were changing our roof line.Proper Architect drawings cost a great deal of money.  When they arrive they will give you an \"estimated cost of extension\"When you read this figure, instead of laughing like a hyena as I did & declaring to all & sundry \"they have GOT to be kidding - it will NOT cost that much\" ... you should take that figure & probably double it !!!! Because it will indeedy cost that much + alot more !!!(2) Never, ever, EVER use tradesmen who are friends - especially plasterers.  They will certainly give you \"mates rates\" quality of work but will charge you way more than \"mates rates\".They will muck you around & will cause you to ring them up & use your \"not nice voice\" to them while they give you all the promises under the sun . . . When they tell you they will be there on Monday, they generally mean Monday 3 weeks away.(3) If your Mr is going to break his leg (or any other bone in his body) TRY to get him to NOT do it while you are in the middle of a renovation.Would I go through it all again ??? ....... not on your Nellie !!!!The past few days I have received some lovely unexpected gifts.When I took a large bag of unwanted books to my local 2nd-hand bookstore the lady reached under the counter & handed me this sweet little doiley\"This looks like a bit of you\" she announced.How delightful .... I adore it.We have had family visiting for the local Agricultural Fieldays & Mum sent this beautiful gift up with my brother ... hand poured soy candle ... the scent is Lotus FlowerAnd then of course Miss Pippi, who brings me unwanted gifts about every 2nd day lately ..... ..... & even though she has licked them & tried to give them the kiss of life, they do not come back to life & run around again (thank goodness)!!*!!Thank you so much for staying with me through this lengthy ramble.I hope to get around to visiting you all at your blogs again this week.I hope the coming week is a good one for us all - take care of yourselves & each other,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Cupcakes & Bunting", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2016", "text": "Good Thursday Afternoon to you dear friends & readers,When I took part in my local craft fair way back in November of last year,  Maria wandered by my stall & took one of my leaflets home with her .  .  .It was early December when I received a lovely email from her, telling me about a new website she was starting featuring artisans & craftspeople .... & would I be interested in her doing an article about me & my little Cottage?Her website was to be called by the delightful name of Cupcakes & Bunting.We agreed to meet up just prior to christmas, & I experienced one of the most pleasant mornings I had in a very long time ... just sitting & chatting with Maria & eating the delicious yummy treats she had bought along with her.I think it is fair to say that since Maria's visit I have been well & truly hooked on salted caramel lava cakes !!!Life - as it often happens - got in the way of Maria launching her website early in the New Year as she had originally planned.She finally managed to launch it early this month & I am her second \"conversation\" which has featured on her website today.If you would like to read a little about what I do here & how it all began, do pop along to Maria's website & have a read You can view Marias website here, & her facebook page hereAnd you can read my interview hereI love the simple, fresh look Maria has given her website, she has done an amazing job of putting it all together, & I look forward to reading future \"conversations with crafters\" as she plans to feature a new artist each Thursday fortnight.Do pop along & pay Maria a visit & perhaps leave her a comment .  .  . I found her new website really easy to navigate my way around also.This has been pretty much what my \"new lounge\" has looked like this past weekYou can do these sorts of things when you have no carpet or floor coverings down !!!!I have been painting various articles in differing states of disrepair .  .  .  the mirror in the foreground was shiny gold . . . the small wrought iron rack in the middle was rusty, as was the upside down half-round table in the background.Although I forgot to take a \"before photo\" the table was well rusted & required a good sanding to remove this before giving it 3 coats of paint .... though it is appearing white in my pics, it is in fact, \"cottage cream\".We lit our first fire 3 nights ago & I have been sitting by the fire in the evenings stitching small yo yo flowers in various shades of pink, to make a table runner for my new/old table.  I think it's fair to say that it can't grow quickly enough for me !!The Mr has been continuing with the clearing out of the farm sheds & I have been there assisting him in my capacity as Steptoe.A large box of old books was unearthed & I wondered what I could do with some of the ones in better repair.Last week I decided to make a Book Bundle  .  .  .  in Pink !!Do you like it & would you be interested in making one for yourself ??Because I was thinking of doing a simple tutorial in my next post ??Do please let me know what you think . . . it seems such a shame for all these old books to not be given another chance at life.Thank you all SO much for your birthday wishes for little Alec in my last post.I am on the mailing list for Alec's Daycare & often receive emails with photos of his \"adventures\" whilst there.I loved this one that came through this week .  .  .  it was his first experience with painting & I especially loved the way he had \"taste tested\" it first !!!I must confess that when I receive these emails, I smile all the way through them with my face about 3 inches from the screen !!!We really are a pathetic lot in this household you know !!The Mr has had lots of evening paperwork to do lately with regards to the farm & also his Moto X Club.While the house is in such an upheaval he sits at the dining table to do his paperwork .  .  . he was worried that the overhead light might be disturbing Miss Pippi so I noticed he had built her a \"little tent\" so it was not quite so bright !!Well dear friends, I am off to make the delicious looking feijoa muffins featured on Maria's website in her recipe sectionThank you all so much for stopping by today & I do hope you will all pay Maria a visit.Please tell her I said \"Hello\".With much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones  x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Feeling \"discombobulated\"  ??? !!!", "date": "Saturday, May 21, 2016", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,Goodness . . . I did not mean to be away for so long.A week or so ago I read the word \"discombobulated\" on sweet Pom Poms blogI liked the sound of the word . . . so I looked it up in the google dictionary\"to confuse . . . if something has you in a state where you don't know your up from your down . . .\"Yes I thought .... that sounds rather like me !!We have been lost in a world of prepping & sanding & painting these last few weeksIt all begins to look the same after awhileI did capture these few pics last week while preparing the new (2nd hand) window for paintingIt pays to do these jobs while small 4-legged beings are locked away somewhere !!I am pleased to report our walls & ceiling are now painted . . . we hired a large airless spray unit & completed the job in a weekend.There are still lots of fiddly bits for me to complete.This large round cane basket was one of my friend Joyce's throw-outs way back in January.I scrubbed it & then promptly left it in a corner of my deck to get covered in dust & cobwebs all over again.Last weekend while we had the spray unit on hire, I quickly grabbed it & gave it a dust off.\"Could you just whip that spray gun across this for me\" I asked my Stepson who had come to lend a hand.Gosh - what would've no doubt been 3 days worth of painting & drying & painting - took approx 3 minutes !!I fancied making myself a large work basket to sit by my lounge chair & toss all my handwork into . . . I thought this large round size would be just perfect . . . so I dug into my treasured vintage fabric stash & found a lovely piece of Sanderson fabric to line the base.Firstly I covered a circle of heavy duty cardboard with 2 thick pieces of wadding.After covering with my fabric, I glued a length of gathered cotton lace around the edge, then glued my circle into the baseJust exactly what I had visualised.This tall wooden wall unit was one of the very few things my first husband & I ever actually agreed upon.We both really liked it when we bought it all those years ago . . . though it has been shifted around with me many, many times over the years, I still love it but it was looking tired, tatty & worn (rather like its Owner to be honest)My friend Jane suggested I think about painting it . . . although it is showing in my photos as a nice golden colour, it was actually a very dark brown stained pineAfter mulling it over for a couple of months, I took the plunge last week & slapped a coat of chalk paint on it . . . This photo above was taken while I was at the stage of \"wondering what on earth I had done but pretending I was just fine & dandy about it all!!!\"I ended up giving it two coats of antique white & then decided to apply the pale duck egg chalk paint over this . . . I felt the antique white was too stark looking & am so pleased with the duck egg colouring . . . you can just see the white peeping through in some placesI have lighted sanded the edges & have waxed the top half but still have the lower half to complete . . . I can visualise it filled with some old china pieces . . . I can hardly wait to fill it up & find the right spot for it in my new lounge room.Guess who turned One this week ??!!]My dear little grandson Alec had his first birthday this week & celebrated with two parties . . . one on his actual birthday . . .. . . in which Granny made him a feijoa cake to enjoy . . .& then another party today with some little friends in which his Mummy made him a chocolate cake  . . .& even though he got a wonderful fancy new bike from his Mummy & Daddy for his birthday . . . he loved the cheap blue Pak-n-Save ball the very bestest of all !!!Happy Birthday my dear wee Alec . . . I have so enjoyed watching you grow & develop your little personality over this past year.Thank you dear friends & readers for your welcome visits today I shall leave you with this pic I snapped of Blackie last night sound asleep in his basket -  yes, legs in the air dear Willie !!  I am always fascinated when I see the perfect line under his chin.I hope you all have a wonderful, relaxing weekend & be kind to each other & to yourselves,with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Bit of a \"Chair Thing\" ", "date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Wednesday to you all,(where on earth did April slip away to I might ask ??!!)I think it would be fair to say I have a \"bit of a chair thing\" going on However I am unsure whether it is the chairs themselves I love .... or the rescuing of them ??Regular readers of my blog may remember these chairs I have rescued in the pastBlog post about this chair *here*Read blog post about this chair *here*Read blog post about this chair *here* The elderly lady Owner of the dairy farm that The Mr & I milk on has gone into resthome care,  so we are slowly clearing out some of the many sheds & barns on the farm full of junk treasures.Due to The Mr being ever-so-slightly incapacitated at present (broken leg) I have been assisting him with this task.However my main reason is to be there in my capacity as \"Steptoe\"  & ensure nothing of any value (to me) gets thrown in the hole !!!! (it should be noted The Mr & I share very different views on the definition of things of value)This chair above was one such item that I \"rescued\".I scrubbed it & painted it just after my trip to MumsThis is how it looked before I lightly sanded/distressed the edges.(Yes dear readers - that IS our lounge in the background - still incomplete!!)This chair above was yet another \"rescue\" ... although I forgot to take a \"before photo\", this chair had been hidden under some sacks in the barn, so once it was scrubbed up, it was in remarkably good condition.This one I chalk painted - first cream, then pale duck egg.As both chairs had no seat padding I decided to take them to my local upholsterer - a lovely man named Shane.  I purchased 70 cms of heavy duty cotton fabric from MyStyle to cover each one.This is the brown chair upon collecting it from Shane ... He voiced his concerns about the strength of it, should anyone sit on it roughly, or rock on it perhaps ?I laughed loudly & told him Not to worry, the chair was for a dolly & no-one would be sitting on it !!!He looked at me mystified . . . surely I was joking??No, I surely was not !!!I especially loved the carved detailing in the back of the chair.This is the duck egg painted chair below, once it was upholstered . . .This one MAY be sat upon - though preferably NOT by muddy farmers pants or 4-legged critters with dirty paws !!!!I LOVE the cane backing & the cabriole legs on the front of the chair.I chose this fabric because it reminded me of a Regency Stripe.I did lots of cleaning & sorting out for Mum while I was down there - once again in my capacity as Steptoe.The 2 items above were pulled out of her rubbish bag ... yes, much to Mums horror & disgust ... & the serviette tray was in the $1 bin by the doorway at Hospice.I gave them all a wax & a lick of paintthe black letter rack turned out especially prettyThe wooden serviette holder looked nice with a fresh new packet of paper serviettes in itAfter painting I lined the little cane basket with some pretty fabric & lace trimI thought it would make a cute tabletop work basket but I realised not everyone would think of this .  .  .  so I made up a small chubby pincushion & needlecase in matching fabrics to add to it .  .  ..  .  .  I often find that sometimes you have to give them (customers) the ideas .  .  .Our Waikato mornings are thick with fog now as autumn wraps her cloak around us here in my part of the worldI took these photos on my return home from the farm this very morning Poor Old Isabella stands out in the fog waiting patiently for it to clearVery often these fogs do not lift until nearly lunchtime. Surely on days like this, you just want to pull the covers up over your head & stay in bed a little longer .  .  ..  .  .  like a certain little fairy I know !!Thanks so much for stopping by to visit me this foggy day dear friends & readers,I hope you found your way clearly enough ?May the rest of the week be good & kind to you all.with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0x"},

I loved this outdoor area with small vignettes of seating away from the crowds.Though I forgot to take a photo, Carolyn & I sat out here - tucked away in a corner - & enjoyed coffee & hummingbird cake.What a delightful way to spend time with such a lovely friend in beautiful & inspiring surroundings.If you click on this link here & scroll down to page 6 you can read a lovely article in our local newspaper about The HummingbirdAnd of course, some purchases came away with me .  .  .They sell delicious artisan breads so I bought a loaf of fresh Olive & Rosemary bread for The Mr & I to enjoyI loved the verse on this wee cushion - I plan to stuff a big wad of lavender in amongst the filling - & how could I resist this little battered suitcase ??I am hopeful that The Hummingbird marks the beginning of good things for my little township of Kihikihi & that more little boutique style shops open up here.It is certainly a credit to Nita & I wish her all the very best ... I know for sure I shall be popping back to visit often.When the builders were banging & clanging endlessly for all those weeks, I would often take my Tilda books down by the pond to have a glance through, to inspire me, & try to lose myself for awhile.In this lovely book Tilda's Studio, the elephant really appealed to me & I bookmarked the page.When I was packing away some summer clothes recently, I came across this linen blouse - purchased many years ago in Australia, worn lots, but not for several summers now.I decided to cut it up to make my elephant.I was really happy with my completed linen elephant .... it is to be a gift for my grandson Alec, who turns 1 year old next month,I am hoping Alec likes his elephant made by Granny Julie.I was especially delighted that I didn't have to purchase anything to complete it .... everything was already in my stash, or like the shirt fabric, was preloved.I hope you have a wonderful weekend dear readers, & that the coming week is good to you all.Thank You So Very Much for your visits today ....hope to see you back again.with much love & friendship,Julie x0x0x0x"},

{"title": "You're excited about A CUPBOARD ????*!*!*!", "date": "Thursday, March 31, 2016", "text": "Good Thursday afternoon dear friends & readersGoodness me ... the last fortnight sure went by in the blink of an eye !!!When the architect drew up the plans for our lounge extension, one of the things I felt most excited about was turning our old back door entrance into a cupboardOur house is small & lacks cupboard space badly, & ... with 6 entry doors already into our house, I was not sorry to wave goodbye to one more!!!The photo above shows the former back door entrance from inside & outsideThis is the new cupboard beginning to be framed in.I had to make sure the builders made it to the maximum depth possible as I wanted to use every last inch of space available.As we are still waiting for our hopeless plasterer I ran out of patience over Easter & decided to fill the holes myself.The Mr came home & asked me if I knew what I was doing??\"Haven't a clue\" I replied \"but after all - its only a cupboard\"This is how it looked when I had filled all the holes & given it two coats of paint.Not too bad for an un-professional I must sayI found some wood in The Mr's shed to make the side brackets for the shelves ... I gave these a paint also.Then - just today - The Mr cut me up some timber lengths for my shelves.Oh beautiful new cupboard .... how exciting you are !!!You see folks, it is to be a craft cupboard to hold some of the supplies that are overtaking my sewing spaceThis is just a practise run ... to ensure the shelves can actually hold things ... I plan to organise my cupboard properly & really utilise the space available. Great excitement !!!!After a young man came along & purchased two gollies from me for a baby gift, I noticed my golly stock had indeed diminished.I thought I had better rectify that, so I cut out two more bodies & made them up .... the first is Baby Annie Golly, a pattern by Angels in Disguise ... she is one of my all-time favouritesI like to give them a little toy in their hands ... this teddy I named Rosebud as I embellished her with silk rosebudsThe next one I made needed to be a boy ... I used Tobias Golly, a pattern by Melody Daly  ... another old favourite The golly fabric I used on his pants was just perfect.You can see in this earlier post here where I made this same pattern up into a wonderful girl golly.A couple of weeks ago I noticed at The Warehouse, they had reduced their galvanised watering cans from $18 down to $10 in their weekly specials .  .  .  so I purchased 2 of them.Wanting to make a gift for my Mums birthday, I dragged one out of the sleepout & gave it the Amulet treatment (for those of you new to my blog, this means I painted it green !!!)Yes, I was tempted to rust it like the bucket I did here, but lets be honest, there are some folk you can give a rusty item to & some you simply cannot .... & somehow I don't think Mum would get excited about a bit of rust quite as much as I do !!!!!Mum loves pansies so I planted some of the \"antique variety\" in the can this morning & then glued a doiley onto the front.  I just need to modpodge the doiley & lace trim & then it will be waterproofed & ready to gift.Our old carpet & underfelt sits rolled up in our incompleted lounge room & Blackie likes to sit on the underfelt in the mornings & have a wash ... I snapped some pics of him yesterday enjoying the autumn sunshineWell dear readers, I am off on my annual jaunt down to Mums to help her celebrate her 87th birthday so I shall be away from the internet for awhile.Thank you all for stopping by today & visiting me ... I do appreciate you popping in so very much.with much love & friendship,Julie & the furry ones"},
{"title": "My First Experience with Chalk Paint", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,I have read lots of bloggers rave about using chalk paint & have wanted to have a try myself for a very long time now.I contacted my clever friend Michelle & she gave me some good advise so I felt confident enough to give it a go.I emailed Ali at Newtons Paints & this exciting little package arrived in my mail boxI have to say Ali was just lovely to deal with & very helpful & informative .... she told me not to hesitate to get in touch if I needed any further information.I watched her painting video here & found it just so helpfulThis little table above had sat in my sleepout for many months now.I had put off doing anything with it as the varnished finish on it meant I would've had to sand it back before painting.Not so now . . .I simply gave it a good wipe down as Ali suggested, then off I went with my first coat of \"Aged White\"I gave it 2 coats of this as I felt I was a little hesitant with my first coat & only applied it rather thinlyI let it dry for just over an hour then I applied my \"Pale Duck Egg\" which I had bought as a test potThis is how it looked after the coat of Duck Egg had been applied.I really liked the way the aged white colour was showing through in placesThen I let it dry for 24 hours before lightly sanding the areas I wanted \"distressed\",  then applying the wax. Ali explained the wax makes it wipeable as the chalk paint itself is quite porous.It also gives a lovely light golden sheen to the finished articleI was so thrilled with my new/old table & am pretty sure there will be quite a few other things around here getting the \"duck egg treatment\" rather soonLooking a bit more blue in this photo than it actually is Some other snippets from my week included . . .This cracked china teacup above was rescued from the Op Shop rubbish bin by my friend JoyceYesterday afternoon while I had no power for two hours I was able to sit & put together a dainty little teacup pincushion.I weighted the cup first with a little fine gravel then added some wadding & the circle of gathered fabric. The rest is all simply glued in place.I had to wait 20 minutes for some photocopying to be completed whilst in town last week.I wandered a few doors along to the Red Cross Op Shop & managed to come away with this darling vintage cane basket & 2 doilies in excellent condition for the sum total of $10.Though I forgot to take a \"before\" photo, this little cross stitch was so gorgeous, but had been framed in a heavy matt black frame which did absolutely nothing for it.It was sitting on the shelf at the Op Shop just wanting to come home with me.I removed it from the frame, used my chalk paint colours & transformed it.Though my intention was to pop it for sale in the Cottage, I did think it looked lovely sitting on my new/old table in matching coloursMy friend Lois asked me to make her two cushions to gift to her sonHer instructions were \"2 large cushions, about 40 x 40, plain blanket backing, reds & blacks, flowers not hearts, anything is fine\"These were issued out the car window as Lois drove out the gate one day in a hurry.\"Oh & both the same\" she added !!I was really thrilled that I managed to get the entire order out of my fabric stash with the exception of 25 cms of black ricrac which was purchased.Lois was delighted & collected them late yesterday - in a hurry  - as always.I have been painting on my outside table & usually have company of the 4 legged variety.I had to quickly nip out to post off a package & returned home to find Blackie had slid off his cushion in his sleepHe is a dear wee soul our Blackie & no longer the hissy, swipey, scratchy feral cat he once was.With the little touches of autumn in the air I noticed the two furry ones are tucking up together alot moreLeg only partly \"\"in the air\" today Willie  !!!!!Thank you so much for your visit today dear friends ... it was so lovely of you to pop byI hope the rest of the week treats you kindlysending much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0"},
{"title": "Losing Things & Rusting Things", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2016", "text": "Thursday Greetings dear friends & readersIn the past week I have lost four things . . . .Actually five things, if you count losing my sanity .  .  ..  .  .  but The Mr informs me I actually lost this quite sometime ago  (around about the time my sons were teenagers!!)  so I guess you can't really count this.The four things I have lost include :-- my purple cardigan- the rates bill- one pink slipper- one dolls armNow funnily enough ... you don't actually realise you have lost anything until such time as you go to get the thing & can't find itAs for the rates bill, well No, I did not know I had even lost it until this little letter arrived in the post saying \"excuse US but your rates are overdue & we are going to penalise you for being 9 days late\"I was tempted to write my own little letter back saying \"well excuse ME but if you actually SAW what we were living in at the moment, you would understand & would not actually charge us ANY RATES AT ALL!!!\"But instead, I sent a cheque off pronto & crossed my fingers that they might overlook the penalty.(I won't hold my breath though!!!)Now luckily enough, even though the other things remain missing - I found the dolls arm !!Which is rather good because I needed it for an orderChristine had phoned me after I made this doll for her in blues, & requested one \"in maroons with quite a bit of dusky pink please\"I began this order before christmas but put it aside to fulfill other ordersIn between times - & our renovations - I lost the completed dolls armThe pattern I used is called Millicent by Lynn Hyland of Lil' Blokes  She is rather a long girl measuring 85cms in length.Once again, her lower dress is all appliqued dolls ...I was able to make the dolls using fabrics from my scrap stash in a mixture of pinks/maroonsChristine especially loved the dolls hair ... this is hand-dyed mohair which I buy from Annabelles Collections, ... her fibre creations are just the most gorgeous coloursI knew Christine liked the raggedy garland I gave the blue doll so I managed to find one last wooden heart in my junk craft drawer. Unfortunately it was mustard in colour, so I gave it a couple of quick coats using a testpot I had in the cupboard - Resene Persian Red.Christine was really happy with her order & keen to get Miss Pink Girl home to make friends with Miss Blue Girl.My friend Elaine moved to her new home over a year ago quite some time ago now .... I had wanted to make her a housewarming gift but something else always cropped up in the way of this.As I forgot to take a \"before\" photo .. this is the picture off their websiteJust before we started our renovations I had purchased this bucket above from Mitre 10 MegaIt sat outside & I walked past it many times in my day.  I did not like the shiny-ness of it & wanted to somehow \"dull it\".The Mr had some acid in his shed which I wiped over it with a rag.  This did serve to dull it somewhat but it also went rather smeary which I wasn't happy with.I did a quick google search \"how to dull galvanised aluminium\" & Vinegar popped up on several sites.So I sat the bucket in an old enamel dish & poured vinegar over it.  Everytime I walked past it I would turn it a few degrees.It began to go lovely & rusty. Oh how exciting !!!\"You have ruined that bucket\" one of the builders commented to me,\"Oh I know, isn't it wonderful!!??\"The bucket sat outside for a week - we now have moisture in the air with a slight touch of autumn tempsWhen I was satisfied with the rustiness of it, I ran cold water over it to stop the process as otherwise, My Mr informed me, it might keep rusting away to just a heap of metal!!Then - much to the builder's amusement & disbelief ... I glued hessian, teadyed lace & a doiley to the outside & then modpodged over it all.I loved how - when the modpodge dried - the doiley took on a slightly rusty tingeA couple of embellishments tied on, a potted red geranium & it was ready to gift to Elaine\"You surely can't give someone a rusty old bucket!!!\" the Mr informed meElaine simply loved it .  .  .  just as I knew she would  :-)Now listen veerry closely . . . can you hear that ???It is the sound of silence !!!  Yes indeedy the builders have finished !!And Thank Goodness too.Two furry friends who are rather happy there is no longer any banging & clanging all day long !!!!I told them that even though I had become rather fond of them, I was happy to see them not come here anymore !!!On their last day I made them my favourite muffins to celebrate.So now I We wait for the plasterer to do his thing. And then we I paint the room. Well friends, thanks for staying with me through a lengthy catch-up post.I am off to pick up my paintbrush as have been painting the outside of the house, but cannot begin work in this area until afternoon when the sun has gone from it.Hope you all have a wonderful week - take care, be kind to yourselves & to one another,sending you much love & friendship,Julie & the furry onesx0x0x0"},
{"title": "Three Small Things .......................", "date": "Sunday, February 21, 2016", "text": "Sunday Greetings dear friends & readers,Three small things emerged from the chaos of my sewing room this past weekConsidering I don't actually have a sewing room at the moment, this is quite an accomplishmentI have moved my machine to the dining table - yes accompanied by the cats - & am using the dining room floor as a cutting table!!This Verse appealed to me very much this week !!!My lovely friend Jane contacted me after I wrote in this post about the gorgeous mustard wool blanket I had been giftedJane inquired if it was to be cut up for craft work & if so, could she please have a rectangular shaped cushion made from part of it??Although I did have \"some assistance\" with the cutting out of the cushion, whilst down on the floor ........ I did manage to complete it for Jane, & also pick any stray cat hairs out of the finished articleThe grey buttons were in my Button Jar & I felt they just set off the finished article nicelyMy friend Donna gifted me this lovely water colour painting two christmas's ago I loved it - especially as I collect enamelware in these colourings ... however the watercolour sat in a folder for many monthsI had wanted to frame it but the only frame I ever came across that was just perfect, had a price tag on it of $89.95 ... which unfortunately was out of my budget.If they had just removed the \"8\" from in front, I might have been able to afford it!!This little frame was the perfect size & was on sale at The Warehouse for just $12I bought it on impulse because I decided the watercolour had sat in a folder for long enoughAfter two coats of the green Amulet paint that I am so addicted to fond of, I felt it just set off the watercolour perfectly. . . . & I put together this little vignette on my rustic dresser(in amongst the chaos that is currently the rest of the house!!!)When I was gifted a small bag of doilies & old linens late last year, much of it was beyond repair & unusable.However in the very bottom of the bag was this old piece of patchwork, which I think had been a cushion cover in a former life I unpicked the back of it & carefully washed it ... it was very delicate & tore on some of the edges as the fabric was so thin & wornI decided I would like to make it into a small table mat as, although faded, I loved the colours & fabrics & someone had taken the time to hand quilt it at one timeI cut off the torn edges, added a vintage cotton lace & then backed it with a plain piece of cottonThen I hand quilted around the outer edges of the patchwork  ... Pippi made sure I didn't miss any stitches & Blackie tested it out for snugability for me !!!I really love how it has turned out & hope to find a special place for it in our new lounge area ... perhaps on top of a small cream table would look lovelyAlso I am so pleased that the old piece of patchwork has been given a second chance at lifeThe pile of white on the very bottom is our lounge ceiling!!!The Mr bought the big trailer home from the farm yesterday & we began the huge task of clearing up our lawn .... indeed it didn't take us long to fill the trailer & there are still at least 3 more loads this size to be taken awayThe red chair is for folk whose arms are too tired (yours truly) to throw the wood way up high !!!We had some gentle rain in the night which will help to green up the brown patches of lawn again.I hope you have a wonderful week ahead dear readers & find some creative time amongst it allThanks to all of you who stopped by ... your visits are so very much appreciatedsending much love & friendship to you all,Julie & the furry ones x0x0x0"},

I can fully understand why people just chose to move out for the duration.During the chaos of it all I have been going regularly on Mondays to look after my grandson AlecI always take some stitching with me to work on while he naps (tho' I must admit that sometimes I am tempted to have a wee nap myself!!!)These wooden noticeboards were on sale at The Warehouse a couple of years quite some time ago nowThey were in the half marked price bin ... my absolute favourite place !!When Leanne Beasley published her Vignette Magazine I only ever bought 3 copies as they were quite expensive here in New Zealand.Issue One had a lovely noticeboard decorated with this gorgeous \"Remember\" Stitchery I decided to use this for my noticeboard revampEach Monday this project would come with me to Alec's house ... I finally finished it just last week.  I framed it using this wonderful tutorial from Jenny of elephantzI laced it tightly over some thin wadding & heavy card ... then I fitted it in the wooden frame to cover the Pukeko'sMy original plan had been to paint the wood cream - but I quite like how it set off the stitchery colours in its natural state.I glued a border of ricrac around the edge of my stitchery.As I had originally purchased two noticeboards I have now traced off my 2nd \"Remember stitchery\" to begin working on on my \"Alec days\"Alec has begun to crawl - more of a \"commando type crawl\" but it gets him across the ground well enoughSarah sent me this lovely photo of him outside on the weekend practising his \"press ups\" ... I just love the determined expression on his little face & he reminds me of his Daddy so very muchThe Mr grows Japanese Millet at the farm as feed for the cows.  Some paddocks of it get made into silage for winter feed & some paddocks get break-fed now to keep the cows going through the drier months.He also grows sunflowers in amongst the millet as they add oil to the cows diet & they love eating them.I was helping The Mr with some farm chores last week & snapped some pics of the gorgeous sunflowers waving their happy faces upwardsNo matter what anyone says ... I believe you can't help but feel happy looking at these gorgeous flowersAnd then Nicole, the girl that milks the cows for us at the farm, took this lovely picture of her young daughter Izzy in amongst them It is the time of year for picking & drying my statice ... I love to see my Dads old ladder fill up each year as I hang bunches from it to dryAnd lastly - & especially for my dear friend Willie - Yes the cats are unfortunately  - back on the table !!! And quite honestly, at this stage, I could not care less !!! (Even though I am ashamed to admit that)Lord & Lady Muck !!!!Thank you So much dear friends for your visit today,May the rest of the week bring you all good, kind & happy things(& no alterations to live through!!!)with much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0x0"},

I have managed to complete a couple of ordersMy friend Pauline requested baby rattles for newly born twin girls as well as another customer Fay, who requested a baby girl rattle also.I made up 4 pink & one blue for them to have a selection to choose from.The pattern is from this beautiful book from Amy's blog nanacompanyMy friend Joyce has moved to a new home & I wanted to give her a small housewarming gift.I remembered that her new kitchen was in modern greys with a touch of red so decided to decorate her a teatowelThe pattern for this design is a free download from KerryAnne's lovely blog Shabby Art Boutique .  .  ..  .  .  though KerryAnne's teatowel has 5 houses across it, I could only fit 4 on mine. I also stitched \"Joyce's Kitchen\" onto my teatowel.As Joyce is a wonderful gardener I popped in a cake of lemon myrtle \"Gardeners Soap\" as well.While in town today running some errands I delivered Joyces housewarming gift to her  ... she was delighted with her present & immediately hung her teatowel on her oven door handle.My little grandson Alec has just turned 8 months old.

{"title": "Making a pact with myself ................", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersPlease tell me what is different (And wonderful) about the picture below ???For those of you that noticed ... Yes indeedy there is No cat basket on the table !!!!!!!! Just a lovely jug of flowers,  a candle & Not a cat hair in sight !!!!(long may it last)                                                                  Last week, I made a pact with myself .  .  .pact ... to agree .... an agreement or compact between two or more parties or nations ...The pact was that I would remove two items per day from my sleepout & either give them away, throw them away or do something with themIt began easily enough .... there are a zillion empty cardboard boxes in there, so it was simple enough to just remove several of those.Until The Mr pointed out to me ... it's all very well stacking up piles on the deck table but you actually need to do something with them!!!So I began with the smallest articles first .  .  .Two small wooden bowls & a serviette holder/ letter rack from the Church Op ShopThe little carved wooden bowl got painted using my Cottage Cream wallpaint, then lightly sanded & made into a pincushion using some of my pretty Tilda fabricsI loved the way the rough sanding seemed to make the carving on the side show up moreThe taller wooden bowl got the same treatment, but I added some pompom trim & braiding to the middle to break up the depth of itThe little wooden serviette holder (or letter rack) got painted & sanded quite heavily to give a real chippy paint effectI then added some brass embellishments & found a cute pack of cottagey serviettes to complete it.This wooden letter rack got the same paint & rough sanding ... then embellished with some wooden butterfly cutouts ... this is able to be hung on the wall or can stand up all by itself   :-)And last - but by no means least - this cheap wooden slatted box got painted & very lightly sanded ... just to add a touch of shabby chic to it I lined the bottom with a lovely scrap booking paper ... actually a \"christmas paper\" apparently ... but on sale for half price !!Just a simple embellishment for the ends completed itI have been lucky enough to have been gifted two gorgeous vintage items this past weekThe first is this unusual teapot ... an elderly customer wondered if I might like to paint & plant it ??I am thinking with its twin spouts it might be useful for when I have large groups having a cuppa here?The second item was this gorgeous old woollen blanket - a gift from my lovely friend, MarieI had not seen a blanket in this beautiful mustard & grey colouring before & I just adore it.Thank you so much for your visit here today ... the sun is out & I am off to garden in a shady spot .  .  ..  .  .  in this garden here actually by the old wringer washing machine.I hope the rest of the week is kind to you dear readers,with much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0x0"},

I remember my Grandmother having one of these shelves with all sorts of bric-a-brac on it ... she was a great hoarder collector my Grandmother ... I am wondering if perhaps that is where I get my hoarding collecting tendencies from??An elderly customer gifted me a small bag of crochet doilies late last year.Most of them were rust marked, torn & beyond repair but some were able to be rescued.In the bottom of the bag was one lonely crochet glove ... it was quite stained but I was able to get it clean with a gentle soak.As I was certain no-one would want to buy one glove without its mate, I filled it carefully with dried lavender ... then I gently gathered the top of it in with some perle cotton & stitched across the openingA vintage pearl button & small crochet flower just completed it ... I really love this single lavender glove & the fragrance is heavenly.The Doves have returned after a long absence I counted 8 here this morning which is great because before they all left ... we were up to 22 !!!!!I have bought some more Dove Mix from Binn Inn & a certain little 4-legged Miss is back on the rampage again ... I snapped these pics just this morningClick on the pic to enlarge it & YES - that is her - up the tree !!!!I am sure if Pippi ever learnt to speak English the first words that came out of her mouth would be \"it wasn't me ... Blackie did it!!!\"As I walk across the lawn to the Cottage throughout the day I could smell this beautiful fragrance ... I realised last week it was a lily bulb that I had shifted last winter when I took out an entire corner garden.A customer commented on it yesterday & that it was unusual to have so many buds on the one stem ... she counted 18 in total.It is obviously thriving in the shadier spot I have shifted it to.A surprise package arrived late last week from my friend Carolyn in the South Island.I was not expecting anything as we no longer exchange christmas gifts.Upon opening the parcel, this little face smiled out at me .  .  .It appears Carolyn had popped in to the local Recycle Centre at the Rubbish Dump & this fellow was sitting on top of a pile of stuff to be sorted ... she posted him off to me with this little note enclosedYes Carolyn ... always room for \"one more\" !!! It was just priceless & made me smile all day long.I shall find him his own special chair & his note will stay tucked into his little jacket always.Hope you find something to make you smile all day long this coming week dear readers,Thanks so much for stopping by today ... I am off to vacuum out my Cottage as my first group is due tomorrow (help !!**!!)with much love & friendship to you allJulie, Blackie & Miss ratbag Pippi x0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Happy New Year 2016", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2016", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & A Happy New Year to you allThe festive season has passed us by in the blink of an eye .... phew I can hear some of you sayingRather than make any resolutions (which I generally keep to for approximately 3 weeks on a good year) ... I prefer this year to live by the words I read on Rhonda's blog .....\"Lets be against sweeping changes & in favour of doing things in small steps.Lets not discourage ourselves by trying for too much or subject ourselves to the tyranny of somebody else's big ideas.\"(Wendell Berry)It certainly struck a chord with me & sounded very appealing.I received some lovely goodies for christmas this year- a stack of books both new & 2nd-hand- beautiful soy Ecoya candles- the latest Adele C.D. (apologies for the blob of light in her face!!!)- gorgeous handmade christmas decorations from a clever friend.The past 10 days have seen a good tidy up of my sewing room & some gentle stitching appearAfter my mammoth tidy up on Boxing Day I decided to make myself a new ironing board cover ... I had come across some vintage Op Shop fabric that I had long ago squirrelled away so decided to use some of this up as I adored the floral patternI had lots of help from Blackie who \"warmed\" the fabric up for me firstI also added another layer of wadding to give my poor old flattened board a bit of a boostIts funny how something so simple - I just layed the old cover on the ground & drew around the outside of it - can bring so much pleasure The entire task took about 30 minutes from start to completionHeart & Dove decorations made from scraps of an old grey army blanketThese decorations were stitched by hand, just a little late gift for a friends first christmas in her new homeThe pattern is a free download available from hereMy daughter in law Sarah has her birthday on the very last day of the yearI had given Sarah my old Janome Sewing Machine a little while ago & she has been attempting to spend some time using it so I made her up a little sewing kit for her birthdayThe needlecase pattern is from Gail Pan's book Patchwork loves Embroidery which Sarah had gifted to me for my last birthdayApart from the purchase of the sewing notions, all the fabrics, trims etc came from my scrap stashWhilst tidying & sorting my sewing room I came across a large sack. I am sure I purchased this several years ago from Davids Emporium in Hamilton.  I seem to recall it was the princely sum of $2.00.I looked at this sack & \"cushions\" came into my head(Yes .... I know ... please don't comment on this sentence!!!)I decided to make some squashy cushions for my rustic outdoor chair . . . as it was raining at the time, I (unfortunately) had some assistance .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  of the four legged variety .  .  .  ..  .  .  . who thought the sack made a wonderful hidey placeOne sack cut through the middle = 2 cushionsFrom The Warehouse you can purchase The Basics range of pillows ... a pair for $6 ... so I used one each inside the cushions as I wanted a soft squashy effect .  .  ..  .  .  & also to simply tie the corners with some jute twine.Really happy with my new cushions & the world is not going to end if they get left out in the odd rain shower !!!Before I close I would just like to show you a photo of my window basket ... each year I plant red/white Impatiens in this basket as I find the red looks striking against the paint colour of my house.This year when I went into Bunnings to buy some Impatiens the lady told me I was too early so I quickly chose a punnet of red petunias instead . . . thinking they would be equally as niceThe petunias are thriving in the basket . . . I am just not too sure when they will be turning red !!!!!(But I do live in hope !!!!)Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friends & readersMay the coming year be a wonderful one for us all filled with all things that bring us pleasure & good healthwith much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Miss Pippix0x0x0x0x"},

I thought he would enjoy the tactile nature of the fur while he is still littleEverything, apart from the fabric, was already in my stash, hence the addition of some remnants of braid across the toe of the stockingFor the back of the stocking I just used up some quilted calico I hadWhen it was lined & finished I decided I had better try the parcels IN it to make sure they did actually fitAnd then we got to try it under the christmas tree, where it is currently sitting waiting for little Alec, who will no doubt be far more interested in the wrapping paper this year I am sureYesterday my friend Lorraine popped in to say Happy Christmas - she had been out in her garden working & remembered me mentioning how I loved lilac trees, so she bought me this generous bunch from her treeThere is just the most delicate fragrance of lilac perfuming the house as I sit here typing.My friend Jane had lent me her stamps a wee while ago.As my friends & I no longer exchange christmas gifts, I decided some handmade cards might be well received this yearI had no idea what I was doing but I knew that I wanted the card to be like a little gift in itself  .  .  .I made a little pocket on the inside & tucked a gift tag into the pocket ... below are just some of the ones I made ...The primitive style ones I made had lovely little brass charms tied to the fronts ...My daughter-in-law Nicole loves all things black/white & hot pink.  I felt that christmas didn't necessarily have to be traditional reds & greens, so I tried to make them one in her favourite coloursI had no black embellishments but I DID have black poster paint, so the white doilies & butttons got my paint brush waved over them.Then I thought ... well what about envelopes Julie??I found some vintage wallpaper & just sewed up square pockets for them with a simple luggage tag attachedI really enjoyed my day of card making ... I could get quite addicted to paper crafts(I think it would be an understatement to say that the house was a complete bombsite by the time I had finished!!!)Of course, I had a supervisor to make sure I stayed on task & glued everything in its rightful place (tho' the supervisor did get a little weary at times!!!)Yes I KNOW ... DON'T SAY IT ..... WE SEE THE BASKETS STILL ON THE TABLE JULIE !!!!!!??????I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a wonderful, joyous festive season & to thank you with all my heart for your visits to my funny little Threadbear life & listening to my ramblesI appreciate each & every one of you that stops by.Bless you all this festive seasonwith much love, kindness & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstocking x0x0x0"},

I think the little shoes & socks she wears just finish her off nicely.Both girls got a small teddy to hold as we can't have them getting lonely with no toys to play with can we??!!Isabella & Baby Annie are on their way to Auckland as I type this & Maria is going to chose her golly ... the remaining one will be put in the Cottage as my Gollies are rather depleted at the moment.Claire came out & asked me if I would be making any more of my \"fat legless angels\" this christmas?I could not for the life of me think what she meant & spent many hours racking my brain ... thinking she surely has me confused with someone else's craft?Finally Claire bought one out to show me .... Oh of course ...Matryoshka Angels from the book Gift by Rosalie Quinlan ... Claire requested them in vintagey pastels so I used some of my Tilda scraps & made up two for her to choose from.Now all I have left to stitch (before christmas) is a stocking for my grandson AlecI have been lucky enough to receive some lovely mail recentlyFirstly - all the way from the United States - from my lovely, kind, thoughtful friend Amy from my vintage marketplace... this gorgeous Prim Pouch arrived totally out of the blue !!I was just so speechless ... Amy wrote in her letter that she felt it would look wonderful filled with some of my drieds hanging up somewhereI am looking forward to saving & drying some seed heads & pods to fill it withI have long been a fan of Amy's work - she makes the most amazing gypsy pouches, bags & other creationsThank You so much dear Amy ... And the second lovely mail I received recently .... my mail lady drove in & handed me a box out of her van\"Inside this box is a tree\" I informed her\"Oh yes, I'm sure\" she replied, whilst giving me *that look* as if to say \"finally Julie, you've lost your marbles\"My  dear friend Catherine & I had been corresponding about lilac trees & she offered to send me one she had dug up whilst out on her garden-fairy roundsI have forgotten to photograph it today but it is residing quite happily in the rose gardenThank you so much my dear CatherineThe 3rd package that arrived was an order of stickers & notepads from Vistaprint Little Miss Pippi - who decided all this christmas mail was rather boring - was more interested in the box than anything elseI put this little collage together of her attempting to squeeze herself in the box for a wee napMy Mum is not coming up this christmas & has announced she does not wish to exchange gifts this year eitherI decided I would still like to send her a \"little something\" but what to give your 87 year old Mum who has pretty much everything she wants ???At the beginning of the month I made up Jenny's Christmas Tea Recipe so I decorated some jars to fill with my tea mixtureI thought this was such a wonderful idea when I first saw it on Jenny's elephantz blogI decided to send Mum a jar of Christmas Tea & the latest House & Garden magazine so she could relax, enjoy a cuppa & a leisurely readI also found time to do a little christmas decorating this past weekThe wooden angel wings (below right) are the only new purchase I have treated myself to this christmasThe tree is up now & I have dotted a few christmassy bits & bobs around to add some festive cheerLittle Miss Pippi found herself a \"new friend\" early this morning - I had my camera handy as she trotted along after her new friend for a good half hour or so ....  .  .  most fascinated indeed with her prickly new friend .  .  .And as for Blackie . . .

Blue Prim Santa from my last post post hung on the wall & she had made a bathroom themed wreath for the corner of the room with Santa sitting in a bathThe teddybears wore blue Santa hats in keeping with the theme.The Master bedroom had its own small tree & bear themed wreathThe middle Santa is a Baker Santa so he was sitting on the kitchen serveryAs you climb the stairs Christine has wound greenery around the bannister railA fairy tree is on the landing at the top ... this was done mainly for her grandaughters ... just magical.more bannister decoration upstairsThe upstairs bathroom is a burgundy colour scheme so - of course - it has been decorated for christmas tooVignettes & displays of Santas in both traditional colours & also white & gold.  .  .  Upstairs above & Downstairs below .  .  .I think one of my most favourite displays of all was a dresser in the dining area ... just quite simple but tasteful & stunning ... I loved the olde worldliness of it allInspired by my visit I came home to put up my own Christmas tree, but after carrying it inside, that is as far as I have gotten to.  Hopefully it will evolve this weekend.I popped into the Church Op Shop last week to drop off a bag of clothes & to say Hello to my friend Joyce who was working there that morningThese vintage sheets were crying out to be purchased ... at just $3 each I thought they were a bargain & are drying on the line today in the sunshine & the breezeJoyce was throwing out some old stock & asked me if I would like this little dish below It had long ago lost its lid & although the inside was marked & pitted, I quite liked the floral china pattern on the outer ... I felt I could turn it into a cute wee pincushion .  .  ..  .  . which I was able to do with a circle of Tilda Fabric which once inserted, I just carefully worked into the oval shape of the bowl. The addition of some lace & a pretty pearl braid just completed it nicely I thought This morning I got up before 5 am as I was unable to sleep & was lying there thinking of all the things I needed to do.  Well why not just get up & DO Them Julie ??!!These little felt mice were finished by breakfast time ... yes I had cut them out the day before.I plan to start a tradition of giving Alec a christmas decoration each year of his own .... some will be handmade & some I will buy.  Then as he gets older, my hope is that we can either craft it together each year, or go shopping & choose it togetherLittle Pippi slept in her basket as I sat at the table handstitching & watching the sun come up .  .  ..  .  . stressful life that she leads!!  I am hoping she doesn't think I will need any \"assistance\" to decorate the tree this weekend !!!Well dear readers, thanks so much for your visit today ... I surely do not know where the last week went to but it just got lost somewhere along the way.I hope you enjoyed your little virtual tour of Christines Christmas Home.Wishing you all a wonderful weekend doing things that bring you pleasureA final pic from Christines Homewith much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0"},

Margaret also likes to give them when someone passes away - she tells me they \"last alot longer than a bunch of flowers & are half the price\"!!!I had two groups in one day last Thursday - this has never happened before but it was simple enough to quickly nip out & re-write my blackboardHeavy showers had been forecast ... I was so thankful they stayed away til the end of the day ... it just makes it so much more pleasant for the groups to wander around the garden or sit on the seatsThe first group presented me with a rather beautiful handmade Thank You Card upon leaving ... one of the ladies handwork no doubtPrior to their arrival I managed to quickly cobble together a bit of a christmas mantlepiece in the Cottage .... I usually have my christmas display done at the beginning of November but appear to have lost the weeks somewhere along the way this month ...A few fairy lights dotted around all adds to the effectWell dear readers - I am off to finish some Santa hats for Christines teddy bears (yes, some blue ones as well as red) ... I shall leave you with this picture of Madam Pippi who insists on \"helping me\" when I am on the floor cutting out fabrics .  .  ..  .  .  but finds it all rather tiring having to \"keep the fabrics warm for Mum\" & has a wee nap on the job.Wishing you a wonderful week ahead & hope it brings you laughter & happy timeswith much love & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstocking x0x0x0x"},

Alec is proving to be quite a social little boyAlec & his Granny JulieAaron & Sarah have purchased a spa pool & at 6 months old now, he is allowed to go in it.He loves the water jets & the bubblesHe is such an adorable wee boy & a delight to all of usWhile Mum was here there was lots of tea drinking & chatter ... I try to always fit in a bit of stitching or creating while we are doing this.I needed to make some more wool blanket hearts for my china bowl in the Cottage (which was empty)These are just made from scraps/offcuts of wool blanketsIts a shame the computer screen is not scratch-n-sniff as the smell from the lavender is divine.For a couple of days the sun shone brightly so we sat out on the deck table ...

I made the pincushion top from my Tilda fabrics & then trimmed it with some cotton lace & a gorgeous tape measure braid I found in my stashLikewise the old tea kettle got the Amulet treatment .  .  ..  .  .  before being \"doiley-fied\" & a babies tears plant popped in the topThis was a rather unusual tea kettle in that it has a swivel lid still intact ... which I unscrewed & attached to the side with some jute twine(This little number was sold this very morning to a lovely customer)Well dear friends, now Mum is home again & the cat basket has been returned to the table against my better judgement  .  .  ..  .  .  as you can see above ...

I have no idea who that belonged to !!!???To add to the great day, I had lovely stallholders as neighbours each side ... on one side a lady selling gorgeous soy candles & on the other side, my friend Pauline selling her Infused With Nature range of productsAs you can imagine, the fragrances coming from either side, were just heavenlyConsidering the week prior I spent many hours wondering why on earth I booked my stall & what possessed me ... I had the most wonderful day after allNow if you are going to expect hope that folk buy from you, you need to support the other stall holders too ... so I came away with a few little purchases myself, as I usually doI also purchased some home-made fudge & shortbread but unfortunately I ate them Pippi ran off with them before I could take a picThis little fellow below got the last stitch put in him rather late the Friday night beforeRustic Santa - an old design by Woodcutters Daugther, now trading as Theodora CleaveI wanted to have him on my stall along with a few other christmassy bitsI was so delighted he was one of the first items I sold & he went to a very lovely customerThe other item I sold two of was my string jars.  I sat down the next day & made two more in country colours .  .  ..  .  .  but it was a conversation I overheard between two customers that got me thinkingA lady who bought one, offered to buy her friend one also & told her friend to choose a colour.Her friend replied that her kitchen wasn't \"country colours\" but very shabby chic & these would look out of place.I thought about this afterwards .... why couldn't I do some shabby chic string jars maybe ??I spray painted the screw bands cream instead of the black I usually use ... then ran a swipe or two of cream paint over the plain hessian I glued to the dome seal.I then glued a crochet flower to the centre of the lid making sure the hole was big enough for the string to come through smoothlyI used some of my treasured Tilda fabrics for the bows & added a Tilda tag with a tiny charm attached.Shabby Chic enough do you think dear readers??Well I am off to continue cleaning my house ... my Mum arrives tomorrow for a few days & despite her macular degeneration, she will certainly notice my dust & cobwebsWhere, oh where is a cleaning fairy when you need one???Hmmmm .... not so sure she is quite the fairy I am after.from PinterestHave a wonderful rest of the week dear readersThanks so much for your visit today - a Very Special Welcome to my new followers alsowith much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi-the-fairyx0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Two Lovely Visits", "date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2015", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersLast week a customer asked me the name of my flowering cherry blossom tree ??Ummm...  \"Prunus something something\" I informed herI am sure she rose up a good few inches in height before telling me it was in fact, Prunus Shimidsu SakuraSo there you go  .  .  .  I had the \"s\" right anyway !!!This past week I have had two lovely visits . .  .the first lovely visitor was my fellow blogging friend Wendy from Charlottes Web who came from the city to see me.We had the loveliest time sharing muffins, tea & chatter & Wendy very generously gifted me this enticing package of goodies belowI have been drooling over the Daphnes Diary magazines when I get a few spare minutes in my day.Thank You SO much dear Wendy - I always really enjoy our catchups.The 2nd lovely visit was my weekly trip out to see my wee grandson Alec, who is growing like a little mushroomI love this photo above where he looks as though he is crawling now, & reading books (which he is not) ... super intelligent that grandson of mine (*wink*) !!!!I have managed a couple more completions ... I had sold completely out of my dainty lavender bags after the last group, so I put some more together over the weekendThe house smelt delicious & I notice I slept a little better that night     :-)When my friend Gail delivered her \"rubbish for dumping\" in my last post, I saw she had some cut out christmas stocking shapes in a bag that she said I could \"do something with if I wanted, otherwise to toss them\"Although she had cut the front shapes out, I had to back them, line them & embellish them.  I managed to do this entirely from my stash of fabrics, doileys & trims, which was great.They are a good generous size, big enough to get gifts into comfortably, but not so big it will involve a small mortgage to fill them.The Mr pointed out to me they were not in christmas colours ... although I personally love traditional reds & greens, I remember from my years in the Gift Shop, not everyone wants these traditional colours nowadays.I pulled an orphan stitchery out of my work basket & completed it in an evening.  It is an old Country friends design called Garden Sampler which I stitched onto Sandcastle fabric.I have made this pattern up before into a Needlecase & always love it.  I lined the inside with some flannel fabric that I had already.I had to laugh at my photo below . . .I had taken the needlecase outside to photograph on my outdoor table as the light was better ... yes thats a little paw appearing in the top left picThe Jersey bulls were in the house paddock roaring their lungs out, & someone was a teeny bit frightened . . . look at that anxious little face.  Bless him, Staying safe by Mum.A few posts back - when I was ferreting around under my house looking for firewood - I came across an old preserving pan & dragged it out, along with the watering cans which I painted & planted.For some reason, when I looked at the pan, I visualised it filled with white petunias. I have no idea why I thought this .  .  .  but that is what I did do & now it is flowering away merrily, the picture in my mind has come to fruitionEvery time I walk out my kitchen door & look at that funny derelict old pan, it makes me feel cheery.Rusty old trikes planted with snapdragons for spring are also cheerful.Well friends, today the house smells delicious as I am dehydrating some homegrown oranges  .  .  . .  .  .  my stocks of citrus potpourri are low again so I am making up a fresh batch& as I work away in the house  .  .  .  one good guess what the other two are doing .  .  . ???Yep - on the table still !!!Please note ... new fleece blanket in the basket !!! We are training Mum real good !!!Thanks so very much for your visit today dear friends,May the rest of the week bring you things that make you happy & cheerywith much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippix0x0x0"},
{"title": "Some Long Overdue Completions", "date": "Sunday, October 25, 2015", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Sunday to you allNew Garden Sign hung up just last week   After spending every spare moment in the garden before my group last weekend, it was lovely this week to catch my breath & spend some pleasant time in my sewing roomI had completely sold out of some items, though to be honest, I did not have great stocks of them to begin with.The herbal mothball sachets (above) were one such item ... so I made another batch this week, then sewed & filled some muslin bags.You can find the recipe for these at the bottom of this post here.6 new golly teatowels waiting to be wrapped individually in cellophaneLikewise I noticed there were no golly teatowels left.I try to keep a nice range of good quality teatowels in stock ready to applique when I need some fresh new ones.When I made the Tilda Teacup Pincushions back here, I wasn't too sure how they would sell.I was pleasantly surprised to notice there were only 2 left so, as I still had a good selection of china coffee cups on hand, I was able to put together some more.I really love the way the gorgeous Tilda fabrics complement the dainty bone china.My friend Gail bought some rubbish out which she had asked the Mr to toss in the burning hole we have at the farm.This shelf was on the top of the bag of rubbish ready for burning.  I asked her if I might perhaps have it.My original intention was to cover it with chicken mesh & plant with succulents but I realised the thin ply on the back would not last 5 minutes once watering began, so I pulled the back & the 2 shelves off the frame itself.Again, my original intention was to paint the entire frame cream,  but by now, I quite liked the blue distressed look of the wood so decided to stay with it.As removing the 2 shelves left marks on the frame inner I ran around it with some dark blue paint.(Incidently I did not have any matching blue paint on hand, but was able to mix some bright blue poster paint that I had with black to get a shade that was \"near enough\")I screwed in one of the hooks left over from this frame I did back here, then hung a $2 shop mason jar from the hook.I teadyed some white lace to age it, then tied a bow & added a tag & a key to the jar.The addition of some pip berries just seemed to complement the blue, but this vase could just as easily be filled with water & used for fresh flowers.This item is going in my cottage for sale .  .  .  I am So happy I saved the frame from the burning hole.These 2 cane doll cradles have sat in my sewing room since before time began !!!(I cannot even remember where they originally came from)Every single time I would tidy my sewing room, I would move them to the front of my desk with the intention to do something with them.Then they would gradually get moved to the back & under a pile of stuff again.And so it went on  .  .  .  .  until yesterday !!!I pulled the old lace off them & gave them both a gentle wash.Once dry, I glued fresh new lace & silk rosebuds to each cradle.I made a mattress, pillow & a small lace quilt to fit each one.Every thing I made was using up scraps of fabric & lace I already had in my stash.The tiny dolls above were half naked in my junk drawer bits-n-pieces basket.They too got a gentle wash & some dainty clothes made for them.It was interesting that something I had been procrastinating about for many years a very long time, only took half a days work to turn into something so sweet & gorgeous.Again these are going as stock for my Cottage .... I am thinking they would make a delightful gift for a wee girl.I hope you all have a wonderful week ahead dearest friends & readers .  .  ..  .  .  filled with lovely things,Lastly, as you can see from the photo below, my attempts at re-training Pippy to not sleep on the table are not quite going according to plan . . .. . . in fact my plans are going so off track, I now have two of them in the one basket to retrain !!!!Thanks so much for popping by today friends,with much love & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Pippy x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Craft Groups & a Revamp", "date": "Saturday, October 17, 2015", "text": "Happy Saturday to you dear friends & readersAnd Welcome to some new followersMy friend Gail had attempted to start up a small craft group when she closed her Shop earlier this year.Unfortunately it was not really getting off the ground & she asked me to come along & offer some suggestions.I suggested they try what Michelle's Kindred Heart Sisters Group do occasionally & that is, all bring along some craft supplies to share & then each one put their own special little stamp on itThis is the mottley odd looking selection we all came home with . . . it was clear this was going to be \"an interesting one\" !!!First off, I decided to cut hearts out of the paper pieces & string them from an old mossy tree branchI stitched the hearts in rows on my machine then tied them to the branch.I stiffened (with pva) some of the crochet flowers & added these to one end then glued the butterfly to the other endI printed off the words \"flowers\"  \"butterflies\" & \"I love Spring\" & strung these on coloured papers alsoThen for the rest of the supplies, I decided to make a lavendar lady doll ... this idea was mainly to use up the soft sculpture face that was in amongst the bits & bobs.She is made over an old knitting wool cone which I filled with dried lavender, then used the pipecleaners for arms, a peg for the neck & then I dressed her.  I stitched the beads & the buttons to cards to make her into a Pedlar Doll, then gave her a basket filled with her wares ... also adding the remaining buttons, pegs & fripperyAn old piece of crochet lace became her shawl, & the remaining crochet flowers got tucked into her tin of wares beside her.I thought you might like to see what the other girls came up with . . .Gail made 3 items, the printed card she framed, then made a mermaid doll using the sculptured face & some silk flowers.   I loved the tray she painted & attached a bunting & the pegs & butterfly ... very shabby chic.Sharlaine made a gorgeous wallhanging using all of her pieces up.  She dyed the pipecleaners to bend as twigs, made the cardstock into swing tags, used all the crochet/silk flowers & beads as flowers to fill her basket.  It was stunning.  The pegs were used up in the top of the actual hanger part but my photo has missed this out.Liz painted her paper pieces black & made a canvas picture, then added embellishments to it using flowers, beads, buttons.She also made a small \"toilet roll person\" using up the other left-over bits & bobs.Joyce decorated a shabby chic frame with her bits & added extra butterflies.  She also decorated a hair band & a heart shaped box with crochet flowers, papercraft & other bits of bling.Fay thought completely \"outside the square\" & chose to make a terrarium up using all her bits based on the theme of \"a day at the beach\".  She made characters using the pipecleaners & sculptured heads & added her own unique embellishments.I thought it was fascinating how each one thought quite differently & came up with such a diverse range of end products.It was actually a really enjoyable challenge.This little wooden bowl-on-a-stand was in the $1 bin at the Op Shop.  At first my intention was to paint it & then make a big plump wool felt pincushion in the bowl part of it.However, it was seeing it on my bench alongside the Fancy Feast Catfood tin that changed my mind about this somewhat.I decided to add the tin to the centre of it & make a small size pincushion, leaving the outer rim for sewing supplies.This was how it looked when I had painted both the stand & the tin, screwed the tin to the centre & was ready to line the outer rim with felt.The tin is painted pale pink & also the lower base of the stand. The rest is painted cream & sanded to distress it.The circle of baking paper was my \"pattern\"This is the completed revamp.  I lined the outer circle with pink wool felt, then trimmed this with a pretty braid.  I made a pincushion in the (catfood) tin, then tied some sewing related embellishments to the stand.  Really quite \"tickled pink\" with the finished result   :-)I have had a large Garden Circle group to my Cottage today - the rain stayed away but the winds whirled aroundThe ladies had a lovely time in the shelter of my deck area having their morning tea.The numbers grew from 15 (yesterday morn) to 29 today !!!!  Bit Frazzled there by any chance Julie ????!!!I will be off soon to find my jim-jams .... feeling rather tired.I shall leave you with little Madam-butter-wouldn't-melt-in-your-mouth in the garden yesterday .  .  .Just click on the photo to enlarge.  .  .  . when I had just discovered she had dug up my miniature tulip bulbs.Thanks So Very Much for your visit today dear friends,Wishing you all a restful weekend doing just whatever makes you happy,with much love & friendship,Julie, Fat Black & Madam Pippi x0x0x0x0"},

I have had some unwanted \"help\" along the way & Miss pain in the Pippi is currently sporting the lovely spring shade of \"Redwood\" on all 4 feet !!!!I was slightly speechless last weekend when some customers arrived while I was mid-stain & commented \"oh those look nice, how much are you going to be selling those for ??!!\"With some birthday money last winter I ordered myself the book below written by Amy Sinibaldi from the lovely & inspiring blog nanacompanyPhoto borrowed from Amy's blogThough there has been minimal sewing recently, I managed to complete my first projects from the book last week.  The Baby Bear Rattles .  .  .  One for Alec to test run & one for the CottageThese were able to be made entirely from my scrap stash.  The rattle is encased in the head part & has a nice loud sound to it.I am looking forward to trying some more projects from Amy's BookThe garden is finally bursting into life & there is much to be done as I tend to hibernate from it all over winter & then am often overwhelmed by how much I have to do come spring.I took my camera for a wander this morning . . .Fat Blackie photo bombing my picture.I only planted this clematis last spring just before the Garden Ramble.This Rhodo was gifted to me by my Aunt who is sadly no longer with us, so I call it Margs Rhodo.I am so pleased this little succulent is finally growing down by the pond area.  I acquired this urn when I helped a friend shift house. It had a large chip on its rim but I liked the shape of it & visualised it lying down with something growing/spilling out of it.  Before it became established, 9 out of 10 times ... the Garden Circle ladies would stand it up & then tell me \"oh I stood your pot up over there, it had fallen over\" !!!  Umm Thanks .... I think !!!???The bluebells & the mauve blue-bells (??) are flowering away happily by the Cottage Garden.The cherry blossom trees (prunus awanui) that have not been bashed by the wind are in full bloom & providing a wonderful home for the Tuis & other birdlife that live here.On a sad note, we lost a beautiful girl last week .... my eldest son & his wife had to make the difficult decision to have their beautiful girl Mina put to sleepMina was my first ever fur-granchild & she was adorable - she lived a wonderful life with Aaron & Sarah & 3 other female dogs of different breeds ... plus 1 cat & numerous hens.She would have turned 9 this month, which is a great age for dogs of this breedRest in Peace beautiful girlYou melted the hearts of everyone who ever met you.Thanks so much for your visit today dear friends,While the sun is still shining I am off to weed some more round the pond area.I hope the rest of the week is kind to you all,with much love & friendship,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Not Much Stitching . . . but . . . ", "date": "Wednesday, September 23, 2015", "text": "Good Wednesday Afternoon dear friends & readersThere has been not much stitching g0ing on here at my funny ol' Threadbear Life of late  ... (or none actually).  .  .  but .  .  .as well as signs of spring popping up at last  .  .  .  there have been other things going on I have always admired these painted Agee Jars that I see on the web & in some stores but their prices are enough to frighten me offLikewise, the cost of proper actual Glass Paint was rather scarey & offputtingSo I thought I might have an attempt using my trusty test potsAmulet on the left & Pale Rose on the rightI found the paint went onto the glassware really easily & I gave them 2 coatsThe only thing you need to remember is they are decorative & should probably not be washed ... although I think a wipe-over would not do them any harmWhen dry I lightly sanded the wording on the jars to make it stand outThese little potted baby's tears plants had sat over winter sloowwly growing so it was time to plant them up into other containersAfter painting & planting the old kettle in this post here, I decided to try a \"baby version\" using this old op-shop aluminium teapot I drilled a single hole in the bottom for drainage & when planted, I \"doiley-fied\" it with a tiny crochet doileyAs the lid had a small steam hole in it, I attached it to the pot with some bakers twine . . . I think its rather cuteAlso these vintage china cups & one polka dot coffee mug got some baby's tears planted in themThese are all going for sale in the Cottage.I was given a box full of - well ...  junk really.   Inside were a few old books, a couple of them had their covers missing, so I thought I might try my hand at some book bundles . . .Once again, I have seen these done before but at huge prices & I didn't think they would be too difficultI have to admit, I really enjoyed the whole process of putting these together.I found some images on good old Uncle Google which I printed off & then parisiene essence dyedRemember to always tear the edges of your paper, not cut with scissors as this leaves a blunt edge.The tatty spines of the books I covered with some old pages & some music pages ... modern day music pages, once again made to look \"antique\" by spraying with a cold parisiene essence mixtureI also sanded the spines & edges of the books, when the glue was dry.All bound together with some lace & a couple of charms or a keyThese make great bookends or just look very vintage-chic sitting by themselvesMy Mr doesn't understand the whole concept of book bundles & wonders why you don't actually get to read them ??!!These little four-legged creatures above are the reason there has been no stitching done of lateCircumstances at the farm have changed & I have been called upon to help quite a bit recently.I am hoping this will not be for too much longer.Now I must confess we have started some bad habits in our house & one of them was allowing little Miss Pippi to sleep in her basket on the table.It was just easier when she was unwell & since then, I have never not yet re-trained her (Oh I will.... I promise !!!!)When she is not lying horizontal in her basket  (which she is rapidly outgrowing)  then she likes to sit & watch me prepare the meals in the kitchen I chat away to her as I do this & she watches every move I make & looks at me as if to say \"oh really, is that right??\"However, fat Black - who has always been more of a couch cat, has decided the table is quite a nice place to sit beside Mum & \"supervise\" her when she crafts . . .. . . perhaps \"help her\" with her book bundlesCome summer . . . we I have some serious retraining to do !!!!I thought I would share this delightful photo of my grandson Alec that I took recentlyHe is now 4 months old & is such a bundle of joy ... he is also going quite blonde like both of his parents are.After winter I have been closing my Cottage for one day a week (a Monday) & I try to get out to visit my wee grandson each Monday.His little face certainly lights up my day.Thanks so very much for visiting today dear friends & readers,I hope the rest of the week is kind to you allwith much love & friendship,Julie, Fat Black & Miss Pippix0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Painting, Planting, Stitching, Knitting", "date": "Friday, September 11, 2015", "text": "End of the Week Greetings dear friends & readers,There I was last week ... under the house ... ferreting around like a rat down a drain pipeI remembered that I had stashed some wood there last winter & as our wood supply is looking rather desperate, hence my \"ratting around\" under the houseThough I was not greatly successful on the wood-finding front, I did come across 4 old tin watering cans.I completely forgot to photograph the other 3 before I gave them a make-over, but they all looked alot like the one above ... dirty, damp, cobwebby & unloved.After a good scrub & drying off, I was keen to paint them up using my stash of test pot coloursAmulet first - of course    :-)I hadn't intended to plant them, but once painted I decided this was a good idea as I hoped to offer them for sale at the CottageThe Amulet one got some white petunias popped into it . . ..  .  .  as did the Hot Chilli one, which matches the kettle I painted & planted in my last postLastly this watering can is not vintage, but I still felt it could benefit from a coat (or two) of paintThis one got the \"escape\" colour treatment & planted with lovely dainty Catmint, whose lavender coloured flowers will look gorgeous against the blue of the can.I plan to keep them sheltered til the plants get established & by then the Garden Groups will be due to visit (I hope!!)Way back 9 months ago Jenny first offered her The Vintage Kitchen Block of the Month stitch-a-long(which is still free to download on Jenny's blog elephantz)Although I was tempted I did not take part, due to having no room whatsoever in my kitchen to hang this lovely pieceHowever, about 5 months into the stitch-a-long I had a change of heart.Every month when Jenny would release a new block I would be drooling .... I loved it so much, so I decided to take part My kitchen is a small galley style, with cupboards covering most of my walls & french doors at one end, so I have very limited wall spaceAt the end, as the kitchen runs into my dining area, I have a large iron stand housing (some) of my vintage enamel collectionI decided the wallhanging would just fit above this stand.I would like to say that I quickly caught up with the months I was behind on, but truth be told, I struggled right to the last month & almost gave up,Although Jenny has done hers using a white & bright red colour theme, I decided to try to use what I had on hand. I chose to do my stitcheries using DMC 221, a darkish turkey red stitched onto a dull cream background.However, when I was finished & ready to put it all together, I pulled out my stash of red fabrics (yes there are rather a lot) but not one single one that would go.Off to town I trot with a plan to buy some red & a nice deep mustard to go with it .  .  ..  .  . this is what I came home with .  .  .The red fabric is by Lynette Anderson & the other 2 are designed by Kristel Salgarollo from her Betty Blue collection.  I hoped the greyish blue would tone nicely with my enamel collectionAs I didn't have a novelty print for the top & bottom panels as Jenny has used, I chose to add a heart appliqued in the red.Also I changed the wording in the centre block to \"My Vintage Kitchen\".I am really thrilled with my wallhanging .... it is not very often I make something for my own home & it has bought me lots of enjoyment.Thank You dear Jenny for sharing this wonderful block of the month with us all.My Mum has always been the most beautiful knitter all of my life.She is now 86 & has macular degeneration of her eyesight ... her knitting days are numbered.Up until about a year ago this large enamel baby's bath sat in my Cottage filled with Mums knitted boy & girl gollies.They sold out like hotcakes -  to all ages of customers.Mum now struggles to knit the black wool & especially the hair which is looped over your finger as you knit.I offered to put the hair on myself using fur ... so this is how the gollies arrive now in the post .  .  ..  .  . minus hair, faces, & skirts for the girls.But they still turn out just fine once I add these little touches . . .This little girl above was an order ... for a 90 year old lady!!!I am trying to encourage Mum to keep knitting to keep both her hands & her mind occupied.Thank You to all of you who have entered & taken part in my Spring Angel Giveaway The Giveaway runs until the end of September so there is still plenty of time if you would like to enterJust go to this post here to enter in the comments section.I will leave you with these pics I snapped of Miss Pippi this morning ... ... her favourite pastime of late - hunting the Doves !!!May you all have a wonderful weekend filled with activities & people you enjoy,with much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0"},

I made this lovely Angel from Rosalie Quinlan's pattern An Angel for all SeasonsI used fabrics from my treasured Tilda stash & put her together in floral pinks & greens ... spring colours I imagined.She is a nice medium size doll measuring 50cms in length.The pocket on her pinafore has Spring embroidered on it & button flowers growing out of the pocketThese flowers however, require No watering !!!   :-)She has dainty pink pantaloons under her dress & in her hand she has a handmade wreath all ready to hang up to welcome in spring with a small cluster of silk flowers on it.Because spring can still be rather chilly (in fact, today in my part of the world you would swear it was still winter!!!) so she has a woollen beanie on her head adorned with a handmade crochet flower.Although I have photographed her hanging up, she is equally as lovely sitting .  .  .  either tucked in amongst your old china.  .  .  perched on a stack of old suitcases  .  .  ..  .  .  or sitting on an old chair perhaps .  .  .Her wings have been stiffened with Stiffy fabric stiffener as we can't have angels with droopy wings ... & the fabric tabs on her pinny are adorned with tiny vintage buttonsMy Spring Angel Giveaway is Open to anyoneYes, I will post to anywhere in the world.You don't have to be a follower to enter but if you are a follower you get two entries into the drawI will put all the names in my old enamel teapot & The Mr will draw out a nameThe Giveaway is Open til the end of SeptemberIn order to account for all my friends who tell me they try to leave me comments but can never remember their passwords, I have decided to allow anonymous comments .... However, if you are commenting anonymously you will need to leave me your christian name at the end of your commenteg:  \"thanks for the chance to enter your angel giveaway (from Julie in New Zealand).Also when you comment you might like to tell me which is your favourite season of them all   :-)In between sewing my Spring Angel I have managed a couple of other completions this past week  .  .  .Remember last post where I showed you the old aluminium kettles rescued from my wood shed ??This was the one I had originally painted with blackboard paint - it got 2 coats of Resene testpot \"Hot Chilli\" ... to match my outdoor table & chairs, already painted the same colourEven Miss Pippi gave it her sniff of approvalAlthough there are slim pickings at the Garden Centre as we enter this change of season, I still thought this white primula gave it the pop of colour I had visualised.This little wooden shelf was another gift from Sue ... only this was from her visit before her visit last week ... I posted about this way back here late last yearI had been looking for a nice pale vintagey pink for awhile & think I might have found the right shade ... again this is a Resene testpot -  \"Pale Rose\".Not too bright but a lovely pink just the same.What do you think my dear friend Willie seeing as you are definately the expert on pinks??I lined the drawers with a pretty floral scrapbooking paper & modpodged it onto the outer drawers also - then I lined one of the shelves with some white broderie lace Yesterday it rained here all day long !!What to do with two cats stuck indoors wanting to \"assist me with my sewing\" ???I remembered what I used to do when my boys were young ... build them a hut !!!Miss Pippi exiting the Hut Yes I can hear you all . . . quite pathetic aren't I ???!!!Pippi played for hours in the hut but Blackie preferred to observe the entertainment from his favourite spot on the couch ... horizontalThank You all so much for stopping by todayI do hope you are inspired to enter my Angel Giveaway ... even if you don't fancy her for yourself, she would make a wonderful gift for someone.The very bestest of luck to all of you who do enter,with much love & friendship,Julie, Pippi & Fat Black x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Snippets from my Week", "date": "Thursday, August 27, 2015", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersWe have had some lovely sunshiney days this past week .... just little snippets to let us know that spring is hopefully just around the corner.My Vintage Car Club Group last weekend went well & the rain held off for a few hours while the ladies visited the CottageThey are such a friendly bunch & I always enjoy seeing them dressed up in their finery to drive their vintage cars for the day, whilst leaving the menfolk at homeI think after me, they were heading on somewhere to have a High Tea.A couple of days prior to the groups visit, my blogging friend Sue decided to pop over my way for a visitThis was timely as I had had a baking day just the day before.I dont often have baking days now ... as these are usually followed by \"eating days\" -  such is my willpower (or lack of !!!)No-bake Muesli Slice                                                                                          Louise CakeI had made Louise Cake (the Mr's favourite) & a delicious no-bake muesli slice (this recipe came out of the Tempo magazine)Sue informed me that she had gathered lots of crafty bits & bobs to bring over to me . . . & I was certainly not disappointedThere was a treasure trove of goodies in the large carrier bag along with seeds from her garden, magazines, patterns & these cane trays below which Sue was happy to pass on to meIt was lovely to sit & have a catch-up again with Sue ... I was surprised Madam Pippi did not make an appearance - only to discover when Sue had left that she had been accidently shut in the sleepout !!!!  Poor wee thing was quite miffed she missed Sues visit.Sue thank you so very much for all the goodies you gifted me - I have been diving into the bag lots of times in the past couple of days, & it still feels like christmas!!Our winter vege garden has been a great source of pleasure & joy to me.I seem to prefer to grow all my brassica's now during these colder months when the white butterfly isn't making a pest of itself.We are currently eating broccoli daily & have caulis & cabbages ready along with silverbeet & spinach which I now grow all year roundIt is exciting to see my garlic coming through as well as the curly kale that I planted last month thriving awaySo when I knew Sue was coming, I quickly put together a \"produce box\" for her & tossed in a magazine & some of the muesli slice I had just madeAs I forgot to take a photo myself, I have pinched borrowed Sues photo from her blog - you can read her post about our visit hereOnce again, thanks Sue for a lovely visit - next time I promise to come with you to do the Opshops   :-) And the trays which Sue gifted me got a wax & 3 coats of paint this week . . . then a light sanding to give them the chippy look that I adoreThe woven cane bases really soaked the paint in but I think this has made them quite wipeable now.This past week, while hunting in the very back of the woodshed I found these two old aluminium kettles under some sacks of pineconesI gave them both a good scrub & a light sand - I went through a phase once of painting everything with blackboard paint as I liked the matt black effect it gave - the black one is a cast-off from this phaseNow of all the people that enter my funny little home, 9 out of 10 of them will comment on the \"doiley-fied\" kettle sitting on my green stool which I have planted with babys tearsIt just seems to fascinate them & draw their attention.So I decided to do this to one of the aluminium kettles to pop for sale in the CottageI chose the plain one but I lightly sanded it & painted it with my Amulet green shade of paint ... the reason I painted it was because the aluminium was very pitted & I felt the paint would help to hide thisWhich it did indeed !!I was really pleased how it came out - I masked the lower handle first so I didn't get green on this.The little plastic pots that your salad comes in at the supermarket fitted perfectly in the round opening of the kettle .  .  ..  .  .  so this got planted with some baby's tears .  .  ..  .  .  & then the \"doiley-fying\" just finished it off nicely .  .  . .  .  .  along with a rustic key tied to the handle. Next post I shall hopefully be able to show you what I did with the other (black) kettle Miss Pippi Longstocking is certainly feeling so much better now after recovering from her surgery - I notice she is not protective & guarding her tummy area anymore & tucks herself up with Fat Black now quite happilyAbove is their sleeping positions at night, & during the days when I am painting outside on the deck table, they like to supervise & take a wee nap while watching the paint dry !!Thank you all so much for visiting today & staying with me through my lengthy ramble.I hope the coming weekend brings good (& creative) things to you allwith much love & friendship,Julie, Fat Blackie & Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0"},
{"title": "A Special Doll", "date": "Wednesday, August 19, 2015", "text": "Rainy Wednesday Greetings dear friends & readersWell over a year ago Quite some time ago my friend Christine asked me to make her a very special dollHer instructions were .  .  .- she must be in blues (but I could add a touch of maroon)- she must be a large country doll (not primitive)- she must look like a girl doll (again not primitive)- she would like dolls appliqued on her dress (!!!)After I had finished making the cot blanket for my grandson here I felt confident enough to tackle the applique.A lengthy look through my doll patterns unearthed an old pattern I had long ago been given - \"Millicent\" by Lyn Hyland of Lil Blokes. I decided to use this as a guide for the doll as at 85 cms long, she was certainly one tall girlI finally finished my version of Millicent (Milly) today after spending several weeks to-ing & fro-ing on herI am hoping she meets with Christines approval .... I altered the pattern quite a bit & changed my mind about several things along the way as I often tend to doAs pictured above, I left half the entire back seam of the skirt open so that when she sits, the applique dolls are displayed nicely & not half hidden from viewI was able to bring in the \"touches of maroon\" in the appliqued dolls clothingI originally cut down a crochet doiley to make her a collar & had this sitting in place .  .  .  but then changed my mind as I felt she was a \"country doll\" & this was giving her more of a vintagey lookIn the end, I didn't give her blouse a collar at all.I thought she was complete, & she sat on a chair for a day or more, while I walked past her. But I felt she needed \"something in her hands\" somehow .  .  . though nothing covering up the appliqued skirt - not a handbag, not a toy, not a doiley .  .  . I was very undecided ???These chunky wooden hearts were unearthed in my sewing drawer - I think they had been on a wallhanging in a previous life.  I drilled some holes in the maroon one & added some raggy strips to make a small country swag for her  .  .  .  this is only pinned in place at present as I am still a teeny bit undecided .  .  ..  .  .  & may wait to see what Christine thinks.What do you think dear readers . . . swag or no swag ???I do love Milly & her country colours - she will look perfect in Christines beautiful home.After all my painting endeavours last post using the beautiful Escape colour, I found this old toolbox in my sleepoutIn fact, it has been in there for so long I am actually unsure whether I bought it, it was given to me ... or just grew out of the piles of detritus in the corner of the sleepout!!!It was ratty & tatty but I felt it could be given a make-over.I waxed it & painted it my gorgeous Escape colour ... the Mr pointed out to me I had \"forgotten\" to paint the inside base, but I was planning to insert a lining, so why waste paintThis vintage cotton sheet was the perfect match for the blue colour so I made a padded cardboard base, covered it & glued it in placeAs the edges were rough & uneven I disguised these with a lovely braid I found in my stash ...winding the braid around the handle reminded me of a vine climbing along a trellisLast week my dear friend Shirley popped in for a brief visit - the box was sitting on my dining table in a stage of half completion.Shirley loved it so much, she asked if she could buy it (when finished) for her new craft roomI was so pleased it would be going to such a lovely homeWhen I hand-delivered it a few days later, Shirley showed me where she was planning to put it .... it looked simply perfect in her craft room holding some creative bits & bobs.Likewise this table got completed, but this one I did in the lovely green shade, AmuletWe had some brief patches of sunshine this past week & dear little Pippi enjoyed sitting out in it watching me paintShe is looking so much better after recovering from her surgeriesWell folks, with my first group due this Sunday the Cottage is looking full, but all I can say is thank goodness they are not a Garden Circle !!!! The Garden IS a sorry sight indeed.Thank you all for stopping by today - I hope the rest of the week is kind to you allwith much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstocking x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Feeling Blue", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2015", "text": "Good afternoon dear friends & readers,It really all started with this \"little article\" below . . .A gift from a friend earlier in the year . . . she thought it \"looked like a bit of me\" ??Now even though I love the colour blue, for some reason I have no blue in my house except for a ruffle curtain at my bathroom window.So the \"little article\" got put in the bathroom & everytime I looked at it I thought to myself  \"I really do love that shade of blue\"Off I trot to my local hardware store, \"little article\" in hand. Now the men in there are well used to me by now with my grand schemes & my budgets of zero ... usually, they hide from me.However, there is a new man working there - a lovely young man who took the time to go through the colour charts with me & attempt to mix me a testpotResene \"Escape\" we thought might be the right shade of blue ... Yes I liked the sound of that !!!!Backing up a bit from this story now . . . my friend Joyce works in the Church Op Shop in my little town.This shop is only open 2 mornings a week & is not large, but I would definately consider it the cheapest Oppie in our town.When I went in a couple of weeks back to deliver some books & clothing articles, Joyce asked me if I was interested in the two tables below ... $5 eachAs you can see I had begun to sand one down here alreadyAlthough they certainly weren't shouting out to me to buy them, come home with me they did.Joyce's boss Raewyn asked me what I did with the wooden bits ... I explained how I paint them up & revamp them.She came out with an assortment of oddities that I could have, that she said \"they couldn't even sell for 50c\"These items below were in the assortment ...AFTER a good scrub - they weren't quite this clean to begin withSometimes when I get given things, they eventually DO end up on my burning heap - some things are just beyond repair or revamping.I wasn't too sure about the fate of this little wooden bowl belowFirstly, I decided to have a go with the two breadboards using my new pot of EscapeThe blue is Escape & the Green is AmuletThree coats of paint per board later & I was really pleased with how they turned out.  I decided not to sand the edges & just stay with the colour ... I added a simple teatowel wound around each board as I thought this might make an attractive gift.Many years ago I used to make artificial bread twists & varnish with a thick lacquer - I found a bagful in my cupboard & added one to each string tie - purely as embellishment.The bowl was destined for the burning heap but then I had an idea (an epiphany as my son would say)  ... I painted the bowl with my Escape & then lightly sanded the edges.  I also drilled 4 holes in each little scallop edgeWith the addition of a small silver charm tied to each hole, I thought this might make a sweet little trinket dish perhaps the ideal gift for a young girl for her jewellery ??One of the tables also got the Escape treatment . . .I actually undercoated both little tables with my cream wall paint twice to give a coating to the dark wood underneath.  This makes it easier to apply any colour & gives a good base for the paint to adhere to.Though my original intention was to leave the tables plain like the bread boards, I ended up just ever so lightly sanding the edges.  I liked the way it gave a slightly time-worn appeal to the whole look of the table - don't take off too much, just a very light rub is best.On any given day the scene above is what my dining room looks like - it can be pouring down outdoors but I can still manage my small paint projects by the fire ... occasionally I have to pick the odd cat hair out of the end result !!!You can see by the picture that I undercoat the darker articles first with my cream wall paint.These two dark cane baskets were in an Op Shop bargain bin quite some time ago.  I didn't especially like the dark colour so gave each one a fresh coat of coloured paint ... Escape & Amulet - the gorgeous green I am eternally indebted to dear Catherine for recommending to me.The green one I lined with my treasured Tilda fabric & the blue one got a base made from some vintage sheeting fabric .... a nice fresh look to a dated old cane basket I thought.You will be pleased to read dear friends that Miss Pippi is definately over the worst of her surgery now . . ..  .  .  even if somedays she needs a little rest whilst climbing out of her bed !!!!With a few more projects needing my attention, I am off to Escape some moreThank you so much for popping by today - your visits most certainly make my dayBe kind to yourselves & to each other,with love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippi x0x0x"},
{"title": "The Haybarn Chair", "date": "Wednesday, August 5, 2015", "text": "A Very Rainy Wednesday Good Afternoon dear friends & readersAfter my make-over on the $2 chair in this post here, The Mr came home with this \"rather lovely\" chair tossed on the back of his uteIt had been sitting in the haybarn at the farm since time began for a very long time, & birds had used it for free parking as well as the numerous spiders that had taken up residence in itEven Blackie was intrigued with its many smells . . .Definately smells of mice I think !!!!First up, a good scrub using a strong mixture of sugar soap & disinfectant .  .  ..  .  .  which kind of transformed it somewhatI bought it inside & have spent the past days while I have been on \"Pippi confinement\" painting it by the fire. I have done this over several days as it needed four coats & I had a helper that was unfortunately, not optional, so it has been a long process as I am sure you can imagineLittle bit missed on the back here MumI often wonder what they thought at the Vets while Pippi was under anaesthetic & they got to witness all the bits of white paint on her??!!When I was satisfied with the coverage, I left it for an entire 24 hours to harden by the fire.  This wouldn't be quite so necessary if it wasn't winter-time.Next on the list was to sand & distress the edges, just lightly, not too shabby.As I envisaged this as a kind of bedroom chair, sort of soft & feminine, I decided to use a selection of doilies & vintage linens to cover the squab- sort of a similar effect to the footstool in this post hereI attached these to a calico backing as it needed to disguise the red of the squab ... overlocked the edges, then spent several hours hunting in The Mr's shed for his staplegun (which incidently, I am sure he hides from me!!!)The covered squab - a nice patchwork effect & lovely if you can't decide which doiley you actually prefer to use .... Use them all I say !!!But,  as usual - \"something\" was missing . . . ah yes, a cushion perhaps?? I had put aside these 4 gorgeous vintage serviettes which were amongst my linens - I thought they might make a lovely little squashy cushion for the back of the chair - more for looks than practicality to be honestThe addition of a beautiful vintage bakelite coat button & my squashy patchwork cushion was complete . . . Hard to photograph on this grey rainy winters day but viola . . .Another chair saved from landfill . . . this little petal will be going for sale in my CottageAnd speaking of little petals .... thank you SO much for your kind words & well wishes on my last post regarding little Pippi's surgeryShe gets her wound stitches out this Friday & then hopefully, she will be back to \"as normal as it gets for Pippi\".  As you can see above, she is continuing to milk it for all its worth make the most of the care & attentionAnd as for Blackie . . . well some pictures speak for themselvesAnd look Willie, leg in the air today   :-)Thank you for brightening this rainy day today with your visits,I hope you enjoyed my little repurposing story & that you look twice at those chairs next time you are sending them off to the dumpHave a wonderful rest of the week dear friends,with love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Miss Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0"},

I have been working on some painting projects in front of the fire these damp wintery days.It actually took 4 coats to cover it well & I must confess, it was a fiddly darn thing painting between those slats ... but after the paint had hardened, I sanded it lightly to distress it .... . .  then the fun part ...   embellishing & \"doiley-fying\"Goodness what IS that stuff shining in my bedroom windows .... Oh yes, its sunshine !!!!  We just haven't seen any for awhile around these parts ! !The doilies at each end got mod-podged onto the woodThen I got to \"try it out\" to make sure it all actually worked okay !!!!It is going for sale in my Cottage so will be useful to have some magazines in it, for those customers that will ask me \"what do you actually use this for ???!!!Poor Pippi has had a rough week .... I got her spayed last week & she was coming along well until she developed a nasty infection under her wound siteBack to the vets for more surgery & home again with two drains in her wound(I promised her I would Not put any photos of her drains on my blog)Needless to say there has been quite a bit of the above going on ....And she has been getting away with doing pretty much as she pleases while I keep her distractedPut it this way  .  .  .  we shall have a little bit of \"retraining\" to do once she mendsHelping Mum sort out her silk flowersAnd as for Blackie  .  .  ....  well he's being his kind, caring & understanding self ! ! !Thanks so much for stopping by today dear readersGosh, where on earth did July slip away to I ask you ???Have a wonderful weekend & I hope to be back real soon with a new painting project to show you (completed, hopefully)with much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & poor wee Pippi Longstockingx0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Bibs & Aprons", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2015", "text": "A wintery Monday Good Afternoon dear friends & readers,My daughter-in-law Sarah mentioned that she had seen a baby at Plunket wearing this cute little \"Bandana type bib\"I had not come across these before .... however, a quick search on Uncle Google & I managed to find a free pattern to tryThese two were my first attempts & they were for little Alec, my grandsonAlthough he turns 9 weeks old today, they were just a fraction on the large size for him ... but he was most happy to model them for me during my visit yesterdayI also managed to run up four bibs for my Cottage - I was lucky enough to have fabrics on hand suitable for both boys & girls I used soft flannelette on the outsides & then a thinner polar fleece on the underside ...... or you can also use towelling.  Although the pattern suggests using a snap fastener at the neck, I preferred to use the velcro dots I had ... I liked the idea of this being softer to lay on than a button or a fastenenerIf you would like to give them a try, you can find the pattern hereWhen I did my Cottage revamp I left a large blank space on one wall. I had wanted to make some aprons for quite sometime but had nowhere to display them to do them justice.  Also I had often been asked by customers before \"do you have any aprons?\"This was the first one I made ... I only had half a metre of this pretty floral fabric so had to find a contrast to mix-n-match.  Making these aprons was very much about using what I have in my stash, so I have had to be resourceful & think outside the square quite a bitThis was the second apron I made ... although I had more of this floral fabric, I still had to use a contrast for a large front pocket.  I plan to make four aprons in total so hope to be able to show you the last two in my next post.  I would also like to embellish some teatowels to compliment the aprons.After I visited with my grandson yesterday I travelled on into Hamilton city.  I had wanted to go to Palmers Garden World as I had acquired some giftcards & one was due to expire if I didn't use it up.  I love Palmers - not only is their Garden Centre great but they have a lovely cafe & a large gift area also.These are what I came away with .... compliments of my gift cardstwo new plants, new garden gloves & secateurs AND gorgeous tin jugI had hoped to be outside using my new secateurs & gloves today as I am waayyy behind with my pruning this year.  But it is a bitter wintery day here again & I am tucked up indoors with some \"body parts\" drying by the fire !!!. . . and someone else who is also tucked up by the fire . . . favourite toy & blanket all intact  :-)sometimes you just feel like hanging out the \"do not disturb\" sign for awhile !!!Have a wonderful week ahead dear readers,hope you all manage to stay warm if you are in these wintery climatesthanks for your ever welcome visits today,with much love,Julie, Blackie & Pippix0x0x0"},

I have always loved these little dollies but haven't made any now for quite sometimeThe little primitive angel needed some pva/water dabbed on her perle thread hair, to keep it out of her eyes !!!Their little felt vests are cut out using my scallop edge scissorsI have another 2 bodies cut out that I am attempting to stitch up nextThese bone china mugs were in a box of china oddments I purchased from an Op Shop on one of my trips to Mums many years ago a little while backI pulled them out of the cupboard recently & decided to make some pincushions as I am trying to put together a small \"sewing area\" in the Cottage with sewing related goodies  I decided to take a deep breath & cut into my treasured Tilda fabrics to make them ... I thought the soft pastel florals of the Tilda fabrics suited the patterns on the china mugs beautifully.I wanted to make some small swing tags to tie onto the handles but didnt have any pretty florally scrapbooking card on hand . . . In the end, I just ran a piece of the fabric through my printer scanner onto A4 paper & then made my tags up from thereI usually weight the cups with some fine gravel about 1/4 full, as I find this prevents them being too flimsy & stabilises them alot betterI am really pleased with the end result - pretty & dainty just as I imagined, but still useful & functionalI think this front one in pinks/greens is perhaps my favourite.How about you ... do you have a favourite ??One of the things you first see when you walk directly into my odd little house is my dining table.  I usually like to have one of my vintage tablecloths on it & - when seasons permit - a vase of flowers. It is just one of those funny little things that makes me happy . . .OLD photo  .   .   .     VERY OLD !!!!!The rest of the house can be a complete schamozzle (& frequently IS) ... but if the table is nice & clear, then all is well with the world ...Oh how times can change ! ! ! !this is currently my table by night . . . Yes - thats my craft stuff balanced on a tiny corner there !!!!!And this is currently my table by day . . .Lady Muck Pippi having a stressful afternoon ! ! **! !Thank You All so much for popping by today to visitIts the weekend tomorrow here, so Happy Weekend to you allI hope its a happy & creative (& healthy) one for us allwith much love & friendship,Julie, Fat Black & Lady Muck Pippix0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Baby Corners, Boots . . .  & Orange", "date": "Sunday, June 28, 2015", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers & Happy Sunday to you allDuring my revamp I decided I would like to make a \"baby corner\" somewhere in the CottageI have always had a few baby bits & bobs dotted throughout, but I wanted to have more of a specific \"baby area\"I decided I needed to define this area with a bunting so out came my wool blanket scraps yet againI made up a scalloped bunting using blanket scraps & lovely Cath Kidston fabric leftoversI am really pleased with how it looks in the corner of my little Cottage & hope to make some more baby bits for this area ... I am thinking even the bunting itself would make a lovely gift for that baby that perhaps has everything ??Several months ago I received notification of a new pattern release from Lisa's BigLittle Etsy Store  The pattern was for her Baby Flower Boots ... I quickly purchased my copy as planned to make some for my imminent grandchild.I embroidered Alec's name on each boot These finally got made this past week, along with two other pairs for friends grandsons.I lined them with some soft flannelette from Spotlight & for the inner soles I used brushed polar fleece fabric.  I had long ago been given a box of leather scraps ... I am so very glad now that I didn't toss the box away, as I had originally intended to, the leather was perfect for the soles.I have to say ... this pattern of Lisa's is quite surely the simplest, easiest instructions I think I have ever followed ...  her photos & steps are So clear & concise, it was a pleasure to sew these up.I purchased the Baby Size Pattern but Lisa also does Childrens & Youths sizes.  My friend Donna's gorgeous little grandson Archie above is about to turn one ... I made him the largest Baby Size & they fitted perfectly & his Mum was most impressed that they stayed on !!!!   I made little Alec the smallest in the baby sizes.Sarah, Alec's Mum, has asked me to make him bigger sizes as he grows & to embroider \"left\" & \"right\" on each little boot so he can look down & see which is which - a great way to learn I thought.When sorting out the Cottage, you are always left with oddments & bits you are never quite sure what to do with ...this was the case with these four orange items below ...An Owl, 2 lavender hearts & a pair of wool coasters ... all made from a really lovely orange wool blanket ... but never ever sold.I have a tall, thin, 4-shelf bookcase that houses the homemade jams & chutneys I have for sale ... so I decided to make a couple more \"orange things\" using up the last of the blanket, & have a bit of a splash of colour in the bottom two shelvesThis was the woollen rabbit that I was sewing up last post when Pippi was being a pain assisting meI had cut out a hottie cover from the blanket & also some hearts to applique onto it . . . but somehow I kept procrastinating.I felt it needed something more \"retro-ey\" somehow . . . ? ?So I gave in & appliqued a vintage caravan onto it ... I am so happy I didn't do the hearts as I just adore this little caravan & bunting flags & feel it suits the hottie cover to a tee This too got lined with the same lovely soft polar fleece as the boots aboveLets hope some \"orange loving customers\" come along to my little shop sometime  :-)Rascally Miss Pippi has discovered she can climb this past week .... she looked down upon me from great heights above - here she is below on the grapevine frame ...She has lived with us for 10 weeks now, has grown long & lean, but has yet to fill outwards . . .Fat Black on the other hand, should probably not climb trees any longer . . .. . . as this is what happened when he climbed up the Cabbage Tree 4 days ago - the entire middle trunk fell over under his weight !!! (I am wondering if they have a weight watchers group for cats??!!)I hope the coming week brings you only good things dear friendsI hope mid-winter or mid-summer is treating you kindly,thanks so much for popping by today to visit mewith much love & friendship,Julie, Blackie & Pippix0x0x0x0"},
{"title": "Thinking Outside the Square ", "date": "Thursday, June 18, 2015", "text": "A rainy Good Afternoon to you dear friends & readers,(typing this post with kitten on lap so please excuse any typo's!!!)I am making sloooww progess with my Cottage Revamp, but at least I am making progessThere have been several boxes of old stock packed up to give back to suppliers & a large bag went into the Op Shop just yesterday.These little wooden bowls were an Op Shop revamp quite some time agoThey started out their life as dark stained wood, which I waxed, painted & lightly sanded.  I displayed them as \"vintage wooden bowls\" They sat  .  .  .  & they sat .  .  . & did not sell.I reduced them to half price  .   .   .  they still did not sell.It was time to \"think outside the square\" .... my idea to display them as \"little bowls of prim\" pretty much came about by purchasing these cute wooden spools of twine & a packet of rusty looking bobbins . . .. . . from The Warehouse of all places !!!I covered the bottom of each bowl with a layer of dried rose hips then embellished away to my hearts content. I wanted to be able to scent the bowls with my cinnamon & clove oils so the rosehips & the cinnamon stick bundles were perfect for absorbing the fragrance.Now I just need to design some grungy primitive style labels to attach to them ... mostly for those customers that ask me \"what are these for??\"  . . . Or \"what do you do with these ??\"(My Mr always suggests to me when I get asked this last question, that I smile politely & say \"you take them outside, plant them in the garden, & hope that more will grow\"  .... as I am not sure that they would laugh, I have never yet tried this !!!!)Earlier in the year I made a couple of purchases . . .This gorgeous Seed Box was bought on my last trip down to Mums(No, not the cat, well yes, the cat was purchased but I am referring to the box here)These envelope templates above were my other purchase.  They were bought online from hereI knew I had an old book of bulbs in the back of my cupboard .... a $1 find from the Op Shop many years ago.Pippi & I spent a rainy afternoon last week sitting at the table making envelopes from the pages of the Bulb Book ... apart from Pippis help it was quite therapeutic, all the repetitive cutting & folding ... we made 8 small size envelopes & 6 large size ones.(Incidently old calendar pages are great for making envelopes also)My plan is to package up some of my seeds from the garden, display in my new Seed box & sell in the CottageOften in the spring, when the garden is pretty & the groups come, I frequently get asked if I sell any seeds.  I plan to make a label & attach with plain brown string to the envelopes . . . cross my fingers & hope for the best !!!!While attempting to sew an orange wool blanket rabbit yesterday I grabbed my phone & clicked to show you just how very difficult creating can be since a small ginger 4-legged being came to live here . . .She is fixated when the needle goes up & down & a paw will often shoot through from the other side ... other times she decides I might need the stitch length altering on my computer panel perhaps !!!!***!!!!Though I try really hard to maintain some sort of order here in the house, some days it just all turns to chaos. It has been a bit like that lately as Pippi has discovered a basket left on the dining table (previously housing my bags of rose potpourri) makes an ideal sleeping spotShe is there in the mornings as the sun comes into the room . . .. . . she is there tucked up in the afternoons as the fire warms the room . . .. . . well golly gosh, look who is there in the evenings with his ample proportions squeeeeeezed into the basket ??!!While the shortest day looms closer here our nights draw in very early now ... I have been so enjoying the beautiful Yankee Candle gifted to me by my youngest son for Mothers Day last monthThe fragrance \"MacIntosh Spice\" is just beautiful ... I burn it while we have our dinner, away from little dancing paws & inquisitive faces.I hope you are finding some creative time in your world dear readers,I hope life is treating you kindly whether it is winter Or summer you are experiencing now,Thank you So much for stopping by today ... I am off to fill the wood basket (yes, again!!)with much love & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Pippi Longstocking x0x0x0x0"},

I am closed for the remainder of the month of JuneWinter is always a good time for me to tackle this task ... everything gets a good clean & a \"spit-n-polish\" & every single piece of furniture gets shifted (at least once)Last week I managed to stitch up some Owl doorstops  I had none left in stock so out came my blanket stash once more.Sometimes customers prefer the darker colours to the pastel ones ... they do spend their life on the floor after allAfter an \"unfortunate incident\" with the wheat I used to weight them with, I now pop a bag of fine gravel in their \"bottoms\" - this makes them nice & heavy & solid.After making the pussycat rattle for my new grandson back here I decided to make some for the CottageI stitched a small wadding bag & popped in their tummies with a couple of small bells inside ... thinking perhaps customers won't actually realise they are rattles, I attached a small label to themnote to self ... add a label to these ones Julie!!!I simply had to add this footnote to my post .... my dear blogging friend Willie sent me this video after reading my post last night ... I smiled all the way through it ... I hope you enjoy it too(Have just realised it is missing the story ....

They have named him Alec Raoul - he is beautiful & yes, I am indeed biased  :-)My precious Grandson & his Granny JulieMy heart has well & truely been captured by this wee soul, who turns 2 weeks old tomorrowAnd so ... begs the question ... what to be called ??Although I love all the names ... Gran, Grandma, Nan, Nanny etc ... ever since I was a wee girl I have just adored the programme The Beverly Hillbillies.   One of my all-time favourite characters over all the decades was Granny ... I loved the way she would sit on the back of the truck with her shotgun in her arms ... Oh I thought she was wonderful.And so I decided ... Granny it was to be    :-)It is nothing short of a miracle that I have any completions to show you this week as my mind has been elsewhere.I received an invite to my friend Sandy's daughters 21st birthday. When Sandy & I first met through our younger sons becoming friends, Abby was only 18 months old.So I have watched her grow up through the years & become the lovely young woman that she is today.  What to make Abby for her 21st birthday??I knew she loved to cook & bake & spend time in her kitchen.  I also knew she loved blue. So I decided upon an apron ...It was very much a \"make it up as you go along\" kind of project.Firstly, as I wanted to personalise it, I embroidered the bib part with her name(I must confess it was one of those occasions when I was thankful Abby had been blessed with a short name!!!)I used the Stitchery Alphabet from month 6 of Jenny of elephantz Stitchery Club I decided to make it quite girly & feminine, so added a deep frill & lace to the bottom - Abby is about my height so it was easy to gauge how long to make it.A pocket is always handy on an apron so I added a generous pocket & - of course - I had to add a doiley to it !!!I also like quite long ties on my aprons so added these to the sides, & some button embellishments to finish off.I had managed to buy some good quality teatowels in similar colourings to the apron fabric so decided to embellish these to matchI appliqued the words \"cook\" & \"bake\" to each one, then added a frill along the lower edge of the applique stripTo one I added ric rac & to the other, a simple daisy trimI was really pleased with how these turned out & especially loved the checked oneA good quality wooden spoon & some matching stick-on labels completed the gift package.I hope Abby enjoys many happy hours in her kitchen being a domestic goddess & wearing her new apron.Another gift completed for a dear friend & posted away ... this is certainly a miracle as . . . well . . .  have you ever tried knitting with a kitten on your lap ???!!!**!Once again ... a \"make it up as you go along\" gift.  Some small knitted squares from some scraps of wool ... hmmm ... what to do with these squares ... Oh, perhaps make a small shelf bunting in simple neutral toningsI appliqued \"I (heart) home\" in Lynette Anderson fabrics, attached it to Lynette Anderson ribbon, then added Lynette Anderson buttons to each end  . . . for no particular reason other than I was using what I had in my stash at the time.  This morning I have been trying to stuffing some soft toys at the kitchen table ... the help I have been getting is unfortunately not optional!!!!I hope you all have a wonderful week ahead dear friends & readers, Thanks so much for popping by today so I can share my news with you allwith much love & friendship to you all,Granny Julie x0x0"},

Its a *BOY* by the way !!!I had quite a stash of lovely soft, white towelling & I thought some handmade washcloths never go amiss ... so I stitched up half a dozen & bound them with some pretty bindings.Also some polar fleece cuddlies are a definate pre-requisite for a winter baby ... along with some flannellette cot sheets & a matching wheatbag to warm the cot But the project I have been working away on diligently over the past few months ... in between orders & kitten related life ... is this cot blanket for my grandsonI came across the pattern in an old Country Threads back in January when I was culling alot of my craft magazines.  The design is called \"The Toyroom Floor\" & is by Lyn Hyland of Lil' Blokes.  I thought it was perfect for a wee boy.I used a gorgeous wool blanket I had tucked away but I enlarged the size, & added the Noah's Ark to the topSoldier, Train & Jack-in-the-boxMy favourites .... Teddy & Golly,  toy ball & Noah's ArkI took it outdoors to photograph as I felt the colours were showing up really quite \"wishy washy\" & they are in fact lovely & bright & vibrantWhen I had finished the applique I backed it with a nice thick cream polar fleece bought from Spotlight.  Then I bound it all .... but it still seemed to be lacking something ... so I purchased this variegated perle thread & decided to herringbone stitch around the edges of it allphew ... what a loonng way round the blanket !!!I have the label ready on the back to fill in with his name & date of birth   :-) I had an old toy which had fallen to bits so I saved the rattle inner & made this wee cat soft toy/rattle from the leftover blanket scraps.And last but not least ...  a pair of soft flannel shoes in perfect kiwiana fabric, the buzzy bee ... lined with the same polar fleece as the blanket backGosh I do SO look forward to making many more special creations for my grandson over the coming months.And I have included these next 2 photos to show you just how difficult life really is craft-wise in my house of lateOn the floor - Me - trying to cut out blanket toys - helpers NOT optional !!!!chewing on my machine cord - a frequent pastime !!. . . this game is called \"unravel the cotton for Mum\" . . .Oh it brings new meaning to the word \"tolerance\". Yesterday, just to get some fresh air & \"blow the cobwebs out\" we (\"we\" meaning me & cats) spent some time on the deck washing all my gourds & putting them in my old wheelbarrow ... hopefully a nice splash of colour for the coming winter months  :-)Thank you all so much for popping by today to see my creations,I hope the coming week brings you many lovely moments,with love & friendship to you all,Julie, Blackie & Pippix0x0x0"},
{"title": "Vintage Aprons & Teacup Angels", "date": "Saturday, May 9, 2015", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readers,My friend Claire had been given this beautiful vintage apron quite sometime ago by her cousin.I have folded it to fit it in the photoIt had originally belonged to her Aunt who had lived to the ripe old age of 98 ... still using & wearing the apron Claire had thought.I very much loved the detailed embroidery in it & also the very worn bias binding around the edges of the apron ...  together with some different coloured bias binding that had been used to repair one of the ties.I loved the \"make do & mend\" philosophy of using what she had on hand.Claire & I discussed what to do with it to best show off the embroidery.  I suggested a small plump bolster cushion that would look equally as lovely on a chair or a bed ...I was really pleased to be able to use the entire bottom panel of the apron to utilise the beautiful embroidery.I backed the cushion with a fine linen I had, in a slightly off white colour.I also managed to make up a lavender bag using the \"bib\" part of the apron ... rather than draw it together at the top (& lose the effect of the embroidery), I sewed it down & added 3 mother-of-pearl buttons.I really enjoyed doing this project & giving a second life to the apron .... I think Claire is planning to give the cushion back to her cousin as a gift.We studied the embroidery together & laughed over how some of the hollyhock centres had been stitched in black but when she had perhaps run out of thread, she had used what she had on hand or left them unstitched.Her stitches were exquisite & beautiful & had definately stood the test of time as the embroidery itself was in immaculate condition.My dear friend Catherine had given me some fabric pieces & two beautiful vintage teacups along with a magazine - \"stitch craft create\"Catherine had asked if I could please make up the Tilda teacup angel pattern in the magazine titled \"Teaspoon Ladies\" for her  I vaguely recalled my friend Claire mentioning she had made this pattern & recommending to enlarge it to fit more neatly in the teacups.Unfortunately I remembered this after making my 1st calico body.Yes, it definately does need enlarging, otherwise the angels appear a bit lost in the teacups ...Catherine had chosen a lovely vintagey looking rosebud fabric for this teacup above, which was the first angel I made - a single pearl bead embellished her collar & a silk ribbon rosebud in her hairI did love this simple green polka dot cotton fabric which perfectly set this teacup off.  I found a tiny vintage button in my stash for her collar.I came across the feather wings at Davids Emporium in Hamilton but found I had to cut them down quite a bit as they were quite large for the delicate dainty angels.Catherine was delighted with her pair which she tells me are currently residing in Lucy, her vintage caravan where I am sure they will be most at home.I hope to make this pattern up for myself & some for the Cottage also.Autumn is very much a gathering season here at my rather odd threadbear life ...I have been gathering walnuts everyday this week & drying in big cane baskets out on the deckI also finished harvesting my crops of pumpkins & gourds this past week ...I love this little orange \"jack-o-lantern\" variety below but unfortunately only 2 grew, so I will save the seeds from them for next time roundI really, really enjoy growing gourds each year & hope to continue this for many years to come   :-)And So ... the Pippi & Blackie Saga continues ...Oh to be a kitten .... where life is just one big game - playing with toys, diving into neatly folded clothing piles etc ...Blackie likes to sit out on his chair & sleep, contemplate life, or watch the world go by ... Miss Pippi likes to have someone to entertain her .... all day long !!!!Her personal hygiene habits have improved just a smidgeon. I noticed the other day he got her in a headlock & some grooming went on ... she suffered it for only a very brief timeI hope you have a wonderful weekend dear friends & readers,Thank you all for stopping by today,Tomorrow is Mother's Day here in my part of the world,To all the ones that care for others .... human & furry varieties included ...

I used a nice piece of neutral linen for the backing & stitched on the words to show the area in the U.K. that it representsVicky was really thrilled with her cushion when she collected it this morning.When I am spraying my section perimeter I also wander over into the depot yard next door & spray the boundary for them.  I often notice the area out the back where they put their \"scrap metal\".  This wine rack had been sitting there for a couple of weeks so I asked if I might perhaps have it ??(sorry I forgot to get a \"before\" photo of it when Pippi wasn't using it for a jungle gym)Firstly I scrubbed it ... surprisingly, under the layers of dust & grime, it was actually in immaculate condition I spray painted it with some cream spray paint I had in the cupboard ... then I embellished it a little ...It turned out so lovely .... sort of fresh, clean & feminine looking ...I have popped it for sale in my Cottage    :-)I have decided that seeing as Pippi dances merrily over the keyboard when I am typing (& deletes alot) that she can jolly well do a post today ...\" Life According to Pippi \"(1) Seeing as My Father chose me, he told my Mother that she could name me.  She named me Pippi Longstocking.  He says it is such a mouthful  . . .  he calls me \"little one\"(2)  I have been trying to get Little Blackie to play with me.  I honestly don't know why  they call him Little Blackie ... to me he looks like big fat Blackie.  I have decided from now on, I shall refer to him as Fat Black ... a name much more suited to him, the big lazy oaf who won't get up & play with me.(3) My Mother tells me I have some serious personal hygiene issues I need to sort out.  She wants me to \"watch fat Black\" washing & grooming himself & learn from him!!!  I can think of much more fun things to do instead of wasting time grooming myself.(4) My Mother likes to pursue crafty pastimes.  I don't actually know why she does, but when she gets fed up with me, she lets me play with the things on her sewing desk ... its quite fun mostly & when I get a little bored, I just chew on her machine cord & she quickly stops sewing!!! She tells me she knew a girl once called Julie who had time for creative pursuits & a reasonably clean house, but now she thinks perhaps she was just an illusion in her head or a figment of her imagination??!!   I have no idea what she is on about.Re-organising my Mothers bobbins for her                                                Chewing on the machine cord    (5) Sometimes when My Mother is doing chores, I like to \"help her\".  I know I can be most helpful.  The other day I \"helped her\" wrap a birthday gift for her friend(as you can see .... I am warming the paper up before she uses it - helpful aren't I??)(6) The other night I heard My Mother yell loudly at my Father & use at least 3 bad words in the one sentence!!!  It appears my Father had left the toilet seat lid up & I accidently fell in when I was pirouetting around on the seat. I have never heard My Mother use 3 bad words in one sentence before. My Father just rolled his eyes & smiled.In the mornings when My Mother uses the toaster I like to sit in the appliance cupboard amongst the crumbs for a bit(7) My Mother tells me I am \"such a pain\" but when she strokes me in her (quite large) lap, she tells me she loves me.  AND she puts a wheatbag in my bed & my blankets in the clothes drier to \"warm them\" for 5 minutes before I go to bed, so I guess she must care a little tiny bit.. . . & so I think . . . all in all . . . I am kinda lucky I came to live in this rather odd little house.I hope you all have a week filled with love & kindness,thank you all so much for your visit,with much love & friendship,Julie, fat black little Blackie & pain Pippix0x0x0"},

{"title": "A Piece of Linen ... Some Apples .... & a Gift", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2015", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers & Happy Friday to you all Earlier this year, while having an hour to fill waiting for a wheel alignment on my car, I wandered into the Habitat for Humanity Thrift ShopI remembered that down the very back of the store they have a large banana box filled with fabric remnants & old textiles.  After a good old fossick I unearthed this lovely old piece of embroidered linenI absolutely loved the detail on it ... (I must confess it was most certainly not this colour when I purchased it ... it was rather grubby & unloved)I loved the combination of colours that someone had used ... it would not be colours I would put together but I adored it.A gentle soak & a wash & it definately changed colour, & was in remarkably good conditionAs it was two pieces of linen joined together - with holes to crochet a small picot edge - I wondered whether it had perhaps started out its life destined to be a cushion cover ??  As I do not know how to crochet, I decided to make it into a penny rug It spent about 3 days on my lounge floor with several pieces of felt thrown across it ... this is how I choose which colours to use ... I have to \"walk past it\" over several days before I can decide.After choosing the colours for my pennys, I just worked on it in the evenings over a couple of months ... I find stitching the felt very therapeutic work when my eyes are tired at nightWhen finished, I backed it with a piece of grey wool I had in my scrap bag  -  once again an Op Shop findWhat do you think dear readers??  I have it sitting on my old travelling trunk with my large wooden trug on top ...Although I usually blanket stitch the edge where the pennies meet, this time I chose to just copy the row of stem stitch that was already around the inner edgeAs I said earlier - not normally colours I would have chosen - but it definately adds a splash of cheer to my dull dining room . . .. . .  & I think what appeals to me most of all is the combination of vintage (with the old embroidered linen) & slightly primitive (with the felt pennies)My lovely friend Kerryn has recently been on a quick visit.  She purchased some of my fabric apples, but on her return home, realised she needed more to fill her tin dish, so she requested another 6 in \"country colours please.\"I really enjoy making these little apples ... I think the pattern originally came out of a Tilda Book ... though I have long ago lost the instructions & am just left with the apple shape.Though you are supposed to insert a twig into the centre, I always use a small piece of cinnamon stick.  When I scent this with my cinnamon/clove oil ... the smell is just divine  :-)My friend Pauline is turning 60 this weekend.Many of my friends & I have chosen to no longer exchange gifts ... we feel we all have enough \"stuff\" & would rather spend a pleasant couple of hours together enjoying a nice lunch to celebrate our birthdays.However I wanted to make something for Pauline as I feel those 10 year birthdays are quite special.I used one of the patterns from dear Jenny's Stitchery Club ... & stitched up this little friendship design using 2 Cottage Garden threadsThe piece of white linen was in a bag of fabrics given to me.  In the bottom of the bag was a pair of white ladies trousers - cut out - but never sewn up.  I have used the linen for lots of projects now.As Pauline loves buying the handmade soaps I sell in the Cottage, I decided to make my stitchery into a little drawstring bag & pop some soaps insidePauline loves her garden so - after coming across this sweet little cup & saucer with 2 birds on it, I chose to make it into one of my teacup birdfeeders as I knew she didn't have a birdfeederThe saucer base screws into a green garden stake & can be easily moved around the garden.As well as the soaps she often buys my cottage garden potpourri so having just made a fresh batch, I filled a noodle box with it for herWe are off for morning tea tomorrow morning & I have her gifts all wrapped & ready to go(phew !!)My dear friend Catherine sent me this really delightful little verse about \"angels with fur\"I just loved it, but I was having an email conversation with friend & fellow cat-lover Willie  ... & we both agreed we were not too sure about the sentence \"cats will pay your rent if you let them\" !!!So I put the question to little big Blackie ...Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friendsI am off to my Mums on Sunday for a few days - she is turning 86 - so I will have no internet until my return.I hope you all have a wonderful weekend filled with things that bring you pleasure & joywith much love & friendship,Julie & Blackie x0x0"},

I do love it now thoughWhen Sue came to visit me in this post here she bought me a boot load of goodiesThis little varnished shelf was in amongst Sue's treasures ... it came up beautifully with a revamp & some shiny new hooksThank You So Much dear SueAlso unearthed in my sleep-out this week, was this wooden tool boxI should say \"mini tool box\" as it is only 13 inches in length & veeerrry cuteAfter the clean/wax/paint/sand proceedure, I cut a square of thick cardboard for each compartmentI then glued wadding to my 4 cardboard squares & covered them with fabricThen the fun part begins  .  .  .  .  embellishing   . . .  some wooden embellishments & some rub-on words . . . One end had the name \"T Rise\" engraved into it, which you could still faintly see after my painting over it I solved this dilema by mod-podging doilies on each end(should you come across T.Rise at any stage, please don't tell him I have his tool box !!)showing the four lined compartments insideI just love my mini tool carrier & can think of 101 uses for it   :-)My friend Gail is closing her Gift shop after 20 + years  -  all her stock is reduced by 50%I purchased this frame thingy from her  .  .  .As the frame was $15.90 I paid the princely sum of $8 for it It is actually a jewellery hanger ... you hang your necklaces etc from the 4 hooksI didn't especially like the colour or the style of it ... but I did have something else in mind .  .  .First I removed the hooks & filled the holesAfter waxing it I applied a couple of coats of my cream wall paintHowever, when sanding it back to distress it, I kept getting yellow coming through & couldn't seem to get down to the raw wood underneath(this serves me right incidently, for not thinking it through properly & just firing ahead impatiently)To solve this I wiped the whole thing over lightly with some wood stain I had on hand ... just lightly with a rag, let dry, then gave it another coat of cream paintThen I sanded it all again . . .When happy with the finish, I replaced just one hook in the middle & hung it up\"well that looks interesting\" the Mr noted on his way past ... \"pity you forgot to put the picture in it\" !!!???I wound some wire tightly around the rim of an old jam jar, tied a lace bow around it, & also to hang it from(what - no cream lace on hand - only white?? Just dunk it in parisian essence for 2 minutes)I tied a small dainty key charm onto my lace bowAlthough there are limited pickings in the garden just at present, I found some rosemary which smells wonderful(Note to self . . .  remember to put some water in the vase Julie !!! )I am so delighted with my hanging vase-frame & look forward to trying camelias in it when they start to bloomThank you all so much for your visits today dearest friends & readersI hope you all have a wonderful Easter breakI hope I have inspired you to go rummage in the shed for the Mr's old tool box, perhaps a frame, a jam jar or two??with much love & friendship to you allJulie & Blackie x0x0xWillie ... please note ... no leg in the air today !!!!!"},

I particularly like the pattern made up in this denimy blue colourwayThe pattern includes both the \"fond hearts swag\" & the \"fond heart door hanger\" stitched onto a background fabric of wool feltAnother little golly girl got completed this week .... this is Suzy, she is a pattern by Kympatti Bears, Australia  She only stands 7 inches tall so is a real cutie ... I am gradually filling up my golly ladder in the Cottage againI love the little pink shoes which match her dress perfectly.The pattern said to make her some optional striped pink tights, but I found the shoes to be a snug fit without any extra padding.I made her body from some black brushed velour fabric & her little gloves are white felt.After the lovely patchwork group ladies I had last Tuesday, I noticed I had completely sold out of my herbal mothball sachets.Luckily I had the ingredients on hand to make up another batch & managed to stitch & fill a dozen bagsAlthough I mainly sell them to the wool/fibre artists, the patchwork ladies were most keen to toss them in amongst their fabrics.I have popped the recipe at the bottom of this post should you be inspired to make some of your own.My daughter-in-law Nicole has her birthday next week.  Both my daughter-in-laws are \"minimalist girls\" so I would never wish to impose more \"stuff\" onto them.  I usually buy them a gift voucher for their favourite store & of course, the obligatory choccies.  However I do like to pop in a little something handmade.Nicoles kitchen is based on her all time favourite colour scheme of black/white & hot pink.I had this black/white dotty teatowel in my stash so I found some hot pink remnants & appliqued the word \"cook\" onto it.I didn't have any bright pink braid or ric-rac on hand, so I used a fancy stitch on my machine to embellish the edgesI am certain I remember seeing flouro pink kitchen spatulas the last time I was at the supermarket, so one of these will be popped in with the gift  (providing I was not hallucinating !!!)The Mr came home last week to find me weeding & having (yet another) little weep about my Jinxy girl.  I miss that little fairy so very much but I am definately getting alot better now.The next time I checked my emails, this little \"note\" popped up in my inboxIt certainly bought a smile to my face & his timing was just perfect   :-)Do you remember the suitcase planter I wrote about in this post  ??? I took this picture just after I had completed it . . .In my post I wrote   \"viola ... one suitcase of flowers ready to grow & spill out ...\"As I was sweeping my deck yesterday I noticed that it had indeed, grown & spilt out ... so I took some pics to share with you .......  apart from the lobelia which got lost somewhere under all the Impatiens ....Well dear readers I am off to make this \"Julie special\" for my lunch again today ...Our beefsteak tomatoes were late ripening this year but are so fat & tastyI have been enjoying having them on toast with some mashed avocado & basil this week ... my basil has also been prolific this summer.I wish for you all a super weekend & thanks - as always - for your welcome visits which are SO appreciatedwith much love & friendship to you all,Julie x0x0x0Herbal Moth Sachets :-- 50 grams dried rosemary- 50 grams dried mint- 50 grams dried thyme- 25 grams ginseng (I buy as a tea from Health Shops)- 200 grams whole cloves.Mix together & put in muslin bags (I also toss in a good handful of dried lavender)"},

I seriously have my doubts  !!!!!I shall keep you posted on this venture dear readers.I asked my friend Jan if she ever came across any small size Agee Jars in her Op Shop travels to please let me know ... Jan very kindly offered me 6 jars she had sitting at home.I was able to make some more string jars as had sold some of the ones I did last year for the Cottage.I also made Jan a string jar as a \"thank you\" ... I was so grateful as these Agee Jars are becoming quite sought after now that bottling & preserving seems to be making a come backI really enjoy making these - often they make a pleasant change from sewing Well dear friends - thank you all again for your welcome visitsI wish for you, a week filled with wonderful things(well actually Julie, the week is almost over - haven't you realised this yet !!!???)I shall leave you with this little collage of Blackie who, as you can see, continues to lead a rather stressfull existence here at my Threadbear life . . .his absolute favourite pastime .... sleeping with one leg in the air !!!!with much love & friendship,Julie & Blackie x0x0x0"},
{"title": "The Tale of the $2  Chair", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2015", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers . . .  & \"Happy Tuesday\" to you allWhen I emerged from the Stratford Salvation Army Op Shop carrying this old wooden chair out to my car, I am certain my Mother sank down in her seat.In fact I am sure that  . . .   if she had been able to manage - she would've hidden under the dashboard of my car !!!I can't for the life of me imagine WHY ???!!!I remember her comment well  ...  \"Oh please tell me you have NOT just bought that hideous piece of junk??!!\"\"Yes I have actually\" I replied \"for only $2\"On the half hour journey back to her house she did inquire if perhaps we were going via the Dump??I ignored her ... my Mum has never been able to see the potential in anything & calls me \"a junk collector\"(oh shock horror!!!!)Oh lovely old chair . . . . . full of potential, potential, potential    :-)The chair travelled all the way home with me & sat in a corner of our deck with my recycling bin on it for a good 18 months at least.It was only last week when The Mr (who had dug a big hole at the farm to burn some rubbish in),  inquired if I wanted to toss \"the old dilapidated chair\" in??I decided it was time it got a long overdue make-over.(I must add too, that the chair was really solid & not rickety or wobbly in any way)First up was a scrub, then a spray with kerosene (to kill any borer & yes, there were several holes), a light sand & then I began my painting with my trusty old household wall paint.The chair needed 3 coats all up, to cover the old brown paint that was on it.  It also needed some filling of gaps & holes, but I chose to give it 2 thick coats before doing this as often the paint itself will fill alot of the holes.  I attempted to fill the large missing section in the chair back but I wasn't being too fussy as I had other ideas in mind for this particular area.A light sand after the filling, then I added my third coat.  When dry I lightly sanded the edges to give it the shabby chic look that appeals to me.  You could still see faint outlines in the chair back where the wood had been missing . . . so my next plan of action was . . . . . .  Yes,  you guessed right !!!I mod-podged on the 3 cute little crochet doilies that I had been saving for this very project.Then I decided to make a thin squab for the seat of the chair & found the lovely piece of tea-dyed looking fabric that I had also earmarked for this projectI was happy with the finish but - as with lots of my projects - I like to walk past them for a day or two (or 3 sometimes) ... & yes, I felt it needed \"something else\" to complete itYes, that was it . . . a small plump cushion to finish it off.I used some of my wool blanket scraps & another crochet doiley, then I appliqued a small heart from the squab fabric.A bit of a transformation don't you think dear readers??Now tell me .... would you have agreed with my Mum & dumped this chair ??Another small revamp in the Threadbear house this past week was this little wooden box/container purchased for 50c from Hospice(it had been $1 but was in the half marked price basket)While I was busy painting my chair, it was no effort to slap some paint on this wee cutie, though a little tricky doing in between the narrow slats ...I added a padded base lined with some pretty Cath Kidston fabric.A lovely customer to my Cottage, Sheila, was finding it difficult to get any accessories in orange to compliment her new kitchen.She asked if I would make her an oven mitt set with gollies appliqued on it.As I had the two orange tea towels in my stash, I appliqued on the same gollies while doing Sheilas order.Her lovely daughter-in-law Vicky, collected the order, saw the teatowels & bought them as a gift for Sheila.My dear friend Carolyn was up from the South Island on a visit so I decided to make the Raspberry & White Chocolate shortcake recipe that I had been obsessing over for several weeks now, but never actually attempted A neighbour had given me some fresh raspberries which inspired me to give it a tryYou can find the recipe I used HEREAfter dusting with icing sugar & serving with freshly whipped cream I have to say . . . it was divine !!!!And Carolyn bought me a gift .... a piece of her beautiful mosaic workI had been wondering about how to mark little Jinxy's final resting place & this was just simply perfectShe is laid to rest under the old Plum tree that she so loved to climbEvery few days Blackie & I pick fresh flowers for her grave . . .Let me rephrase that a little - I pick fresh flowers for her grave - Blackie would rather observe me from the garden .... . . sniff the dried seed pods . . .  Or . . .. . . lounge about & watch me from the deck with one leg in the air !!!!Thanks so very much for stopping by today folks & listening to my - rather lengthy- \"tale of the chair\",I hope this has inspired you to give those old chairs a second (or third) glance now ?? I hope the rest of your week is filled with cheery things,with much love & friendship to you allJulie & Blackie x0x0x"},

I found this beautiful piece of scrap booking paper fitted on it perfectly ... I mod podged this also, as it ensures the trays remain wipeableWhile away for the funeral I popped into the Hospice Shop & picked up these little china butter dishes - they had just been put out & were only $3 each.I have a \"bit of a thing\" for small butter dishes (Yes Julie, along with the \"bit of a thing\" you have for nice soaps & small china jugs!!!***)I would like to take a moment to say THANK YOU to you all from the bottom of my heart, for your kind, thoughtful, & heartfelt comments on the loss of my dear little kitten Jinxy.Your comments \"wrapped their arms around me\" & gave me comfort & I am so very grateful for this.Bless you all for the kindness you showed at such a difficult timeThank you to the friends that sent me the little \"care packages\" - your thoughtfulness is so appreciated.A customer that has recently started coming to my Cottage - a lovely girl called Vicky - came across my blog post on the internet & rang to read me a poem she had written about Jinxy.  I couldn't believe that, although Vicky had never met Jinxy in person, or even heard me speak of her (now there's a wonder Julie!!!) she still managed to compose the most beautiful poem that covered her short life in exact detail.  I would like to share it with you if I may ... Mummy Cat, she had it toughOut there all aloneShe was ready with a litterShe was searching for a homeShe came upon a gardenIt was pretty and sereneThe loveliest of placesThat her eyes had ever seenShe settled in to birth usThere were four of us in allMy siblings were all healthyBut I was Oh so smallMy Mummy tried to do her bestTo keep us warm and fedShe tucked us up all safe and soundIn a big old doggy bedA lady came from time to timeI knew that she meant wellMummy didnt understandYou were helping, I could tellSometimes she would take meInside her lovely, cosy houseI'd get toasty by the fireAnd stay quiet as a mouseShe called me \"Little Sickie\"A title true to formThe lady helped me grow so strongShe kept me fed and warmAs I became much strongerShe changed my silly nameIt suited me no longerAnd so \"Jinxy\" I becameI looked upon the ladyAnd my heart felt full and strongShe had become my humanI had loved her all alongI was happy with my ladySee, she had become my MumI loved it when she stroked meFrom my head down to my bumNearly a year had gone byI was such a happy girlMy lady mum was always thereTo me she was my worldBut then one day I was playingAnd I strayed away from homeI saw a light then all was stillAnd then I was all aloneI was sitting on a rainbowAnd as I looked aroundI saw my sister, WhiteyShe was lost, but now was foundWe looked down from there togetherAnd we saw her, looking sadHer eyes were full of tearsSo we knew that it was badSoon I came to understandThose tears were shed for meI said \"don't cry I will wait hereMy beautiful Mummy\"And so we stay here playingAnd I will await the dayThat she comes to me on Rainbow BridgeAnd once again, we'll play.I can just about - almost - get to the last verse now without weepingI hope you enjoy the poem dearest friends & readersVicky, thank you So much for your very kind gesture which brings me great comfortI am planning to make a little photo book of Jinxy & frame a copy of the poem inside itLittle Big Blackie is settling slowly - he likes the tune that The Mr's i-phone plays, it lulls him to sleep(yes I know, we are a pathetic lot aren't we!!??)In the meantime I read this little verse to Blackie each day  . . . (& try very hard to remember it myself!!) Thanks so very much for your visits today & reading all the way to the end of this lengthy postwith much love, friendship & blessings to you allAnd THANK YOU all again for your kindness & thoughtsJulie & little quite big Blackiex0x0x0x0x0"},

( a Eulogy )", "date": "Wednesday, February 18, 2015", "text": "A sad, sad Hello to you dear friends & readers,A few days ago I had to say Goodbye to my precious little Jinxy Girl after she was killed on our road.My heart is heavy with grief as I type this.It seems difficult to believe that I snapped this photo just one day prior to her deathI had been wandering around the garden looking for something inspiring to photograph & saw her watching me from under my old wooden wheelbarrowWhat struck me was how well she looked after many months of caring for her & trying to get her to put weight on.As I never knew the date she was born ... a litter of 4 wild kittens just appeared in my front garden last autumn ... I can only guess she would have been about a month shy of her first birthday when she died.I left food every day in the front garden but their Mum kept shifting them as she didn't like me trying to interact with them. And then the frosts came & I found them one morning, all sleeping in my old dogs kennel, that I had still kept.(click on the pic to enlarge to see how really tiny she was)It became apparent how much smaller you were than the others ... you were such a wee dot.A puff of wind could've blown you over (in fact one day, a puff of wind actually blew you sideways as I watched you trying to run across the lawn)You seemed constantly chilled & would let me bring you inside by the fire or the heater ... but you would only last about 10 minutes & you would be gone again, searching for the others . . .. . . who frequently went off & left you all alone for long periods of timeWe fed all 4 of you day & night ... but your Mum didn't like it & still took you away lots ... you were all quite wild really.I named you Little Sickie with your sad face & your weepy eyesYour sister \"Whitey\" was killed by a truck at the depot yard, & I found a good home for \"Squawker\" to live.  That left just you & your brother, Blackie.  I invested in a cat cage & finally managed to get you into the Vets.You had bad cat flu & bronchitus & she gave me 2 weeks of special antibiotics to give you.After 24 hours you disappeared again, so I made the decision to lock you & Blackie inside for the time being. Then, it became pandemonium for awhile  . . .I kept you shut inside through a cold wet winter for about 8 weeks in total.You loved it & thrived  .  .  .  Blackie - he barely tolerated it.  As your health improved we renamed you little \"Jinxy\"We tipped our little house \"on its ear\" making games & tunnels for you both to play in You were always right there being a pain assisting me whatever I was doing, you loved my crafty pastimesYou were mischievious, rascally & often just plain naughty ... but like with any naughty child,  I always forgave you when I saw you sleeping - your sweet little face & your curled up toes never failed to melt my heart From day one, I always noticed how you loved to sleep in contact with one of your siblings, always tucked up right next to someoneYes -  we had you speyed ... this took two attempts at the Vets, you almost didn't survive the first anaestheticYou were such a treasure little Jinxy, my dear sweet girl.  I had never experienced kittens before, I had always inherited other peoples \"cast off cats\" that needed rehoming.You tipped my world on its head but you bought me endless joy & pleasure I felt a tight knot of such deep love for you right in the centre of my chest where I imagine my heart to be.We miss you so very much already.And as for dear Blackie .  .  .  he is just lost & lonely.He wonders where his nutty, dippy, loopy sister has gone to.  We are giving him extra special love, care & attention.Sometimes I was sure there were multiple personalities inside that tiny wee head of yours dear Jinxy ... & I loved every single onephoto borrowed from Sue's blogI shall think of you every year when I put the lights on my christmas tree & I will remember to leave a special place underneath it in memory of youRest in peace my sweet little Jinxy girlThank You for the immense joy you bought me in your short lifetimeI shall carry your memory with me in a special place in my heart.with much love,Julie & Blackiex0x0x0"},

I adore this picture !!Sometimes the Cottage can feel like it is ticking along quietly but not really a great deal flying out the door  ... just a kind of steady plodding along.Then suddenly I can look & there are gaps everywhere ... mostly my \"regular stock\" ... for example teatowels, handtowels, wheatbags etc ... nothing particularly creative, but just good steady items that slowly flow out the door & that my regulars like to keep on hand for unexpected gifts.This is what happened last week & after having a small seizure when I saw the amount of gaps ... I thought I had better concentrate a little & fill UP some of those gapsMy handtowels are a regular seller - since taking this photo on Friday, these 3 are gone As I had an over-abundance of flouro green handtowels I made up some more kiwiana ones, & sets of my Scented Spice Mats to match themIn total I made 8 sets of the Spice Mats in a variety of different fabricsThe Kiwi & the Pukeko ones are now on their way to the U.K. - a lovely customer who popped in on Friday wanting lightweight, locally made gifts to take home with her  . . .I made another 5 Golly teatowels to bring the basket total up to 8After all these years of making Golly teatowels, I still really love them   :-)Though the weather is certainly not conducive, I have been selling lots of wheatbags lately ... I can only imagine people have injuries or sore areas, that need the heat appliedMainly I like to use the flannelette fabrics as find these are cosier & more comforting to handleJust before my Garden Ramble last November, I potted up some of my china cups with delicate babys tears plants ... I wasn't sure how these would sell but had some vintage china cups left over from making my teacup birdfeeders so decided to give it a try ...The four I potted up had sold, so I decided to do another 3 ... it takes a wee while for the plants to get established enough to sell them(I must add here that one lady came back recently with hers ... a sorry looking state ... \"Ummm my plant died\" she said ... I gave her another plant I had growing in a plastic pot so do hope she remembers to actually water this next one !!!!)In the evenings, by the time I get inside from watering & get to actually sit down my eyes are too tired to focus alot I need some gentle handwork that doesn't require too much concentrationThe wool blanket hearts are perfect for this & I try to keep a basket full ready by my chair for evening stitching ...As the bowl in the Cottage only had 3 left, this gave me the chance to do a lovely assortment using up some of my wool blanket scraps ... stuffed with this seasons dried lavender they smell heavenlyMy lovely friend Lorraine popped in the other day - she had been on a trip to Perth & had purchased some linens from an Op Shop that was closing down ... she had taken out what she required & my name popped into her head ... what a treasure she is ... just look at these delights ...Thank You SO MUCH Lorraine for your kindness & generosity ...

{"title": "Lois's Wedding Dress Doll      (& a tutorial)", "date": "Tuesday, February 3, 2015", "text": "Good Tuesday afternoon to you dear friends & readersWay back sometime mid last year, my friend Lois bought me an order to do for herYou can read about part of Lois's order in this post here Scrunched up in the bottom of the plastic bag was Lois's wedding dress.Although I completed the rest of the order, I can't tell you how many times that dress came out of my sewing room cupboard, then was thrown right back in again . . .(& the door slammed shut tightly !!!)I decided I had procrastinated enough !!!***The dress itself was in a sorry state .  .  .Front View of Dress                                                                          Back viewLois got married nearly 50 years ago now ... & although the dress in its day, would've been beautiful ... it was now neglected & yellowed with age . . .This time - for a change - its not my photography making it look yellowed . . . it actually IS very yellowThough the train was gorgeous, there was very little lace detailing to work with, apart from using the flowers off the train, & the lace up the sleeves. The rest of the dress was quite plain.I decided I was going to need to make a decent size doll, to do it justice ... so I chose Charlotte by Rosalie Quinlan designs as she is 70 cm's in lengthI tentatively cut out my pieces, then I needed to try to clean the fabric.I dissolved a strong mixture of Napisan in hot water, then made it up to luke warm.  I soaked my pieces overnight, then just rinsed them really well in cold water, then hung them on the line in the sun to dry.  They came out spotless.(phew . . . what a relief!!)I made the entire dress using the heavy satin & then used one lace sleeve for a \"pinny\" at the front.The sleeves were made from a fine silky organza fabric.The cuffs became the bodice & I managed to use one button-up cuff for the back so the dress is removable.I handstitched some of the ribbon roses that were in good condition still, to the hem of the dressI used more of the heavy satin for her pantaloons & edged them with a vintage lace.  Recently Lois had given me an old powder box filled with some lace pieces that had belonged to her late Mum & this length of lace was in there.The remaining sleeve was used to fashion some dainty ribbon roses which I used in her hair as a kind of \"fascinator\" headpiece (& I added some feathers)When she was finished I realised she needed something to hold in her hands . . .I still had some larger size ribbon roses that I had removed from the train so I wired these with some florist wire . . .. . . & made her a bouquet to holdI love her . . . but I now have a deep respect for the women that sew wedding dresses . . . working with the heavy satin & sewing the slippery organza over the top of it all very nearly did my head in !!!! -  Beautiful  -. . .  A Suitcase Planter Tutorial  . . .My friend Lynda phoned & asked me if I would like a Vulcanite Suitcase she was going to dump??I said \"yes please\" - even though I didn't actually know what a Vulcanite Suitcase was  :-)When Lynda's husband dropped it off he said the lid was split & broken & it was only really fit for the dump . . . but I thought perhaps it could look cute planted with flowers ??Cut your timber lengths on a slant at the top for the lid to sit onI drilled in two lengths of timber to hold the lid open - I use my ordinary kindling for this job as I find it is sturdy, but not too thick to drill eitherLine the case with two big black rubbish bags & puncture some holes in the bottom of the bags - clothes pegs are good to hold the bags from slipping as you fill the case with your potting mix.Work out the placement of your plants ... you could use just punnets of flowers but as I wanted instant colour, Mitre 10 stores throughout the country currently have 10 potted colour for $10 . . . which I thought was a bargainViola . . . one suitcase of flowers ready to grow & spill out . . . one Vulcanite Suitcase saved from landfill.I just lift the lid to water it every couple of days.You can read another post about suitcase planting I have done hereThanks SO much for your visit today folks - rather a photo heavy post I am sorry.Before I go ... could Trish (who commented on my last blog post) please email me (stitchedbyjulie@hotmail.com) - Trish I am unable to answer your question as you are coming up as a no-reply blogger.I will leave you today with Jinxy \"pondering her stressful life\" . . .Click on the photo to enlarge it - if you wish  :-)with much love & friendship to you all dear readers.Julie x0x0"},
{"title": "Four Little Angels", "date": "Thursday, January 29, 2015", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers & a warm Welcome to my new followers . . .Four little angels flew out of my sewing room this past week.Or I should say ... 4 little pincushion angels ...this is a Woodberry Designs pattern (by Kerryanne English)You can read about the last time I made these angels hereThe two angels on the left are for birthday gifts ... 2 friends having birthdays this week within 3 days of each otherAs both are beautiful crafters (one a sewer, one a crocheter), I decided this was an ideal gift as you can store sewing notions in the back pocketI popped a pair of small scissors & a needle threader in the back before gift wrapping them.The other two are now for stock for my little Cottage.A customer phoned & asked for a gift to take overseas.  She was happy to leave the choice up to me but her instructions were that it needed to be:-- usefull- lightweight-bright & cheery- kiwiana if possibleAs she has bought the handtowels from me in the past, I decided to make another using my gorgeous bright Pukeko fabric.  A set of clove scented spice mats to match & a teatowel trimmed in this seemed the perfect package.She was delighted with the gifts I had put together & took all 3 items.My hanging baskets are beautiful again this year but soak up the water like a bottomless pit  . . .I find I need to water them twice daily now - both early morning & late evening - the petunias don't seem to mind these long hot dry summers we are now having each year ... so long as their feet are kept wetThe other flowers that seem to do well in my garden during the dry spells are Impatiens (or busy lizzies we call them)Each spring I plant a punnet full in my big old Beatie Wringer Washing Machine that sits under the old silk tree . . .  & fill the old suitcase on my deck with another small punnet.When the rustic chairs in my garden become rotten unsafe to sit on, I like to move them into the gardens themselves as I feel they can still look attractive.You have to be careful though, as customers will sometimes still go & attempt to sit on them ... so I have found if I place a pot of something on the seats, it discourages this from happening.This miniature variety of petunia pepe seems quite happy tucked away in the midst of the rose garden, with the occasional jug of water tossed over itLast week after finishing the millet silage, the Mr decided we should drive to Raglan for a dinner of fish & chips on the beach.Raglan is just over an hour from here & it our nearest beach.I love visiting Raglan & often wonder whether I would be happy to live there??We bought ourselves some dinner ... the fish at Raglan comes in fresh each day & tastes completely different to any you might buy back home ... we found a nice grassy patch to sit & look out at the sea ...Yes I know ... I am pathetic the way I cart my tomato sauce all the way over to the beach !!!!After eating & a walk around the wharf, we usually take a drive out to Whale Bay - sometimes there are surfers out here, & the Mr likes to watch the boats come back in after their days fishingAt another Bay closer to the township, there were some kite surfers out having fun . . .We took a different route back home again (Old Mountain Road) & I noticed how brown the countryside is looking due to lack of any rainfall this summerYou can just faintly see Hamilton city in the distance hereIt was such a nice outing & to get away to the seaside, even if just for a few hours.Well friends ... it is lavender harvesting time again in my neck of the woods so I am off outside to rub some more lavender stalks - below is this morning pickings ...Lean closely into the screen & take a big sniff !!!!But firstly I am off to make myself a cuppa ... I hope you enjoy this little verse I found to share with you extolling the benefits of tea drinking ...Source : tumblrThank you all so much for your visit today & all the lovely comments you leave me ... I appreciate them all so very, very much.with much love & friendship,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Op Shop Treasures . . . dead ducks . . . & Blackie", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2015", "text": "Hello & Happy Tuesday dear friends & readers,Another wedding invite  . . .  another horseshoe to make  .  .  .This time for my sweet young friend Rebecca getting married in early MarchI have accumulated a small stash of these white boxes now from Warehouse Stationery as they are perfect to present the horseshoes in & I really enjoy decorating them as well.While running early for a haircut last week, I popped into the Animal Care Op Shop to fill in time . . . the young girl behind the counter was texting & chewing gum & looking like she wished she was \"anywhere else but there\" . . .I popped these on the counter (they have had a wash, they werent quite that colour!!)How much for these I asked her??a shrug of the shoulders   . . .  \"Umm ... 50c\"  she said (my heart skipped a beat)I popped this on the counter & again asked how much ??another shoulder shrug . . .   \"50c\"  still texting . . .\"are you sure??\"  I asked her \"Who would want that junk\" she replied \"the doll doesn't even have any arms!!!\"So I paid my $1.00 &, heart beating fast, I exited the store.After a gentle soak & wash, I am so in awe of my vintage linen set - someone has crazy patchworked the serviette & small egg cosy using their left over remnants from a time long gone by ...the fabric is fragile & thin in places, worn with age ...I just love it so much & it brings me cheer sitting on the rustic egg holder on my kitchen benchAnd as for \"armless wooden dolly\"   .  .  . she got a gentle wash to remove the fly spots & a bit of a makeover too . . .I fashioned her a dress from some of my Lynette Anderson fabrics - I visualised her in quite neutral tonings ... then a pair of pantaloons to attach the wooden legs to her bodySome small calico arms were made & tucked inside the sleeves, then a doiley collar & a set of rusty wire wings seemed perfect I thoughtThe little wooden heart came off something long, long ago, & the wooden bird button was just the right size to adorn itMuch happier than sitting in a box of broken oddments at the Op Shop don't you think??My neighbour Leah's very dear elderly Aunt passed away late last year in Holland.  Leah's Aunt had been a wonderful artist in her day & had done many beautiful paintings as well as some onto fabric.  Leah arrived home with a small bag full of some fabric \"remnants\" she had once practised on, & asked me if I could \"do anything with them\" for her to keep.It was a little nerve-wracking as I had to carefully soak & wash the fabrics first ... I tried out a small piece for a test run to ensure the colours stayed & didn't bleed.  It really had just been her \"practising onto fabric remnants\" as it was large pieces with various paintings on at different intervals, & I had to try to fashion something from them.These 2 paintings were my favourite & I loved the colours ... they were large enough to cut around, overlock & hem, & make into two medium sized cloths for an occasional table ... one was a white background, one was ecru.I managed to make 2 small, plump cushions from another corner & then a small lavender bag from the last remnant.  I find requests like these can be scary sometimes, but Leah was SO happy with what I achieved for her & now has some mementoes to enjoy of her Aunt's work.This week saw another \"mini avalanche\" in my sewing room which unearthed a box I had long forgotten about.  Many years ago I used to make these calico \"upside-down ducks\" ... it is a pattern called \"Dead Duck\" by Di's Dazzling Dolls (Diana Chalk 2002).  I used to have an old ladder hanging in my kitchen with pots & pans on it & one of these hanging in the middle, & I received lots of comments about my duck.  Inside the box which fell on my head, were 2 calico ducks already cut out.  So I sewed them up & stuffed them.  My orange felt was almost non-existent & I had just enough for the feet, so I decided to paint the beaks insteadAlas - no orange paint !!! Being the weekend & wanting to finish them, I recalled a faint distant memory . . .  \"red & yellow makes orange\" (I think from my primary school days no less)So I mixed my red/yellow paints together & voila ...  I made orange !!!    :-)Really hard to photograph these darn ducks . . .They are really long ... from head to toe they measure a metre in length They are such a fun, cheerful thing & always bring lots of positive comments ... they look great hanging from the wooden ladder amongst the dried flowers in my CottageAnd some exciting news ... this week for the very first time I was able to pick little Blackie up (now come on Julie ... you call that exciting???!!!)Little Quite big Blackie has always been an aloof kitten (cat) - he is happy for you to pat him sometimes ... on his terms, but don't ever try picking him up, or you would feel the sharpness of his claws.  This week I just bent down, picked him up gently & popped him on his chairNo hissing, spitting or scratching ... mind you, he did go limp like a ragdoll ...since that first time, I have picked him up on numerous occasions & he seems fine ... I haven't quite gotten to the stage of cuddling him in my arms yet ... but I do live in hope   :-)Thanks so much for stopping by today dear friends  -  I always appreciate your visitsWishing you a restfull week ahead & try to remember to  .  .   .with much love & friendship,Julie x0x0"},

I have decided to just enjoy it in the garden & not cut it to bring indoorsWell friends, time to go put the kettle on . . . one of the most thoughtful gifts I received at christmas was from my stepson & his girlfriend.  They gifted me the latest issue of Frankie Magazine along with a tin of tea - \"Chamomile & Lavender\" The tin reads \" a floral rapture ... a superior blend of chamomile, lavender & cornflowers artfully blended\"They wrote on the card that it was \"enforced relaxation\" ... & it certainly is!!   Each afternoon, while escaping the heat, I make a cuppa & enjoy a few more pages of the magazine.I hope you get to enjoy some enforced relaxation in your coming week dear friends & readers,thanks so much for stopping by today, I hope you are managing to keep warm or cool, wherever you may bemuch love & friendship,Julie x0x"},

I gave her some little shoes & embellished her bodice with a small crochet flower (which also got dunked in the parisian essence mixture along with all the lace)The 2nd completion I managed was this stitchery (started about 6 months ago & a gift from my friend Bev) . . . the actual stitchery itself was completed awhile ago but I just never quite got around to making it up into the wallhangingThe pattern is called \"Making Spirits Bright\" designed by Natalie Bird from The Birdhouse.  I stitched it using Cottage Garden thread Kangaroo Paw.  The fabrics I used for the wallhanging are from the Lynette Anderson rangeWhile Mum was staying we took ourselves off to Hamilton Gardens for a picnic lunch.  It was my daughter in law Sarahs, birthday so my sons & their wives came along too ... it was a wonderful outing which I enjoyed SO very much.  We ate our picnic on a huge marble table overlooking the Italian Renaissance Gardenwe all enjoyed a lovely shared picnic lunch, homemade club sandwiches, muffins & fresh fruitI think of all the different sections in the Italian Garden, this particular area was my absolute favourite ... I just loved the combination of blue delphiniums & the lacey red yarrow . . .. . . & must admit that I have now become quite fixated on planting some red yarrow :-)If you walk through the large Italian Building behind the fountain you come out onto a balcony that overlooks the Waikato Riverwe posed for a couple of quick family snaps   :-)Three GenerationsMy beautiful daughters-in-law Nicole & Sarah, my Mum, & yours truelyWe briefly walked around a couple of the other gardens ... the Chinese garden & the formal English garden but Mum was too weary to do a great deal of walking ... there are many more award winning gardens to see here, it is well worth a visit & completely free to enterApologies for all the garden photos but my camera honestly does not do it justice, it is simply beautiful.Before I close I wanted to share a couple of pics ... one is a handmade christmas gift, a surprise in the post from a dear friend who lives far away  . . .His name is Cedric & I just adore him   :-)     And even though the christmas dec's are packed away, this fellow will be staying out to be enjoyed for a bit longer  New (replica) vintage scales, a christmas gift from The Mr ... all chipped & dinged in the appropriate places to look \"antique\"Finally this pic taken on christmas eve, just prior to heading off to beddear little Jinxy, sound asleep under the twinkling lights. I said to The Mr that I hoped she was dreaming of how lucky she is to live with us here & what a wonderful life she has . . .  but he reassured me she was far more likely dreaming of Santa, what he would bring her, & hopefully he would take Blackie with him  !!!!!Have a wonderful week dear friends, thanks SO much for your welcome visitswith much love & friendship to you allJulie x0x0x"},

What to do ???A quick phone call to Mum who assured me that NO she couldn't possibly manage to knit me two before christmas . . .  forced me put my thinking cap on . . .I chose the 2 with the longest/wooliest hair ... & gathered up a length of fabric into a \"skirt\" then added a bow in the same fabric to their hair (Oh & stitched a small bee button to their jackets)Wendy was just delighted & about now the 2 girls are winging their way to Australia for christmas stockings.My friend Lois who frequently gets me to do bits & pieces for her, dropped off this bag of oddments quite sometime ago.  It had been weighing on my mind that I needed to get it sorted for herThat is actually her wedding dress to the left ... I havent even touched that part of the order yet.The roll cushion needed to be recovered in the green stripe fabric, the cream wool cross stitch cushion needed to be taken apart, a good soak to clean it, then a new inner & new backing made for it. The delicate crinolene lady china cup had a hairline crack so I turned it into a pincushion for LoisThe wedding dress is to be used to dress a doll (as yet unmade) ... but that may have to be a project for next year I feel.This \"always kiss me goodnight heart\" was an order for a \"new baby boy who has everything\" giftI had a couple of these in the Cottage but nothing in suitable colours for a new baby boy ... so I made this one up especially for the customer.The pattern is called Sentimental Hearts by Laurel Hermon & is torn out of a very old Homespun MagazineI have sold these in the past to be given to new babys & always think what a beautiful gift they make for the baby who has everything.Before I go make a cuppa I would love to share a few more photos from Kayne & Nicoles recent wedding - they loaded some to my computer over the weekendPrecious Little KarmaBeautiful NicoleAs the weather was so bad they took them down to the wine cellars to take some photos. . .  my 2 boys & I  . . .This last one is one of my absolute favourites - just a random snap of Kayne sharing a laugh with Nicoles Dad & the 2 grandads ... love it.Thanks for staying with me through a photo heavy post dear readersI hope the coming week is good to you all & you are managing the lead up to christmas okay - the next couple of weeks can be a busy time so try to remember to take some time out to \"smell the roses\" along the way . . .Just as little Madam Jinxy is doing   . . .   !!!!!!with much love & friendship to you allJulie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Orders, Inspiration & Flowers", "date": "Friday, November 28, 2014", "text": "Hello & \"Happy Friday\" to you dear friends & readers,I have managed to complete another christmas order in between groups & other \"goings on\" here at my funny ol' threadbear lifeNot sure how that annoying yellowish light got in there . . . sorry folksRecently I made a hottie order for my good friend Sandy, to have at her caravan - you can read about them here.Sandy loved hers so much she thought they would make special christmas gifts to post to family in the South Island.Sandy's sister Bronny loves all things relating to Minnie Mouse, so together we decided on a red/white spotty theme along with some white frilled lace.I lined it with a gorgeous polka dot fabric that was just perfect.Sandy chose the pastel checked blanket with the flowers & the verse tape for her MumMany years ago Sandy's Dad drove a truck for the Fisher's Bread Company. With this in mind, she was able to find an old picture of a 1962 Bedford Van on the internet, which I managed to replicate(with a little bit of help from The Mr who assisted in getting the van shape just right!!!!)I thoroughly enjoyed putting together this order for Sandy & she was really happy with her Hottie Covers.When it comes to creativity where do you get your inspiration from?I get mine from all sorts of places & happenings throughout my day or week, & lots from reading other crafty blogs.Last week I read this post from my clever friend Leeanne's blog& also this post from Vikki's beautiful blogThey both got me \"christmas inspired\" ... especially Vikki's who made me pull out my Tilda book ... purchased long ago & never yet any projects made out of it(hands up all those who can relate to this!!!!)I found myself obsessing about making the Santa ... a little voice in my head kept saying \"its all very well buying these lovely books Julie ... but sooner or later you actually need to make something out of them!!!!\". . . & so, my version of Santa came to life . . .(Now a little footnote here ... should you decide to make him yourself, this is what I would do next time round ... cut the sleeves wider (they are very narrow) & do NOT line the coat with thick fusible interfacing as stated in the pattern ... this makes it very thick & was not necessary I felt personally)So Santa looked a little lonely I thought ... perhaps he needed a little \"pixie\" as a helper ? ?So I made one of the adorable Pixie's on page 12 . . . . . . & now Santa has some company  I am hoping they will stand in the centre of my christmas table in the Cottage & keep everyone in order  :-)(Tilda Book available from here)After my bus the other day I took my camera around the garden ... I noticed the roses were looking stunning despite the awful winds we have been having lately ...Click on the pics to enlarge them if you like  :-)As the first flush will soon be over, I have been de-heading & gathering baskets of petals to dry for my potpourriI dry them in our Sleepout as the sun pours in this room ... as you can imagine, it smells divine at the momentThe hanging baskets are still pretty but will soon need replanting againThese were planted in mid-winter so I have had a good long flowering from them There has been some naughty behaviour recently from the rascals ... disembodied mice & \"prehistoric things\" dissected & left on the lounge floor when I am not aroundI think my life was simpler before the kittens & I am certain the cleaning up was only half the amount it is now !!!!!I hope you have a wonderful weekend dear friendsthanks SO much for your visit today - & also the well wishes you left last post on my son's weddingWe are forecast for rain this weekend so perhaps I can find some sewing time indoors?sending much love, friendship, & flowers to you all . . .The rose \"remember me\" gifted to me when my Dad passed away 12 years ago. . .

{"title": "The Weather was Atrocious ... the day was Beautiful", "date": "Tuesday, November 18, 2014", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersLast Saturday my youngest son Kayne got married to NicoleDespite the fact that the weather was appallingly bad  ... we still had a most beautiful dayMy dear 85 year old Mum spent all last summer drying this pillowcase full of rose petals from her garden.When I dry petals I pretty much fling them on a cane tray, wish them luck, cross my fingers & hope for the best.Mum spreads every one out individually & carefully turns them each day with love & careAlthough we planned to scatter lots up the aisle, Nicole asked me to make 20 paper cones & fill them with petals for the guests to throw instead of confetti ... I decorated them with a simple paper doiley & some jute stringDriving over to the city on the day - the rain pelting down, my wipers on full & my hair falling down rapidly . . . I decided to adopt a \"glass half full\" attitudeIt was lots of fun helping the 3 boys get readyKaynes groomsman Simon snapped a couple of us before we left for the venueOne of the major factors in Nicole choosing the venue was whether or not she could have her little dog Karma there ... it was very important to her that Karma be a part of her special dayShe behaved impeccably considering it was not quite like this at the rehearsal the night before & was most definately - the star of the showThere were a few occasions when we were asked not to take photos as courtesy to the professional photographer (& I totally understand this) ... plus for some reason, my camera was jamming on me frequently but I did get a few snaps throughout the eveningNicole is a lovely girl & I count myself lucky to have her as a daughter-in-lawThe photographer has released this one photo to Nicoles facebook page ... I was not aware they managed to get down to the grapevines for any photos but I think they found a brief break in the weather ... I just adore this image & look at dear little Karma (at the last minute Nicole put her bike in the car & took along in case she got the chance to use it in some photos)It was a most special day enjoyed by everyone.While raising my 2 sons by myself, one of the things I always tried to instil in them was how important family & friends are to you ... & not necessarily blood family either.  If you have people around you that love & care about you, you should be thankful & not take this for granted.  Many people are not so fortunate.  I also wanted to teach them that in order to have good friends, you have to first be one yourself.  Kayne is very lucky - he was surrounded by good mates on the day & his best man & groomsman were wonderful.  Despite the fact they all consumed rather alot of alcohol they got up at the end of the evening & sang a song on stage (with the band playing) ... I was the only one left with a camera by then & I managed some good snapsThis was a totally impromptu performanceThe song they performed was this one below by The Proclaimers.(Many thanks to Catherine for teaching me how to post a video to my blog ... hope this works out okay dear readers)I think this part was one of the really special moments for me as Kayne has a deep love of music.Well dear friends, with a bus due tomorrow, lawns to mow & christmas orders to be made, I need to get focused ... even though I would far rather follow little Jinxy's lead . . .. . .  & just put my head under the covers for a wee while  :-) (or a long while actually!!!)Thanks so much for visiting here today & letting me share Kayne & Nicoles wedding with you allLeft over wedding flowers in the jars we decorated last post . . .  enjoyed now on my dining tablewith much love & friendship,Julie x0x0"},

I have done these for a few years now ... I had stitched the verse onto calico & sewed the candy canes a few weeks back, but the stockings needed to be assembled & then decorated ... It was a rather painstaking \"enjoyable\" process as I had assistance along the way from Jinxy . . .. . .  whether I wanted it or not !!!!One of them has been teadyed quite darkly, the other left paler ... different people like a certain shade/look I findI really love these stuffed stockings - it is a very old pattern from Melissa Duncan of Mogs Designs - every year I really enjoy making them up.Two of the things I sold completely out of last Sunday in the Garden Ramble was my herbal mothball sachets & my citrus potpourri.  I decided I had better rectify this as I had all the ingredients in the cupboard for the mothball sachet mixture ...You can find the recipe to make these in this older post hereMy dehydrator has been working overtime as I dry the oranges from my tree to make up a fresh batch of citrus potpourriOnce again, this is a process that I never grow tired of doing . . .(thank goodness!!!)The Mr has been organising a big finale for his Moto X Club as the winter series comes to an end (he is the President of our local Club) ... he wanted to thank the ladies who gave their time to the Club so he requested me to make up 6 large gift baskets to present to themI had to do this job at the last minute, just prior to the meeting, as otherwise I find if the chocolate is in the house too long, it tends to fall into my mouth melt quite alot!!!!I have been watching this self sown poppy seedling come up in the path to my Cottage ... just this morning it opened & I just loved the variegated colour ... these pop up regularly in my garden & some I pull out, but decided to leave this one amongst the lavender edging my pathThere is such pretty colour in the garden at the moment ... it's nice to capture it on camera to enjoy a little longer & appreciateAnd then just this week I harvested & cooked up my very first batch of beetroot for the season ... delicious  :-)Well friends I am off to make us a salad for dinner, & to feed the rascals thanks so much for stopping by today - may your week ahead be filled with many good thingsI shall leave you with Blackie pondering life in general !!!!Cheerio for now,much love & friendship,Julie & the rascals x0x0x"},

I found a way round it all . . . My sign covered all my bases I thought . . . & made people smile    :-)Another blackboard I wrote a sign on made them smile also, & click lots of pics of it . . .The menfolk all commented that next time I have to have a spare blackboard beside this so they can all write a reply!!!My daughter-in-law Sarah came to help me yesterday & snapped some photos of folk enjoying the gardenAround the pond area - the lavender is not yet floweringThe Cottage was nestled in a frothy pink sea of granny bonnetsThe last of my cherry blossom trees still just in bloomAlthough the morning was definately busier, we had a constant steady stream of people all day longI guess the greatest compliment was when 2 posh very well-dressed ladies asked me for the name of my gardener!!I laughed & explained that I do all the garden myself ... \"but you are the \"shop girl\" aren't you??!!\" they exclaimed\"Yes, but I am also the gardener too\" I am sure they did not believe me ... I guess its hard for some folk to comprehend that some of us actually have to do everything ourselves!!When the last of them had gone & I went down to close the gate I took a couple of snaps looking back towards my garden from the depot yardOur property is rectangular shaped, running parallel to the road & at the far end is a depot yard which we rent out to an Agricultural Contracting firm ... this means I can use the yard for parking for buses or any functions like yesterdayThere is a large established border of native trees planted between our lawn & the depot yard & I had planted some baskets of white Impatiens to try to add some lightness to this area. Unfortunately as it has been so cold, they were not blooming well & giving me the effect I had hoped for . . .Just a week ago a friend popped in to do some early christmas shopping & bought the 2 \"pinkeeps\" I had out in the CottageI found these 2 odd looking stands & also another 2 mini baking tins, so decided to put together a couple more, in between running round like the mad woman that I have been lately !!I really love these pinkeeps, they are one of my absolute favourite things :-)After making the cup/saucer birdfeeders last post, I found a few extra china cups that were \"surplus to requirements\" . . .  so I potted some of them up with delicate baby's tears as thought these may appeal to the gardening customersI was lucky enough to sell 2 already  :-)Also - a week ago - I was invited to my future daughter-in-laws Hen Party ... I must confess I have never attended one of these in my entire life til now ... the theme was \"1920's dress up\"Yep, thats me, wearing the fox ... but don't panic ... its fake!!! And I got my very own sash in case I forgot who I was  ... \"Mother of the Groom\"Nicole, my daughter-in-law to be (in 2 weeks time!!) - her bridesmaids dressed her up, she had no idea about any of this!! (incidently Nicole is dark haired, they put a wig on her)Nicole & her lovely Mum, also named Julie  :-)(also wearing a sash in case she forgot who she was too!!!)Well dear friends, thanks for staying with me through this lengthy \"rambly\" postI am off now to put together a horseshoe for Nicole - Oh it is lovely not to have to be outside gardening todayWe are getting gentle rain which is watering everything nicely for meCheerio for now & thanks - as always - for your welcome visit todayResting up after a stressfull few days \"helping Mum\"with much love & friendship,Julie (shop girl/gardener)Jinxy & Little Big Blackiex0x0x0"},

I find myself taking part !!!!!****!!!This is run every year on the first Sunday in November It runs rain or shine ... or sleet or snow, or thunder & lightning ... whichever happens, it goes aheadThis year is the 19th Ramble & they are featuring 14 different properties - gardens, but also some homes as wellI am only making my garden & the Cottage available ... So as you can imagine, there is lots still to be done ... I work every single day in the garden & then at nights try to make extra stock for the CottageI have hung this Welcome Bunting on the outside of the Cottage for a number of years (I take it in each night)Often it blows away & sometimes I find it, drenched, stuck up in the guttering ... I lost it completely over the winter & the farmer returned this sad, faded looking bundle to me last monthI decided it was time for a fresh new one . . .Last spring I noticed I occasionally would get asked if I had them for saleso I made a couple extra & bagged them up to sellAs I was down to only one teacup birdfeeder remaining, I sat down & sorted through my cup/saucer collection & made up another batchWith their little packet of \"wild bird seed\" I am hoping these might appeal to the garden ramble peopleA couple of summers ago when The Mr spray painted my cane chairs & table for me (see here) I promised myself to make some cushions to adorn themIt was only yesterday that I actually managed to accomplish this task... using a nice cheery curtain remnant & a huge $5 bag of stuffing, both from the Hospice shop ...At long last . . .  it has only taken me 22 months !!!!!When we first moved here (17 years ago now) I uncovered this old wooden bridge under all the wandering dew in my gardenMy stepson commented on it the other day \"I remember that bridge, we used to think it had been there since the beginning of time\"It kinda looked like it had . . . So I decided to revamp it . . . ...bearing in mind I had very little time, energy or resources ... I simply pulled the old palings off, took one into my local Goldpine Store, conned the nice young man to cut me 21 lengths from some old timber \"out the back\" . . .When I got them home I dunked them in some waste oil I found in the Mr's old shed & painted the sides of the bridge with some roofing paint (again, unearthed in the Mr's shed)I then had to cover the bridge with chicken mesh for 2 entire days while the oil soaked in to prevent a certain small furry ginger being from dancing on it all day long !!!!***!!!I must walk past this bridge at least 8 times a day as its on the way out to my clothes line ... its funny how you can actually not notice something until a comment by someone causes you to stop & lookI am so thrilled with my new/old bridgeThe Mr had been playing around with my camera & snapped some photos of the kittens ... looking back through some earlier pics I had taken of Jinxy when she first appeared in our lives with her rattly chest, runny eyes & sallow look ... I loved how healthy she looks nowTimid Jinxy - taken in AprilAlert (mischievious) Jinxy - taken in OctoberThanks for staying with me through this photo heavy post dear readersI may not be back here again until after the Garden Rambledo wish me luck please . . . kinda feels like I might need it !!It was lovely to have you visit here todaytake good care as you are all very specialwith much love & friendship,Julie x0x0"},

I try to just keep plodding alongMy dear old Dad always used to say about me ...\"that girl, she sure is a plodder if nothing else\"I noticed poor old Cedric was looking rather shabby, faded, & in need of some T.L.C. last weekUsually around this time of year he requires a trip to the Op Shop for a new set of clothes & a bit of a revamp(pity it wasnt that simple for ME !!!!)He does a mighty fine job of standing out there in all conditions all year round does dear old Cedric ... so I figure its the least I can do to give him a yearly freshen up  :-)There have been a few new creations come out of the sewing room ... some orders, & some unfinished projects that finally got completedUsing up some of Dads old cotton gloves again ... this pattern was torn out of an old craft book ... there was not even a designer to acknowledgeSomehow I feel it should read \"faith, patience &  hard work makes a garden grow\" !!!!These 3 little items were made from a fat quarter of fabric that I purchased in Kaikoura when I visited my friend Carolyn way back in AprilI made the little zipper pouch first & then decided to make up a little sewing set to compliment it ... so the pincushion & needlecase \"evolved\" from the leftover scraps ...The little wooden button was a purchase from Kaikoura tooMy friend Sandy ordered some more hottie covers from me.  Sandy has a permanent caravan at the beach which she has spent the past year redecorating using gorgeous fabrics & paints. She wanted something that looked attractive on the beds, even when they weren't being used. Sandy had chosen the blankets to use, but left  all the rest up to me . . .I thoroughly enjoyed putting this order together for Sandy  :-)This was the one I left til last . . .  Sandy had chosen this particular blanket as she wanted a bit of a \"manly\" one for her sons or her husband to use.  I knew hearts or flowers would be inappropriate when I suddenly thought \"what about a vintage caravan\" ... a search on google gave me a basic image to go by . . .I think perhaps this is my favourite one . . . I lined the inside with a lovely soft polar fleece that I had in my stash.This little Op Shop basket came into my possession last week ... all it needed was a good scrub & a padded base to make a lovely work basketI am always fascinated by little Jinxy when she sleeps, she usually likes to either wind herself around little Blackie or in some way drape herself over him, she seems to like the body contact . . .  I laughed to myself yesterday when I saw how he had managed to find a way off stopping her doing this ... he is quite a weight now & this surely couldn't have been comfortable??!!They love having a little nap on my bed in the late afternoon sun. . .  & as you can see, he is still obsessed with his favourite \"dolls arm\" toy . . . (& heaven help little Jinx if she should get hold of it!!!!!)Not so much Little Blackie now . . .  but more like Big Blackie!!!Well friends, thanks so much for your visit today I am off to finish putting labels on my soap order - the house smells lovely after the postie delivered this boxfull todayAnd Yes .... I do have a little \"helper\" just to the left there on the screen !!!!Have a great rest of the week & I hope your days are filled with sunshine, tui's & lovely fragrances toowith much love & friendship,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Around The World Blog Hop", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2014", "text": "Good morning dear friends & readers   . . . & \"welcome to a bright shiny new week\"I have been invited by my friend Shane to join in this \"Around the World blog hop\"Although Shane & I have never met up in person (yet) I feel we have become good friends, albeit, blogging friends.I really enjoy Shane's blog & her photo mosaics are a special favorite of mineDo pop over to Shane's blog & say Hello won't you ... its a really lovely place to visit.Way back in March of this year, I had an Angel Giveaway & The Mr drew Shane's name out of the teapot.And then, out of the blue one day, the most delightful box of treasures arrived in the post, a surprise from Shane, read about it hereI have been asked to answer 4 questions as part of the blog hop ...(1) How does my writing/creative process work?No weeks, or even two days, are ever the same here at My Threadbear Life.  Running my rustic little craft cottage from the garden here at our rural property, can bring a diverse mix of days & encounters. I have tried to get into the habit of taking my camera with me where-ever I go, which has been the great thing about blogging, as I now photograph my work (whereas before my blog I always forgot).From helping on the farm somedays, to gardening, painting my Op Shop \"treasures\", hosting groups or just spending time in my sewing room ... I really enjoy the diversity of the days & draw my creativity from the entirely different aspects of all of these things(2) Why do I create what I do?This is an easy question . . .  I really, really love it.  Its that simple.I honestly enjoy what I do. And when I no longer feel like that about it . . . I will know its time to stop.Anyone who pursues craft related pastimes will know, if you choose to sell your work, you never, ever get your time back, so you must really have a passion for it, in order to continue to do this kind of work. I also really enjoy being at home so running a home-based business suits me perfectly.(3) How does my work differ from others of its genre?I dont really think I work in any particular genre.My craft related activities tend to jump around all over the place as I go from working on a primitive project, to some stitchery, to perhaps something a little more shabby chic, then off to dehydrate fruit or paint my thrifted vintage finds.I tend to find this \"hopscotch\" style of work suits me now. I used to really focus alot more on one particular project or work in one medium, whereas now I jump about all over the place.  I think this may feel somewhat \"unstructured\" to some people, but I also find I can end up with a variety of completed projects & be okay about enjoying the process along the way.(4) What am I working on now?Currently I am trying to complete some christmas projects as I would love to do a bigger christmas area in the Cottage come early November.(however, I think it only fair to admit ... I think this every single year & have yet to achieve it!!!)I have been making some more matchbox mice like the ones I posted about hereAnd also stitching the gorgeous Natalie Bird design \"Making Spirits Bright\" that I was given for my birthday by my friend Bevstitched using Cottage Garden Thread WaratahAnd now its my turn to introduce the 3 bloggers who have agreed to take part in continuing the \"Around the World blog hop\"I would especially like to thank them all for taking part as it can be daunting when first asked, but I have really enjoyed joining in here today.For my first participant we jump across the Tasman Sea to Australia & welcome the very talented Bev from the blog Welcome to Kainga Happenings ... Bev writes on a variety of topics from her amazing patchwork & embroidery to her cooking & gardening pursuits. I love the little verse on her header \"come, let us have some tea & talk about happy things\" . . .My second blogger today is my lovely swap friend Anne from the blog NANA GoGo - all the way across the oceans & miles to Scotland we go. Do pop in & say Hello to Anne, her blog is a very enjoyable place to visit.I especially love this little verse on Anne's sidebarAnd lastly (all the way back to New Zealand again), I would like to welcome Wendy - a lovely friend who lives in my region - from the gorgeous blog Charlotte's WebWendy & I originally met through our blogs & I thoroughly enjoy it when we get the opportunity to catch up from time to time. Wendy too, is a talented girl who does beautiful stitchery, knitting, crochet & all manner of crafty things ...Do go visit these 3 lovely girls, tell them I sent you pleaseThey will be posting next Monday 29th SeptemberThanks so much for your visit today & reading my lengthy postThanks also to Shane for inviting me to take part.Wishing you all a great week ahead filled with all that you wish for ...with love & friendship,Julie x0x0"},

I have thoroughly enjoyed this swap, I did not feel pressured (as can often happen with swaps), & loved that we both just decided to \"do our own thing\".Immediately after my last post, I had to do a brief trip down to my Mums. I usually try to catch up with my friend Claire while down at Mums, but instead I had been invited to the meeting of Claire & the \"KHS\" girls.  For those of you that follow Michelle's blog, you will know about these crafty ladies & their monthly get togethers.The meeting was at Michelles new home & was just off the very same road I was travelling on ...As soon as I parked my car at Michelle's, this was the view that greeted me ... Oh how I still miss you Mount Taranaki Egmont!!Michelle's new home was just gorgeous & decorated very much in her favourite primitive style.  Despite her protests otherwise, she is one crafty, creative girl & her home & garden are a credit to her busy life - I honestly dont know how she accomplishes all that she does.I clicked some photos but it was impossible to share all that I took ...this will just give you a little taste of her style . . . I adored the rusty saw she had hanging between dining room & loungeGorgeous handmade Raggedies everywhere I lookedeven outside was given the \"prim treatment\"The girls have a challenge each month & despite their protests that \"nooo, we haven't done anything this month\" ... these were some of their creations ... the theme this month was \"wool\"Michelle S (there are 2 Michelles) had knitted a gorgeous dishcloth, a hottie cover & a banner brooch, all in the softest blue woolsNicky was gathering together a stunning assortment of vintage trims & embellishments to make a bag - no not \"wool\" as such, but I could easily have sneaked this lot into my own bag!!And Claire had \"whipped up\" this gorgeous wheat bag in wool fabrics, & also added some lavender so it smelt divine.Michelle hadn't done the challenge this month but she did provide us with the most yummy morning tea & lunchSuch lovely, friendly, creative girls ... Michelle 1 & 2, Nicky, Claire & Nancy - thanks SO very much for a lovely visit.Oh how I WISH I lived closer!!!One of the things I always do when at Mums is take her to the Memorial Gardens at the crematorium to \"take flowers to my Dad\" as his ashes are scattered thereThe Memorial Gardens are set in a huge circle & I have always loved this giant gnarly old tree that sits right in the middle of the circlePrior to my trip to Mums I had completed some revamps (feels like I am kind of working backwards in this post) ... this cane chair was a purchase from St Vinny's quite sometime ago & on my neverending \"to do list\"A good scrub, then a spray paint gave it a fresh new lease of life, but I wanted to bring some colour to it somehow.  I decided to make a squab & a roundie cushion using some of my vintage sheets as I felt it had a real vintagey style to itI was really pleased with how it turned out & hope someone falls in love with it in the Cottage - I think it would make a very lovely bedroom chair.This wooden base lamp was in amongst a box of \"junk\" my friend was taking to the Op Shop.  I - of course - promptly fished it out !!I carefully cleaned the shade which was rather dusty, waxed & painted the base, & then embellished it with some crochet doilies & my usual pompom trim (dunked in parisian essence)While down at Mums I completed this simple \"Make a Wish\" stitchery, which is a free download from hereI stitched it using a gorgeous Cottage Garden thread \"Blue Wren\"I originally planned to make it up into a cushion but instead rather liked the idea of popping it in this Op Shop wooden embroidery hoopI quite liked the \"unfussiness\" of it just as a simple hanger.Thank you all so much for your good wishes for Little Jinxy in my last post ... as you can see she is still continuing to lead a rather stressful life here at Threadbear ...Happy to show off her wound site .... Yes Jinxy WE KNOW you have had stitches!!!... along with little Blackie who remains quite traumatised by life in general ...Thank you all SO much for staying with me through this rather lengthy postI hope you have a great week ahead filled with only good things . . .. . . & that it is NOT a week with any days like Little Jinxy has had ! ! !with much love & friendship to you allJulie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Signs of Spring", "date": "Wednesday, September 3, 2014", "text": "A glorious Spring \"Good Afternoon\" to you all dear friends & readersA couple of days ago, after I turned the calendar over to 1st September, I treated myself to a cheery $2.00 bunch of daffys at my local Supermarket ...On Special for $2.00 this week at Pak-Save... & then a $2.00 lace tablecloth at the Animal Care Op Shop on my way homeWhat better way to welcome spring to my dining room I thought!!!In amongst the busy-ness of family visiting & stepsons returning home, I had my first group . . .  ... was I ready I hear you asking ???not on your nellie . . . well let me put it this way ... Thank Goodness it wasn't a Garden Group !!!!Although I have noticed there are signs of spring popping up all around my garden now ...The magnolia is about to burst into bloom & I noticed this cute little bluey/purple ground cover was flowering away in my rockeryQuite some months ago (way back in late May in fact) my dear friend Catherine very kindly sent me some seeds from her garden - I love to share seeds with other gardeners myself, & had requested some of the perennial Honeywort (Cerinthe Major) from her, as I was unable to find it anywhereThere is another large pot of honeywort not included in the picture, already been planted in the gardenI used my moon calendar to advise me on planting times & am really happy with my strike rate ... I have several pots of honeywort, some blue woodruff & the other plant I cannot remember the name of (as a bird flew off with my label!!!!!) Thanks so much dear Catherine ... now I will have you waving at me from my garden   :-)Also, way back in early July I took part in a swap organised by Betty\"From my Home to Yours Swap\"Betty partnered me with Anne from the blog Nana GoGoAnne & I corresponded & both agreed to just send something relevant to where we live ... after finding a gorgeous kiwiana fabric I decided I wanted to dress an angel doll for AnneI used a Rosalie Quinlan pattern \"Friendship Angel\"This was the package I put together - which took exactly a week to fly all the way across to Scotland - I included a New Zealand teatowel, some notecards & a cake of the handmade soap my friend Pauline makes from her range Infused with NatureI decided to adorn the angel with a small earing I had in my stash, a delicate paua kiwi ... goodness knows where its \"partner\" ever went to but it was one of those things I knew I would find a use for one dayIt was lovely to get an email from Anne to tell me she was thrilled with her package & just adored her angel.Recently The Mr sent me off to The Warehouse with his wallet to buy some toys for the kittens (if you please!!!!)This was the variety I came home with, mice filled with catnip etc ... really quite an unexciting selection truth be told.  The oddest thing is that little Blackie would not have a bar of any of them, but his most favourite toy ever, is pictured just to the right which is actually a calico dolls arm, stolen off my ironing board.He spends many happy hours tossing it around & if you look real closely at this next pic, you can see he sleeps with it tucked just under him, so Jinxy can't run off with itBless their little souls   :-)There has been very little creativity going on here of late in the Threadbear household.   I did manage to complete some handtowels yesterday afternoon - I had been wondering how to use up these white waffle fabric teatowels I had bought, & quite liked them embellished with some golly fabrics & trimsThe Matryoshka doll fabric on the right is a favourite of mine.I hope to be back in a few days with some completed revamps to show you  :-)In the meantime I am off to the Vets to collect dear little Jinxy, who had her surgery today (finally after a failed first attempt), so as you can imagine, I am like a \"cat on a hot tin roof\" today, not settling to very much at all.dear wee Jinxy - growing up slowly & still as nutty as everThanks to you all so much for stopping by today & visiting,I hope you are having a lovely afternoon where-ever in the world you might be & whatever season you are celebratingwith much love & friendship,Julie x0x0"},

(slapped on while the rascals were sleeping)Then I added some embellishments ... my favourite part  :-)As someone had engraved quite deeply the initials \"J C\" in one end, I mod podged some doilies over each end ...I padded the base by covering a piece of corrugated cardboard with  thick wadding & then covering this with some vintage floral fabricI was really happy with the end result ...I am actually finding it quite difficult to spend time in my sewing room of late ... the 4 legged rascals appear to have claimed it as their ownWhen Little Blackie is not asleep on the ironing board, he is underneath it !!!Little Jinxy spends a great deal of time up here ... cos if you look real closely in the distance of my photo, you will see the neighbours goat grazing the road verge ... most fascinating indeed!!!We decided little Blackie was now big enough to go into the Vets for a \"little operation\" as he was becoming quite an aggressive tom cat.  However, getting him in the cage was another story altogether ... we had been trying for over 2 weeks & in the end I borrowed my friend Jan's bigger cage. I finally succeeded this week but OH the pandemonium when I shut the door!!!  After I had secured it, while waiting for The Mr to come & collect him, I snapped these photos of Jinxy \"assisting him to escape\" . . .Warning ... these photos may be disturbing to some folk!!!Honestly friends, it is such absolute chaos around here somedays ... I just have to try to make light of it & laugh or I fear I shall go quietly insane!!!I must add that little Blackie has returned & is none the worse for his \"little surgery\" & now allows me to pat him & even purred this morning for the first time ever (yes I know ... such is my life!!!!)Thanks so much for popping by today - I shall be back soon with some more creativity - fingers crossed!!!A wee rest, thats what we all need,with much love & friendship to you all,Julie, Jinxy & Blackie x0x0x"},

Thanks Carolyn  :-)Sandys lovely daughter Abby commissioned me to make her a hottie cover for her partner who is training to be an aeronautical engineer . . .  Abby suggested perhaps a plane appliqued on it ??I had enough left of this gorgeous tartan blanket & I appliqued the plane with some red wool blanketing I lined it with a red spot flannelette for warmth  I initially hand-embroidered Tim's name on, but it was hardly visible so I unpicked it & appliqued it in some denim blue wool feltAbby collected it today & was delighted with it . . . I sure hope Tim is too !!!!As I had sold 2 hottie covers recently, I decided to make up another two - I figured they are not something I will sell many of in the summer months !!!After stitching this gorgeous wool felt angel pincushion back in MayI came across 2 more Anni Downs pincushion patterns in my drawer ... so decided to make them up using up some of my wool felt remnants . . . Gilroy Goose & Larry Lamb ... filled with my finely crushed walnut shells From time to time I receive emails asking me whether I sell the craft work that I feature on my blog ... my apologies if my blog appears vague. Yes the stock I make is for the Cottage (unless I have made it for a gift). However should you wish to buy something from my blog (as some have done in the past) I am more than happy to package it up & post it to you ... simply email me for a price ... \"stitchedbyjulie@hotmail.com\"I am looking into adding a selling page to my blog in which I can offer some work for sale over the winter months when my Cottage goes rather dead quiet  :-)(also I am happy to make to order should you see something you would like made in a particular colourway)Just 1 kitten photo to share this week folks ... I had purchased a \"cat carrier\" as I figured perhaps I was going to need one for vet trips etc ... I must be honest here & confess our last cat never went on a trip to the vets, if she ever got unwell she got a jab of penicillin down at the cowshed ... yes I can hear you all gasping now but she lived a long & healthy life til she was 17 years old.Anyway The Mr instructed me to \"just leave the cat carrier outside so they can get familiar with it\" . . .Considering Sickie looked at me initially like \"if you think I am ever going in that thing you can jolly well think again!!!\" ... I just had to snap this pic on my way to bed last night . . .Wishing you all a wonderful weekend out there folks & I hope you find some creative time for yourselves as I plan toThanks so very much for stopping by today for a visitmuch love & friendship,Julie x0x0x"},

Sue is a real Op Shop Queen & I was so pleased to be able to make her gift from thrifted items I added in one of my friends lovely Infused With Nature soaps (which I stock in the Cottage) plus a notepad & some thrifted magazinesYou can read Sue's post about it here ... she was most delighted with her gift & has used the bag already  :-)(Also a big thanks to Sue for putting her hand up to take part in the P.I.F. exchange)While on the subject of lovely gifts ... I received this most amazing package in the post this week from dear ShaneEarlier this year Shane won my Angel Giveaway - you can read about this here & also in Shane's post hereShane had been gathering together vintage doilies, trims & fabrics that she no longer had any use for & making up a box to send to me ... opening it was just like opening a treasure trove ... everytime I look at it all I still find something new to see & enjoy   :-)I almost needed a wide angled lens to photograph it all spread out on my bedThank You SO VERY MUCH dear Shane for your kind & thoughtful gesture which quite simply made my week  Also last week I made some more apples ... I sell these in my Cottage & was down to just one lonely little apple sitting in the dish . . .. . . so I made another six to keep it company . . .These are just made from scraps of fabric but I add a piece of cinnamon stick which I scent with cinnamon/clove oil ... lean in real close & take a big sniff   !!!!When Leeanne came to stay the other weekend we sat & made some string jars ... we just used old Agee Jars & \"primified\" (not sure if thats a word actually Julie!!!) them up a bit. . . this was my jar I made with Leeanne . . . So after buying another 4 jars on trademe I sat & made some more yesterday - while it poured with rainThey were such an enjoyable & fun thing to make & a pleasant change from sewing  :-)The Kitten Diaries part 2 :-(yes you may close your browser now if you so wish !!!)We lost a kitten this week - little whitey (yes the one with lots of white on it in case you wondered!!!) met an untimely death down at the depot yard - Little Whitey was a beautiful looking kitten & loved the string gamethe driver who accidently run her over (yes, she was a she) has offered to take little squawker (yes the one that squawks alot!!!) when I can quieten him/her a little more... here we all are wearing our funeral faces for a day...thats little squawker sitting in the mangleLittle sickie was none too traumatised & fancied herself some schooling this weekOn my best behaviour & ready & waiting for the teacher !!!!????They have discovered the Mr's fishing net & it makes a great playing & hiding spot  Also on top of Nero's kennel is an old cane bike basket that is a great favouriteHopefully by my next post, we shall be down to just two kittens & little squawker will have gone to its new home (Oh & not been returned either!!!)Thanks so much for stopping by today - have a wonderful weekend everyone,with much love & friendship,Julie x0x"},
{"title": "The blink of an eye . . . ", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2014", "text": "Good afternoon dear friends & readers,The past couple of weeks has passed by in the blink of an eye ...Last weekend I had the unexpected pleasure of a visit from a  friend I originally met through my blog  -my dear friend Leeanne from quiltmekiwi came down to the Waikato for a couple of nights.\"Lets go Op Shopping\" was her only request ... I was more than happy to oblige   :-)The left hand pic is my car boot after our day of hitting the Op Shops & the right hand pic is (some of) my stash spread out on my bedThis was the end of my lounge as I hung all my Op Shop treasures on the clothes horse to dry after soaking & washing them ... I love this sight  :-)(It was so lovely to spend time with Leeanne, & even though The Mr & I tried really, really hard ... we were unable to sneak a kitten into her car before she went home again!!!)After Leeanne's visit the rains came & have stayed around for the rest of the week, so I have been spending some time in my sewing room.Last winter I took part in The Hottie Project & was really pleased when I got Lisa's email inviting me again this winter as I think it is a fantastic projectThese were the four I managed to stitch up & post off to Lisa ... I tried to make a selection that was suitable for both boys & girls, & especially loved the v-dub beetle fabric which I teamed with the orange retro blanket.My baby cuddly blankets in the Cottage were looking a little depleted, so I ran up some more fleece cuddlies from this gorgeous polar fleece I had purchased while down at Mums in April.Several months ago I bought these plain glass jars in the \"sale bin\" at my local Supermarket & popped them aside with a project in mind I had an idea floating around in the wilderness that is in my head to make up some herbal bath sachets ...I made up a combination of rose petals, lavender, oatmeal, a few herbs & some epsom salts ... then I realised the plastic stopper actually comes out of the lid, so I filled some with dried lavender & some with rose petals (& yes, I did have to \"test run\" one under the tap in my bath that very night)I was especially pleased with these beautiful sheets of \"Vintage Adverts\" that I was able to get from Paperzone & use as labels for the jars This little doll belongs to my sister-in-law & was bought back for her from Vanuatu She was dressed in a ghastly plasticy dress which we removed - my sis-in-law asked me to dress her in a simple white dress with a touch of black & turquoise (the colours of her newly decorated bedroom)She was so difficult to fit any clothes on that I ended up actually removing her head from her body!!!!The little box sitting beside her was to give me the exact shade for the turquoise - I hope to come across a small turquoise flower to pop in her hand when I am next in town.Warning  :  Kitten photos !!!!!The Kitten Diaries:-(for those of you that wish you may close your browser now)We have discovered that Mums potted grasses in the terracotta boots makes the most wonderful soft little \"nest\" to sit in & bounce a bit ...We are eating lots & growing fast - we prefer to be outside but sometimes at night we will venture inside for one of your stupid games that you play with us involving string & paper ...The smallest of us (little sickie) prefers Mums fabric wrapped balls to chase but sometimes you need a little nap part way through this gameWe have stopped hissing & spitting at you but we really prefer not to be patted - thanks very muchWe often go walkabout for a day or two & sometimes we wonder why you come out in the most appalling weather conditions to look for us . . . (we figure you must be quite insane) ... calling us in that stupid voice you use ...Our adoptive Mother .... & no, she is not weeding the garden ...Thanks so very much for your visit today folks - I have an appointment with my sewing machine this rainy afternoonWishing you a wonderful rest-of-the-weekmuch love & friendship to you all    :-)Julie 0x0x"},
{"title": "headless chooks, creativity, seeds & kittens !!!", "date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2014", "text": "Good afternoon dear friends & readersThe phone conversation last week, went something like this . . . \"yes of course Joss, you would be most welcome to bring your garden group ... when would you like to come??\" . . .  inside my head a little voice was saying over & over repeatedly . . . \"please say next spring, please say next spring!!!\"Joss's reply came back ... \"Oh Monday week would suit us\"Good Grief!!!a quick glance outside ... Oh yes, the garden really does look perfectly disgusting!!!and so the rest of the week I ran around like a headless chook trying to get myself organised for the group . . .and - of course - the gardening ladies were just lovely, plus because it was such an icy cold day & I had the heater on full, they spent most of their time inside the Cottage & barely looked at the rather messy garden :-)(note to self .... never have garden groups in future after April)Prior to their arrival I knew I was completely out of golly teatowels so one rainy afternoon I appliqued another five -plus I noticed the doiley pincushions were down to one lonely soul left, so I ran some more of these up using some of my doiley stashAlso on the creative front ... I remembered that Nola had ordered a teacup teddy quite some time ago\"a plain bear but with touches of red\" ... were her instructions (I seemed to recall she had a red china cup to sit it in)This little treasure was fashioned from some mohair scraps . . . . . .  and I got to \"practise\" with my own red dotty cup  :-) One of my purchases while down at Carolyn's was this gorgeous wool felt pincushion pattern - a design from Anni Downs of  Hatched and PatchedI already had the wool felt colours so once I had cut it all out,  it was just so enjoyable to sit & hand stitch a little each night beside the fireAfter shelling a large batch of walnuts I tried crushing the shells in my ( very ancient) blender, as the pattern required crushed walnut shells for stuffingI was SO pleased with my \"Alice Angel Pincushion\" & now I think I would like to make another one, fill it with dried lavender, add a little string from the top & hang it on a doorknob  . . . Last week (while running around like a headless chook) I received a lovely package in the mailCatherine & I originally met through our blogs - although we have met up once - due to geographical reasons (living on opposite sides of the island), we are more blogging friends & exchange emails & comments via our blogs Catherine had promised me some seeds last year & she sent me the most wonderful parcel including the seeds & along with a book to read that she had blogged about here Catherine wrote in her message that \"perhaps Friendship Bread might need to become a Pay It Forward book\" ... & so I thought about the idea of reading it & then sending it on along with some seeds from my garden ... to someone else who might like to do the same . . . ??? what do you think ???If you would like to receive the book when I have read it (+ seeds) then do let me know & I will send it on Perhaps we should just keep this within New Zealand due to all the strict rules & regulations for posting seeds overseas ???Thanks SO much to Catherine for her generosity - the parcel simply made my whole week!!!... and the kittens ...The kittens are settling in well even though their mother takes them away frequentlythis greeted me the other day when I had left the door slightly ajar - even Bob had ventured insideAnd even though The Mr tells me every single day(at least twice!!!)we are NOT keeping those kittens ... I did notice that it was indeed him who had named two of themthis one he has named \"little sickie\" (yes I know!!!)\"Little sickie\" likes the heater in the mornings & the fire in the evenings thanks very much ...  \"Oh & if you could keep putting the wood on without disturbing me too much, that would be great too!!)this one is called \"little socksie\" due to his white sock feet.Little Socksie is veery cute & also veery naughty - I just wish he would stop practising his star jumps into my potted flowers each evening!!! (Oh & now I see he is teaching the others how to as well!!!)as you can see, they are all growing like little mushrooms . . .Hurry up with the food in there can you . . .Okay. . . no more kitten photos I promise :-)It feels like we are in for a doozy of a frost tonight so best go fill the wood basket - thanks so very much for stopping by today - your visits are always appreciatedwith much love & friendship to you allJulie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Hotties, Baskets & the \"Bob Saga\" . . . ", "date": "Sunday, May 18, 2014", "text": "Hello there dear friends & readers,Whilst reaching for a basket way up high in a cupboard last week, a small \"avalanche\" landed on my head . . . ... the \"avalanche\" consisted of 4 hot water bottles, the remains of some I had purchased last winter on sale.I decided to make some hot water bottle covers as it was definately feeling like hottie weather !!!I decided to use some more of the wool blankets I had cut into for the girls pinafores in my last postLast time I made these up I didn't line the insides & I blanket stitched right around the top edges . . . However, this time I decided to line the whole inside & found that as well as it being much thicker & cosier, it was alot quicker to put togetherMy favourite was the blue checked blanket one with the Paris ribbon & the floral lining ... but The Mr much preferred the Kiwi one A lovely customer who often pops out to my Cottage is the Co-Owner of a popular local Bar & Eatery The RedoubtShe called in a couple of weeks ago & asked me if I would like the job of planting up all their hanging baskets that have become a bit of a \"feature\" as they are on a busy corner site in our town.It was one of those situations where I opened my mouth to say \"Thanks, but No, sorry\"...... & the next thing I knew ... I was standing in Mitre 10 Garden Centre choosing the plants for them !!!!!!!I decided on a combination of pansies, violas & lobelia, & planted up a mixture of pastels & then some brighter ones. I really enjoy planting usually, but when it is a commissioned job I always worry that they will grow/flower/look okay... Her husband said to me that these baskets have become a real \"talking point\" around town now ... lets hope the talk is how great they look & not \"who on earth planted up those manky looking baskets for you??!!!\". . . These fine autumn days are spent outdoors raking up the endless supply of leaves & putting down a thick layer on the gardens ... I always like to think I am \"putting them to bed\" for the winter monthsI thought the Nerines in my old wheelbarrow were a bit confused about the seasons but a customer informed me that No, they were in fact, autumn flowering bulbs  :-)When I helped my friend shift shops some 18 months ago now, this was one of 3 antique Chandeliers that used to hang in the old shop premises ... they were promptly snapped up for purchase, but the lady that had earmarked this one never actually turned up to buy it ... (& so I was offered it for purchase)This week it finally got hung up in my freshly painted bedroom ... I am so delighted with itIt had about an inch of thick dust sitting on it & after a gentle clean, it just transformed it completely :-)This old piano stool was sitting in the sleep-out under a myriad of boxes - I hauled it inside as I needed a small bedside table.  I had originally planned to wax & paint it but The Mr wasn't at all happy as the Oak was in such good tidy condition.In the end I just gave it a good oil & polish & decided to recover the top using an old embroidered table cloth which was very thin so I lined the inside of it firstSlooowwwly my room is coming together, but that light fitting just brings me SO much pleasure  :-)And the ongoing saga of Bob the cat . . . I noticed a couple of months ago that Bob's mother had returned - the reason I knew she was his mother was because I remember when Bob & his sibling used to play in & around the Cottage. Read my post about them hereThe Mr informed me that Bobs mother looked pregnant again!! Just prior to my visit to my Mums she gave birth to 4 tiny kittens in my front garden.  By the time I returned from my trip to Carolyns, the kittens had grown & ventured further afield.Can you imagine my surprise when last week they took up residence in my old dogs bed - which I had never actually put away or disposed of.  I always used to tell myself I had left it out in case any passing (animal) souls needed shelter for the night.Good grief . . .  I thought I was seeing things !!!Early days . . .  just peeping out at memore relaxed now several days (& several feeds) laterI am not sure what my old Mr fat fluffy would think of 4 kittens taking up residence in his bed !!!Now one other teeny tiny point to note . . .  I have watched Bob looking after these 4 kittens (his half siblings) & by the way he licks them & cares for them (when the Mother is off hunting) & fusses over them ... I must confess I am ever-so-slightly concerned that Bob might in actual fact, be a Bobbi !!!Thank You So Much for staying with me through this lengthy post friendsWishing you all a wonderful weekend wherever in the world you might beBeautiful Mothers Day Hyacinth that fragrances the whole housewith much love & friendship,Julie ... (& Bob & Co ...) x0x0x0x"},

I was very excited to see this parcel sitting on my dining tableWendy had hand-made me the most gorgeous bag using thrifted & gifted vintage fabrics PLUS she had added in a wonderful little collection of doilies, buttons, trims & a new magazine that I hadn't come across before but it made my heart skip several beats !!!!The bag is just stunning ...

Mum had quite an overload of courgettes this year so we made a batch of bread & butter pickles one wet dayThese 3 traditional gollies came home with me . . . This is some of what my Mum knits for my cottage - at 85 years of age she is still knitting away - a little slower now, but still beautiful handiworkMum stuffs them all & sews on the buttons & I do their faces & ribbons ... her work is an inspiration to meNo trip to Mums would be complete without a visit with my dear friend Claire - this time it was a quick cuppa on my way home - but I did remember my camera :-)Although Claires lovely home has been much photographed & posted about on my blog here (& Michelles blog also) I continually find sources of inspiration from ClaireThe swag above was a new touch in her country bedroom - she had affixed it along a painted beam ... it was just beautiful & so perfect for the roomcurtains = op shop lace tableclothsI wander around with my camera while Claire makes a cuppa - she is used to me by now clicking away (gosh, just as well!!!)This was an old dark wooden corner unit from the Op Shop which received one of Claires amazing make-oversI was inspired by the \"mirror wall\" in her bedroom as I am trying to think of ways to lighten our bedroom as we redecorate it more gorgeous Op Shop needlework pictures . . . . . .  & fascinating tabletop displays I commented to Claire I didn't think I had ever seen her table so \"bare\" ... this was quite minimalist for Claire ... just a touch of pastel Easter decorating - stunning!!The last 3 pics are her entry porch where she always has beautiful displays which change & evolve with the different seasons - I am always in awe of Claires amazing ability to put things together so effortlesslyMy friend Lois popped in a few days ago with a treasured cup & saucer that had been her late MumsLois had poured tea into it & it had leaked from a fine hairline crack around the base Lois asked if I could \"do anything with it for her\"I decided a pincushion would be the solution as it was still in such good condition apart from the crackIt turned out lovely & dainty ..... Lois was thrilled with it   :-)I wanted to share with you (some of) my Op Shop finds from my trip down to MumsAlthough I usually prefer the plainer vintage linens, for some reason I found myself drawn to the more coloured doilies this tripAlthough the Mexican Men arent really my \"thing\", I just loved & appreciated all the detailed handwork in themThis little number from the Hospice Shop felt like I had hit the \"doiley jackpot\"  - it is a tray cloth & the cup on the bottom right has a little pocket to tuck a serviette intoThe little crochet lace edge is the pocket(I think it only fair to add however, they were most definately not in this condition when I purchased them & have since had a long soak & a wash & iron)Lovely Op Shop tablecloth, hydrangeas (from garden), tin bird (from Claire) & berry candle (from Mum)(And flowers sitting in $2 glass Op Shop Jug)Thank you all for your very kind comments last post on the anniversary of my beloved dog NeroAfter Nero passed away, I confess I dreamed for a good many months about a lovely fluffy little cat curled up on my lap or sitting at my feet while stitching ... a female cat quite possibly named Pearl ??? ... or Poppy perhaps . . .  ???Instead . . . it appears . . .  this is what I have \"inherited\"A feral ginger tom (whom I have named Bob) who sits here on the top step each morning (& evening) waiting for me to feed him on the lawn - we have a gap with a board missing under our deck & he sits here looking out & watching meI cannot get close as yet but I have managed to get him to stop hissing & spitting at me ... plus he now eats off a plate instead of on the lawnNot quite what I imagined in my dream ... but I shall persevere with Bob - lets just say its lucky he's cute cos he is quite naughty !!!!Thanks so very much for your visits todayI hope your Easter is a happy & safe one for you allwith much love & friendship,Julie x0x0x   (& Bob)xx"},

I am 3/4 of the way through painting our bedroom (& at that stage of wondering why on earth I ever began!!)Somewhere in amongst it all ... is a bed we sleep in each night !!!!!The smaller projects are much more enjoyable (& fun) ... these 3 little items found their way home with me from the Salvation Army Bargain BinA wooden bowl, letter rack & a cane basket in sad repairAfter a clean, a wax & 2 coats of (bedroom wall) paint ... I felt they looked much improvedI padded the base of the little basket & lined it with a lovely floral fabric & some vintage gathered laceThe little letter-rack came up rather well I thought ...I used some of my \"rub-ons\" & some wooden filigree embellishmentsThese old smaller-size baking tins & coffee mug trees were lying in the back of the cupboard - another Op Shop find from awhile agoI cut the coffee mug trees down a little, then drilled holes to attach my cake tins to the centre poles - a light sand, a wax & a coat of Persian Red (Resene Testpot) paint to each standWith the \"ring-tin\" I decided to line the inside (outer) base circle... so I cut a pattern using some baking paper & then transferred this to a piece of cardboard to which I glued some wadding ... then covered with a piece of wool felt & glued inside the ringI then added a wee circle of checked wool felt which I filled with wadding, gathered, fashioned into a pincushion & glued insideA few vintage sewing accessories, a tag & rusty bell  ... viola ...The 2nd baking tin I simply drew a large circle of wool felt (pattern = dinner plate) then blanket stitched a felt flower onto it & padded it up into a larger size pincushionA large size pin keep  :-)Circle glued inside base of baking tin ...(incidently, my wool felt I am using - which is normally rather expensive - are old mens blazers from the Op Shop)(apologies for the photo overload this post). . . And Remembering . . . I just wanted to mention that on Sunday it was one year since we lost Nero - our beautiful german shepherd dog - I still think of you every  single day Mr Fat Fluffy & remember with such fond thoughts & memories the immense joy you bought into our livesyou can read my post about him hereI look forward to us meeting up again one day over the rainbow bridge Have a lovely rest of the week dear friends & readers,I am off to Mums for a week - yes it's that time of year again - she will be celebrating turning 85  :-)Thank You So Much for your visitswith love & friendship to you all,Julie x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "Harvesting . . .  & plodding . . .", "date": "Wednesday, March 26, 2014", "text": "Good afternoon dear friends & readers,This past week has been a time of some plodding ... all mixed in with a little late summer harvesting ...When The Mr & I built our 2nd raised vege garden back in November of last year (see here) ... we filled it with soil from our burning heap. I noticed a couple of pumpkin plants had popped up in it so I just left them to do their \"thing\" & wanderAs you can see above, those pumpkins actually turned out to be ornamental gourds - obviously self seeded from the odd ones that get thrown on the burning heap (by myself) from time to timeI was so pleased that there were a few different varieties & not just all the same plain yellow ones ... there were some very small sized ones I was planning to throw out ... but then decided to pop them in my kitchen scales - a little splash of colour on my benchtopI do so enjoy the colours, shapes & patterns of gourds  :-)As autumn kicks in here now, I like to pull the last of the vege garden to bits to re-fertilise & plant it out for the winter.However, I managed to harvest this last colourful assortment just yesterday morningcucumbers, tomatoes, red peppers, passionfruit, & 1 lonely courgettethough our tomatoes this year have been small in size, they are still very tasty & sweetBefore I mowed the other evening, I gathered this basketfull of walnuts off the lawn - though listening to the wind that is howling around us today, I imagine there will be just as many on the lawn again by nowI have been shifting stock & feeding pets for my friend Lois this past week - she lives a few kilometres up the road from me - I have had a constant companion by my side while carrying out these enjoyable tasks - a gorgeous chocolate labrador named CocoNow doesn't she just look like she fell into the tin of cocoa???!!!(p.s. YES I was tempted - definately - to put Coco in my car & bring her home with me!!!)A few years ago my youngest son Kayne undertook a building apprenticeship - Kayne played a significant role in the building of my little Cottage & also built the one for Colleen that I posted about back here.Kayne would frequently find himself unemployed \"in between jobs\" ... & on one occasion Lois commissioned him to build her a \"garden room\"  ... I always loved where Lois situated it & captured a snap of it while feeding her animals this weekAlthough it is not many years old, I love the timeworn, weathered patina it has taken on ... ... as if it has sat there for a good many years ...My friend Bronwyn had asked me to make her a teacup teddy to take to Australia as a gift ... she was undecided on a colour so I decided to make 2 & let her choose,  then keep the other as stock for the CottageThese tiny little \"pieces of fluff\" which end up pretty much fitting in the palm of your hand sure  do take some fiddling with to put together The first one was a gorgeous pink tipped fine mohair fur - she has ended up as Little Miss Rosebud (thankfully they don't take a great deal of fur to make so you can use up your smaller offcuts)The second one is Miss Goldilocks & she was made using a lovely golden mohair fur with a slight curl to it. (The teacups pictured are mine - Bronwyn has her own to use) I wonder which one Bronwyn will choose - Miss Pinky or Miss Goldy ...(these teddies are constructed using one piece for the body, arms & legs & then a pieced head, plus ears) This pattern (again) is torn from a very old Bear Magazine & is titled Teacup Teddy by Joan Woessner.You can read another post about my teacup teddies hereAlso - whilst \"plodding\" this past week - I managed to complete these rusty tin swags made using rusty punched-tin hearts, a star & a birdhouseThey are just made using torn strips of fabrics which I iron & fray neatly (I Know, I Know!!!) & then tie in co-ordinating colourwaysI have made these before for the Cottage & they have proved to be rather popular.Well dear friends - I am off to sit down with a cuppa & a new purchase - many thanks to Betty for letting me know about this new book - a sequel to the one I posted about back here.Before I close I just wanted to say a huge Thank You to you all some of you have, on the odd occasion, dropped me an email telling me how much you enjoy reading my blog & stopping by my little corner of the world This has meant so very much to me - it truely lifts my heart & gladdens my soul to know you enjoy my ramblingsSometimes just a little kindness (a comment or a word) can mean so very much to a personI snapped this photo walking into my lounge yesterday afternoon - I loved how the late afternoon sun was making rainbows on the wallsMay you all have a rainbow filled week dear friends & readersThanks so much for your visitsmuch love & friendship & kindness to you all,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Lizzie", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,This post is written especially for my good friend LeeanneSeveral months ago Leeanne asked me \"could you do a post about that doll thats up the top on your header\"That doll is called Lizzie . . . & she is a pattern by Chris Rook of \"Raggedy-ole-britches\"My tatty copy has been torn out of an old Homespun magazine & (until now) I had only ever made the oneHello there . . .  I'm LizzieMy Lizzie sits on my dining room couch & watches the world go by, observing all the comings & goings of my rather odd threadbear lifeWhen Leeanne asked me, I had already begun another body so this weekend - with cyclone Lusi whirling her way around us - I sat down & began to complete Lizzie No 2.The photo above shows the before & after of the hands & feet which require some needle sculpting ... as I tend to stuff my dolls rather tightly, this was often a tiny bit tricky but we got there in the end.  Without sculpting, her feet would be quite misshapen I feel.Now wouldn't you just adore a figure like this ???!!!The above pic is the completed doll body - yes I know - rather odd looking isnt she ... but I am quite partial to these \"hammer head style\" dolls, especially the primitive ones(I notice the pattern says to sew all the body pieces first & then dunk in parisian essence but I personally find it much easier to dye a large piece of calico first, dry it, then begin my body)Dressing her is the fun part ... her dress is simple enough & she has pantaloons also  I just love the finished Lizzie ... I decided to embellish my \"No 2 version\" with some torn fabric ribbons in her hairIts interesting to notice the fading of the calico body & cardy  in Lizzie 1 - although our diningroom is dark, it just shows how much the light can fade thingsThe pattern just used 3 single strands of wool for hair stiffened with PVA glue ... I preferred to add a bit more hair, but this is a personal choiceAlthough the pattern calls for an Op Shop baby cardigan (to be parisian essence dyed), she is equally as lovely without the cardyHer eyes are black domes (or snaps/poppers as some countries call them)The pattern also shows how to make her some primitive cakes with painted icing on but my Lizzie is quite content to just sit around observing, so I didnt make up the cakes.Because I seem to have made rather a few Raggedies lately, I decided to do a small Raggedy Anne display in the Cottage to group them all togetherI thought they could just enjoy each others company & share stories a littleSometimes when I am in bed at night, I wonder to myself ... do they ever get up & move around & then get back into their rightful places by morning . . .  hmmm ... no wonder the Mr thinks I am \"losing the plot somewhat\" at times ...I just love my Raggedies So VeRy MuCh  :-)While Cyclone Lusi blew great gusts & gales around us all weekend (& unfortunately, did not rain a great deal) it was definately indoors weather but great for crafting & finishing some long overdue projectsThis was a panel I had planned to make up into a table runner for my Mum - originally for a christmas gift but it ended up back in the \"to finish basket\" ... her birthday is next month so I had another go at completing it ...(The panel was called A Stitchers Garden by Moda)I am still undecided whether to attach the black bobbles to the ends of the runner or leave as it is ... what do you think readers - bobbles or left as it is  ??Looking at my photos, I would like to stitch through the centre borders in red to make them sit a little better ... also a note to self... \"give table runner a good iron!!!\"Another completion was this very old stitchery pulled out of the pile - it is a Country Friends design,  stitched on linen very many years ago (in fact, I think it was approx 8-9 years ago now!!)I tossed up a few ideas but in the end, decided to cut out a blue wool felt border with my scallop scissors & then attach it to some blue ticking (from the Op Shop) & make into a cushion ... the linen on the stitchery is faintly tea-dyed but you can hardly tell.Today the wind has died down, the sun is shining & it was lovely to sit & have lunch on the deck, to read a gorgeous magazine & drool over some new projectsThe hanging baskets can be hung back up again now - they are little wind battered but survived none the less And I am sure . . . from Pinterest . . . that lurking in the back of the cupboard somewhere ... there are some more PHD's to be completed.Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends & readersMay you keep safe from any \"storms\" out there - thanks so much for your visitsAnd Leeanne - perhaps you will be inspired now to make your own little Lizzie dollmuch love & friendship to all of you,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Potpourri ... stitching ... turkeys & trikes !!!!", "date": "Wednesday, March 12, 2014", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,My friend Kerryn who owns the beautiful patchwork store The Country Yard have just last weekend celebrated their annual \"New Years Launch\". This coincided with their being in business for 10 years so was a double celebration.Some of you may have read about this on Leeannes or Raewyns blogs as these girls are lucky enough to work at this wonderful store.I however, was lucky enough to be asked to provide bags of my potpourri for the goodie bags that were given out to some loyal customers ... 35 bags (I think) in total  :-)I was honestly so chuffed that Kerryn decided to include a bag in the very generous goodie bags she was making up as I just adore making potpourri & am quite sure, even if I didnt have my little Cottage that I would still make these recipes as it has become a \"little bit of who I am\" over the years ...Lean in real close & take a big sniff   :-)Warmest Congratulations to Kerryn & her amazing team of girls - I would certainly have loved to have been part of these celebrations but (unfortunately) a family wedding prevented this.Speaking of potpourri . . .  my friend Elaine is celebrating her birthday tomorrow - we usually exchange small handmade gifts as she is a crafter herself.Last month I purchased from Michelle the pattern for her gorgeous Stitcher\"s Alphabet.  I had seen these initials pop up in quite a few blogs & had long coveted this pattern ... as it turned out some family members were coming over from Melbourne & could hand deliver it to me   :-)Elaines \"E\" was my first attempt(I stitched this using a Cottage Garden Thread - \"Kangaroo Paw\")I realised I had forgotten to tea dye the calico before stitching, so a quick blast with my parisian essence mixture (that I mentioned last post) & I then hand stitched it onto a piece of red cotton fabric ...... that I had begun to make into a \"sort of pouch\"  . . .  this was one of those creations that just \"evolved\" as it went along ...... & ended up as a lined bag with a box bottom . . .  I had planned to fill it with little chocolate treats but then remembered that Elaine is quite gluten intolerant . . .  so my fresh batch of rose petal potpourri beckoned . . . I hope Elaine likes it ... (although she is a follower, I know she is not reading this because her computer has recently crashed)Happy Birthday for tomorrow Elaine  ! ! !Last post I mentioned I had been working on another \"roundie cushion\" . . .  to say that my dimensions on this one were rather miscalculated would be an understatement . . . there were many hours spent unpicking & recalculating my measurements(there were also many words said that I cannot print here AND on a couple of occasions the cushion sailed through the air like a frisbee!!!!!!)However  . . . we got there in the end . . .And that my dear friends  . . . is the important thing  :-)This old cane carpet beater had been lying in the back of a cupboard - it belongs to my mum & she had given it to me many years ago to decorate for her ... more years than I have had my blog in fact  ...I finally pulled it out this past week ... it was under about an inch of dust so I gave it a good scrub (I think it only fair to acknowledge the dust was more likely to be from my house than from my mums!!!)I decorated it with some silk flowers from my stash plus a couple of different types of cones raided from my citrus potpourri bowl . . . I felt it was certainly an improvement . . . & hope Mum thinks so too :-)These turkeys decided to make an unwelcome return to the garden after being absent for a few weeks There are 9 in this flock ... they came in through the front gate & were tall enough to set the gate buzzer off !!!As it buzzes twice for each entry, you can imagine the noise with it going off 18 times as they sloowwly made their way through !!!It is so very dry here now & there are only slim pickings left in the garden as I simply cannot water every single thing  I did manage to gather together a few dahlias & good old \"The fairy\" rose to brighten my table this past weekWhile standing outside watering the other evening, The Mr's friend Dave pulled into the driveway. I knew the Mr wasn't home & I must admit I groaned silently to myself (& muttered a few things)  Dave is a lovely man but he very much enjoys talking endlessly about Moto X ... whether The Mr is here or not !!! In other words ... I get to listen to him waffle on ... frequently !!!  I was forced to rethink my thoughts somewhat when he reached into his boot ... & pulled this out for me though !!!He told me I was the only \"rather odd\" person he knew who would get over-excited about a rusty old trike that his wife had told him to take to the local dump.I would say by the \"baldness\" of the tyres this old trike has done many a mile in its day  :-)I am off to finish picking the last of the strawflowers for the seasonI hope the week is treating you kindly dear readers Thanks - as always - for stopping by my little corner of the globeyour visits are always so very much appreciatedLove & friendship to you allJulie x0x0x0The last of the strawflowers picked for the season"},

I do not know who this pattern belongs to ... I have a doll like this myself, bought for me by my Mum many years ago on a trip to Australia. A customer once asked me to make one for her so I made up my own version of the pattern (though mine has turned out much fatter I notice)I particularly love Raggedy Annes & it has taken me a great deal of willpower over the years Not to begin a collection of themI have had to quickly pop this little sweetie in the Cottage as she was beginning to look right at home on my couch !!! When I first began blogging just over 2 years ago I won a giveaway from Louana from here ... I won her gorgeous little bundle of fat quarter vintage sheet fabrics - it honestly made me SO happy - you can read my post about it hereI had great plans for these vintage sheet fabrics  ...  but had never actually done anything with them ...so yesterday I had my first attempt at making a roundie cushion from this gorgeous bookAs it required some mathematics to work out my dimensions, I had been procrastinating for a good long time.  (My Maths teacher did not sit me down the back of the class for no reason at all you know - maths was never, ever my forte) However ... I must say ... I was most chuffed with my first attemptI just love my new roundie ...  what do you think ???As I didn't have a round inner (as the pattern stated) ... I simply drew around a large round tray I had & then stuffed the inside with fibre fill (you stuff it from the middle, under the button closure)I am currently mid way through my next attempt in which I have drawn around a (very) large round enamel basin & am making this one up in darker colourings using some gorgeous vintage sanderson fabrics from my treasured stash ... I shall share it with you next post I promise  :-)Last week while waiting in town for an appointment, I popped into my local Animal Care Op Shop ... it was my lucky day as I came across these little treasures buried under a pile of old sheetsI must confess ... they didnt quite look like this when I purchased them  (in fact they rather changed colour after a good soak)Though things are really brown & tired looking here now, I noticed my lillies had opened in the corner of my native garden & snapped these pics last weekclick on the collage to enlarge themThe white seems to really stand out against all the green of the natives & I love their fragranceWell dear friends, I must away as The Mr & I are milking this weekend & I will be late & get a \"telling off\" again !!!Thanks again for your visits which mean so very much to meI just always LOVE this little quote from the film \"The Help\" ... how very true Wishing you a great week ahead - & some creative time would be just that extra special   :-)with much love & friendship to you allJulie x0x0"},
{"title": "Raggedy days", "date": "Tuesday, February 25, 2014", "text": "Good afternoon dear friends & readers & welcome to my new followersIt is so lovely to have you stop by for a visit  . . .  thanks so very much  :-)When my friend Claire owned her gorgeous little patchwork Shop in Hawera one of the very first patterns I purchased from her was a Sun Valley Primitives design called \"Raggedy Angel\"Claire also sold the rather large corrugated iron wings that were used in the patternI eventually made the angel up & she used to hang just outside my entry door greeting people & generally hanging away there quite happily - I found an old grainy photo of her back then ...The entry door to the left is no longer there as we removed it when we altered our kitchenAs you can imagine, being dressed in red, after hanging out there for a few summers, the red fabric had faded to a shabby pink & she was most tatty & neglected looking.  She was relegated to the back of a cupboard for a year or two ...Recently I found her body & the wings & decided to give her a new lease of lifeI mixed up a spray bottle containing 3 teaspoons parisian essence & 200 ml white vinegar & liberally sprayed over all the faded calico parts that would showShe got to lie out in the sun on a large fluffy towel to dry, & I can assure you, she was not mistreated in any way.Oh yes this is the life .... lying here in the warm sunshine ... starkers !!!!!I showed you a sneaky peek last post of the new dress under construction ... the design is quite like stitching a penny rug with all the felt pieces making up the \"tree\" designToday I completed her & hung her on my dining room wall although she is not going to stay here - I just havent found quite the \"right home\" for her yetI had planned to redo her hair (which is thick jute string that I originally hand dyed) but my good friend Leeanne suggested I leave it as it is - all sort of scraggy lookingI just love the mottled effect on the corrugated iron wingsI kept the original star that she is clutching, but covered the centre felt stars with masking tape & gave the calico a good spray with my parisian essence mixture I like to hang my dolls on the wall for a few days & walk past them to decide if I need to embellish them any more or change anything ... already I have decided she needs some brown cheek blusher & some red berries tucked into her star, hmmm ... perhaps a rusty button at her neck .... ??? . . .This past week I had my last group booking - a Rural Womens Group bought their lunch to the garden & ate in the shade of the trees & had their meeting The doves very much enjoyed the additional company to the garden but made the meeting a little difficult with their loud noises & deciding to swoop in & out every now & then - they are becoming very settled & at home nowMy friend Jan thought they were ornaments when she walked up the steps last week & got such a shock when one turned its head !!!!!!As they tend to stand either in their food dish or on the edge & kept tipping the dish over ...  I notice The Mr has given them one of my vintage enamel plates to eat out of ...just about to climb into the food bowl !!!   notice how the bits we dont like get tossed out !!!Along with my last group booking I also completed my very last order this past week . . .  Sandra had ordered 3 large sized cushions from me to go on the back of a sofa bed in her sleepout - she requested that they be approx 25 x 25 inches, in wool blanketing & a pale blue colour schemeI decided to make up a patchwork effect using a variety of blue blankets I had in my stash - these cushions turned out huge & took a mountain of stuffing ... but Sandra was delighted with themHer main concern was how to sneak them in without her husband noticing ... I couldn't offer any suggestions but I wished her lots of luck  :-)Having no more group bookings or orders is actually a first for me ... I have never been in this position before & thought I would feel rather concerned ... but I actually feel quite calm about it ... perhaps this will give me some time to really enjoy being creative for a change ??I made up a few more sets of scented Spice Mats from my kiwiana fabrics as there were no more left in the Cottage ... these always tick along as they are a great gift for sending overseas.You may recall two posts back when I mentioned my vintage cane shopping trundler ... a trademe purchase ... how I hadn't yet decided what to do with it   :-)Well it was a post comment from dear  Shane that got me thinking ... & so I filled it with my dried hydrangeas & sat it on a sheltered area of my outside deck - I love the combination of blues & the different pastel shades Thanks so much Shane for the inspirationAlthough things here are rapidly turning brown & crisp I took some snaps of my wheelbarrow which is still flowering away happily - I water it each night & the begonias & lobellia are still thrivingThanks so much to you all dear friends & readers for stopping by  I shall be back at the end of the week with the draw for my angel - best of luck to all those that have already entered - there is still time if anyone else would like to pop their name in the giveaway -here are the post details for you to enterHoping you have a lovely week ahead,much love & friendship to you all,Julie x0x0x0x"},
{"title": "A Giveaway, an anniversary & a \"sort-of\" birthday", "date": "Thursday, February 13, 2014", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,I have decided to have a little give-away on my blog ... there are a couple of things I have to celebrate which made me decide to do this . . .source PinterestFirstly this month is the 10 year anniversary since I had my accident - fell out of the hammock, & broke my neckThis in turn, lead to my little Cottage being constructed for me  :-)(which in turn lead to me beginning my little blog about my life here at Threadbear Cottage)Secondly it is coming up 2 years since I started my blog - kind of my 2-year birthday & seeing as I have never had a give-away before, not even for my 1st birthday, I decided it was long overdueThis lovely linen angel is based on the Rosalie Quinlan Peace Angel from the book Gift ... however I have altered her slightly ... she is dressed quite neutrally in a linen dress, doiley pinny, & her wings & bloomers are Lynette Anderson prints. Her hair is hand-dyed mohair & her little peace-stitched heart is raw linen. She has 2 mother-of-pearl buttons on her bodiceAlthough she has hung on the wall watching over me for the past few days ... she is equally as lovely just sitting ...Would you like to win her perhaps ???The Giveaway is open to Anyone & I will post to Anywhere in the worldAll you have to do to enter is leave me a comment on this post & if you are a follower, let me know, & I will put your name in the draw for two entries.You don't have to be a follower to enter but if you are, then you get two chances  :-)Is that simple enough ???Also I will be adding a few extra goodies in with the parcel - a couple of little surprise extras.I will draw the give-away at the end of this month.(incidently Peace Angel is 43 cms/ 17 inches in length)Last week I posted about the 2 ring-neck doves that had come to live in my trees - this week they have become even more quieter & have let me get right up close to them at timesThe dove in the background had lots of feathers missing around his neck - apparently he was very picked on by the other birds when in the aviary - I am so pleased to see them all growing back again slowly now he is freeEvery night I give The Mr little reports about our daily \"progress\"He assures me that it is not actually me they are so fond of, but rather the $12.00 worth of dove mix I bought for them at Bin InnAccording to him it is purely \"cupboard love\"However these visitors to the garden this past week, have not been quite so welcome ... If you look at this next photo you will notice the tall solar lamp at the foot of the steps, just to the left - this was taken in spring a couple of years agoThe solar lamp had been a gift many years ago but unfortunately it had blown over many times & was no longer able to be straightened so we decided it had come to the end of its lifeHowever, I saved the glass dome that was around the bulb as it was quite solid & had never broken in all the times the wind had blown it overThis week I gathered together the dome, a $2.00 glass dish & a $1.00 wine glass from the Op Shop - I had a little project in mindI tipped the wine glass upside down & glued the plate to its base ... then I added a sparkly diamante star which I think had been a christmas decoration at some stageAll I need now I feel, is a pretty glass flower or bird perhaps, to adorn the top of the domeI was rather chuffed with my $3.00 project  - what do you think??This piece of vintage embroidery had sat in the bottom of a box of linens for many moons - I had always loved it & wanted to do something with itThe thread I have used is an Op Shop purchase - almost like a linen type of yarn - very oldAlthough I had soaked it, it still had a couple of marks & was very thin & worn in places, but I really loved the design on itThe fabric was so thin it almost felt like it had been stitched on an old flour bagI cut around the best of it, turned it under & blanket stitched it onto a lovely piece of wool blanketing in a similar colourwayI decided it could make up the last cushion on my couchIt hardly shows up the gorgeous striped blanket unfortunatelyLooking at my photos I am thinking that perhaps I should add 4 large bakerlite buttons to the edges of the embroidery to complete it . . .  hmmm . . .  what do you think ??I also stitched the original blanket label (which was in great condition still) to the back of the cushionLastly to share a couple of sneaky peeks of some prim dolls I am currently working on . . . Incidently the lime green is masking tape - no the dolls legs are not striped green/burgundy !!!!!I hope to have the completed dolls to show you next post.While grocery shopping last week I treated myself to one of these lovely fragrant candles at Pak-n-save ... for $4.99 they smell delicious & are so enjoyableThis one is the raspberry one but I have also tried the pumpkin spice one .... Wishing you a wonderful week dear friends & readersPlease do enter my give-away if it appeals to youThanks as always for your visits which I so appreciatewith much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x"},

I got a good picking off my statice plants this past week ... plus a couple of buckets of hydrangea's click on the pics to enlarge them if you likeFrom past failures, I have found the best way is to pick them when the leaves feel papery to the touch, (about this time of year is ideal) - give them a good big drink of water (for about a week I find) - then hang them to dry in bunchesI love the see my Dads old painting ladder (that is hanging in the Cottage) filled with my dried flowers for the seasonThe old statice from last season, I chop up into my rose potpourri to add a bit more colourLast year my friend Pauline from Infused with Nature gave me some calendula seeds which I scattered around the edge of the vege garden & I am sure  ... every single seed took   :-)So I picked a basketful of the flower heads & dried them in my dehydrator this weekAlong with the yellow statice, they add a nice splash of colour to my citrus potpourri'sThe dehydrator has been working overtime lately as I have a large order to fill for a friend - I do really enjoy making all my potpourri's & it never feels like a chore  :-)The roses (thankfully) are having their second flush & I have been drying their petals as much as I can before these strong winds we are experiencing, blow them to infinity & beyond ...I have also been drying some millet seed heads which The Mr grows at the farm to make into silage, & also to break feed to the cows when the grass gets lowYou may recall some months back, I moaned about posted about pruning our grapevine & weeding the rows of aggies & what a chore it all was ... This was what it looked like back then - mid September these were takenWe have had some prolific growth & the severe pruning of the vine has really been quite successful with it looking like producing a good crop this yearyou can see the bunches of grapes in the pic on the leftThe Mr keeps telling me he is expecting a phone call from Corbans Wines anyday now  (???!!!)   . . . truth be told, usually the birds beat us to most of it as we don't cover the vines to protect the fruitI am really enjoying the flowering miniature agapanthas this year -having weeded the rows properly last SeptemberThis past week I finished an order for a friend who wanted some of my wool blanket cats/rabbits to on-sell in her shopShe had asked for 5 of each so I made up a dozen & let her pick out her favouritesAbout mid last year I helped my friend move house - she had lived in the same house for 40 years & so consequently, got rid of alot of stuff during her move.  I took lots of bags to the Op Shop & also the dump for her.  I also took quite a few home & - you may recall - earned myself the name \"Mrs Steptoe\".There was a supermarket bag to be taken to the Op Shop & when I opened it, it contained her wedding dress ... \"are you sure??\" I asked  \"Yes I dont want it\" came the reply.  So I asked if I could perhaps have it to cut up for the lace & fabric ??\"Yes, of course, do whatever you like with it\" It seemed appropriate then that I came across the plastic bag with the wedding dress in this past week in the mess that is my sewing room ...  as tomorrow is a potluck tea combining both her birthday, her housewarming, & a \"thank you\" to all those who helped with the moveThe dress had a long train & a frill around the bottom which my pic has not shownI found one of the doll bodies that I had made last post still waiting to be clothed ... with trepidation I cut into the wedding dress fabric & lace ... I tried to use as much of the lace as I couldI covered her wings with it plus stitched some of the tiny pearl beads here & there ... made her some lacey bloomersalthough I have given her a small posy of tulle flowers, I like to think she is more of an angel . . .  not a bride dollI hope my friend loves her - there sure is plenty of wedding dress left over   My neighbour has opened the door of one of her aviaries & released her ring-neck doves - some have returned & others have  not  . . .  a pair have decided to take up residence in my trees & The Mr captured these pics yesterday morning . . . I am more than happy to share my garden with them - I love the sound they make & they seem very quiet & contentFinally friends, I made a Trademe purchase way back in September last year but it was a \"buyer must pick up\" purchase ... as the lady lived in Auckland I asked my stepdaughter to collect it for me - which she did - & I have only just received it when they came for a visit last weekendI am not sure why, but I have always loved these old cane shopping trundlers - although I must admit my grandmother had one & Oh how I hated it back then !!!The Mr asked me what I planned to do with it ... \"I'm not sure yet\" I replied \". . .  something arty perhaps . . .?? \"\"Well so long as you dont expect to walk down the street with it wearing a funny old hat & expect me to walk with you\" he informed me . . .  (gosh, I hadn't thought of that .... now there's an idea !!!)I hope you have a wonderful weekend out there folks - thank you SO very much for your visitsWishing you rusty old trikes filled with flowering snapdragons  :-)with much love & friendship,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "Angels ... & a Book about a Cat   ", "date": "Thursday, January 23, 2014", "text": "Hello dear friends & readersI noticed my angel wall in the Cottage was looking a little depleted lately - although they are not a huge seller, sometimes you can sell 1 or 2 & suddenly ... its looking rather emptySo I set about remedying the situation ... first up was my old favourite \"friendship angel\" from Rosalie QuinlanYou may perhaps recognise the dress fabric Catherine  ???I especially loved her delicate little pearl bracelet on her wrist  :-)I also made 2 other bodies so will endeavour to show you them as they \"get their clothes on\" ! ! !Next up I decided to make some more angel magnets, but I thought I would use up some of my doiley offcuts for their dresses this time roundlittle ladies all lined up waiting for their wings & their hair  :-)I like to try them on my fridge to make sure their magnets adhere well ...Some of them have tin wings & the top 3 have wings made from stiffened lace scraps(I once made a dozen of these for a lady going overseas & she sent me a postcard from Chile to tell me my angels were \"flying all over the world\" - she used them as hostess gifts)Although it is mid summer here, we have had all 4 seasons this past week ... on the nice sunshiney days you get to do chores like this ...One poor ol' ted is hanging by his foot as he has no ears to peg on to !!!!!On those off days when you are feeling just a tad grumpy & out of sorts with the world in general (or perhaps with The Mr!!!) I have discovered a bit of a tonic . . . I have discovered - quite by accident - that if you sit outside for a couple of hours in the fresh air & the sunshine rubbing lavender stalks, &... (as an added bonus) ... listening to Fleetwood Mac at quite a high volume . . .  not only do you end up with much uplifted spirits & enhanced mood (or \"high as a kite\" as The Mr informed me!!!) ... but my friends . . . you also end up with a lovely big bowl full of lavendar to use  :-)My friend Lois had been on my mind alot lately & I remembered that it was coming up to the one-year anniversary of her sons death  - he died just a month short of his 30th birthday - so I decided to make a lavendar heart & pop in the post to surprise herFor some reason this years lavender crop seems very high in oil content - I noticed this in my rubbings - & the smell throughout the house is intense ... so I filled Lois's heart with itPlus I filled the parcel post bag with bunches of rosemary (for remembrance) ... no wonder the man at the Postal Counter was looking at me oddly this morning when I handed it over !!!I also completed an order for my dear old friend Margaret - she likes to keep a good stock of these padded coathangers on hand for gifts to give to her elderly friends in the retirement villageonce again I used this years lavendar rubbingsCleaning out a top cupboard I came across a bag of lightweight cotton gloves - Mum had given me these when Dad passed away (12 years ago now) ... & I had done nothing with them in all that timeContinuing on with my \"prim theme\" from last post I dunked them in a heavy parisian essence mixture & made up some primitive hand-to-heart little wallhangersnot sure what my Dad would think ... no doubt shaking his head & rolling his eyes !!!I had been watching this late soldier-poppy seedling poke its head through in the old tin bucket where I grow my red begonias & when I saw it flowering just yesterday morning, I tried to capture it ...Finally friends I wanted to share a special book with you ... I really enjoy it when fellow bloggers recommend books they have read ... & it has often lead me to either borrow them from my library, or purchase them myself.When I gave my son Kayne this book 2 christmas's ago & he opened the parcel ... he actually, honestly thought I had mistakenly given him the wrong gift & that this was a book meant for a childBut he has read it, loved it, & last week returned it to me as I had mentioned I would like to re-read it ... it is truely the most delightful story & one I would thoroughly recommendKayne had just returned it to me & I had been thinking to myself that I must mention it on my blog when I came across this post from Betty ... in which she recommends the book also.Phew I have sure prattled on this post & jumped all over the show ... apologies if I have lost you along the way  :-)Wishing you sunshine & rainbows in your week dear friends & readers - thanks so much for your visit,much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "A little bit of prim . . .  just because  . . . ", "date": "Friday, January 10, 2014", "text": "Happy New Year to you all dear friends & readers2013 was a real mixed year for us here at my threadbear life . . . we experienced some great highs . . . my eldest son got married in my garden in late Novemberand some real lows as well  . . . we had to say Goodbye to our dear friend Nero at Easter ... & I lost the big fat fluffy \"floor rug\" that I always had in my kitchen ... we still miss him a great dealBut that is the way it goes for us all . . . ups & downs & roundabouts  ...  as life ticks on through the seasons   . . . For some reason, even though it is mid summer here in our hemisphere, I have felt like doing winter projects ... wool blanket & felting projects ... (yes we have already established that I am a little odd & back-to-front!!)) The Simply Vintage Magazine that I mentioned a couple of posts back had a few projects that had caught my eye ........I very much liked this prim pear pincushion in mustard wool felt (a design by Debbie Lofgren for Little Stitches) I found an old pine wooden base that I had tucked away & stained it darker, then made the pincushion, crow & strawberry - the crow is just calico, painted black & then lightly sandedInspired by the finished article, I turned my attention to another project catching my eye ...  \"Jack the Cat\" (a design by Deborah Busby for Wooden Spool Designs) Although the pattern made Jack up at 26 cms tall, I decided to enlarge it & make him into a doorstop ... my Jack came out at 39 cms tallI used part of an old grey army blanket I had & weighted him with half a broken brick (so he is rather a heavy chap) plus I decided to give him a more smiley mouth as I felt he looked a little grim in the patternAnd speaking of cats . . .  I have discovered a feral mother cat & her 2 kittens living under my cottage & have been feeding them ... the mother is very wild & hisses/spits at me but the kittens are still not quite sure about human beings ... one came skidding into the cottage yesterday morning when I was dusting ... \"hellooo\" I quietly said ... he looked at me & suddenly something in his brain went click as if he was saying \"my mother told me not to talk to you\" & away he skidded, off out the doorOh I could watch them playing all day long ... I mentioned to the Mr the other day ... it wouldn't matter how grumpy you were feeling, to watch kittens playing must surely improve your mood ... until of course I discovered this just this morning ...I couldn't figure out what on earth had hit my shrub until the Mr informed me he had seen the kittens playing & jumping in it when he left at 5 this morning to go to the farm !!!\"So umm, you didnt think to chase them away?\" I asked him ??!!\"Oh it did cross my mind,  but they were having so much fun\" he informed me !!!!!!!I am hoping the little ratbags dont come back tonight & decide to \"re-arrange\" the opposite one The vege garden & our plum trees are offering lots of pickings at presentThe plums are very tasty this year - for some reason, we seem to get a really good crop every alternate year I stood at the bench this morning making up some more of my herbal moth sachet mixtureYou can find the recipe in this post here should you decide to make some up yourselfJust prior to christmas I sold the last Isabella Golly I had in the Cottage - I usually like to keep at least one in stock & also keep on hand a few of the painted face panels (which I paint myself)I found one last face panel in my \"Isabella box\" but none of her cardies, which my Mum knits for me from 5-ply woolI think Miss Pink Isabella is just delightful   :-)I went ahead & made up the last face panel into a Golly,  left her without a cardy but gave her a nice lace doiley collar instead.  I havent done a pink Isabella for many years but had these dainty little ballet shoes which made me decide on this colour combination.I hope you have found some creative time in your week dear friends - the weather here today is glorious but we have had lightning/thunderstorms &extremely strong winds as well this past week thanks as always for your welcome visits - wishing you all a wonderful 2014much love & friendshipJulie x0x0x(I am just off outside to try to resurrect my kitten damaged shrub!!!)"},

I have been collecting many different seeds as I weed, & storing them in brown paper bags. I also had to have a quick prune of the lavender up the Cottage path as it had flopped all over the bricksPlus all summer long I constantly gather nuts, cones & strawflowers for my pot-pourri making ... this is second nature to me now The small cones to the left were lying on the lawn under the magnolia tree & hastily gathered yesterday before mowingI noticed how much the fluffies garden had grown in the 6 weeks since I first photographed it, so put together this little collage to show you ... (click on the pic to enlarge it)The catmint & shasta daisies are all in full bloom nowBefore I close I wanted to mention a beautiful website that is well worth a visit ... my young friend April now has a site for her aprons & gorgeous handmade craft work, go visit here  ... & also for her wonderful organic skincare products, go visit here.  April has put together her website so beautifully, it is a treat for the eyes  :-)I hope the New Years arrival brings good things to you all my friends & that all our hopes, dreams & wishes come true in 2014Thanks so much for stopping by this wet December daymuch love/hugs/ friendship to you all out thereJulie x0x0"},

I promptly forgot her request !!!!!The other night whilst trying to sleep, a cog shifted in my brain ... & I remembered the rabbit request !!!!***\"a girl rabbit in a pink dress about this big \" were her instructions \"no cardigan but quite girly & pretty\"I used my Rosalie Quinlan book \"Gift\" & her \"Miss Millie\" pattern as a guide ... but I enlarged it a little & gave her a dress instead of bloomersI even found the same micro waffle fabric as the pattern suggested for the body in my stash, but it was pure white, so got a good dunking in parisian essence.I decided to do 2 bodies & have one as stock for the cottage - the 2nd Miss Millie got clothed in a lovely paisley print fabric I had on hand ...Oh I do adore a good old paisley print  :-)Being the neurotic creative person that I am, I had to give them a little doiley hanky to hold in their handsRosemary is coming tomorrow to collect her rabbit ... I wonder which she will choose ... Miss Rosebud or Miss Paisley ???     Which one would you choose ???My friend Sandy has always had the most beautiful christmas decorations & displays ... earlier this year she had the misfortune to sustain a terrible fire in which she lost all her lovely christmas collections, along with lots of other personal items.I had wanted to make her something a little christmassy as she begins to replace her collection again .... she had admired one of the Santa bags in the Cottage & I remembered she had had one before the fire ... so I sat & stitched one for her this past weekIt is a Country Friends design (an old pattern) & just simple redwork which I lined & backed with a ticking fabric.They are lovely filled with lollies or choccy treats & hung on a door knob for when guests arrive ... I noticed this sign which I had tossed aside during my outside spring clean-up prior to the wedding ... it was certainly faded & past its best ... I had other ideas for it as it seemed the perfect size ...You can hardly read it - it is SO faded - but it said  \"PEACE may peace be forever in our hearts & home\"Many months ago I had picked up a couple of floral spring clips from the bargain bin at The Warehouse ... I wanted something to affix them to, to make a clipboard of sortsAfter a \"lick & a promise\" with my waxing/painting technique ... I managed to attach the pegs to the board & used the \"rub-ons\" given to me by my friend ElaineThe little wooden butterfly was found in my craft drawer stash I have hung this on my sewing room wall & am finding it most useful already.I had to do a trip to Cambridge last week & popped in (again) to this lovely shop  -  mystyleI had long coveted one of their Cath Kidston ironing board covers but I could not bring myself to pay $70 for something to cover the ironing board !! ... so instead I bought 70 cms of their good quality fabric & made myself one (which probably took half an hour at the most)I simply took my old cover off & traced around it on the floor, & made a casing with elastic threaded through it I am so chuffed with my new cover ... my ironing board covers get a hard time with sticky vliesofix etc & like many crafters, they get used a great deal - not just to do the ironing  :-)Thank you all SO much for your very kind comments last post about my sons wedding day ...  I must confess to feeling my energy levels returning again & now my groups have finished for the year, I can breathe a sign of reliefThe last bus on the last day was not without dramas ... he actually drove off leaving 2 ladies still chatting to me in the Cottage !!!I did not know I could run that fast (lucky I didnt fly to bits!!!) as I ran out my other gate to catch him coming up the road - I suggested rather \"firmly\" to him that perhaps he do a headcount in future, before departing a venue !!Sarah emailed me a couple more photos I would like to share with you please ... Notice how chuffed Cedric (scarecrow) looks in this photo that he got to be a part of the day  :-)I love this photo - look at my Mums happy face as she hugs Sarah in the backgroundIsabella (in the background) also got to feature - she got a good wash/hosing the day before hand - she got told she was in NO fit state to attend a wedding all grubby & cobwebby like she was - it was disgraceful !!!Sarahs nephews ...

Kayne not asleep this time !!!Probably my most favourite so far (above) - thanks so much for letting me share them with you Today is a dark sky & a rainy day - a perfect day for sitting at the table making some christmas cards - I love the whole cutting & pasting thing ... reminds me of when I was little (quite some time ago now!!!)Thank You So Much for stopping by dear friends & readersMay you enjoy the rest of your week be it rainy or sunshine :-)much love/hugs/friendship to you allJulie x0x0x"},
{"title": "a most magical day", "date": "Monday, November 25, 2013", "text": "Greetings dear friends & readersOn Saturday my eldest son Aaron got married in my garden - we had a most magical dayThe weather gods smiled upon us (though a huge thunderstorm went through the night before taking down 2 large tree branches)Sarah is a minimalist girl & didn't want any fussiness - though I \"sneaked\" in an antique chair with a basket of dried rose petals for tossingIt was a beautiful day enjoyed by all ... I have no proper photos yet apart from a few snaps the Mr took for me ...She put her posy together from flowers out of my garden which was special for us bothSarah is one of 5 beautiful girls - imagine that . . . 5 daughters??!!(Sarah is 2nd to eldest - I think this photo is eldest to youngest on the left)They both chose to have no attendants - Sarahs Mum & myself were the witnessesme & my two boys . . .  one having a wee nap !!!!I dont know about you folk, but I just HATE photos of myself !!!me & my little tiny Mum . . . I Love the sign just behind my back end  !!!!!Now, because I always want my blog to be an honest place &, lets face it, I dont live in a world where everything is all sunshine & roses - I live in the real world, let me just say this.  The weeks prior to the wedding were not ones I would want to repeat in a hurry. The work load felt huge, often overwhelming,  coupled with the fact that November is my busy season for groups.The cleaning, weeding & preparation seemed endless & energy levels were low I wanted everything to be Oh So Perfect for everyone. To tell the truth, most of the time, I just wanted to be in a cave, on Mars,  with my eyes shut tight & my hands over my ears !!!!!  So when they both arrived for the wedding, I went around the front to greet them & walk up with my son ...  & I saw in front of me, an actual bride & groom, it suddenly struck me, they are actually getting married ... I promptly burst into tears !!!!!I thought they both made such a lovely couple, but yes, I am indeed biased  :-)Sarah is a very lovely girl & will be a wonderful daughter in lawThe day just flowed so well & everyone seemed content to sit (in the shade mostly) & relax & enjoy themselves.  We laughed lots ...It was honestly a truely magical day  :-)Oh, & I must share with you my new wedding shoes ... made in Spain ... so comfortable to wear & my favourite colour too The following day I had a group coming. Wendy from charlotte's web bought her very lovely church ladies out to the garden. Wendy was surprised I would want to host a group the day after the wedding. I confessed to her that I felt it should all still (hopefully) be tidy so it was perfect timing.Oh it was so nice to just sit for awhile  :-)We had a lovely afternoon tea in the shade with china teacups - the ladies were in no hurry to rush off which is always the greatest compliment.Wendy presented me with this delightful gift as a \"thank you\"Today, it is back to reality & on with some christmas ordersA large order for angel & golly teatowels & matching oven mittsThere are gaps to fill in the Cottage plus I still have 4 more groups before they finish for the year.Thanks so much for stopping by & letting me share our special day with you all.I hope the coming week brings you only good thingsThe soldier poppies in my garden always remind me of my DadMuch love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x"},
{"title": "A garden for a Fluffy", "date": "Wednesday, November 13, 2013", "text": "Good afternoon dear friends & readersWhen I  stand on my cottage deck & look up the length of my section I can see the spot where the fat fluffies grave is.It always bothered me somewhat, that it was just a patch of lawn with the stones on it made for me by my dear friend CarolynIt always felt that someone in our lives of such significance should have a more memorable resting spotI had tossed around the idea for awhile now to make a small garden around the areaWhen we first moved here a lady from further on out my road would sometimes come & gather fruit off our trees.It appears the previous owners used to let her & I was more than happy for her to continue as fruit was one of the few things she could digest with no problems We developed a kind of disjointed friendship over the years but often she would call in just to see the fat fluffySo what do ya reckon Mum ???Over the years I knew not to get offended when she plainly told me \"No, I dont want to talk with you today, I have just come for a pat with Nero\" -  more often as not... this suited me to a teeI am hiding today & I am NOT receiving visitors thanks !!!!!!...though I am not sure the fat fluffy was always receptive to her attention!So  I came home recently to find a most beautiful handmade card & a granny smith apple tree left on my doorstep ... she had written the words \"never will I pass your gate again & not think of him...\"It seemed like the perfect time to mark his resting spotI couldn't think what flowers to plant until, in the middle of the night it dawned on me - of course, forgetmenots & catmint - yes, he had a fascination with cats, bordering on obsession And as he loved to chase the grannysmith apples (he thought they were balls), the tree was just perfect :-)Not great photos unfortunately but I am hoping when the catmint & white shasta daisies bloom it will be lovelyIt has been 6 months now since he passed away.  I still miss him like it was just yesterday.   These have been busy November days & many late nights - some spent on the floor making up batches of potpourri There were 2 orders for Hettie Hen Doorstops that were flying out to Australia . . . the customer didnt want me to weight them as she was already very overweight in her luggage . . . I usually weight them with a broken brick so these two felt like a feather with nothing in themBack on the floor again, this time making christmas stockings for the CottageThese two little sampler needlecases (A Country Friends design) finally got completed & are stock for the CottageI managed to fling together a small christmas mantlepiece late last week before a busload arrived . . . the month had kind of slipped away on me as I usually have a christmas display done well before now . . . Not really the grand vision that I had back in February for my display this year . . .  but gosh, where did the in-between months go to ???!!!Sometimes when you rush through your days like a half crazed person (as I do) you dont get to see & appreciate the beauty & the growth in the garden ... I took my camera for a little stroll yesterday to try to capture some of it & share with you . . .The roses are just coming into full bloom now - mine are a little later this year The lavender path leading to the pond has a gentle haze of mauve as the lavenders come into flowerThe water lillies are looking beautiful on the pond right now ...And some of my water iris's are flowering also\"surely you must have a gardener?\" a customer asked me last week\"yes\" I replied \"there are 3 gardeners here...  me, myself, I...\"It is a pretty time in this part of the globe although things have taken a hammering from the strong winds we are experiencing latelyThanks so very much to you all for popping by  :-)I am off to \"park up\" with a cuppa & unpick a dollies dressWishing you all a great rest of the week  :-)much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x"},

I like the bright splashes of colour for a changeWhile at Briscoes I noticed their lamps were half price so this rather uninteresting little number came home with me ...(I am always looking for extra lamp light for the Cottage but the ones that appeal to me, cost a small fortune)The shade is rice paper . . . so I decided to \"embellish it\" a littleOut came the Op Shop doiley again ...I was so pleased with the end result ... even the Mr commented on what an improvement it was  :-)What do you think ???I added a doiley circle to each side plus some bobble trim I found in my scrap boxIn my kitchen I have a bit of a \"poppy theme\" going on ... I did not really plan this but the old tiles I rescued from an antique fire surround kind of started this offAnd so I commissioned the poppy stained glass doors to match the tilesSo I was most excited to win an auction on Trademe last week for this set of coasters - handmade by a lovely lady from the far northThey are so beautifully finished & have felt on their underneaths to prevent scratchingWell folks I hope you have found some creative time in your weekThanks so much for stopping by to read my ramblingsI may not be posting much in November but I shall remember to cart my camera with me to record the \"happenings\"Wishing you much love/hugs/friendship, as alwaysJulie x0x0x"},

Love the glasses Kayne  :-)I think he was looking up at a plane ??  or daydreaming maybe ??I look at these & its hard to get my head around all the places he has been & the things he has seen ...(& I must confess that a tiny part of me would really like to send these pictures to all the teachers that repeatedly told me my son would never amount to anything in life!!!!)I was also rather spoilt & received some delightful gifts The wee Owl was from a tiny village in Cinque terre in Italy - the lady was sitting in her Craft Shoppe overlooking the ocean - stitching them (Oh the poor lady!!!!!!) Incidently they said I would've thought I had died & gone to heaven had I been in that shop!!!When I look at this photo they sent me .... OH YES ... I can see why !!!!!!!!Looks pretty much like Heaven to me  :-)     click on the pic to enlarge it - its gorgeous !!!!!After the 10th my moon calendar told me it was very good fertile planting time & most prolific for sowing & planting all that produce above ground . . .  so I planted come courgettes & cucumbers (my friend Donna had very good success with growing hers in tyres last year, so I thought I would give it a try this season)We are experiencing the most awful chilly winds at present, so they are looking a little wind blownA dear blogging friend Shane & I did a \"seed swap\" through the mail - you can read Shanes post about it here - so I planted the gorgeous variety of seeds that she so kindly sent me also.(thank you all for your lovely comments about lunar gardening ... it seems there is lots of interest out there so I may keep \"mentioning\" it on my blog from time to time)Last year I made pincushions from some vintage china cups & saucers, but they did not really sell in the Cottage, so I decided to try something else . . .  birdfeeders seemed a possibility ??I have one in my front garden & often get comments on it ... so thought I would give it a try . . .  they look lovely sitting in the Cottage garden (the green stake is removable by the way)At the start of the week ... I took a long hard look at my bathroom & decided it could do with a revamp.Having neither the time, money, nor the energy to do this task . . .  I decided to improvise . . .  & make a new curtain for the window  :-)In fact, the curtain that was already there - having decided it was just dusty & needed a good shake - upon taking it outside & doing this - it promptly fell to pieces on me ... it was faded & rotten !!!!So I decided to line this one to prevent fading & also, the sun rotting it ... I found some calico in my stash, along with the blue check seersucker type of fabric that I used.To tell you that I very nearly threw the sewing machine out the window during the making of this . . .  would be the honest truth !!!!Give me a fiddly doll to make anyday!!!!The bows are purely decoration & serve no useful purpose whatsoever!!!Upon completion I asked the Mr what he thought of my new blind ??\"Very blue\" was his reply !!!?So then I turned my attention to my little wrought iron chair, gave it a whisk of paint with a spray can - then decided to recover the cushion squab that was on it (& rather water stained) - I used the oilcloth I had bought several months back (& also the help of my friends industrial sewing machine)The linen cushion was a pair of trousers given to me by my mum (many moons ago) & still in the \"cut-out-ready-to-be-made-up\" phaseI couldnt resist attaching one of the beautiful crochet hearts sent to me by my friend Amy - to be used as coasters But, Oh ToO LoVely to sit your mug of tea on !!!!Thank You So Much dear AmySometimes as I am rushing about my day or my week, I occasionally catch glances of vistas in the garden & they make me stop & appreciate them for a minute ... because they pass by so quickly with the changing of the seasons ... this was one such view last week as I hurried to open the end gate for a customerThe blossom petals reminded me of confetti on the groundWhile pegging out the washing I noticed the wisteria flowering & the purple catmint underneath it I read this post by eco ethel with great interest - I absolutely loved what she had done with the jumpers/jerseysI mentioned to her that I had been making herbal mothball sachets this week & promised her the recipe(for eco ethel .. & for all of you) x0x0xHerbal Moth Sachets:-50 grams dried rosemary50 grams dried mint50 grams dried thyme25 grams ginseng200 grams whole clovesmix together & place in squares of muslinI also add a good handful of dried lavender to my mixture + the ginseng I buy as a tea (or teabags) from Health Food Shops.Hopefully this will help keep the moths out of your woollens & not leave that nasty napthalene smell that mothballs seem toWell friends I have another box of soaps arrived that need labels made for themThe house is quiet & I am burning my Apple Spice Wax Melt - so it smells like someone is cooking delicious baking ...which - unfortunately . . .  they are not ! ! !And this lot awaits me on my dining room floor - which I need to finish before the Mr arrives home  :-)\"Works-in-progress\" which I shall show you next post.Have a wonderful week filled with only good things,thanks so much for your visits   :-)much love/hugs/friendship to you allJulie x0x0x"},

I gardened outside in a t-shirt (Yes I Did in fact, have trousers on too!!)  ... the sky was so blue & clearOn the days when the weather was lovely, I felt like doing outdoorsy things ... walking past my old table & chairs I decided it needed a freshen up ... I remembered having some old testpots in the back of the cupboard somewhere ...by adding a touch of water to the mix ... I had just enough& was so pleased with the improvement  :-)(when purchased, they were white, then they went dark green for a few years, now \" Hot Chilli\")However on those cold days, it was indoor activities for sure ...I only had 2 blue owls left in the Cottage so out came the blanket stash again ...  another \"Parliament of Owls\" came to life ...No you are not seeing things, yes there are 2 the same ... 1 is a gift for a friend far awayI was especially taken with this little fellow ... I had not used this blanket before ... quite a bit of retro going on ...Especially loved the \"poppy wings\"   :-)Incidently, the doilies I have used to embellish their tummies, if you look closely at my Op Shop purchases from my last post (below) you will see the bottom left corner doiley ... I simply cut out the individual crochet \"flowers\" & used some of them up ...This stitchery had been completed several months back & sat in \"the pile\"Finally I made it up into a cushion ... it is a Country Gate Crossing design & was bought out of a clearance bin many moons ago ... I decided to use some of my Lynette Anderson wooden buttons to embellish it ...I loved this pattern for two reasons ... firstly, it was a preprinted panel (dont you just LOVE those) & secondly, I love anything flower or garden related   :-)Also sitting in \"the pile\" was this stitchery ... also completed many months ago & never quite made up into anythingThis was another bargain bin purchase - a pattern from \"You are Special/Sami's Stitchery's\" - I made this one into a wallhanging & added a wire hanger I had in my stashI decided not to tea-dye the centre panel as it was a lovely lineny osnaberg fabric & it seemed a shame to detract from thisNote to self . . .  clean moss off brick paths ! ! !The garden is \"unfolding\" as spring kicks in ... twice this past week customers have commented on my grannys bonnets (acquilegia) ... \"oh you have these weeds too do you ??!!\"  . . .  well (to climb up on my soap box for a minute here) ... to me, they are Not Weeds ... I adore them   :-)And I save the seeds of the different coloured ones, & sprinkle them round in other places of my garden ... just because something chooses to pop up in the cracks of your concrete ... doesn't make it a \"weed\" in my book !!!!!slooowwly coming to life . . . Its okay everyone  ... I'll climb down now . . .Finally folks, after my \"slip\" last post down the steps, I had to go one better...I actually fell right through the deck of my cottage this week ... now honestly ... I know I could do to lose a few kilo's but for goodness sake . . . I am Hardly an elephant !!!Yes the boards were rather rotten but all I could think of (once I had hauled myself out of the garden & dusted myself off) was \"thank goodness it was me - & not the little old lady customer I had the day before!!!!\"So the moral of the story is . . .  if you need to lose a few kilo's & are having trouble finding the motivation ... try falling thru your deck & that'll kick start your weight loss campaign well & good!!!Our builder Daniel is coming this week to replace several decking boards I am pleased to adviseI am off to walk myself round the local Domain Park - thanks so much for your visit - do hope the coming week is filled with good things for us all . . . Cheerio for now folks,much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x(p.s  do let me know if you would like any grannys bonnet seeds ...

I managed to do both this quick trip  :-)(a footnote for my overseas readers ... here in New Zealand we call thrift shops Op Shops, which is derived from the word \"opportunity\")Beautiful Mount Egmont ... I grew up thinking everyone had a mountain out their bedroom window(yes I know they now call it Mount Taranaki but NOT me . . . . )These are the doilies I managed to acquire on my Op Shop foraging(I have yet to soak & wash them)plus the gorgeous vintage sheet they are resting on was an Op Shop find for $1Now before I go on, you really must pop on over to here & read eco ethel's post on joining her B.A.D. club  ...  I think this is a great idea & I am sure there are many out there who would want to \"join\" ... eco ethel is a girl after my own heart ... she just loves a doiley,  or two,  or three . . . These little vintage cut crystal salt & pepper shakers were another Op Shop find . .  .  since returning home I have filled them with vintage buttons & decorated them for the Cottage (VERY tiny vintage buttons for the taller pair I might add !!!!!)While I was at Mums I managed to decorate this horseshoe for my son & his partner Sarah who are getting wed in my garden in late NovemberWoops . . .  hope Sarah isnt reading this blog post ???!!!I cover real aluminium horseshoes (like they use on race horses) ... (a dear old soul in his 90's gives them to me as he spends his days hanging out at the racing stables)I wasnt able to find any silver letters anywhere - I usually buy these from cake decorating shops - I had neither the time nor the energy to traipse all over Hamilton City searching,  so I bought gold ones & found my can of spray paint worked perfectly fine as far as I could see . . . Visiting with Claire . . .  always such a buzz & an inspiration - I am never disappointed, in fact her home has popped up a few times on my blog posts . . .this is what greets you as you knock on the door ...One of Claires creations - \"dont open the door\" I yelled to her \"I am drooling\"  she had recently made a new quilt & it was hanging on the wall ...my photo does NOT do it justice - it was stunningClaire had been redecorating her t.v. room in quite a masculine theme as this was her husbands lounge mainly  I just fell in love with her handmade plant holdersI am seriously hunting for the Mr's old wooden rulers now !!!!!!!!!!Op Shop belts  -  I LOVED this one - simple but effectiveClaires Country RoomI know that  Michelle has posted about Claires country room here before ... & in fact,  lots of Claires creations as they belong to the same craft group - a very talented bunch of ladiesYou have to look in every little corner, nook & crannyThe window seat - where I sat dribbling !!!Claires new vintage table filled with birthday gifts & treasuresLastly, this was in her entrance hall - my photo has chopped the top of it off (unfortunately) but it was a torso she had made from chicken mesh wire & stuffed the \"skirt\" with old dressmaking pattern tissue, then fashioned a light bulb inside so the whole shape lit up at nights ... it was just beautiful (& amazing) & I could imagine how stunning it would look glowing at night ...* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Now for the tale of the footstool ... on my last visit to Mums back in April I rescued acquired this old footstool from the Hospice Shop for the princely sum of $4I unpicked the cover (which took hours & contained about a million staples), removed the 4 \"feet\" then when I was doing some of my paint revamps, they got a sand & a quick wax/coat of paintAfter all my patching & piecing with my doilies & linens back here, I decided that I would like to make a patched doiley cover for the top ... to be honest I didnt know what to cover it with but this look just kind of appealed to methe long rectangle piece on the left is actually a vintage pillowcaseI am so thrilled with my $4 stool \"revamp\" . . .  naturally the Mr has been forbidden to stick his grubby cowshed socks on top of it !!!!And then just this morning - slipping on our very wet steps, hurting my derrier & my back, feeling rather sorry for myself, hobbling out to the mailbox, licking my wounds . . .  a package ?????   to me ?????beautiful soft hand-crocheted heart mats in the palest shade of bluesa surprise from a dear friend across the miles . . .  a blogging friend - sore back & posterior forgotten :-)    So beautiful, such a lovely thought - thank you so much dear AmyWishing you all a wonderful weekend - thanks so much for being patient with me through this rather lengthy post - hope you enjoyed all the eye candymuch love/hugs/friendship to you all,.Julie x0x0x"},

I decided to make them up into cushions using some of my wool blanket stash ...After a soak & a wash, the doilies were in immaculate condition...Someones beautifully detailed handwork from many years ago ...I added some of my bakelite buttons to the top of this oneThis little angel set has been finished & appliqued,  & is ready for the Cottage ...A double-ender potholder & a single oven mittThis lovely little panel with a  Mabel Lucie Attwell design was in the bottom of the rubbish bags I squirrelled home after helping my friend shift last month ...

{"title": "Its Spring :-)", "date": "Friday, September 6, 2013", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,My favourite season has arrived . . .  spring.I love spring  ...  to me it is the season of \"hope\" ...   after the winter it makes me feel full of hope when I see my plants & bulbs peep through the soil & rear their heads again Although our winters here are getting milder, it still fills me with hope when things come into bloom againMy magnolia is in full bloom & I can enjoy it from my dining-room windowMy young friend Rebecca is having her first baby & they have found out it is going to be a boy - they have decided to name him TobyAs I knew she was a golly lover I decided to make her a golly for her baby shower gift ... I knew just the pattern too I chose Tobias -  a Melody Daly design out of the Handmade Magazine I decided to do a \"kiwiana themed golly\" as I knew Rebecca loved this particular buzzy bee fabricHis top is a lovely soft polar fleece that I already had in my stashI stitched his name on with beads but (should they decide NOT to name him Toby) they can be unstitched easilyWhile I was making him up I made 2 extra bodies to have as stock for the CottageI did one as a boy & then the same body,  but dressed as a girlLast year I did this pink colourway, but I have not used this boy golly fabric for the boy before ... I was really pleased with the end result (& especially delighted that I found my bumble bee buttons which matched the bow tie fabric perfectly!!)taken before the stylist came along & did her hair properly !!!!!I gave her a toy to hold, but he just gets to hold her handThis giraffe had browny coloured dots on its body so when I wanted to change them to hot pink, I simply held my hair dryer against each one & it loosened it .... you may already know this tip, but some of you may not ... I use this method for loosening the glue on lots of things & find it works very well  :-)After reading this particular post from Raewyn I decided to use some of my flybuys rewards points to buy the Rosemary McLeod book for myself ... I had coveted it for quite sometime but it was rather expensive to purchaseI haven't found time to read it thoroughly yet but a couple of patterns that really caught my eye were these ...a gorgeous vintage stitched apron . . . & I thought this applique picture (above) was just beautiful I was lucky enough to catch up with some lovely friends last weekend & this is the surprise gift they gave me ... have you seen these ??They are called Tili Jars ... & they have 1001 uses (apparently)I just adore it ... as soon as I opened it I immediately thought \"red buttons\"  . . .  but now I am thinking perhaps red jaffa lollies ??!!   But I am not too sure how long they will remain in the jar (knowing my willpower - or lack of)!!!Finally to share with you something just a little bit personal ...\"Sometimes in the middle of an ordinary day ... life gives us a fairy tale ...\"When I was 27 years old I found myself with a broken marriage & 2 young sons to raise on my own ... to say that they were difficult years would be an understatement ... sometimes it felt like it was all uphill. When my boys grew into teenagers they pushed hard against every single boundary I set them. Somedays I think we just got by on pretty much \"a wing & a prayer\"my son laughs at this old picture \"Oh Mum your so 80's - look at your fashions\" he saysSome people wish for great & wonderful things for their children ... I did not.   I never wanted my sons to rule the world or become rocket scientists ... I simply wanted them to grow into decent young men who were good & kind to others & to each other & to themselves ... & most of all, I wanted them to be happy.My youngest son (above) & his lovely partner have been saving for what seems like forever to do a trip to Europe for 6 weeks - it feels like they have been poor for a very long time.  On Sunday they flew to Paris & on Wednesday he proposed to her in that wonderful city of love ... my heart is bursting with happiness & joy for them both - he told me before he left he had found the one he wants to grow old with ... what more can he ask for?And my eldest son is getting married in my garden in late November to his lovely partner also.As their Mum, what more can I ask for??Thanks for letting me share that with you all.The Mr's old work boots, now growing moss & planted with polyanthus ... love the little foxglove self-seeded into the crack where the lace-up was.Have a great weekend dear friends sending wishes of happiness to you all - thanks for popping by - your visits make my day  :-)much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x"},

I just smiled ... I have been called worse !!!!I have had 2 orders for my vintage linen table runners so decided to make 3 to have one for the cottage againI very much enjoy re-using the old linens & doileys & always think about the women who made them & what they would've been thinking as they spent all those hours stitching away on them The Mr has learnt by now, when he comes home in the evening, invariably he will have to tiptoe his way to the lounge - he is used to me by now & doesn't complain ...  (much!!!)I love the patching & piecing of making these runners - adding bits of lace here & there - they are not perfect as they have that slightly time-worn vintage appeal with their little faults & blemishesThis particular doiley (below),I almost could not bear to part with ... I just adored the flowery sails on the shipSeeing the 3 together made me think, what a beautiful bed quilt they would make ... so I lay them out on my bed to get the general effect ...Hmmm ... maybe that will be a project for another day  . . . ???!!!I also completed an order for an Isabella Golly - imagine coming out in the morning all bleary eyed to be greeted by this sight on your breakfast table . . . Good morning . . .  whats for breakfast ?How could you not feel cheerful looking at those little faces holding their teds :-)So 2 more orders left on the list, & as one is not needed til christmas  I am hoping to get back to making some new stock for the cottageThese wooden pegs had been sitting in this container for many months - since I had made one for my friend Claire way back here  - they were waiting to be made into peg garlands for the CottageI decided to leave one lot stained & not paint them, to make more of a prim/country-style garlandDo you have a favourite??I just love old wooden pegs - I love the differing shapes of them all . . .  speaking of which . . .  this just might have appeared in the post last week . . .  it just might have been a trademe purchase !!!Quite a few peg garlands there I think !!!!I cant actually print what the Mr's comment was !!!!Hope you have found some time to \"tread gently, be thrifty or live simply\" this past week folksthanks so much for your time & for stopping bymuch love/hugs/friendshipJulie x0x0x"},

I was thinking about the beautiful jar covers that so many crafters make, often gorgeous crocheted ones like my friend Amy makes here ... & how much I loved them ... & this idea popped into my head ...why not make one using wool blanket offcuts & blanket stitch the edges ??add some crochet flowers (purchased ones because we wont discuss my efforts to learn to crochet today??!!!)add a tag & some lace & a pearl button or 2 ...perhaps add a doiley ...Just Lovely :-)   don't you think??A group of ladies in my neighbourhood meet once a month for morning tea at each others homes ... this group is called \"good neighbours\" & has been going for over 30 years ... I try to get along whenever I can. Since I hadn't been to one since February I went this last week as I knew it was at Colleens place & I particularly love her garden & its setting ...Colleen & her husband would be in their late 70's I am guessing (sometimes you cant actually ASK these things)  They made the 3 ponds on their property themselves & have spent the past decade or more planting them out with natives & making bridges, walkways etc...Colleen plants her daffodil bulbs by the 100's - they were not quite in full bloom yetColleen commissioned my youngest son Kane to build her a small version of \"Threadbear Cottage\" to place beside one of the pondsI met this beautiful creature whose name is Elizabeth ...she is very friendly indeed ...Elizabeth had a mate - named Edward - but he died recently after becoming entangled in blackberry - it was very sadThese two last photos are especially for you Catherine ... because when I saw them I thought to myself ...\"Catherine would just love this\"I hope you enjoyed your little tour round Colleens garden folks ...

I also made sure all legs & arms were double-stitched plus hair stitched on etc ... I couldnt resist popping a little teddy in their hands :-)The 2nd picture that is making me rather joyfull is this ...\"Oh Yes - how very fascinating Julie - a patch of brown grass \"  you are saying ... but it is great because it shows I have finished another pile of mulch ... & this was a huge one too!!!!(I had 6 piles to do, now I only have 2 left!!)A couple of months ago my dear friend Catherine sent me a little parcel of fabric bits & pieces from her stash & I have slowly been using them up in my projectsThis beautiful doiley was amongst them & I decided to make myself a cushion using itIsnt the crinolene lady doiley just beautiful - thank you SO much CatherineOne of my aims hopes this year was to make a collection of wool blanket cushions for along my couch I think I might just have room for one more !!!???I had to take a trip to the city this week for some business & I popped into this rather interesting shopI know I have been complaining telling you lately how I am fast going through my vintage button stash ... well I knew they had a good selection in hereand I wasn't disappointed (I might add they had rather a good selection of interesting other things that were very tempting to bring home with me also .... but I was very brave)I dragged this poor old neglected trike out from under some bushes this week & gave it a good scrub upI usually plant it with pansies for the winter but am rather late doing these things this year for some reasonLast year it flowered right through into February for me ... so I am hopefull again this year  :-)Plus I think I am only going to get one more year before the bottom drops right out of my rusty old bucket - so fingers crossed it holds on in there !!!As I sit typing this my house smells so lovely - I had a large box of gorgeous handmade soaps arrive this morning to sell in the CottageI have been busy making little home-made labels to tie onto them with some jute - I liked the handmade charm they add to the soaps I think they look rather lovely on vintage plates in the Cottage - what do you think ??I couldn't chose a favourite - they all smell so wonderful - almost edible!!Finally, in the middle of this week I had the most wonderful surprise ... several months back I had accidently broken my favourite big red bowl that sat on my kitchen bench (actually the Mr broke it but we wont go into details !!!!)  I always give my broken china to my friend Jan as she does really beautiful mosaic work, which I sell in the Cottage.  Well Jan turned up with this ...This beautiful planter pot which she had made from my old red bowl + one of my polka dot coffee mugs I had broken quite sometime agoIt was a belated birthday gift as Jan has been overseas ... isnt it stunning ??? I was surprised & overjoyed.  Jan has planted it with white pansies so when they bloom, I will share it with you.(Incidently Jans daughter is my friend Sally - whose home I often share pics of - so you can see where Sallys talent comes from )Well folks I hope you have a great weekend - I am off to tidy up my extremely messy rather interesting sewing room - I have lost another leg (dollys that is!!!) in there somewhere & I need to find itIf anyone is peering closely at the screen & you spot a dollys leg, please let me know ... thanks so much for stopping by - take good care everyone :-)much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0"},

I was rushing as I wanted to post them away to herKerryn had done the most beautiful stitching on the aprons (I would very much like to take the credit myself but I'm afraid I cant)I ADORE the fabric Kerryn has used for the apron stitchery hereI think my most favourite (tho it was hard to chose) - was the darker one - I loved how she was ever so slightly primitive looking & I would never have put these fabrics together but I just loved the combination of them ...Sorry Winnie ... have chopped your head off a bit hereThe tea-dying was also much darker than my photography is doing justice to, but you get the general idea(Miss burgundy Winnie had a doiley in her hand & Miss blue Winnie did not ... but she was giving me \"the look\" so I found one & stitched it to her hand also !!!!!)(I must mention ... Kerryn was very happy with her 2 Winnies which arrived safely thru the post - I was happy (& relieved!!) that she was happy)This past week I sold 2 new things out of the Cottage which gave me much excitement !!!!

{"title": "The \"Befores\" & the \"not quite afters...\" !!!", "date": "Friday, June 28, 2013", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,This past fortnight has seen me somewhat disappear into the land of winter ills & chills..I have managed to fulfill my plan to paint my cottage walls,  but not without plenty of sweat & a few tears tooLast week the Mr very generously shared his nasty flu virus with me :-(By the weekend I was feeling ever so slightly improvedso I ... very stupidly ... painted the Cottage walls - twice!!The pics I am showing you above are the colour it was before.The colour is Marzipan & was a warm yellowy toning which would take on different shades in different lights & at differing times of the day.I did love it once . . .  but I wanted a fresh lighter look as it had been this colour for just over 7 years nowSo I chose Clotted Cream - a rich vintagey deep cream colourJust prior to painting - holes filled - all ready to goPlus I wanted to remove the gollies I had stencilled all around the walls - you can just see some above the bear shelf You can see from the above 2 pics the very narrow channel I had to move around inMy photos do not really show up its true deep richness unfortunately.And that dear readers .... is how it remains, as this week has seen me feeling so dreadful that I have had to take myself off to bed  & just rest & recuperate - which is exactly what I should've done in the 1st place!!An indication of how I have felt this past week !!!Painting the Cottage walls while running a temp & feeling unwell was kind of like . . .  well as I explained it to my friend Leeanne\"like trying to stuff an elephant into a walnut shell!!!\"Now for those of you that have done this before (stuffed an elephant into a walnut shell that is) then you will know exactly what I mean...but for those of you that havent ...well you can only imagine!!!!!Above are pictured some of my lovely new displays in the revamped Cottage!!!!!!!!!I am pleased to say I am now feeling on the mend :-)I did learn two very important things throughout this past week ...the 1st important thing I learnt was ...(1) when you feel unwell you need to listen to your body & rest & go to bed (like your Mum used to make you do when you were little & then you got better real quick) & all the other stuff whirring around in your head \"to do\" will still be there waiting for you when you are well again!!!the 2nd very  important thing I learnt was ...(2) Our bedroom ceiling could really do with a nice fresh coat of paint :-)  !!!!!!!!!!So as I sit & type this I must confess to fretting somewhat over all my poor ol' stock sitting stacked up in my sleepout ...but I figure that can be next weeks job ...Although I have done very little sewing while feeling like this (for some reason even the fabric felt heavy to hold on to) ... I did manage one completion before I caught the virus - when I made this lovely pink angel back in January I made two bodies ... So the 2nd little lady got dressed in blues - she is Charlotte Angel, a Rosalie Quinlan design - I love them both equally...Her lace collar is a vintage treasure from my friend Elaine + her button is also from my vintage stash - a gorgeous deep blue glass buttonHer basket was brown but I waved my paint brush over it + added a doileyI have found (from experience) that it pays to paint the fabric wings with Stiffy to prevent them from curling forward when she is hanging up(or even P.V.A. mixed with water would do the trick)And lastly, this precious little treasure arrived in todays post - I had actually purchased her sometime ago from my friend Donnas shop after I did this post I had planned another visit to bring her home but life kinda got in the way of things ... so Donna kindly posted her down to meI adore her :-)She is the work of Juliet Novena Sorrel whom (I think) is a Dunedin artistHer delicate face (& torso) are hand sculpturedShe is fragile, exquisite & delicate - I thought I would name her \"Petal\" or \"Rose Petal\"   ... what do you think ????I have to find just the perfect spot to hang her as yet.Well folks I am off to make a hot lemon, honey & ginger-root drink & read the latest Good Magazine (a Mothers Day subscription from my son)I hope you are warm or cool, wherever in the world you might bethanks so much for stopping by my \"pity party\"I look forward to showing you more Cottage pics next post.Much love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x"},

{"title": "Doing a very good thing", "date": "Wednesday, June 5, 2013", "text": "A rainy afternoon hello to you dear friends & readers,Well where did May disappear to I ask you??!!Over the long weekend I went out to visit with my eldest son Aaron & his lovely partner Sarah.(they live out in the country on a block of land about 35 minutes away from me)Last year Aaron & Sarah (after much homework),  began a \"chook project\" This involved them purchasing chooks from Battery Hen Farms & undertaking to \"rehabilitate\" them & then sell them on as free-range laying hens.At approx 12 -13 months old the battery hens are considered to be past their best \"point of lay\" & so they are \"moved on\"It is at this age that Sarah & Aaron are able to purchase them for $4.00 each - they arrive in varying states of health - mostly they have no feathers left & all need their nails clipping as they have grown around the wires of their cages The chooks do not know how to walk normally as they have spent their entire lives in cages up to this pointOnce their nails are clipped, they then have to learn to walk properly (& out on grass), eat & drink, & generally act like a normal free-range chook does. When they undertook this project Sarah & Aaron had commissioned a lovely large purpose-built chook house for them plus they fenced off an area of their land for the chooks to live in.Aaron feeding them pelletsOnce it became apparent that some of the chooks needed to be separated from the others as some came with very \"special needs\", then they fenced off another area & built a smaller chook house for these \"special needs chooks\"slowly their feathers begin to grow back as their health improves & their combs turn from pale pink to redHere is a picture of some of them - we have Hoppy (came with a broken leg), Dot (wouldn't mix with/ timid around any other chooks) & Karate Kid (very aggressive with other chooks)  (yes I must confess to becoming slightly alarmed when they named them all!!!)Then we have the lovely Beaky . . . You can see how she got her name - she was born with a deformed beak & has struggled to eat properly all her life - so Sarah discovered she likes her pellets made into a sloppy mash & she has her own special chair so she can eat up away from the others . . . Beaky has absolutely thrived & gone from being such a scared timid chook - to being so friendly & always right there looking what you are doing . . .  quite the nosey parker.(since starting this post Beaky has found a lovely new owner & is very settled in)I must confess that I simply imagined that the chooks would all arrive, settle into their new homes & think \"wow - this is what heaven must feel like - green grass, food on tap etc etc\"However ... this has not been the case ...They are quite traumatised when they arrive & often very aggressive & pick on each other & I guess, are so used to just fighting to surviveOften they come with lots of illnesses that have gone undetected til now - or if detected, then left untreatedThis involves often a course of medication & so they have to be kept that much longer before being able to be rehomedThe treated ones eggs cannot be sold either - at least until they have finished their medication(this pic was taken last year when Mum was visiting)Aaron & Sarah both have careers that involve long working hours - so I asked Sarah why she undertook such a time-consuming project?her answer was simple . . .\"everyone should do their little bit to make the world a better place\"She is sooo right :-)Why - hello there !!!!!There are some other \"folks\" that I very much enjoy visiting with when I go out there tooLittle Feebie in her basket (an abandoned dog Sarah rescued a few years ago)Aaron & Sarah have 4 female dogs & 1 male cat (Sonic)Let me put it this way ....  if I had to be someones pet ...  please Lord let me get to live at their house...I know you are not supposed to have favourites but this girl in particular,  melts my heartMina is a Neopolitan Mastiffthis is Mina (ming, she is sometimes called) - I just adore her & have known her since she was a tiny new puppysuch a sad face but such a happy lifeshe frequently has slobber over herthere are other stars too ...They have 2 Black Russian Terriers - Mischa & Nika - I can hardly tell them apart but they would not pose for a photo together for me (I have known them since tiny new puppies also)& Sonic the cat was asleep in the hot water cupboard & not posing for the camera that day :-)Nika was always the \"runt\" of the litter but she has grown up to be an incredibly intelligent dog & so protectiveThis photo greeting was in my inbox the other morning & quite made my dayLook at those beautiful brown eyes :-)Its always a pleasure visiting with them all - adults + pets alike :-)I always drive home with a smile on my face & a warm feeling in my heartI am so proud of the \"difference\" they are making in their little part of the world.And as for craft related pursuits . . .I managed to top up the old leather suitcase that I display all my wool blanket cats & rabbits in this past week(I have sold a few lately & it was looking depleted)I very much enjoy making these wee crittersSometimes I have runs on selling mostly cats ...then other times of selling only rabbits !!!???I also made 2 cushions while I had the wool blankets out...the larger size one was only intended to have a ruffle across the topbut I decided - when finished - it looked too plain so I added the red  wool heart which I blanket stitched on by handthe stripey blue one was the result of a picture I had seen awhile ago on pinterest& really loved the tiny buttons stitched in a heart design & framed as a pictureSo I put my own version together, stitched them onto Osnaberg & made up into a cushionBoth cushions were meant for the Cottage but I am finding myself rather partial to the blue one & rather like it sitting on my couch with my other 2 blanket cushions . . . Incidently the blue striped blanket was bought from the Op Shop in the \"pet blankets bin\" for $3.00!!!  In a filthy state but its amazing how a good soak in Napisan & some sunshine can do wonders :-)I hope you have found some creativity or some me-time in your week folks as winter sets in here in our little corner of the world.Thanks so much for taking the time to stop by & \"see me\"I do so appreciate your visits.Wishing you all a great week aheadmuch love/hugs/friendship,Julie x0x0x"},

February  :-)And where did January go to I might ask???!!!  I was looking back through some older posts - in particular, this one picture ...frosts in June & I realised I am always complaining about the weather!!!So I promise - no more complaining :-)I shall enjoy the seasons whatever they bring ...(tho some of THIS would sure be welcome about right now!!!)  Rain, that is - & gosh look at that green, green grass!!!  As the Lavender farm around from me have harvested their flowers this past weekI decided I had better do the sameWith having over 40 bushes to prune it is rather a large jobbut I am pleased to report I am almost finished :-) It has been so hot I havent even hung them in bunches to dryjust left them sitting in cane trays in the sunNow all I have left is the rubbings to do which is time consuming but rather nice on the senses . . .   I have been trying to stay on track with my resolution to use whatever I have on hand & NOT buy new craft suppliesI pulled this out of the pile last week - I think it was an Op Shop purchase from a long time ago in amongst a pile of doilies  An old cross stitch of a cow and it looks like someone had sewed bias binding around it at some stage - perhaps it had been framed?So I unpicked the bias & carefully washed the aida cloththen I gave it a new surrounding & made it into a little cushion... which I think turned out rather nice :-) It has been a bit of a cushion making week really...this was another revamp ... it had been in a frame It is a Country Friends stitchery panel done by me many years agoI took it out of the frame (as it had never sold in the Cottage)& stitched it onto some felt borders,added some buttons, then onto a nice piece of ticking fabric,& another cushion was born . . .  I have always loved this Wendy Briggs angel design ...     And then thirdly, while shopping in my local Patchwork Shopjust prior to christmas, the owner was throwing some fabric swatch samples in the bin - she saw me & threw them at me instead\"you can do something with these\" she saidI soon snapped them up as they were Lynette Andersons designsI stitched the 9 squares together & then framed them with a fat 1/4 of Lynettes fabric that I already hadit began its life as a patchwork table mat & then along the way...it morphed into a cushion :-)  Also another completion was this Ruby Doll - remember this version I made last winter??this is a Rosalie Quinlan design out of the Homespun Magazine  Well I found I had made 2 bodies at the same timeso Ruby II got some clothes this week . . .   Ruby I has already gone to live in a very nice home :-) Lastly I pulled these 4 china mugs out of the back of my craftroom cupboard the other day& decided to make them into the pincushions that I usually make in the china teacups - coffee mugs can be just as nice !!  I was rather pleased with the result  - the mugs were in such good condition - I weighted them first with about 1/4 cup fine gravel   Sometimes February can be a quiet month at the Cottagewith school going back & the Lavender farm having harvestedThough I have already taken 2 group bookings this morning :-)It is good to have a chance to catch your breath a bit& maybe try some new patterns out -I am keen to do some more things out of this book . . .  I shall keep you posted friends. In the meantime, have a lovely weekend all of youlets hope its a creative one where ever you are ...& remember this little verse I have on my fridge ...(so I get to read it lots of times throughout my day!!) Given to me by my friend Sally :-)It is most certainly true.(The Mr has just come along & read my draft post & has commented ...\"why dont you just write \"this week I made 3 cushions ... why do you have to make such a saga of it all - people dont want to know all that hoohaa\" ...\"  hmmm, an interesting thought I guess but I LOVE to read all the hoohaa behind other peoples creations & so ... I hope they do too with mine)???!!!  Cheerio for today folks,Much love/hugs/friendship,Julie Xoxo ﻿"},

{"title": "A little bit about me . . . ", "date": "Saturday, October 13, 2012", "text": "Hello there friends & readers, Today it is pouring with rain here, we have just had a 2 hour power cut & I am sure the rain is coming down sideways! !I looked out the lounge window & this is the poor cows in the house paddock, trying to bunch up to get some shelter! ! And further along, past the clothes-line. . .  I commented to \"the Mr\" that I felt so sorry for them.\"Oh\" he said \"shall I phone the farmer & tell him not to put the cows in the house paddock when the weathers bad as you find it distressing??\" ! ! !\"Oh - could you \"  I askedI cant print what his reply was ! ! ! :-(      I saw the fat fluffy looking thru the glass doors at me - resembling a (rather large) drowned rat . . .I took pity on him & let him in . . .    After my last couple of posts I have had a few emails with readers asking me \"what is it that you actually DO at Threadbear Cottage??\"So I apologise for being rather \"vague\" & wanted to explain a little bit about what I do here & how I got started.(I promise to try to give you the \"short version\")  In 2006 I fell out of a hammock down by our pond & broke my neck.I fractured C2 - commonly known as the \"hangmans fracture\".The bone took a long, long time to mend - 18 months in fact.During that time Graham (the Mr) & my youngest son, Kane, decided to build me this rustic little cottage which was intended to be a sewing room for me.  It was through the encouragement of my creative friends that a little craft cottage \"evolved\" from this.It had long been a dream of mine to have a little \"shop\" at our property here.To say this was built from scraps would be an understatement.We had a budget of $0 ! !It was built from \"scrap\"wood that was exchanged for some work the Mr had done for a man who milled timber.The windows were out of an old shed of ours.When I set the inside up, I used furniture from my house.And so, . . .  Threadbear Cottage was born :-)  I should add at this point . . . while I had something else to think (worry) about - rather than my neck, the bone began to mend at last :-)This was (thankfully), right at the point the specialist was going to take bone from my hip to fuse the break.Amazing what a bit of \"diversion\" can do.   And so I kind of developed the garden around the cottage as you have to cross our property to get to the cottage itself.My garden is - & always will be - a work in progress.It continues to grow (like Topsy) . . .  The tree in the background was where the hammock was hung   Though I do love to share it with people.I feel that gardens should be \"shared\"Not hidden away just for you to enjoy. My Paulonia tree in bloom - taken from the deck    I took the above photo yesterday as I never get to snap this tree in flower.Then I finished mowing the lawns & took the next picture 1 hour later. . .Can you believe, I have (stupidly) raked all these flowers up when I have a group coming !!?? (you dont have to comment on this!! I can HEAR you) Anyway, I open the cottage for customers who are passing by but I also have groups come - buses, garden clubs, ladies groups who sometimes have their meetings in the garden & I have had the odd vintage car or classic car club going through on a \"run\".They come & (sometimes) shop & often bring their lunch or morning or afternoon teas & have here.We had some friends use it once for their wedding :-) I love people to use the area.Though I must admit here a little secret. . . we have had a few disasters ! !Mostly weather related, & the odd naughty child :-(I have had a few vehicles break down but by far the worst thing that happens is when . . . people bring naughty dogs ! ! (yep they actually do!!)And of course you can imagine Mr Fat Fluffy when this happens. . .  Anyway, this was supposed to be a \"short version\"(sorry)I have my handcrafts for sale plus I have several friends work alsoI have my friends soap & skincare range that I posted about back in March.I have my mums knitting (gollies & baby knitting)Hello, here we all are in our babys bath :-)  I have a friends jams & chutneys,my friend Donnas felting work,my friends home-made cards,  These are old pics - taken a couple of years ago    I have my friends Mums beautiful fine mosaic work.The above are just a few older shots as my camera is not behaving itself at the moment. The reason I began my blog (apart from the fact that I am a little \"obsessed\" with reading blogs), is to keep some sort of journal of the happenings here at the cottage & also some record of the things I make as I often forget to photograph them.I was hesitant in the beginning to reveal too much as I didnt want folk to think I was kind of saying \"look at me & all that I do\"However, it was the very kind Betty from herehttp://betty-thewoodfairy.blogspot.co.nz/   that pointed out to me \"it is more about sharing of things with fellow bloggers, ideas, tips etc - kind of come & join me for a chat\"rather than \"look at me\"  - so thankyou Betty for making me realise& look at it this way instead.  I hope you have enjoyed your little \"tour\" of the cottage folks - thanks so much for listening to my ramblings.(I have sure jumped around a bit this post - sorry) The only crafty thing I have achieved this past week is to fill these lovely little wire baskets I came across in the back of my cupboard:  Small, medium & large          I thought they would look lovely with my citrus potpourri in them so filled them to the brim . . .  Orange & Clove scent - delicious  And finally, a little Op Shop find last weeka lovely little powder bowl for the princely sum of $2.00  Wishing you all a lovely weekend folks - wishing you sunshine & flowers wherever you are . . .   Thanks again for stopping byLove Julie & Mr Wolf  x o x oYou are all very special to My Mum   X x x"},
{"title": "Not a bike collection", "date": "Thursday, October 4, 2012", "text": "Hello dear friends & readers,A lady wandered up the driveway to the cottage last week in the spring sunshine.\"hello\" I went out to greet her...\"Oh hello \" she said -  \"you collect bikes\"\"No??\" I replied . . .  \"Oh but yes you do\" she said, look how many you have around your garden !!!\" . . . So we chatted about spring & gardens in general & she had a browse & I walked her back to her car.When she had driven off, I decided to have a serious look at this \"so-called\" bike collection . . .Well, I mean to say  . . .  whats one ol' bike sitting under the tree where you park ??? As I walked around the 1st corner of the driveway I did spot an old rusty trike in the undergrowth but it was hardly noticeable . . .if you can hardly see it,  it doesnt really count does it????!!!!I do \"happen\" to have a trike on my deck which I sometimes use for children to ride on to occupy them while their mums are shopping...As you walk past the deck there is another old planter-style bike once again, hiding in the growth . . . (so doesn't really count)Then on the lawn, we have the old trike that I planted back in the       winter which is now full of colour . . . As you cross the cobbles to the cottage pathway, there might be is another old derelict bike which has a basket planted but is - like everything outside at present - covered in little pink/white blossom flowers - these spring winds we have make the lawn look like it is dotted with pink/white marshmellows lately . . .Then - just recently - I was thinking of have moved a bike onto the deck of the cottage & planted a little side basket on its carrier, which I hope will soon be overflowing with flowers & prettiness . . . Not to mention (of course), there might be is the odd bike on the wall . . . Now I ask you friends . . .  would you call that a \"bike collection\" ?????    She was slightly mistaken don't you think ??? A bit of an over-exaggeration on her part????  :-) (or perhaps a bit of denial on mine)The garden is coming to life at last & some of my old-time favourites are coming into bloom -iris's flowering by the pond - grown from a cutting  I Love grannybonnets - one of my absolute favourites & love that they just self seed everywhere . . . Even the vege garden is showing some life & I have also been planting lots of summer salad veges . . .   A friend bought me some blankets that she needed edging with blanket stitch & they came in this little plastic carry-all bag - she said I could keep the bag & it has made the most wonderful little \"mini greenhouse\" to raise some seedlings in  . . .Amazing what a bit of improvising can do There has not been alot of crafting going on inside - truth be told I have felt sooo tired of late - the change in seasons perhaps & also we have daylight saving which has begun here in New Zealand & I have felt tired & unfit & notice my summer clothes from last summer appear to have \"shrunk\" somewhat !!!???  (I knew that soap powder I was washing them in would do that to them!!!)I have finished making up a batch of citrus potpourri though & have been bagging it up along with my country garden potpourri as have a large group due next week & always like to have fresh stock of potpourri in the cottage   Needless to say, the house smelt delicious -& finally folks, Mr big Fat Fluffy has found himself in a bit of \"trouble\" this past week - what with digging & burying, & generally \"sitting\" on precious plants etc (believe me, not alot survives when that big fat fluffy thing parks himself on top) - but theres not alot bothers him now & when he gets a telling off from Mum (never Dad) he just closes his eyes & pokes his tongue out at the world & everything in general . . .that stupid ol' Mum yelling at me like that - who does she think she is . . .  tomorrow I'll sit on another plant!!Maybe we should all take a leaf out of his book ???Wishing you a wonderful rest of the week dear folks - thanks as always for stopping by :-)Love/hugs/friendship,  Julie (& Mr poke-your-tongue-at-the-world Wolf)  xox"},
{"title": "A bit of spring insanity :-)", "date": "Saturday, September 22, 2012", "text": "Hello dear friends and readers,Do hope you are having a great week out there :-)At the beginning of this week Mr Wolf & I sat outside in the lukewarm spring sunshine and looked long and hard at the garden . . .\"Mr Wolf\"  I said . . .  \"the garden after the winter,  is a  MESS ! ! ! \" He nodded & agreed wholeheartedly with me.  \"You know what Mr Wolf\"   I said -  \" my first groups start next week & just look at it ! ! \"  He nodded again & gave me that sideways look he always does . . . \"I think Mr Wolf, that it is just as well that I don't charge the groups to come here,  because . . .  they would most CERTAINLY  -  want their money back !!\"More nodding & sideways glancing from the fat fluffy.    Then he gave me that squinty \"what are you going to do about it\"  look . . .And so we got off our chuffs &  went a little bit crazy & had a bit of a \"spring clean up\"  . . . to slightly rephrase that a tad  - ONE of us went a little crazy while the other one supervised & made sure I didnt miss any bits . . .(which is a very important role I might add) Supervising from my blanket with my eyes closed . . .  you missed some over there Mum ! !The garden got weeded (in some parts)  & it was amazing what I uncovered under the umbrella of weeds - some lovely spring things coming back to life after the winter . . .In this area, there were 2 Pot People perched on tree trunks,  & after weeding the area around them  . . .  their baby appeared - he had been hiding under the weeds . . .One of the groups phoned to say they would like to bring their afternoon tea & have on the deck area - Oh great I thought . . .  I wasnt planning on cleaning that area just yet ! !So I set to work & scrubbed & cleaned & de- cobwebbed (is that a word ???) . . .The candlelabra got scrubbed tooThe steps got scrubbed & lost their \"green grungy\" look . . .The cushions got a wash & a freshen up & even the bunting got washed & ironed & hung up to blow in the spring breeze  . . .The welcome bunting had actually gone \"missing\" & was found up in the guttering rather wet & soggy- looking & unloved.The window baskets got freshly planted with some potted colour  -(impatiens/busy lizzies) -  & Cedric - (my scarecrow) got a new (2nd hand) set of clothes from the Op Shop & a new scarf & hanky for his pocket . .- quite a transformation (I should've taken a \"before\" photo) . . . Amazing what a fresh set of clothes can do for a tatty ol' chap isnt it??!!The signs got a polish upEven the pets graves got a spruce up, weeded, & some freshly picked flowers to adorn them . . .To say I went like a \"lunatic\" would be an understatement, but I feel much happier (& less pressured) now that I have made some progress   - of course, there are still loads of areas I havent touched yet but I will try & deter the groups from those areas,  & as any true gardener will know, it is never ALL finished . . .  there is always more to be done  . . .  (well in my garden this is definately the case)An area needing some attention - just hang up a sign, smile - & walk away ! !  (could actually do with several more of these signs for parts of the garden I might add ! !)Needless to say there has been no crafting getting done - although I did manage to dehydrate a fresh batch of oranges to make some more of my citrus potpourri next week - this was done rather late at night while the rest of the house was sleeping . . .All dried & ready for using . . .  smells divine too  . . . I also strung up some of last years gourds that I had dried & given a good scrub - this is not a very clear photo - think I need to hang them against a dark (or plain) coloured background to show them up properly - I was really pleased how they came up & its amazing how you can be quite rough when scrubbing them & they are remarkably tough little things  . . .LOVE the warty onesThat about sums up my week folks but before I go I just wanted to share with you one of my absolute favourite things in the whole world . . .   my cherry blossom tree . . . (prunus awanui)Standing at my kitchen sink looking to the right out the french doors . . .  I never tire of this viewI actually have some tuis living in the blossom trees - I wake up to their sounds & I try to really listen & appreciate them as I know they wont always be there - they are feasting on the berries in the trees & also mating (I think) - a customer told me they like me to talk to them but not to try to imitate their sounds (??!!!) - how she knew this I don't know - my camera is not modern enough for me to get a decent photo of them but I LOVE them & their sounds . . .Hope your weekend is filled with only good things folks, thanks for stopping by & listening to my ramblings & joining me on a little tour of (the tidier bits) of my garden.  May the sun keep shining for us all.Love/hugs/friendship,Julie (& Mr Wolf)  XxXxXx(a little footnote  . . .  the 1st garden group came this morning  - they were running really late - looked in the cottage, didnt even LOOK at any of the garden - but gave me a lovely date loaf so all is forgiven)"},
{"title": "Missing in Action", "date": "Friday, September 14, 2012", "text": "Hello friends,How are you all doing??  I apologise for having been \"missing in action\" these past couple of weeks - I have been helping out in a shop in town which was supposed to be 1 1/2 days per week while my friend (the shop owner),  was overseas - however the lady that I was supposed to be \"helping\" got taken to hospital and I was \"it\" 5 1/2 days per week.   Not really how I wanted to spend my time but however . . .I wanted to share these couple of pics to show you what a difference a week can make - I took them exactly one week after the pics I took for my last blog post - my magnolia coming into bloom and my tulips . . . Now both in full bloom and the magnolia is looking very brown after our 2 frosts this past week. I have been burning the midnight oil trying to get some stock finished for the cottage while working during the day - my neighbour commented my lights were on very late the other night - I completed this little Miss Matryoshka to get in the post to a friend for her birthday . . .  (a little late but it did arrive eventually !!)After 4 pm the shop would go very quiet so I managed to get a bit of knitting done, & some dishcloths finished (while waiting for 5 o'clock to roll round)  . . .  The pale green wool is actually scented with the fragrance Aloe Vera - I am not sure how many washes it will last for but it does smell very beautiful.I have been wanting to make some more \"Miss Alice\" dolls for the cottage - she is a Mogs Design pattern that I do love - here is my Miss Alice sitting in my dining room . . . I had some patchwork fabric for their jackets already so decided to make a pink/blue one and another in red colourings -Often when I talk about her I forget to call her Miss Alice & call her Old Quilts (she does'nt usually object)  - she comes completewith a story in the pattern all about how her jacket is made from Grandmas old quilt - I always photocopy it & include it with her when I make her  . . .Also I was able to purchase some extra long cinnamon sticks so decided to make some more of my cinnamon \"bundles\" again - they smell divine ! !Their fragrances are Sandalwood & Cranberry - go on - have a big sniff  . . . Lastly, this was a doll I had made the body for awhile ago and finally got around to making her clothes (as is typical of me) - she is a Rosalie Quinlan pattern that was published in an old Homespun magazine - her name is Ruby and the words on her tag said \"dear mummy I love you\" but I have changed it to \"we love you\"  - she hangs from a door handle or a hook on the wall & her apron is an old doiley (I do so love little Ruby) . . .                                         (not very clear photo - my apologies)Finally I wanted to share a little \"Mr Wolf\" story with you that happened last week - our old ute had decided to no longer have any gearbox & had gone in for major repairs.  This meant that Graham (\"the Mr\") had no vehicle to get to & from the farm that he runs,  so he decided to come home in the 4-wheel farm buggy.  Nero (Mr Wolf) was quite delighted when he saw this & seeing as he thinks himself a wonderful \"farm dog\" (quite the best) the Mr decided to give him a few rides around the lawn in the farm buggy while I cooked dinner -Hmmm that looks like the perfect vehicle for a marvellous farm dog like myself ! ! ! Now (because I was cooking dinner) I didnt actually get any photos of him having his rides but I can assure you there would'nt have been any room left in the cab even for an ant, once you got Mr big fat fluffy inside sitting up there all proud of himself & full of importance  . . . however the problem arose when we came inside for dinner and he didnt want to get out - AT ALL - & so every half hour or so one of us would go outside & try & persuade him to come inside . . . Just look at that contrary-mary face will you !!!???Note the sky is darkening - still he wouldnt budge! !Night had fallen by now & the Mr had given up coaxing himNow I wish I knew how to start this thing up again & give MYSELF rides round the lawn . . .  Eventually, with a plate of cooked sausages cut up little - I was able to tempt the big fat fluffy inside again  . . . (quite some time later too I might add . . . Dreaming of riding round the farm in the buggy - VERY important ! !Hmm - give me small children to deal with anyday ! ! ! Well I wish you all a happy sunshine-filled weekend & I will be back here again next week - me & my \"contrary-mary\" dog -thanks as always for stopping by.Love/hugs/friendship,Julie :-)   X x X x O o"},

{"title": "Claires House  (+ 2 \"Sunshines\")", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2012", "text": "Hello everyone, Hope your week is going great out there.  When I took Mum home last week I had the opportunity to catch up with my friend Claire.  Claire & I met a few years back when she owned the most amazing little Patchwork Shop in Hawera called Cinnamon Lodge.  I used to go in there whenever I was down at Mums & be inspired by all her amazing creations (& a few new patterns & fabric would inevitably come home with me too :-) Claire closed her shop about 2 years ago & took all the remaining fabric & stock home with her so now I catch up with her at her (incredible) home.I was most excited to see her this visit as I knew she had re-decorated her lounge & (knowing Claire) I was pretty sure it would be amazing.  And friends - I was NOT disappointed . . . Prior to her \"make-over\" this room was alot of wood panelling with  a deep burgundy colour on the walls & dark green couches & touches of country colours like mustards thrown in - honestly, it was still gorgeous & warm & very inviting.Now however, she has lightened the whole room & it is just sooo beautiful - my mouth fell open & I was speechless (very unusual for me I might add!!) Her initial plan had been to base the room around a black/white/cream quilt she was making but she changed her plans along the way and this beautiful girly, vintagey pinky \"shabby chic\" sort of room emerged.This cabinet is the only darker piece of furniture in the room - she had been sanding this down & broke a glass panel so took them both out & filled it with treasuresThe sofa where I got to sit & drink tea & eat delicious lemon cakeThis cabinet was so beautiful & shabby chic & once again filled with treasures & handcrafts made by ClaireWhat I wouldnt give for this yo yo quilt ! !This ladder is used to display just SOME of her amazing quilt collectionthis shelf unit was originally in her shop filled with fabric & bits & bobs   This is around the corner as you go in the doorway - by now my hands were shaking ! ! ! It wasnt until Claire pointed out to me to look at my photos that I realised she had done this cabinet in colours - a pastel theme going on here - more treasures...In the corner to the left hand sideA close up viewI actually thought I may have died & gone to heaven :-)Looking upwards to the lights . . . Another little corner display (more quilts underneath)And out in her dining room area . . . Her actual dining table - our conversation went something like this . . .   \"So Claire do you actually eat meals at your table??\"Across to the opposite wall - if you look closely at the next pic you may see that around the chicken mesh cloche she has wound ivy & there are tiny fairy lights also switched on . . . At this point I think I bumped something on my camera as lots of my photos from here on were quite blurred.  Or it may be that I was simply dreaming of living here myself . . .:-)These next 2 are quite blurry but I wanted to show them anyway - ... as you walk into her actual house from her sunporch you are greeted by the most beautiful (huge) angel & Claire painted her door colour to complement the angel - I dreamt about this angel the other night - I dreamt that she lived at my house . . . Isnt she just beautiful ???The visit to Claires inspired me & made me feel so creative but also - upon my return home - (when my head stopped spinning) - I had the overwhelming urge to throw half my possessions out & start again !!!  Claires handwork is amazing & she is soo creative & wonderful with colours - I told her she should have a job doing shop windows - her display skills are incredible.  Everywhere you looked there were these little vignettes going on - I must add that I did check with her first that she was okay with me doing a blog post about her (& she was fine & happy for me to share it with you). So there you go friends, a little sample of life at Claires house  -  & to Claire (should you happen to read this) - your home is a credit to you, you are an inspiration, a visit with you is such a treat & I count myself lucky indeed to have you for a friend (allbeit a long distance one)**********************I wanted to share the 2 \"Sunshine\" raggedy dolls I finished last week & also show you a couple of Op Shop bargains I purchased while down at Mums . . . Although I did them both in very similar colourways (true Raggedy Anne colourings) they both turned out different - do you have a favourite ??  I can't decide myself . . . Miss Polka dot or Miss Stripey ??I was pleased to be able to use this lovely wooden button finally - I purchased it many years ago & love the little Annie face on it . . .Doing my usual round of the Op Shops in Mums town last week I came across this lovely doiley - it was $5.50 which is much more than I usually pay but I had it in mind to make a jug cover & set to with  my glass beads one night . . .  I was so pleased with the end result My other thrift store bargain was this lovely patchwork cushion which needed a good soak & a wash & a few little stitches here & there (& a new inner made for it as the old one was foam chip & had started to break down & turn to dust)I think this pattern is called Cathedral Window patchwork (??)It is the most gorgeous vintage lemon colour & looks great on my bed with my other cushions - I was so pleased with my bargains.I am off to load up the car as I have a craft stall tomorrow in our local town - as always I am feeling very nervous - this always happens before these events & I dont know why - so wish me luck friends & take care & have a wonderful weekend wont you. (hope you enjoyed your \"virtual tour\" of Claires house)Thanks for stopping by :-)See you back real soon,Love/ hugs/ friendship,Julie  Xoxoxoxox"},

I must confess I didn't get anywhere near the amount of crafting done I had hoped while Mum was here but I did have a bit of a \"marathon\" before she arrived & managed to complete some long-ago-started projects. Now for those that know me it is no surprise to learn that one of my absolute all-time favourite things in the whole world is dolls - I loved them as a child & I never outgrew this love,  & now I simply LOVE to make them - I would make dolls every single day if I could :-)I had long ago made some doiley dolly bodies & decided it was way past time they had some clothes made for them (poor wee things feeling the cold this winter) . . . Cutting out down on the floor as usual :-) I love to sort through my doiley stash & decide which combinations to put together - sometimes a placemat will appeal or sometimes an old crochet doiley will make a great collar . . . I try to use every part of the doiley where possible & like to use the lace edgings on them as part of the clothing . . . This dress was once a vintage pillowslip  - isnt it beautiful??A girl cant go anywhere without her face on . . .  Have a look & see if you like my combinations . . . An old trayclothA vintage runner An old pillowslip A round lace edged doiley Miss Butterfly up closeDo you have a favourite ? ? ?  They look simply gorgeous dotted amongst vintage china - most at home :-)My friend Elaine had asked me awhile ago to make her a small sized penny rug to sit on top of an old nail box that she had some vintage tools sitting inside (the box was turned on its side! !) - she wanted something without any detail in the centre as she planned to sit things on the rug & any centre piece would not be seen  . . . I didnt have any idea at this point what I was going to do but I found myself randomly tracing out hearts & stars using a country colour pallette . . . this is what I came up with - simple but effective colours & design . . . And plenty of room in the centre to sit things Plus it looked most at home on my old wooden bench table in the lounge - oh & just fits perfectly :-)   (whoops, sorry Elaine)I had been moving a ragdoll pattern around in my sewing room for several months planning to make some up - she is called \"Sunshine\" & is a Lil Blokes pattern from Lyn Hyland - I make alot of Lyns gollie patterns & really love her designs.Yep - back on the floor again . . . After making up the doll bodies & playing around with fabrics for dresses, I decided the dolls were much too pale . . .  so they got dunked in my teabag/parissian essence mixture (poor wee souls)  . . . Headfirst in we go - now hold your breath ! ! !No dolls were harmed in the making of this blog post ! ! !Thats better - much darker - we cant have a pale raggedy now can we ??!!  :-)  I have almost finished my 2 Sunshines (just doing their hair) - & will have pictures of them for you on my next post.I just had to snap these pics of the cows directly behind my cottage in the early morning light yesterday  . . .   it is calving time again & this lot are waiting to have their babies . . . Dont take photos of me - it is NO fun this pregnancy lark ! !Waiting to give birth & fed up ~! ! !With all the daffodils flowering & I saw lots of magnolias in bloom down in Taranaki, it looks like we are in for an early spring this year I love spring & look forward to it - I think it is probably my most favourite season - full of hope I always think,  after the wintertime :-)I will be back again real soon friends with some more things I wanted to blog about but before I go I wanted to share with you this delightful picture I took of the window display in a lovely little florist Shop down in Hawera called Wishing Well Flowers - it made me smile & made my heart feel good - hope it does for you too . . . Not great pics with the reflection but you get the general idea I hope :-) I hope you all have a great weekend - I am off to do more sewing - take care out there folks & happy creating where-ever you are . . . Much love,Julie Xoxo  (gosh I have just noticed how BAD my photography actually is of the shop windows - SO SORRY - quite hard with the relection of vehicles in the background)"},

A Jack & 2 Bruce's . . .", "date": "Thursday, July 26, 2012", "text": "A wet afternoon Hello to you all friends,Sorry I have been absent from my blog of late.On Monday of last week my dear friend Shirley came for the day with the plan to teach me to crochet ! ! !   Shirley has the patience of a saint & is one of those people who,  no matter what they turn their hand to, does it sooo beautifully.   I - on the other hand - am a slow & hopeless learner & bumble my way through things mostly getting by on \"a wing & a prayer.\"  Pretty much all of what I know in the handcraft field has been self-taught by me making loads of mistakes & learning from them.  (actually this could be said for all of my life lessons in fact) ! !Shirley was such a kind & patient teacher but when her husband collected her at the end of the day I told him she will need either a packet of panadol or a strong drink ! ! !  :-) We did dissolve into laughter a few times - I couldn't even get the hang of the chain stitch in the first row.     Finally - at the end of the day - this is my attempt - it is going to be a jar cover (I can hear you lot roaring with laughter you know ! ! ! )The next day I went into town & bought myself a thicker skein of wool as I kept splitting the yarn with my crochet hook   - \" that's the secret\"  I thought  -  I'll get thicker yarn & then it will grow real quick    -    this is my attempt since . . .  Growing isnt it ????!!!  If you get out your magnifying glasses ! ! ! So that was my crocheting attempt - however - I am determined to not let it beat me & to keep trying to master it.  So  -  when you have all picked yourselves up off the floor laughing  -  watch this space ! ! !  :-) I took a few things into the Hospice Shop last week & of course I had to come home with some other things - Someone in the house commented \"wasnt it possible to actually leave things there without coming home with more things ...???!!! \" (Hello??)this sweet little dish was the princely sum of $1.00I just LOVED this dainty little jugRemember last post where I showed you the pics of me cutting out the very fluffy bear fur ???Me kneeling on the floor covered in bear fur . . . And remember back in March when I wrote the post about Phoebe & Midge (the 2 bears I had to make for an order) ???Well the daughter of the lady that ordered Phoebe & Midge came to see me to ask me to make up some kitset bears she had bought long ago & never got round to completing.  Same scenario - I open my mouth to explain that sorry, I am rather too busy with other sewing - the lady leaves with the bear kitsets still here . . .   (* * * yes, yes I know) ! ? !I wanted to get on to them as they had been sitting in my sewing room for a month or two.  The kitsets were all D'Lyell Bear designs from their Bearzerk Range  - the 1st one was Jack - a jointed bear with little magnets stitched into his paws & just above his eyeline so that he could put his paws together or play peekaboo & cover his eyesPlease God let me have a nose embroidered on meThat feels better . . .(the glass eyes look a bit startled in this pic)No - dont look at me,  I'm shy The 2nd two kitsets were for Bookend Bears - these took me a bit of figuring out but were really quite neat when they came together -Well a face would be nice if you dont mindOuch - please be a bit careful   Whoops - got that last photo in the wrong order sorry folks - not sure what I did there ! ! !  :-)  -  or how to reverse it ! ! They are filled with lots of plastic pellets which weight them & make them hold the books up . . . the two Bruce\"s complete at last . .  .  THANK GOODNESS !!I dont really think my photography does them justice - they are really gorgeous & heavy & floppy & have big fat pellet filled tummies - one would make a great doorstop if you enlarged the pattern a bit more.In between the showers this past week I managed to get outside & get some pruning done - I see the hyacinth bulbs Mum gave me are peeking through on my mossy old scales out on the deck . . .  They smell sooo lovely too.  Such an old-fashioned smell.I filled my old (falling-to-bits) wheelbarrow with some of the gourds I had dried for a splash of colour up on the deck area . . . Mostly though I have been inside keeping the fire going. . . Sitting on the couch working on a new boy golly - a pattern I havent done for quite awhile -  (named Bernie)  The doll that sits beside me is called Lizzie & her and I have quite a few conversations & put the world right while I am stitching away . . .   My Mum is coming to stay next week & I am looking forward to that - its been awhile since Mum came up - we like to craft together & I am hoping to get some doiley dollies completed while she is here. Say Hello to all the nice folks out there LizzieI hope you all have a great week ahead dear friends, thanks for stopping by & also for all your comments which I read & treasure each & every one.Cheerio for now, love & hugs,Julie X x x"},

Today - just for myself -  I made a huge pot of vege soup in my old crock pot which I saved for & bought when I was aged 20 - quite a few years ago now ! ! (32 actually) This crock pot has been carted around a few homes with me & is still going strong - I can smell the soup still cooking away & it is a comforting, warming smell.  I know the crock pots available today are pretty swish looking appliances but I quite like my trusty old, slightly cracked, stained-in-places crock pot.We have had a few minus 2 degrees frosts & it has been soooo cold - I look at the poor little plants out in the garden & wonder how they survive & bounce back . . . I look out at my wheelbarrow full of pansies & I wonder how they manage to poke their happy little faces up when they have spent a night out in minus 2 . . . When my Aunty rang to say they were coming to stay I smiled politely & said \"that will be lovely to have you\" - then I hung up & looked in at my spare bedroom which looked like this the other week (remember) . . .  (& I think I may have said something I cant actually  print here) ! ! !Now I am sure there is a bed & carpet in there somewhere! !To say I had a \"white tornado\" would be an understatement! ! !     We do not have a big sized house here so you must bear in mind, it is difficult to find somewhere to take the \"overflow\"most of the time.  However I am pleased to say it now looks much more like this here . . . And when they left today I even managed to complete the doiley bunting I had begun a few months back for this room.  I had squirrelled away some favourite lace doilies as I had in mind I kind of wanted a \"snowflake\" effect - what do you think . . . When I first made it I sprayed them with spray starch but they still \"flopped\" so I dragged out my old bottle of \"Stiffy\" fabric stiffener & painted it onto them.I have to say - one of my very absolute favourite things in the  whole world - is bunting :-) For some reason, it always makes me smile wherever I see it.Whilst clearing out the room I happened to come across a small basket with some craft supplies in it & accidently dropped it & who do you think happened to fall out . . .  my missing Willis golly from a few posts back.  (sorry Nero for blaming you for running off with him) -  after I got over my shock I decided to finish the poor old chap in case he went missing again.Here he is face down in the masking tape having his boots painted onHappy at last to have my brother back with me :-)I had a nice surprise in the post last week - an unexpected one - a customer that had visited the cottage for the first time a month or so ago, sent me a lovely canvas print she had made from a paper serviette - she wrote in her note \"I had such a lovely time visiting you & your big fluffy dog, I thought I would send you something that reminded me of your place\"  It most certainly brightened a bleak, cold day - how lovely of her (& clever)I am dreaming of times when the lavendar is flowering & I am not hauling firewood all day long I have spent this afternoon cutting out another bear order - yes I know I need to do some serious work on learning to say \"No\" - like my sewing, I am a work in progress.This particular fur is so fluffy & messy I had to sit on the floor with the vacuum cleaner beside me sucking up the bits before I could move anywhere - a couple accidently got sucked up -  but I have rescued them :-) Not very good photography but gives you the general idea.I hope to be back next week with the finished product to show you all. Wishing you your own \"me-time\" folks & take care & have a wonderful rest-of-the-week.I am off to sample the soup :-) Love/hugs/smiles,Julie X x x"},

{"title": "An enjoyable day out with a friend :-)", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "text": "Good Monday Morning friends,Hope you all had a lovely weekend and managed to stay warm :-)As much as I enjoy my cottage a great deal, one of the downsides is the huge tie that it is.  I find myself often fretting whenever I am away from it, who might be calling & I am closed :-(      So consequently I dont do alot of things with my friends outside of the property.  I dont go and have \"coffees & catch-ups\" like alot of them seem to do.  So when I got the opportunity last week to go catch up with a friend who happens to live very far away (in another island) - then it turned out to be a most enjoyable days outing.A little gift I made for Therle as she has so generously sent me bundles of fabrics over the years Therle & I met through an online craft swap that we both entered into a couple of christmas's ago.  We were both given swap partners in other countries & both of ours disappeared into cyberspace - never to be heard from again ! !  So the lady organising the swap put us together even tho we were from the same country.  We have kept in touch by email and when her & her husband were coming up to the Waikato for the Field Days, we decided to have a girls day out. We met up just outside of Hamilton and the 1st place we drove to is Donna Wards Quilt Studio in Frankton - a lovely shop filled to the brim with beautiful fabrics.We were so busy doing the chatting/ oohing & aahing that I completely forgot to take any photos at this shop :-( typical ! !  We then drove out to Gordonton to the very lovely Grandmothers Garden Store - they even have seats outside for bored husbands to sit in & wait . . .  How inviting does this look ? ? ? Now I have to confess that one of the highlights of this store for me most definately was the 2 beautiful dogs wandering around inside the shop - one I think was called Brutus ??  & I am sure the lady called the other one Mac.  Therle asked me if I had found a friend?? as he didnt leave me alone & when I would browse the fabrics I would feel this little warm head gently push itself into my hand . . . Brutus (I think??) - my friend :-)Now who looks like they might be offering free pats ? ? ?This one was Mac (I think) - the lady had a \"treat\" in her hands - cant you tell . . . I did notice a large beanbag in a sunny spot for them - as you can see, they lead the most stressfull lives.It was hard to choose fabrics as the choices were so amazing . . Yes I'd like one of each please . . . Therle loved the poppy fabric - bottom right  From there we travelled across to Cambridge & had lunch in a lovely old converted church with a cafe upstairs.  By this time we were both starving & so once again, I forgot to take any pics of our wonderful lunch.  Downstairs was a gallery shop & I snapped this lovely pic of a corner with some very gorgeous handmade bags . .After we had quenched our hunger & thirst I wanted to take Therle to a wonderful shop in Cambridge - Quilters Patch - owned by my friend, Bev Johnson.  Bev has the most amazing array of fabrics to choose from + quilts lining all the walls & it is a lovely open airy shop with something to tempt you at every turn. I did love these 2 blocks of the month - Bev has a very good eye for colour combinations.On her counter I spotted this \"interesting\"  book . . . which Bev pointed out had a very nice write-up in it about my cottage (& so of course a copy had to come home with me . . . )Hard to read but gives you a general idea . . . All in all we both had a wonderful days outing - I dropped Therle back at her vehicle to go collect her husband from the Field Days and then came on home on a definate \"high\" & sat down & looked at all my purchases. Now let me share something with you here friends - I need more fabric like I need a hole in the head - & so I had given myself a strict talking to before I ventured out, NOT to buy any more fabric . . .  but as you can see by the photos below . . .   - my willpower needs some serious work done on it  . . . the beautiful Singer sewing panel was only $9.00 from Bevs Shop :-)Gosh what good \"soul food\" the day was - especially as I dont do it often - it was a real treat & I am still feeling the inspiration I got from looking at all those amazing creations in the shops - plus I am thinking that perhaps Therle needs to accompany her husband to the Field Days next year also  . . .  (now Therle - if you happen to be reading this - thank you for the wonderful day out & No, I havent gotten to the sewing machine yet! ! !)Wishing you a creative & inspiring week ahead friends - hope you have enjoyed reading about mine :-)(a couple of footnotes . . .  my butlers sink has arrived & been installed & so far- okay ! ! - maybe some photos next week,  & also still no sign of missing Willis despite having checked Mr Wolfs kennel & blankies)Warm wishes, love & friendship,Julie :-)  X x x x"},

Well thats where you need to drive to  . . . \"So I managed to complete 2 Isabella gollies - I especially LOVE the one made with the buzzy bee fabric which is a flannel and sooo soft . . .Love her little buzzy bee toy I managed to pick up in a baby shop . . .Sorry Isabella I appear to have chopped your head off a fraction . . . My Mum knits the little cardies for me from 5 ply wool (& does a great job) - this ones little brooch is a pottery gingerbread man.Sometime ago I had made some \"wee Josephine\" bodies and never finished dressing them - (another Lil blokes pattern I have altered) - so I fished them out from the bottom of the craft basket and made them some clothing  . . . Yes thankyou that feels much better now we are dressed . . .  As always,  I had been focusing on making girl gollies so decided I needed to do some boys to try to balance it out a bit and found my Willis pattern which I can usually whip up quite quickly . . .I began to make 2 Willis's and was going along at great paces until I got distracted for a day or two . . . and then when I went to go back to it . . .  one of the half-done Willis's was \"missing in action\"   ?????I am here in all my finery but my brother is missing  . . . I had made one with black striped pants (above) & one with blue striped pants (still missing) - I should note that Willis is only 5 1/2  inches tall by the way   .  .   .   now herein lies the problem - this is my sewing room currently & somewhere in the mess - is a missing half-made Willis  . . . :-(to be truthfull  that much carpet showing is actually QUITE tidy for me! !  !To be honest, I have had a very good hunt and no sign of him - so if you should see him at your house (he has on striped blue pants and a red jacket but no bowtie) - please contact me a.s.a.p.  :-)  & I will come & fetch him! !On a lighter note, I went to speak to the lovely ladies at the Catholic Womens League this past week (just to talk about my cottage & crafting etc) - (& you know how I LOVE to talk) -  I had the most wonderful afternoon - just such a lovely bunch of ladies & this is what they gave me for my time & effort  . . . (which was really NO effort at all) . . . a most beautiful Heuchera for the garden in lovely autumn tonesI am looking forward to finding a spot in the garden to plant it this coming week.  I must mention that Mr Wolf is now feeling much improved and only limps on his sore foot when he happens to notice Mum watching him! !  :-)Have a wonderful week ahead dear friends - I am meeting up with a friend that lives far away this coming week so am very excited about that :-)Take care out there & keep warm - wishing you a creative week :-)Love Julie (& Mr fat fluffy) X x x"},

When I returned from my visit to my Mums I decided to really focus on it and get it done so I could move onto some other projects . . .   and I finally finished it last week and Sandy came and collected it . . .

You know that old saying . . . \"one mans trash is another mans treasure\" - well that was probably written about me   -   Yours truly ! ! !   :-)    I just adore old junk things.  I often think I am perhaps living in the wrong era as I so love the older things from previous eras. Mostly this addiction began when we were sharemilking and moved around alot and in those days you could still find treasures under the old hedges on lots of the farms we lived on.  And boy oh boy, could I haul it home ! ! ! * * ! !    In the end our friends and family didn't want to help us move farms anymore because there were so many loads required shifting all Julies old junk bits & pieces! ! !Also this \"addiction\" was fueled by the simple fact that I didn't have a large enough bank balance to buy alot of the things I craved and so had to do the old \"silk purse from a sows ear\" type of thing.   I have a poster that I have framed that says \"Make Do And Mend\" - yep that's me alright, making do and mending ! ! !  :-)And so it was on a recent visit from my dear brother that he walked through my house and simply shook his head.  So when I showed him that I had started a blog (which I am still excited about) - he commented \"why dont you put pictures on of some of the old rubbish things you have in your house\"  (I think he thought secretly to himself \"they wont believe it!!!\")  So here goes for my posting today   . . .    some of my wonderful junk treasures that I surround myself with and call home, and I hope that (like me) you enjoy peering into other peoples homes sometimes too . . . The above are some snaps of my lounge room. (just a small sewing machine collection going on here...)This pic shows my Dads old ladder - Dad was a painter/paperhanger for all of his working life and this was his favourite ladder and still has the old bent nail on the side which I hang things from . . .   it now holds my quilts and some teddies (still miss you Dad )this is the end of my lounge room where I have an old wooden ironing board displaying some of my old doilies and linens and an old heavy iron (found in a haybarn) - no I don't do my ironing here :-)the above is an old violin and case that belonged to a very dear friends Dad (who used to play on it) - we are missing the fiddle for it.  Behind is an old expandable sewing case which was rescued from an old wool shed and painstakingly restored (by me) . . .this cabinet in my diningroom had chooks living in it (when a very dear friend gave it to me),and a drawer missing - amazing what a bit of elbow grease and sheer determination can achieve ! ! !  (this is one of my very fav pieces)Just in a corner of my dining room is a little display using my Grans old cooking bowl and a pyrex dish which she used to use ALL the time and I have filled with rosehips (can you see the dust . . . ??)and lastly for today a pic that probably totally contradicts everything I have just shown you . . .Cos lets be honest . . . . its hardly Living Simply is it now . . . . ????  But I love this little sampler cushion that sits in a wooden trug on a little chest in my dining room.  This is where I sit in the winter when we start having fires and I can sit here and stitch and watch the flames of the fire flickering.Hope you enjoyed the little tour of some of my home and (if you like) I'll be back another time with some more pics.Also hope you all had a pleasant Anzac Day yesterday - its good to take the time to remember all those brave and courageous men & women who lost their lives for us all - I was heartened to hear on the radio that more and more young people are coming along to the Dawn Parade and Anzac Services - taking the time to remember the past - what can be wrong with that I ask.???Have a good rest of the week my friends, take care out there  . . .Love Julie x x x(hope you noticed no pics of Mr Fat Fluffy today - told me he is rather weary of having the camera pointed at him lately . . .all this fame is soooo tiring  - he needs a nap)"},

{"title": "A morning with a friend", "date": "Monday, March 26, 2012", "text": "One of the best things about opening my cottage has been the friendships I have made and the like-minded people I have met along the way.  One of these people is Pauline, my friend who owns and operates the business Infused with Nature,     http://www.infusedwithnature.co.nz/     making and selling her wonderful handmade products from the calendula she grows on their farm at Arohena (about half an hour out from me). Pauline & I became friends when I began selling some of her products at Threadbear Cottage. When she invited me out this morning for a cuppa and to harvest some calendula before it all finishes for the season,  I didnt need much persuading.Upon arrival at Paulines we had morning tea out on her patio as it was such a lovely crisp clear autumn day - she had made the most delicious home-made bread with (homemade) strawberry jam and blueberry muffins!!!  The smell was so enticing.  (no pics sorry . . .  too busy eating !!  :-)Pauline grows rows of calendula in the area behind her house and we set about picking a basketful of the glorious orange and yellow heads ...She uses the calendula in most of her products by making an infused oil from the flower heads and also by drying and using the flowers or their petals in her range of soaps. Calendula has the most amazing healing properties & my 83 year old Mum swears by her calendula ointment for all manner of things!!!  I have used the calendula heads before in my citrus potpourri and find it retains its beautiful colour and doesn't fade like alot of other flowers do.Here I have taken a pic of her wonderful purpose built workroom where she makes her products and also has a display area for people to come and purchase.  (her work area is to the right of this photo & looks out over the farm - the most amazing views ) . . . I truly had the most enjoyable morning and when I got home I had this wonderful basket of flower heads to dry -  I was tempted to just keep them just sitting in their basket to enjoy but knew they would soon wilt and be unusable . . .        so  . . .    with a little help from a fluffy four-legged friend, I set to work laying them out in my dehydrator  . . .  of course this was very tiring work and so   (certain folk among us)    had to have a bit of a lie down and a rest after supervising that I had laid them out all correctly  . . . Fast forward to 6 hours later and I have the most glorious basketful of dried flower heads to use in my next batch of citrus potpourri  . . . I am so thankful to have a friend like Pauline - go look at her website for a full range of her products - absolutely beautiful handmade products that are all natural and all so good for your skin - click here for the link . . .  http://www.infusedwithnature.co.nz/     Hope that works okay folks as am still learning my way around this . . .   :-) When I make my next batch of citrus potpourri I shall remember to show you the calendula flowers used in it in all their wonderful colour :-)Til next time, cheerio for now,Julie & Mr Wolf    x x x   (rather tired from helping Mum)"},

Here he is above asleep on his favourite pink cat blanket - when he gets into a deep sleep he pokes his pink tongue out and often has \"twitchy\" dreams.  I must confess to a bit of an obsession with taking photos of him like this as the girl in the Photo Centre pointed out to me when I was constantly going in there to get them developed !!!!!  She also told me \"your dog should have his own facebook page - my flatmates cat does!!!\" So I came home and asked him and he said definately NO - he would have too many friend requests!!! Well friends I thought I should introduce you to Nero today as he is a big part of my life here at Threadbear Cottage and often gets way more compliments from the visitors than I do!!!!  And you will no doubt see him make appearances quite often here on my blog.  Hope you are all having a wonderful week out there and I shall be back soon with some crafting I have been working on.Cheerio for now,      Love Julie & Mr Wolf x x x"},
