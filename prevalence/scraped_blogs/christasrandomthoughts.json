{"title": "Gotta love health issues...🙄", "date": "Friday, December 8, 2023", "text": "So I have another kidney stone 🙃 just found out at the ER yesterday because of being in quite a bit of pain and nauseated 🤢 from it. Honestly getting and dealing with kidney stones don't surprise me anymore 🙃 I live with them 🙃 Being told from the doctor immediately after seeing me that I'm dehydrated was a first, but honestly I don't stay hydrated well at all, so its not surprising that I was dehydrated as well 🙃 However there was some news I got that was a huge wake ⏰ up call 📞 for me and I'm going to be working on changing things to avoid it getting worse while I can now, because I honestly don't want anything to do with the health scare at all. Its not going to be easy for me to change what I need to, but it is necessary for me to do. Also, being called obese and not overweight is not something I'm used to and I'm not a fan of hearing about myself. Brings back memories of being bullied in elementary school 🏫 when I was younger and it hurts. This morning 🌄 I'm dealing with an earache and hoping it goes away soon and doesn't get worse 🙃"},

I also need the job to be full-time and not part-time, because I can't make ends meet with it being part-time...I would have to have two part-time jobs and they would have to both actually give me 20 hours or more all the time to make it work out as well as both pay me $15 or more. Also would love another job where if I got overtime in it I wouldn't get into trouble for it. As I'm job hunting again, I will be working my content creator, online work, crafting, mystery shopping, and livestreaming jobs full-time as well, because when I do that they actually pay well and make it to where I can live off of it."},

{"title": "Stressing out about my job situation again... ", "date": "Friday, November 24, 2023", "text": "So, I'm kinda in a pickle at work again and now feel like I'm going to lose my job again, based on what the stocking manager told me she was going to start doing with stockers. She is going to start writing them up for not stocking 25 boxes an hour (on a normal stocking day) as well as write ups for things not being put on the correct uboats and pallets on truck day. So, based on what she said yesterday, she most likely wrote me up, because I had a uboat that had 57 boxes on it...meaning it should have taken me 2 and a half hours to complete it. But it took me my entire shift. Meaning because I'm on super thin ice at work because of previous write ups... I'm going to lose my job with a write up for not stocking boxes fast enough now. I shouldn't let this get to me, but it is. I shouldn't be overthinking, but I am. I am the one that kinda put myself in this position, because of a post I made on the Dollar Tree reddit page asking for the number to report violations annousmously and my store manager saw it and asked me about it. So, I ended up telling her what I felt like were violations through text and told her I was just getting the number in case I wasn't confident enough to go to her about them yet and that I hadn't called anything in...she said I could if I wanted to though... I mentioned that I wanted to come to her first which is why I was waiting to call. I did mention to her about what the stocking manager said and how now I feel like I'm going to lose my job because of a write up from her and how I really don't want that to happen. She didn't reply to that yet, but to be fair yesterday was Thanksgiving. But I did mention to her how I wanted to just be put on truck days instead if it means I have less chance to lose my job from being wrote up for not stocking enough boxes an hour. I hate it though, because I really need more then 5 hours a week at work. 25 hours at work has actually brought me in enough money to pay bills and save some money as well, but now I'm going to lose that if I lose my job for another write up or go back to just 5 hours a week. I mentioned how I would like better training on how to know how many boxes an hour I'm stocking an hour before I would feel comfortable stocking again and not worrying about being wrote up and losing my job. I love stocking as a job. I want to continue working stocking. I actually do like working at Dollar Tree (in particuallary the store I'm working at because of the employees and most costumers I know because they come in all the time). But *sighs* I'm stressing out and feeling like I'm going to be fired before my vacation in a few days or if I somehow get lucky and don't lose my job and just lose hours (even though they have hours because of the holiday) I'm going to be upset because I need more then 5 hours a week...25 hours a week has been amazing to have this past month... Anyways, I need to finish getting ready for work this morning... I just needed to get this out... because it has me stressing out and crying... and I've had a super crappy week in general and have just been kinda quiet and hiding and avoiding people."},

Which in turns gives them $10 to start with on the site to try it out and get one free drink. Your friend must in turn spend $15 in real money (not free drinks) in order to qualify. But once done, you will earn a free drink from your friend joining and qualifying.As you can see, you can also pay to promote your profile, to help give you a better ranking and help you earn more money on the site. I personally haven't done, this yet. I'm just seeing what I can earn first without paying to promote my profile right now.Note: There may be a referral link in this post where I will receive a small incentive if you use it."},

I only got a picture of them after I got them home. So, they got a little bit melted on the way home (because of it being 81*F out) and jumped around some in the box (because of the drive home on my moped), but they are still good. I also want to say thank you to my best friend/sister Otter for getting these for me to try.I do not know the name of the mystery cookie. My review and rankings of the four cookies: Mystery Cookie: Tasty cookie and cute sprinkles on top. I would get it again.Honey Cake Cookie: Tasty cookie. Love the look of it with the teddy grahams on top of it. I would definitely get this one again.Chocolate Mallow Cupcake Cookie: You can't go wrong with a chocolate cookie and the fact that it looks like one of the chocolate cupcakes sold in stores makes it cute. I would get this one again.Peanut Butter Cookie: You can't go wrong with a peanut butter cookie that has snickers on top. I would definitely get this one again.My rankings for the cookies are: 1) Honey Cake Cookie2) Peanut Butter Cookie3) Chocolate Mallow Cupcake Cookie4) Mystery CookieAbout the mystery cookie: What the cookies looked like when I got them home (I didn't get a picture of them when I first got them :( ): About the other three cookies:"},

So, I'm doing the next best thing and posting a review with what I thought of them along with the pictures of them that I was able to get at the time. Hope you all enjoy and feel free to leave your thoughts on them with me in the comments, if you tried them when they were out. These were very yummy cookies.I can see me getting them again if they come back to Crumble Cookies.My review for them is below, with the names of them.Did you try these cookies when they were out?What did you think of them?Cotton Candy - Pretty cookie, but would have preferred it on a chocolate cookie. I preferred the topping over the cookie. But would get this again. One thumb up.Peanut Butter Munch - This is a good lucking cookie. The cookie tastes great and so does the topping. I would get this cookie again. Two thumbs up. Birthday Cake - This was my favorite from the topping to the cookie. I would get this cookie again. Two thumbs up.Caramel Shortbread - This cookie looked good and tasted really good as well. I would get this cookie again. Two thumbs up. If I had to rate them in the order I liked them instead of how many thumbs up it would be the following:1) Birthday Cake2) Caramel Shortbread3) Peanut Butter Munch4) Cotton Candy Honestly the top three are in a tie for first place in my opinion, with the fourth one in second place."},
{"title": "Big moped 🛵 accomplishment yesterday - 4/28/23 ", "date": "Saturday, April 29, 2023", "text": "So yesterday was a big accomplishment for me when I drove to work because of the rain 🌧 and a little bit of wind that was 10+ish (the wind wasn't constant so that helped alot, because when the wind speed is 10+ and constant I try and avoid driving) just like when it was raining 🌧 how it was yesterday. But I didn't avoid it yesterday 👀😮😮😮 I actually drove in it and dealt with it for the first time. The puddles sucked on two wheels because there were a few I couldn't avoid and I noticed my wheels slipped more in them, so I drove a bit slower in them. I also did attempt to wear a new rain 🌧 poncho that I got from Walmart, but it didn't work out well, because it was blowing in the wind and making it to where it blocked my views in my mirrors and I didn't feel safe putting up with that when I was dealing with the rain how I was, so I stopped and took it off. Not to mention I was pretty much soaked a good bit at that point 👀🙄🤣 But I don't think I could have done it without alot of encouragement from my friend Brian Croxford because I do everything I can to avoid it, but being reminded that there are others who drive in things like that daily on mopeds as well and how much I spent on it with not driving it, means my money is being wasted at that point, so I'm trying to do better and get more experience and confidence with driving in rain like yesterday as well as wind (10+) but also just driving in general helps a TON with experience and confidence. Here is a short 10 second video 📹 so you can see 👀 how it was raining 🌧 yesterday so you have a better understanding what I drove in 👀🛵"},

{"title": "What is subspace?", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2023", "text": "What is subspace?\"Broadly speaking, subspace is generally regarded as a moderate to deep, almost trace-like, condition experienced by a submissive during intense or erotic interaction with their Dominant.\"Have any of you been in subspace? How deep have you gone into subspace? Do you experience subspace easily or is it hard for you to get into? My answers:I've been in subspace quite a few times over the years. I've been in it to the point where I just started zoning out and floating and everything was far away, but then where I was super far in it and I couldn't speak anymore for awhile after the scene ended. I find subspace hard to get into, which I hate because I love being in subspace alot 🥰 but for me personally it is something that takes alot to put me into. I think part of that for me comes with a few people I played with that once I entered subspace it freaked them out because my reactions to the scene we were having changed and they stopped the scene and brought me out of it without letting me enjoy being in subspace and enjoy it. So, I feel like because of that I have some sort of unconscious block to go into subspace now because I don't want who I'm playing with to not be experienced in the changes that happen when a sub enters subspace and then freak out and pull them out of it immediately without them being able to enjoy it. Because you can still scene after the sub enters subspace. It let's them enjoy it longer and get deeper as well as let's you as a Top enjoy the scene as well and hopefully enter Topspace too."},

It isn't fun, it is stressful. My current lease ends at the end of June 2023 (my birthday 🎂 month) and I'm pretty sure I have to move when it ends, because the owners were talking about how they wanted to sell it before I moved in, but decided not to only because of the one roommate upstairs that wanted to stay here for her last year of college. I wish I had a friend (just one) that would be willing to get an apartment together for a couple years so I felt like I had a home again. I'm trying to figure out my realistic goals to work on the next few months (this year) that will get me ready for when my lease ends at the end of June. One of those has to be saving up the money to move, saving up the money for the next down payment on the next room (want something more then that though), and start looking for a new place/room now to see what's out there now. I need to try and avoid being close to my lease ending and not having a place till the last minute (like this last time) or not having a place at all (like in 2020). I don't want to be homeless or close to being homeless again. Its too stressful. Its times like this I wish I had a boyfriend to help with expenses and get a better living arrangement *sighs* but honestly not sure I want a boyfriend again yet...because I kinda like being single, but guys are kinda complicated as well *sighs*Epic Fantasy Books Bundle + $20 Barnes and Noble Email Gift Card - Giveaway - 99 days leftEnter here today!Enter for a chance to win a bundle of Epic Book Series (Paperback) from some of the most popular Fantasy Authors of all time.The winner will also receive a $20 Barnes and Noble Email Gift CardBook series include Including:J.R.R.

I feel like I had more ups then downs in 2022. But the way that 2022 ended for me has me scared and hurt and upset and unsure how 2023 is going to go for me, because I am lost and confused right now and don't want to end up losing what I have currently, because I love where I live right now, since it is close to downtown Richmond, VA and in a good neighborhood (from what I can tell). I just really don't want to be homeless again in all honesty. It has happened once to me while living here in Richmond, VA and the first time it happened (at the end of January 2020) it caused me to have my first breakdown and scared one of my really good friends and caused issues with a few other friends. It almost happened a second time last year (in the middle of June 2022 and just before my birthday 6/24), but I got really lucky and found a place, before I became homeless. With what I'm currently dealing with it scares me, because it has taken away a big chunk of my income and with what I have coming in from where I'm working part time at Dollar Tree for $13 an hour (they don't do full time unless you are a manager of some sort and they also don't pay more then $13 unless you are a manager of some sort as well), it doesn't bring in as much as I need it to. I mean last month it brought in enough to pay my bills and rent, so that is good, but what it left me isn't enough to buy groceries (I didn't need to buy any last month), have money for gas for my moped (it is less then $5 for me to fill up, but still), put money into savings, put money into stocks, go out with friends (karoke, poker (currently costs $20 to play), etc...), go out to eat with friends once in awhile, and also be able to go on vacation if I want to get away for a bit. So, I'm trying to think and stay positive that things are going to end up working out and my money situation will go back to normal and get better, before the end of January 2023, because if it doesn't quite a few of my bills won't be paid and the most scary thing is that I won't have the money to pay my rent in February 2023.I will keep you all posted with how things go, when it comes time, but for now I just kinda needed to get this out of my head some and kinda have something to look back onto in the future as well and just to see how 2023 goes for me overall. But for now, I'm going to jump off of here and go run an errand I have been procrastinating on for a month with my moped (getting the second oil change done on it)... to be fair I was sick for a bit, but also I've been struggling with being afraid to drive it (at least during the day and week when there is more traffic on the road)... I'm not as afraid to drive it at night because there is less traffic to deal with... but I also just have never wanted to drive either... so I think that plays a HUGE role in my struggle with driving it, but I am going to work on that this year. I am also going to work on getting my driver's license as well at some point this year."},

As well as, I do want to and need to get more driving experience on it as well as in general. I do need to work on driving in new areas and seeing what they are like as well as down roads, I'm not that big of a fan of, because I need to work on feeling better on those roads.)~ Not messing up at work (getting another part time job that pays the same or more...if I can't find a full time job that pays better again) as well as just not slacking off, etc...)~ Building my savings and stocks up again (I want to have money for the future as well as emergencies, etc... again.)~ Not breaking down and losing myself or the progress that I have made since moving to and living in Richmond, VA on 1/18/19. ~ Getting more driving experience in a car, so that I can go to the DMV and get my license. ~ Getting my own place (one that isn't just renting a room, but is actually my own space again...I miss actually having a place to actually call home and it actually feeling like home.) ~ Working on getting my weight and health back to a good place where I have energy and feel happy with myself again (had that in 2019, then slacked off in 2020 to now and it needs to stop.) These are just the ones that I can think of right now, but there are more that I am working on currently from years past as well as that I want to work on in general for what I want in life."},

I used to keep better count of the Hanson concerts I went to by having them all wrote down and then blogging about them as well.I gotta say, if Hanson is preforming near where I live I will find a way to go see them, if I have the money to afford to go. Not to mention if they are preforming in my homestate of Las Vegas, NV, then I will defiantly find a way to go see them there as well, if I can afford to do so. I know this is the 5th time I have seen them preform in Richomond, VA.I'm sure it won't be the last either, because I'm pretty sure they will come back in the future.I am also planning to see them later this year on September 6, 2022, in Las Vegas, NV at the Brooklyn Bowl. The only thing holding me back from it is that they still have the stupid covid requirements in place before the concert. I'm really hoping those go away soon, like how they did for this show in Richmond, VA on July 22, 2022.I wasn't actually quite sure if I could go see them this year in Richmond, VA because of them having stupid covid requirements in place before the concert, until a few days before the concert, when they changed them and went away, so I was able to get tickets and go see my all time favorite band in concert :) Anyways, here are some pictures I took during the concert as well as a few videos I took during the concert.Hope you all enjoy!!! I know some of the pictures aren't the best, but I still like them.My outfit for the Hanson concert :) This is a different view of my outfit for the concert :) My view from where I was sitting in ADA seating. Not a bad view at all.The opening person was John Calvin Abney.John Calvin Abney.John Calvin Abney performed a few songs for us as soon as 8pm rolled around. He only did about a 30 minute set though. John Calvin Abney is cute :) This is one of the better pictures I was able to get of him :) I love that John Calvin Abney plays the guitar and harmonica. Also, this is one of the better pictures I was able to get of him.John Calvin Abney was good at keeping the crowd entertained as well :) This was the last picture I got of John Calvin Abney, before he got off the stage. After John Calvin Abney got finished, this was the view of the crowd in front of me. While we were waiting for Hanson to take the stage.Zac's drum set. Once Hanson came on stage.Hanson on stage. Taylor was hard to get good pictures off because of the light over him, but I still like how most of them turned out. Isaac and Zac were the easiest for me to get pictures of during the concert.Isaac and Zac :) All three of the guys, plus one of the tall guys heads in front of me during the concert that at first annoyed me, but then I just kinda worked with it. Mind you the floor he is standing on is lower by three steps, then the floor I am sitting on. I so enjoyed how Hanson played a mix of songs from 1997 to their new music they came out with this year in 2022.One of my favorite pictures I got of Isaac and Zac :) Like I mentioned earlier Taylor was hard to get good pictures of because of the light above him. This is a pretty good picture of the guys :) Another decent picture of the guys :) I liked getting the pictures without being zoomed in on the guys, because of how the lighting was. Issac and Zac turned out better to see in this zoomed in picture then what Taylor did, but still a good picture. Isaac and Zac :) Isaac changing guitars between songs and Zac watching him. Isaac and Zac :) Taylor, just wish the light above him didn't make him hard to see :/I like how you can see Taylor better in some of my not zoomed in pictures of the three of them. Not the greatest picture, but not the worst either. And I still giggle at the random tall guys head in almost all of my pictures, because there was nothing I could do about it. Zac and Taylor.Zac and Taylor, because Isaac is hidden behind the random tall guys head.I spy Isaac and Zac's head as well as Taylor. Taylor sitting down playing the piano. Taylor :) This is when Zac came out from behind the drums to sit closer to the front and play a few songs. Isaac, Zac (not behind the drums), and Taylor.Zac and Taylor :) Zac *drools* I am a Zac girl and have been since day one :) You can see Isaac, Zac, and Taylor in this picture :) Isaac, Zac, and Taylor. One of the better pictures of them because the random tall guys head isn't too much in the way. Another decent picture of Isaac, Zac, and Taylor without the random tall guys head in the way :) Isaac and Zac. Can I just say that Isaac has grown on me throughout the years like a fine wine. He is also handsome, but I will always be a Zac fan the most. One of the few pictures without the random tall guys head in it, because there were times when he bent down to talk to those he was with at the concert or go get something, so his head wasn't in the way. I really love how this picture turned out of Isaac, Zac, and Taylor. I love that Taylor was also playing the guitar as well. Another decent picture that I got of Isaac, Zac, and Taylor :) One of the better pictures I got of Isaac, Zac, and Taylor. It was so much fun seeing the guys in concert again :) I love Hanson :) They put on such amazing concerts and have really good music as well :) This was such a great concert :) Hanson know how to put on concerts that are so amazing :) Isaac and Zac :) I love that I got a butt shot of Isaac *giggles* Zac playing his drums. Isaac looks really handsome *drools* Taylor banging away on the congo drums (I believe that is what they are called). Taylor turning back to play the piano standing up :) Isaac rocking his guitar like always :) Zac, Isaac, and Taylor. Zac, Isaac, and Taylor.Isaac rocking his guitar :) Isaac and Zac :) Isaac and Zac :) Isaac and Zac :) Isaac and Zac :) A decent picture of Taylor rocking the tambrine :) This is a pretty good picture of all three guys :) Taylor walking around the stage :) This is one of the better pictures of Taylor that I got :) Another one of the better pictures of Taylor that I was able to get :) Another good Taylor picture :) Not the greatest picture of the guys, but not the worst either. I got to meet John Calvin Abney after the concert and get a picture with him. He is a really sweet and cute guy. I wanted to know where I could find him at online, so I took this picture so I could look him up later. Where you can find John Calvin Abney at online if you like his music or want to check his music out for the first time. Hanson on the sign outside The National :) Another view of Hanson on the sign outside of The National :)   The wrist band they put on before the concert showing that I am over 21 *gasps* and the information for the Hanson concert on The Nation website.Just showing off the guys from the show details on Facebook :) This was the merchandise I got from John Calvin Abney.You can see I got his autograph on the CD I bought (his first one he came out with).He threw in the other CD for free (it was when he was younger).The stickers were free.The songs on the free CD from John Calvin Abney.The CD's that John Calvin Abney has out.The stickers that were free. The songs on the CD I bought. This is his first CD. He had a total of 4 to choose from. As you can see this is the CD he signed for me as well :) The front of the free CD John Calvin Abney gave me. Hanson's Back To The Island information for 2023.The front of the Hanson shirt I bought.The back of the Hanson shirt I bought.The back of the shirt has all of the tour dates for 2022.The front of the shirt is the guys in their respective favorite colors.The letters on the left sleeve of the shirt."},

This is my first time ever making a C2C (corner 2 corner) blanket and I am loving it so far. This is the 5x crochet dress that I am pattern testing and showed in this blog post the other day. This is how much I now have completed on it until I can get more yarn to finish it. This is the crochet dress that I am pattern testing in a different yarn, that I just got on Sunday, July 7, 2022, because the Wal-Mart that I got the yarn from for the 5x dress hadn't restocked the yarn I need to finish that dress yet after buying the first four balls two weeks ago. So, this is the crochet dress in the size 2x and a different yarn and different color. I have to say I really like this size much better on me. This is what I have done on it so far as well, but I am adding to it more and more each day to finish it. I hope I was able to buy enough of the yarn to finish it though. This is the yarn I am using for the 5x crochet dress.This is the yarn I am using for the 2x crochet dress. This is the Dollar Tree yarn I am using for the c2c crochet blanket._______________________Where you can find and buy the yarns in this post if you are interested.

{"title": "Life Update: I moved to a new room in Richmond, VA", "date": "Sunday, June 12, 2022", "text": "I haven't really been able to focus on the blog and working on my online work and mystery shopping for May because I have been having to focus on packing to move (which I wasn't totally ready to do so), finding a new room to rent, and working. I finally found a new room to rent on Monday, June 6, 2022, then got approved for the new room on Tuesday, June 7, 2022, and was able to move into the new room on Wednesday, June 8, 2022. I was lucky and had a couple of really good friend help me with moving the big and heavy items I have over to the new room on Wednesday. But I still have a few boxes of smaller things at the old room that I need to get over here to the new room by Tuesday, June 14, 2022. I am ready to be totally moved out of the old room and into the new room, so that I have one less thing to focus on. Not to mention I am ready to be totally unpacked and settled into the new room, so that it helps me get used to how the new room layout is set up compared to the old room layout. Not to mention it will be nice to not have boxes everywhere on the floor and futon that I am having to walk around and worry about tripping over at times. Also, it will be nice to know where everything is as well, because right now, I don't totally know where everything is and it is annoying. I also am looking forward to having everything it a certain place again and somewhat organized. But that being said as I unpack and orgainze and set up my new room, I know there are going to be things I am holding onto for whatever reason that I can go through and let go of, like I was doing when I was packing to move. I got rid of some things, but not alot and I want to do better when I'm unpacking and get rid of the other few things I'm holding onto that I know I don't need because it's trash or junk and just taking up space. Maybe when my move is totally finished and I have my new room set up, then I will see about sharing some pictures with you all. But for now I should get off of here, and get started on my day, so that I can get a few things done in my new room as well as do some online work and look for a couple mystery shops to do. And maybe even try to head over to my old room and get my bike or a box or two and move it over here to the new room. Moving is expensive *sighs* Between the new room costing more ($700) the old room was ($625) not to mention having to pay a deposit as well and hope that I get my deposit back for the old room. Then the fact that I have been getting uber to go back and forth to the old room to get stuff and move it to the new room. As well as go to Wal-Mart and buy a couple new storage boxes to finish packing the old room up, so I can finish moving. I'm just ready to be finished moving again for a little while. I signed a lease to rent this room until June 30, 2023, so that gives me one less thing to worry about for a little while. I should get going though, I really need to get things done and also get some groceries again because I didn't want to get groceries just before moving, so I haven't actually order groceries since May 8, 2022, and I don't want to wait longer to order groceries, because I don't want to keep spending money on uber eats just because I am hungry and don't have any food at the new place to eat *sighs* Anyways, hope you all have a great day and that you enjoyed my life update and I will talk to you all later :)"},

So, I wanted to try this and see how it turned it. I have to say that it didn't turn out bad.It was good vanilla flavored oatmeal.It was new to have included a marshmallow topping for me, but I kinda liked it, however, I think it will take some getting used to for me.I also think that instead of two packets of the Lucky Charms oatmeal and to toppings bags. I would instead use one bag of the Lucky Charms oatmeal and then use a bag of the Maple & Brown Sugar oatmeal that I have along with the added Lucky charms toppings bags and see how that turns out. Because at least for me I need more flavor then vanilla in my oatmeal.Have you all tried the Lucky Charms Oatmeal???Do you like it??? Why or why not??? Here is my latest cashout from Current on May 11, 2022.I only earn from charging my phone, watching videos listening to music, and taking surveys.

It was my first time. I can't remember the section we sat in right off hand, but we were in the front row and before the show started I made sure we got a photo together ❤ you can see that below ❤ We shared a bucket of beer 🍺 a few each and had dinner during the show (which the staff had to come take our plates after the horses kicked dirt up at us and it landed on them) my Mom shared parts of her dinner with me that she didn't like and wasn't going to eat. We got a dessert as well (I can't remember what it was now, but it was good as well). The section we sat in didn't win. But it was a great show, great food, and most importantly to me great memories with my Mom ❤❤❤ Thank you for those memories ❤❤❤ They mean alot to me 🥰🥰🥰"},

Not to mention one of the pairs actually ripped in the butt area when I bent down to pick something up. Not to mention the last couple of pictures I have taken of myself I am not happy with because of how BIG I am again in them and because of that I haven't been sharing pictures of myself with anyone recently.  So, getting my weight back down and clothes to fit again as well as making it easier to put on my socks and shoes again is a HUGE goal I need to work towards again and I am starting with that today. I will keep you all posted on my progress getting my weight back down and my health back in order. Because posting this here, is a way to hold myself accountable with my goals in getting back on track.Below you can see where I am currently again weight wise and once a month I will do an update picture and post to hold myself accountable with where I am in getting back on track again. My next check in will be post around 3/8/22.Wish me luck please.If you are on this same journey right now, let me know how you are doing so we can support each other during it."},

Because I really am trying to get back on track blogging on here since I love to blog for you all and help you all earn money, coupons, freebies, etc... as well as share what is going on in my life in general. I am currently working ubereats full time, but I'm looking into going back into housekeeping at a hotel full time again so I will be doing ubereats part time when I do that. As well as my other earning ways will go back to part time and not be full time like they are now. I do know I do want to get to where I can just work ubereats full time as well as my other earning ways. Because I love having the freedom to enjoy the day and be my own boss. But I do have goals I want to accomplish this next year, that I haven't done yet in the last two years and having a full time job that pays me more and allows me to save more right now is what I need to make those goals happen, then I can work on working my other jobs online and ubereats full time and be my own boss as well as work on going part time in housekeeping at that point just to help keep some extra money coming in."},

I then had my first ever breakdown and scared my best friend (who I consider family). I just haven't been able to find how to get back on track and find myself again and every time I think I have something shows me I'm not again and it hurts so much and is so stressful. I hate it so much. It makes me numb and lost and confused...I'm having nightmares when I'm able to sleep... I can't focus... I'm not doing well at my current job because of all this and am so close to just walking away from everything until I can figure out how to find myself and get back on track again and not lose everything again. Because of what I'm currently dealing with I lost a really good friend (who I consider a sister) and I'm close to losing my best friend ) who I consider my family). I don't want to keep losing family because I can't find myself. I'm really trying to find myself I just am looking in the wrong places and making bad decisions while doing so. I want to stop looking in the wrong places and making those bad decisions because I don't want to go down that road again when I've worked so hard to make my dreams come true by being in Richmond, having a job, being more independent, being more happy, getting closer to driving and owning a car for the first time ever, actually having money saved up. I've gotten rid of quite a few bad habits and am working on getting rid of a few others that I'm struggling with again because I can't get myself back on track yet."},

{"title": "Why I should stay away from alcohol!!!", "date": "Tuesday, September 14, 2021", "text": "In this post I plan on writing about my journey with alcohol and why I should personally stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY from it. I'm going to start with most of the big times in my life when it comes to alcohol and what I remember from those times. I will also mention how my parents were with alcohol and then how my sisters are with alcohol. I will then transition at the end of this post why I personally should stay away from alcohol. So I grew up around my parents both drinking alcohol all the time. I remember the first time I drank alcohol was in kindergarten and I got to have a beer with my parents. I then went to school the next day and for show and tell I ended up telling everyone that I got to drink beer with my parents.The next time I remember drinking alcohol it was when I was 14ish and I had just gotten out of the hospital for a couple of months and all I wanted to do was go home to be with my G-ma Sally and enjoy my new Hanson merchandise that I had gotten in the mail, but my Dad begged me to come to his house for the night and said we could watch my new Hanson video and drink whatever beer that I wanted to drink. So, I went to my Dad's for the night and we shared a 6 pack of Budweiser and watched my new Hanson video. The next time I drank I had to have been 18 or 19ish and I was at my Dad's for the weekend only because he said we would go four wheeling and drink. We mixed Mountain Dew with Wild Turkey in a big cup you get when you stay in the hospital. I remember drinking two of those and enjoying four wheeling for a little while that night. I remember repeating \"let me drive you're not going fast enough,\" in the car, and then again at my Dad's house when I was told I was crawling around the coffee table. I don't remember not finishing the second cup, but I'm told that I didn't finish it and asked for a refill and then tossed the cup at my step-mom and what was left in the cup spilled on her. My little sister Tara had school the next day and was trying to sleep, but my Dad requested her to watch me while him and our step-mom Martha went back out to drink with friends. They had to come back, because my sister couldn't get me to pass out, she was afraid I was going to hurt myself because I tried to walk and almost took out the TV. So, my Dad and step-mom came back and they both had to deal with taking me to and from the bathroom because I was going to be sick and because I needed to use the bathroom. My step-mom wanted to take me to the hospital, because she thought I had alcohol poisoning, but at one point, because I was hot, they took off my sweater (it was fall or winter) and she saw my self-injury for the first time and so she didn't want to take me to the hospital, because she was afraid they wouldn't let me leave when they saw the self injury on my arm. I remember the next day waking up on the floor in the living room with my Dad on the couch and my step-mom was on the other couch (until she had to get up to go to work) I was only in my bra, pants and had one sock on. I had lost my high school ring somewhere on the floor in the living room as well. The next time I drank it was my 21st birthday and I begged my G-ma Sally to allow me to buy 1 beer to celebrate (she wanted nothing to do with alcohol, but she allowed me 1 beer) I ended up buying a 6 pack of beers, but she didn't know. I ended up drinking them in my room that night, while I played a Super Mario game with my little sister Tara, who kept asking if she could have 1 beer and I kept saying no. However, at some point I ended up blacking out and woke up the next day to her showing me pictures she had taken of me, while I was drunk and in the black out state. She also shared with me what I had done, but I don't remember what I had done. I only remember she said she had to try and keep me from being too loud, so I didn't wake up our grandparents. Most of my 20's after I turned 22 were just my binge drinking until I blacked out and don't remember where I was, what I was doing, etc... having other drunk people I was hanging out with try and keep an eye on me, because I was known for wandering around drunk and blacked out...trying to get home... Also, I have memories where I was out with my Mom and she was driving us home (way drunker then me) and we almost crashed into light poles. Then in 2019 and 2020 I ended up finding out that when drinking I end up beating up and saying \"f you\" to my best friend of 13 years. I had never heard of being violent while I was drunk and blacked out with anyone else before, so I really tried to fix this behavior with my best friends help. Now in 2021 I thought I was doing better with my drinking until I went out to Vegas to do a balloon releasing for my Mom's first birthday in heaven (she passed away on April 20, 2020 from alcohol). I ended up messing up big time because I started binge drinking with my Uncle Keith (not a fan of because of stuff that he did to my Dad when I was a kid, but that is another story) and from what I was told the next day the cops were called on me because of  something I did and they ended up showing up a total of 3 times that night. I had bruises on my upper arms from where someone grabbed me. The reason I thought I was doing better with my drinking is because my best friend had started giving me permission to drink 1 or 2 beers when out with him and I have been doing better and taking my time drinking and not even  getting buzzed from drinking so no black outs from drinking. That is until last week (September 7, 2021) when I went out with an old roommate to a bar that had karaoke and where I knew I might see my other friends as well. I hadn't asked permission to drink (you will understand if you are in a DDLG lifestyle or BDSM lifestyle) and I ended up drinking to try and impress the old roommate I was out with that night and lets just say I ended up blacking out and not knowing how much I had to drink at all. I found out from my best friend that I beat up the guy I was out with and cussed at him as well as ended up passing out across the street from where I live and one of my current roommates was sitting next to me keeping an eye on me, as well as at some point neighbors came by to try and help get me inside, but I was too drunk to go inside.So, that is where things stand in my life as of now September 14, 2021 at 36 years old, when it comes to alcohol and when I drank at certain parts of my life and how much I can remember from those times, etc... I can honestly say now that I have this written out ever since the night I had wild turkey to drink when I was under 21...from that night on with any of the times I have drank, it has been me binge drinking and blacking out from alcohol with a little bit of violence towards friends. It shows me that I should NEVER have been drinking ever!!! I don't know how to limit my drinking to a few drinks when it comes to drinking beers and shots. Don't get me wrong, there have been times when I just drank wine and had a glass or two and I was perfectly fine *sighs* I need to learn limits with alcohol if I ever touch the stuff again in my life. But honestly writing all this out and seeing how my behavior has been with alcohol it embarrasses me and frustrates me and makes me NEVER want to touch alcohol again so I don't put myself in danger from blacking out or getting alcohol poisoning or beating up on my best friends. I honestly don't like how it has taken control away from me and made me lose friends. It also took my Mom away. I don't want to lose more friends because of drinking and I especially don't want to die from drinking. My parents were both alcoholics (Mom who passed away from alcohol on April 20, 2020) and my Dad (he is still alive). My Mom wasn't a violent drunk, she was more of a depressed drunk. My Dad is a violent drunk at times. My sisters (I have two Seana (middle sister) and Tara (little sister)) have been drinking since they were in middle school. Seana is known for being a violent drunk at times, like our Dad and Tara from what I know is more of a depressed drunk, but I have heard there are times where she is violent as well. I want to be the one in my family that doesn't deal with alcohol. I don't want to be an alcoholic. I don't want to die from alcohol. I don't want to lose more friends because of my drinking. I don't want to lose memories from drinking and put myself in bad situations, where anything bad can happen to me because I'm blacked out and wondering around the streets drunk, not knowing that is what I'm doing. I don't want to beat up and cuss out my best friend anymore."},

My big toenails were the worst, even after I was on medication for toenail fungus, so I got them removed and chose to keep the other 8 at that time, but now I want the other 8 toenails gone. Especially the one currently on my left foot that is causing me pain (the middle toe on my left foot). Anyways, I need to start my search for a foot doctor and see how much it will cost me to see them and remove my toenails. I hope it will be somewhat affordable and I know it won't be all at once, because I need to be able to walk, so it will most likely be one foot at a time like when they removed my big toenails. Anyways, I'm going to go for now and I will talk to you all later. I hope I didn't gross you all out to much with the pictures of my feet and toenails. Feet gross me out so much and especially toenail fungus *sighs* Left footLeft footRight footRight footRight footRight footLeft foot of the toenail causing me pain :(Toe on my left foot causing me pain :(Toe on my left foot causing me pain :(Left footLeft foot"},

I have stepped back and started realizing that being in person with him, he has turned me into this woman and I want him to see that again. Because 11 years ago, I wasn't that woman, I was just a child (in a way), but since meeting him and learning how to stop behaviors that aren't good for me because of his honest advice and the fact that he cares about me and wants me to improve behaviors I am not a fan of in myself and don't want to have to deal with. He has helped me become this woman and I don't want to lose this woman, because I love seeing her and how much she has grown since having this amazing guy in her life to call her best friend. When I got with my ex-boyfriend Gareth, I stayed that child and never answered to behavior that I shouldn't have been doing and wanted to work on. I never accomplished goals, that I had and wanted to and talked to my best friend about the entire time.But being in person with my best friend, I have grown up and answered to behavior that I shouldn't have been doing in more ways then one as well as behavior that I wanted to work on and still want to work on. I am way more mature and learned so much about myself and this amazing lifestyle that I love living 24/7. Please continue to help me to grow and mature and accomplish the goals I still have and want to work on with you by my side throughout my journey in the lifestyle and more importantly as my best friend.  This summary is not available.

I don't have a date to go back to Richmond, VA yet. I had to sign the papers giving the people permission to cremate my Mom, even though I never got to see her to say goodbye to actually know if she is gone or not. Yesterday, May 6, 2020, my Mom still hasn't been cremated yet, because the doctor hasn't signed the papers to do so yet, so no death certificate yet either. So, in my mind I'm thinking that its all a lie about her having passed away and that she is actually in a hospital somewhere in Las Vegas, NV. But I did talk to my Grandma Betty Francis, about getting a necklace for myself with some of my Mom's ashes. I'm hoping I can get a turtle for her to wear, because she loved and collected turtles. I can't believe she is gone after just barely turning 59 on March 5, 2020. Drowning your pain in alcohol, solves no problems in the long run. It just hides them for a bit and you deal with them again when sober. I love you Mom  and miss you and I'm glad you aren't in  pain anymore and with your Dad again after losing him ten years ago. Visiting Vegas is never going to be the same again and every few years in NC/VA isn't going to be the same with you not coming out there to visit Seana and her kids. I wish you were still around so much. I wish I got a chance to say goodbye to you."},

{"title": "My year in 2019...", "date": "Wednesday, January 1, 2020", "text": "So, 2019 was a very interesting year for me on quite a few different levels. I'm not going to go into alot of detail about things, because its not everyone's business what all happened to and for me during 2019, but I want to at least mention a few milestones and what I believe are accomplishments for me, that happened in 2019. January 18, 2019 — I ended up leaving Gareth and my cat Tallie and coming to Richmond, VA to visit my friend of 10 years Brian, when I ended up deciding to just try living in Richmond, VA, because I knew if I went back to Gareth then the dream I've had for 10 years of being in Richmond, VA and living here wouldn't ever happen if I didn't just go for it while I was already here, so I ended up going for it. April 26, 2019 — I got my first job as a housekeeper in a hotel in downtown Richmond, VA.June 2019 — I turned 34 and ended up moving closer to downtown Richmond, VA as well as closer to where I worked.July 2019 — I ended up learning how to ride the buses to get around town and save money then spending most of my money on Lyft and Uber rides to places.August 2019 — Started working on paying off my credit cards and getting my credit score better again, because I feel off track with that for awhile. November 8, 2019 — I ended up getting my learner's permit for the first time ever!!! Which is a goal I have had to do for 10 years now. November 21, 2019 — Was the last day I ended up self injuring (I'm working on recovering from it). November 2019 — I don't remember the exact date, but I started working on paying for my first car from my friend Brian. December 2019 — I had a great Christmas with my friend Brian and Otter, which I wasn't expecting at all. So, I'm so glad I made the move to move to Richmond, VA finally, because it has helped me accomplish goals that I have had for years like, working, driving (legally), being independent (learning how to get around on the buses), working on stopping self injury (which is something that I want to do, but am afraid to do), meeting new friends (Otter), being closer to my friend Brian, living and working in downtown Richmond, VA, having my first Christmas with friends. 2019 wasn't my greatest year, but it also wasn't my worst year. It was a good year for me in general. However, I'm really hoping that 2020, will be a better year for me in general and that I will accomplish more of the goals I have for my self and see what else new and exciting happens for me in 2020."},

The experiences we have had over the years have shaped who we are as a band and as people. We grew up on the tour, from being 20 year old kids to in our 30’s. We learned about respect, punk rock ethics, and how to successfully beg for more beer and water. From being a fan first to being in a band who has become a staple of the tour, I’m sad to see it go. Much love and respect to Kevin and Lisa and everyone else who shaped me into who I am today..... from age 16 to 37.\" - Shane Told (Silverstein)⠀ ⠀ #vanswarpedtour #warpedtour #silverstein A post shared by  Vans Warped Tour (@vanswarpedtour) on Jun 1, 2018 at 7:05pm PDTToday is my first time hearing and seeing this song and video, from this band and I thought it was amazing and I wanted to share it with you all :)Hope you all enjoy it like I do :)Have a great day :)Ok so as you can see on, Thursday, June 1, 2018, I had 23 days till I turned 33 this year and I was the first to donate to my chosen charity To Write Love On Her Arms. I started off by donating $10.00 and am hoping that my friends and family will help me donate $23.00 or more by the end of June!!! As of now, Sunday, June 3, 2018, I have 21 more days till I turn 33, but I want to keep the donations going until the end of June to make sure that all of my friends and family and their friends and family, have time to help donate what they can or share if they can't donate. So, Christa what is To Write Love On Her Arms exactly?\"To Write Love on Her Arms is an American non-profit organization which aims to present hope for people struggling with addiction, depression, self-injury and thoughts of suicide while also investing directly into treatment and recovery. Based in Melbourne, Florida, TWLOHA seeks to connect people to treatment centers, websites, books, support groups and other resources. TWLOHA also encourages people to have honest conversations about these issues, and to live in community.\"If you would like to learn more about TWLOHA, you can head over to their official website here.Why did you choose it as your charity? I choose it as my charity because when I was in Middle School and 11 years in in the 6th grade and I first started self injury and didn't know what it was and dealing with depression and not knowing with that was either. I ended up learning about TWLOHA through one of the teen magazines that wrote an article about it one month and I ended up realizing that I related to it alot and wanted to learn about it and so I did and I began supporting it as much as I could by advertising it online in my blogs and forums I was on and talking about it to friends and family. I even donated money to them when I had the chance and I still do to this day as you can see."},

Do you mind sharing your experiences?______Hotline numbers that I know of and would like to share with you all. I know these are most likely only available in the United States, but if you want me to find ones overseas as well, please let me know and I will do so, just let me know where you live. Also, I hear there is now a number you can text, so I will look into getting that as well and adding that on here, when I find that information out. But for right now, please use these hotline numbers if you need them or pass them on to your friends and family members if you know they are struggling and needing someone to talk to because they aren't talking to you right now. It may save someone. 1-800-273-8255 - Suicide Hotline1-877-226-3111 - Addiction Hotline1-844-228-2962 - Eating Disorder Hotline1-877-455-0628 - Self Harm Hotline1-888-640-5174 - Depression Hotline______I've never called the suicide hotline before, but I have called another hotline before, that I needed to at the time (well two hotlines), because I was in really bad shape and needing someone other then friends and family to talk to, because they weren't helping me anymore.I also, didn't have anything that was making me happy anymore and calling and talking to someone on the hotlines at that time was helpful because they helped distract me and gave me other ideas other then the ones that I was already using at the time to try and help make myself happy.So, yes you may not know it will help by calling right now, but if you have been thinking of calling for awhile, then just go ahead and sit down and call and talk to someone on the hotline, because it could be one of the best things you do in your life right now. I know it was for me and I know if I need to sit down and call a hotline again, then I will. I know I have thought about calling again once or twice, because I have been struggling, but right now, reaching out to friends and family has been helping me out, so I haven't needed to call a hotline right now."},

It is the magicalword which, just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure,love, and hate.In language, \"fuck\" falls into many grammatical categories.It can be used as a verb, both transitive(John fucked Mary)and intransitive(Mary was Fucked by John)It can be an action verb(John really gives a fuck)a passive verb(Mary really doesn't give a fuck)an adverb(Mary is fucking interested in John)or as a noun(Mary is a terrific fuck)It can also be used as an interjection(Fuck! I'm late for my date with Mary)It can even be used as a conjunction(Mary is easy, fuck she's also stupid)As you can see there are very words with the overallversatility of the word fuck. Aside from its sexualconnotations, this word can be used to describe manysituations:1. Greetings.........\"How the fuck are ya?\"2. Fraud...............\"I got fucked by the car dealer.\"3. Resignation.......\"Oh, fuck it!\"4. Trouble.............\"I guess I'm fucked now.\"5. Agression.........\"FUCK YOU!\"6. Disgust................\"Fuck me.\"7. Confusion.............\" What the fuck....?\"8. Displeasure............\"Fucking shit man...\"9. Lost........................\"where the fuck are we?\"10.Disbelief..............\"UNFUCKINGBELIEVABLE!!\"11.Retaliation.............\"Up your fucking ass!\"12.Apathy.................\"Who really gives a fuck?\"13.Suspicion.............\"Who the fuck are you?\"14.Directions..............\"Fuck off.\"It can be maternal...\"MOTHERFUCKER!\"It can be used to tell time...\"It's four fucking twenty!\"It can be used as an anatomical description...\"He's afucking asshole.\"Lastly, it has been used by many notable people throughouthistory:\"What the fuck was that?\"...Mayor of Hiroshima\"Thats not a real fucking gun.\"...John Lennon\"Where the fuck is all this water coming from?\"...Captainof the Titanic\"Who the fuck is gonna find out?\"...Richard Nixon\"Heads are gonna fucking roll.\"...Anne Boleyn\"Any fucking idiot could answer that.\"...Albert Einstein\"It does so fucking look like her!\"...Picasso\"You want what on the fucking ceiling?\"...Michelangelo\"Fuck a duck.\"...Walt Disney\"Houston we Have a big fucking problem.\"...The crew of Apollo 13And there we have it boys and girls.Have a great fucking day!

{"title": "New issues in the life of someone who has colitis and doesn't know what is going on now", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2016", "text": "Something new I have been dealing with the last few weeks is feeling like I have a blockage on the lower right side of my stomach, but yet some of the poop is still able to pass as diarrhea, but not much. I thought it was just going to pass, because it was most likely normal and didn't feel like constipation or anything bad to worry about, however I ended up being wrong this week, because it got to where I notice the last week I wasn't passing anything and then all of a sudden it felt like there was poop ready to come out and it was a soft poop (I know this because I had to help it with toilet paper quiet a few times and even that didn't help :( ) It was acting like it was a rock and it didn't want to come out nicely like I am used to with the diarrhea the last 6 years. I was literally flashed backed to when I was a young kid and on the toilet crying and nauseated and clammy from it, because that was how it made me the last couple days, until I did try an enema because it said it would work in 1 to 5 minutes and sure enough it got some of the stuff out of me, but not without me literally screaming and crying and having to have my boyfriend hold onto me to keep me on the toilet because I wanted to come off and make it stop because it was too much to deal with...I think I sat there for an hour as I let as much come out as I could and I drank a bottle of magnesium citrate cherry flavored and followed it down with ginger ale to help hopefully get the rest of the stuff out of me.However, that was a day ago and I still feel like I have a blockage of some sort on my lower right stomach.I haven't been able to eat anything or drink hardly anything since all this started and I feel really weak and wore out right now, so much so that I am on the verge of on ER trip this week I think if I'm not able to get in to see my GI Dr. Outlaw ASAP. to find out what is going on with me now. Because something isn't right with me right now."},

{"title": "Easy Gluten - Free Sandwich Bread Recipe", "date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2016", "text": "Ok so for those of you that don't already know. I am on a gluten free diet. I also find that the sandwich bread in the stores isn't much in a package and costs alot to buy, so to  help save some money and have bread to eat, I decided I would find a recipe and make my own to enjoy. I love to bake anyways and baking a non-sweet bread is on my New Years Resolution for the last few years. So, now I can cross that New Years Resolution off, since I just completed it this past week. I did a good job for my first time, but I know that I can improve my skills at it, especially since I need to find the right mix, so that I can make my special banana and pumpkin breads that I make every year!!! I just need to make sure they are gluten free this year, so that I can enjoy them and that they are still amazing in the taste department.Since I have been baking gluten free products. I find it hard to find the right flour to make the item I am baking taste the best. So, I am busy trying different was to improve my gluten free baking, so I can enjoy the same kinds of foods that my boyfriend and roommate get to enjoy.So, let me get onto sharing with you the recipe I used along with the slight change I did with it since I had it close by at hand and thought it would still work if I made that slight change in the recipe, but by doing so, it didn't do what it was supposed to to the bread, so I had a dense bread, instead of the fluffy one you see in the preview picture of the bread for this recipe.So, I plan on making this same recipe again, but instead will follow it like it says this time and not change anything, to see if that helps improve the bread any! Once I do that, I will be sure to share with you all how it turned/turns out. Wish me luck!So, here is the recipe I used.Here is the flour I used instead of the one called for in the recipe, because this has Xanthan gum included in it, so I figured if I used this, then I didn't have to add the package of Xanthan gum that the recipe calls for either. I somehow went wrong, not sure if I could have still used the above flour and then still added the package of Xanthan gum and it would have turned out right or if I just have to follow every step with everything they call for in the recipe for it to turn out the correct way. If you have a favorite gluten free sandwich bread recipe that you use all the time, can you please share it with me below??? I would love to give it a try and see if it is one that I can start using as my sandwich bread as well.Thank you all so much for any help you can give me and hope you enjoyed reading about my first time baking non - sweet bread that is gluten free so I can enjoy it!!! Had an amazing time visiting Xscape Factor LLC in Fayettville, NC. I know for sure I will be back to try another room and see if I can beat the clock again, since I and my fellow team members were able to beat the clock in the first ever xscape room I got to play in :) I played in the one they have set up for Halloween called \"Big Top Murders (Serial Killer Edition)\".I love that the place is affordable to go to if you are looking for something fun to do in Fayettville, NC.If you would like to learn more about Xscape Factor, you can visit their website at: https://www.xscapefactor.com/You can also learn more about Xscape Factor on their Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/XscapeFactorLLC/ They try and run a contest every week to giveaway tickets to a few winners of the contests they run, so be sure to keep your eye out for that if you are a member of their Facebook page. Be sure to let them know that Christa Sunderland sent you to them.

What you do, is post three things that you love, tips, ideas, etc... then you share it on Thursday (or another day of the week of your choosing), then you add your link to the link up on Royalty in Reality or one of the other two blogs that are involved in hosting this weekly link-up. Once you do that, you then interact with the blogger who linked up before you did and leave them a comment, then you are urged (but not required) to share their post on a social media site of your choosing. The reason for this link-up is to help bloggers learn more about it each other and to support each other.______The three things I collect: 1) Pogs - I have been collecting them since they came out when I was a child. Once I find where I have them stored at I plan on sharing with you a photo of my Pog collection.2) Pins - The pins that you stick on your t-shirts or backpacks. Once again I have been collecting them since I was a child. When I find where I have them stored at I do plan on sharing with you a photo of them.3) Keychains - I have so many and have been collecting them since I was a child. I store them in random places around my place, but once I gather them up and can get a good photo of them, I do plan on sharing with you my collection of keychains.Do you all collect anything?

I know the picture says to fill up a 2 liter with dimes, but it shows a 20 oz bottle in the picture filled with dimes. So, I plan to start filling up a 20 oz bottle with dimes and seeing how much I save up and go from there, since I have a bunch of those around!!!Do you plan on trying the dimes challenge? Why or why not? Are you going to use a 2 liter bottle or a 20 oz bottle? Why did you choose the bottle size you did?Have you done a challenge like this before?I know this is weird, but this is something that I want to try for a few reasons. 1) I want to see if it works. 2) I have had visits from people who have passed away and want to see if they will communicate with me this way, like it says they can in the description here.3) If I try this I plan on recording my experience to share with you all, so you can see if it works or not.Will you try it?

I've been in the ER twice this week for the pain and that didn't help figure anything out, just helped treat some of the pain I was in *sighs* :/So, today, I called and made a follow up appointment with my GI doctor for March, and I'm hoping that when I go the stool sample that I have done will help to tell some of what is going on and also that we can do another colonoscopy and endoscopy, because I'm thinking since May of 2013 my body went from showing visible colitis to having microscopic colitis. So, I'm hoping my GI doctor can find out in March if that is what is what is what is going on and that is why I'm in huge amounts of pain *sighs* :/Also something else that bugs me, is that the ER doctor prescribed me Bentyl and they know I have colitis and I take Apriso for it, so why would you prescribe me that? Then on top of that I tell you that I have taken it in the past before I was diagnosed with colitis and it didn't help me and made me worse when they that I had IBS *sighs* :/ Not to mention I looked up on my phone at the ER that Bentyl shouldn't be given to those that have colitis *sighs* :/What is wrong with doctors?"},

This came to me as a Christmas gift from my Mom on December 14, 2015.I wasn't expecting a Christmas gift from her until January 2016, because she had to take care of family Christmas gifts in person where she lives as well as take care of paying bills, so when I got a big box and saw all of these boxes, I was very surprised and had to document the unboxing of the Christmas gift from my Mom, to send to her and show her that I got it and loved it and thank her for it. These looked good, but when I tried them the were way to sweet and gummy tasting for my taste, so I only had two of them. My boyfriend Gareth, didn't even try them, because he isn't a fan of them at all. I don't blame him for that, since I'm not either.My boyfriend and I loved the breadsticks with the dipping sauces.I preferred the cheddar one over the mustard one and my boyfriend, preferred the mustard over the cheddar one. These were really good :) My boyfriend and I both loved them :) What isn't to love about meat and cheese? My boyfriend and I loved all the meat and cheese in this box :) Aren't these cute?My boyfriend and I loved these little chocolate cakes. I loved the cheese popcorn more so then the caramel popcorn.I did love the white chocolate pretzels as well. My boyfriend enjoyed all three about the same, even though he isn't a fan of white chocolate.  So, as you can see I got a very awesome and unexpected Christmas gift from my Mom! What did you all get for Christmas 2015? Who was it from?"},

I lost two pounds in the six weeks since I last saw him so I went from 242 to 240 now. Not sure how that happened since I'm not trying to lose weight right now. I think it is my colitis making my weight come off right now, but no complaints. I hate that my colon had me up in severe pain all night last night and today. None of my meds are working to bring down my pain and control it and that sucks. Why does colitis pain have to be so painful and hard to control?"},

I'm not going to get into why, because those are personal reasons that I don't feel like bringing up right now, but I may bring up in a later post.One of the first things we had to do when I got there, was get my Mom a new bed, since all she had was a twin bed and we couldn't both sleep on that, so she had to upgrade it to a bigger bed. She ended up upgrading it to a Queen sized bed and it is very comfy if I do say so myself *smiles*I woke a couple days before I left for Vegas on August 18, 2015 and saw, that my cat Tallie was in my backpack.I guess she wanted to come to Las Vegas, NV with me on the 21st of August. What do you think? This was from my first day in Vegas. I was a bit wore out from not sleeping much the night before and then traveling early in the day to get to Vegas early in the day.Yes I was a bit buzzed as well, but it was from caffeinated coffee and alcohol in it *giggles*This is my late Grandpa Lyle Francis who was a barber and from the story my Mom told me he didn't like long hair.I just loved this photo when I saw it and so had to take a photo of it to have a copy of it myself. I love 7/11's and Slurpee's and this was the first one I got while I was in Las Vegas, NV *smiles* I love hummingbird's thanks to my late Grandma Sally, so when I saw this and how cute it was all lit up I had to video it and share it. This is after we finished getting the bed put together and made up. Mind you, the store where we got it from we paid to have it delivered and set up for us and as you can see, that wasn't hat happend. That was also supposed to be the same thing to have happened for the dresser and that didn't happen with that either. This is the original twin bed that my Mom had and it had poking springs out. So, I'm glad she doesn't have it anymore.One night, while I was sleeping in it Cujo decided to hop up and sleep with me for awhile. This was my Mom and I before the Tournament of Kings show at the Excalibur.We were in the Hungary section.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window at night.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window at night.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window at night.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window at night.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window at night.This is the view we had outside of our hotel room window at night.The moon one night.The moon one night.Video of the balloon releasing on my Grandpa Lyle's birthday 8/28/15.The balloons as they went to heaven to visit my Grandpa Lyle on his birthday 8/28/15.The balloons as they went to heaven to visit my Grandpa Lyle on his birthday 8/28/15.The balloons as they went to heaven to visit my Grandpa Lyle on his birthday 8/28/15.Another Slurpee from 7/11.My Grandma Betty with her great granddaughter Aurora. My Grandma Betty with her great granddaughter Aurora. My cousin Orion.My cousin Orion.Cujo.Bruno.Xena.Xena trying to help us put dresser drawers together.Last of the balloons going to heaven a few days later for my Grandpa Lyle's birthday.Last of the balloons going to heaven a few days later for my Grandpa Lyle's birthday.Last of the balloons going to heaven a few days later for my Grandpa Lyle's birthday.Last of the balloons going to heaven a few days later for my Grandpa Lyle's birthday.Chipmunk on the wall.Chipmunk on the wall.I loved this when we saw it in the parking garage one day!This is not a good drink! This is the surprise I brought back to North Carolina for my cat Tallie!!!Just some clouds I thought were pretty one day *smiles* This is the dinosaur man's house at night!!! The two bottles of wine that I won one day at a casino!I wish I could have taken them home with me *sighs* On my way to the airport on my last night in Las Vegas, NV. Hoping to go back to Las Vegas, NV soon.I did win a few times at the casinos while I was there, but not like I did when I was living in Las Vegas, NV, but that is ok, because I still had fun. Hoping next time I go to Las Vegas, NV it will be a surprise trip for me taking my boyfriend Gareth out there for a week or two and just enjoying some sightseeing that I don't get to do when I go out anymore when my Mom sends me out there *sighs*"},

It is so easy to do. If you need help, just let me know and I can help you out.  On March 13, 2015, I had to go to the hospital and check in as an out patient by 8:30am. My colonoscopy and endoscopy was supposed to start around 9:45am. They asked me lots of questions and had me change out of my clothes and into a hospital gown and some special no skid socks that were bright yellow.Here is a photo of my boyfriend and I before I got taken away for my procedure:From my understanding I was going to be given propofol sedation and NOT this versed sedation that they gave me. I was awake during the entire procedure and remember it and didn't want that to happen because of my PTSD. I am afraid of being awake and remembering the pain because of when I got my mirena put in, when that is due again, I'm going to be knocked out completely for it because of my PTSD.May of 2013 they never knew what type of colitis I had, but they knew I had colitis from my findings of my 2nd colonoscopy and endoscopy.As you all know from some of my blog posting, my pain is mainly constant on my lower left side of my stomach/colon, however starting in October of 2014 I have began having constant lower right sided stomach/colon pain. There are also times where I have black tarry stools and sometimes see blood in my stools.Anyways, after my procedure, when I calmed down from being awake for it, I looked over my test results from the procedure and found out that everything looked normal, so my GI doctor didn't take any biopsies during the procedure, which he should have done considering my pain is worse and I still have signs of colitis, he should have taken biopsies to find out if my colitis changed to one that can only be seen under a microscope now. Not to mention, ever since I was a kid I have never liked to poop, because it makes me weak, sweating and causes my colon to be on fire.I contacted my Primary doctor, to get a referral to a new GI doctor, because I don't appreciate the treatment I have been getting from my current GI doctor and feeling like he has been trying to push me away, since I have been seeing him, not to mention he lied to me about the medication I was given during my procedure and blamed it on the hospital for my being awake during it.So, now I have to get a new GI doctor and go through another colonoscopy and endoscopy to get biopsies and find out what is going on with my colon and why my pain and symptoms are getting worse.I'm very frustrated and pissed off and don't see me ever getting over this anytime soon.I've been a member on this site for awhile and just haven't been to active on it lately, but I just got my first cashout from it and I wanted to share it with you all, so you can learn about a new site that I love that is legit and pays you to do offers on it.  This is my latest  search win that I just did today and I thought it was funny and I wanted to share it with you all and let you all know that if you all weren't already a member of this site yet, then you should join and start earning points today before the holidays, to help you save some extra money."},

I got a referral to one and get to have an office visit with them on November 9, 2015.I'm hoping they will work with me and do a new colonoscopy and endoscopy and this time get biopsies because my last GI doctor didn't do that during the procedure and that is part of his job even if everything looks good *rolls eyes* knowing I'm in constant pain still on my lower left side and having new lower right sided pain as of October 2014, should mean even if things look good, you take biopsies, right? I'm also hoping that the new GI doctor will change my meds, because my current medicine Apriso doesn't seem to be controlling all my symptoms and making things worse lately *sighs*I also don't know if it is a good or bad thing that my colon pain is up to the point that breathing is killing me, not to mention walking or bending over. So, I can just imagine that if I went to my new GI doctor today and they pressed on my colon to check things out, that I would most likely scream out loud in pain. Which is not like me when I get checked out, I normally am in just enough pain to where I just end up wincing in pain when they press on my colon to check things out.As of September 17, 2015, when I got in a tiny fender bender and ended up dealing with a tiny bit extra lower right sided stomach pain then normal and not being able to lay on my right side, I'm still as of today unable to lay on my right side, because of the pain.Click here to enter for your chance to win a Pumpkin Patch Flowers and Halloween Pops!Delivered by ProFlowers."},

It was a little stiffer to use then the traditional peelers I have used in the past, but it was a good peeler overall. I definitely give it a 8 out of ten,The twin peeler was a bit awkward to use at first but I finally figured it out. It was not so much a potato peeler, although you could of course use it as such, It made a vegetable slicer. Cutting thin slices to make a eggplant parmesan or a ratatouille. Thin elegant slices to make garnishes or other decorative food art. The other side of the slide cut small hash brown style slices. overall I was quite impressed with the ease of handling of the small peeler. My rating would be a ten of ten.I received the product for free or for a discounted price to review and give my honest opinion."},

I drank about half of it before I had to stop because if I continued, then it would be coming out the wrong end.I got to my appointment and signed in by 12:00 pm, like I was supposed to and I was supposed to have been back for my colonoscopy and endoscopy at 1:00 pm, but that didn't happen, because even after 7 times of being poked to find a vein, they couldn't get one. They tried 5 times in my left arm/hand/wrist and 1 time on my right arm, then 1 time on my left foot.Since, they couldn't get a vein, and they felt bad poking me so many times, they asked if I wanted to do the procedures awake and I told them no, because it would most likely cause me to have my PTSD act up and freak me out and I didn't need that, not to mention I was already dealing with pain and feeling like I was going to be sick at any given moment.They allowed me to leave just before 2:00 pm and told me that I would get a call later and let me know when they rescheduled me at the hospital for another one. The hospital has a few machines to help find veins that like to hide and are deep, etc. So, hopefully when I go for my next one it will actually happen and I won't get stuck 7 times again and then have to leave frustrated again like today.I felt bad because I feel like I wasted my time preparing for the procedures and my boyfriends time, not to mention their time. I also feel like I wasted money because the procedure didn't work out today. I guess my first two worked out better for me because they were done in the hospital where they have ways of finding veins that like to hide and especially so when you are dehydrated."},

{"title": "Stomach pain 24/7 sucks :( ", "date": "Friday, October 24, 2014", "text": "First off, I just want to say this is a post where I will be venting about my chronic stomach pain and also sharing info with clickable links for those that don't know about the conditions that I'm venting about.I'll also, be giving some background to some of the pain I have dealt with the last few years._______I have been dealing with chronic stomach pain since June 2010 and each day it seems to get worse :( I would love for it to go away and let me be pain free again, since I hardly have any good days even with the chronic pain at low levels, because it varies throughout the day. All of my major pain has been concentrated on my lower left stomach since June 2010.Well, in August of 2011, I experienced my first ovarian cyst on my left ovary, however, I was still in extreme pain on the lower left of my stomach.Then in May 2012, I lost my Grandma Sally Sunderland who I was extremely close to because she raised my sisters and I.I also ended up having surgery to get rid of my gallbladder because, during tests to see what was the cause of my lower left stomach pain, they found out in March of 2012 that my gallbladder was dead. Then during surgery they found out that it was sticking to other organs nearby as well. I also never had any pain from my gallbladder.Then in May 2013, I found out after my second colonoscopy, first one was March 2012, that the cause of my lower left stomach pain was because I have colitis and gastritis. I also started dealing with bloating and gas 24/7 not long after this colonoscopy.Then in June 2013, I got put on the med Apriso and still take it to this day.However, at the beginning of 2014, I had started to have a pain under my left rib cage, that feels like it is constantly being pushed on from an organ under it and scrapping on it. Not to mention being bloated and tender 24/7 stillThe pain under my left ribs and bloating is so bad now, that I am feeling nausea 27/7 from it and am extremely tender and can't stand to be touched on my upper stomach.Now as of September 2014 off and on it started with random sharp pains around my belly button that come and go. As of October 2014, the belly button sharp pains are coming and going more and radiating over to my lower right stomach and making me even more nauseated._______The pain under my left ribs, bloating, belly button pain, and lower right stomach pain. I have no idea what is causing it yet.I have been brushed off about the pain under my left ribs and bloating by doctors every time I bring it up.The belly button pain and lower right stomach pain, hasn't been brought up yet because I'm sure it is just due to my colitis, however if it gets worse between now and October 29, 2014, when I go to my first pain clinic appointment, then I will get it checked out. If not, then I will just bring it up to the doctors at the pain clinic appointment."},

It has a bit of spiciness to it as well as a vinegar taste to it. I have also found that it goes with all kinds of recipes, from meatloaf (recipe below) to hamburgers, to making a sauce with it to go with other meals (like the topping for the meatloaf below, along with the recipe for it!) Not to mention just using it as a topping for recipes! I give Delwood's Barbecue sauce a 5 star rating!Now you are probably wondering how I heard about this awesome company right? Right. Well, that is simple. I got introduced to Delwood's Barbecue, through my boyfriend, because he is best friends with the maker of Delwood's Barbecue Sauce! We went to his house one night and got a jar, and got to sample a barbecued pig, mixed with this awesome sauce! So, we bought some of the barbecued pig meat that night as well! Now let's move on to one of my favorite recipes to make with Delwood's Barbecue Sauce! It is my Grandma Sally's meatloaf, that I have now made my own thanks to the help of my boyfriend, so I guess you could say it is actually now mine and my boyfriends meatloaf, but I still have to give my Grandma Sally credit, since she came up with it. I would love to tell her in person about it, but she passed away on 5/9/12, so hopefully she knows by looking down at me that I have taken her awesome recipe and made it my own thanks to my awesome boyfriend and his friend for the Delwood's Barbecue Sauce.Regular sized meatloaf.Meatloaf Recipe~ Marinate the meat overnight in about half a jar of Delwood's Barbecue sauceThen the next day, mix in the following: ~ 2 eggs~ 1/2 cup of oatmeal~ Teaspoon of garlic~Teaspoon of onion powder~ Salt to taste~ Pepper to taste~ 1 package of Lipton Onion soup (powdered) ~ Shredded cheese or a Cheese stick or twoMeatloaf Sauce~ Pour the rest of Delwood's Barbecue sauce~ 1/2 bottle of Hickory Barbecue sauce~ 2 tablespoons of coarse brown mustard~ Little garlic powder, ~ Little onion powder~ Salt to taste~ Pepper to taste~ 1/4 cup of brown sugarThen once you move the meatloaf into the pan you are going to bake it in, you want to make an indention in the middle of the meatloaf to put the cheese into, then you are going to cover the cheese with the meat before you put it in the oven. Then you will bake the meatloaf for about an hour at 350*F. Once an hour is over, you will spoon some of the meatloaf sauce you made onto the meatloaf before you turn up the heat to 400*F to broil for about 10 minutes. Once finished you will serve the meatloaf sliced with another spoonful of the meatloaf sauce on top, serve with a side of mashed potatoes and whatever veggies you like. Now that you have an idea on what you can make with Delwood's Barbecue sauce, I want to move onto my boyfriends review of Delwood's Barbecue sauce, so you can hear from another person what they think of this awesome barbecue sauce!\"This is a review of my friend's eastern NC vinegar bbq sauce.  I have to say this is good on just about everything. We have tried it on meats, and sauted veggies. Mixed in meatloaf, and orange chicken. It is versatile and it does have a bit of a heat, but you can tone it down by mixing in brown sugar . I would definitely give this 5 stars, and recommend it to everyone to try.\"Now let's move onto the part that you are probably waiting for, since I have you hungry and wanting to try Delwood's Barbecue sauce! Let's move onto the giveaway that will be running from today, October 7, 2014 to November 1, 2014. It is open to everyone around the world! Entry-Form"},

I mean you get to enjoy the ocean and the lovely Summer weather as well as fishing, because it is an ocean related activity. I hope you all have a great Marine Day. Do you have any plans to celebrate Marine Day? If so, what are they? If not, how come?  The Happy Monday System refers to a set of modifications to Japanese law in 1998 and 2001 to move a number of public holidays in Japan to Mondays, creating a three-day weekend for those who normally have a five-day work week.You can read more about The Happy Monday System by heading over to this link! Today is the first day I have heard of The Happy Monday System, but it sounds like a great system that I'm sure everyone who works wishes their government would do so that they could have three-day holidays as well. What do you all think? Have you heard of The Happy Monday System before? Would you like to have The Happy Monday System where you live, if you don't live in Japan?﻿﻿"},

He still isn't sure what is going on, but nonetheless since I do have colitis, he renewed my refills on my colitis meds and then gave me a sample of align to try and said that it would be ok for me to try diatomaceous earth when my boyfriend brought that up. He wants to see me in three months and see if things have changed for the better or worse, so I will be keeping track with my GI app still as well as letting you all know how things go on here. I'm nervous about trying the align and diatomaceous earth, but am going to do my best and be optimistic about them working, because I hate being in constant pain."},

{"title": "Bad day yesterday :( ", "date": "Monday, May 19, 2014", "text": "Had a bad day yesterday with my colitis pain and accidents, so I didn't get to workout yesterday  I also binged (well to me it was binging, because I can't eat much anymore with my colitis and always being bloated and nauseous) on food and I felt bad about it because I knew I didn't work off any calories all day, like I had the first three days with being back on here  I didn't even drink water yesterday  With all that yesterday, I'm not letting it set me back today. Even though I couldn't sleep tonight with insomnia and my colitis pain getting higher  I am determined to get at least a ten minute workout in today and not eat so much again today, because I don't want to gain back the 5 pounds I lost since the beginning of the year, especially since I want to get my weight down a few more pounds before I go back to my GI doctor on June 2, 2014. Not to mention I want to get down 10 pounds by September 5, 2014 when I go to brain injury camp with my cousin again. I need more energy because we walk a lot at camp and I don't like not having energy to do the walking or enjoy it, since walking is my preferred exercise. Do you have any goals you are working on? If yes, then what are they? Are you doing good with your goals? If no, then why don't you? I am now as of yesterday working on being active on SparkPeople to help get me back in track with getting back in shape and feeling better about myself again.I have lost 5 lbs. since the beginning of the year, as of yesterday :) So, that makes me very happy, but I want to do better and actually see progress with my weight loss more in person then on the scale every few months when I go to the doctor.I go back to the doctor in 6 months (so November 2014) and I want to have lost at least 10 lbs. by then because the doctor didn't seem impressed with my weigh loss of 5 lbs. :( Even though I was very happy to see that.Starting Weight: 290Current Weight: 271.2 (As of 5/15/14)Lowest Weight: 130Goal Weight: 170Also, here is a starting photo, so that I can work on seeing progress again through photos, because it is motivation for me. Photo was taken on 5/11/14. So, I will update it again on 6/11/14 to see if I notice a difference in my looks. I will wear the same clothing that day as well.I have simple exercise goals of starting with working out in the morning and working out for 10 minutes everyday, if not more. Also, I am working on kicking out soda from my diet again and adding more water with crystal light into my diet again.Also, when I go to my GI doctor in June, I am going to try and find out if I have  a gluten intolerance and if I do, then I will be going gluten free as well, to see if that helps with my chronic stomach pain."},

I found out there are a couple of day rooms to hang out with him in and an internet cafe, that has a coffee knook in it, which we both love *smiles* I also found out that there is a court yard in the middle, that has doors unlocked so that you can go in and out freely with the residents there, because if you take them to the front porch, the nurses have to know and they have to unlock the doors for you.But with all the good things during the visit, I did find out that my Papa does have alot more work to do, to be able to come home again *sighs* I just hope he realizes it, because I would rather have him at home, then in a rehab place, where he seems too be happy, but also depressed :(Today only Lee is having a BOGO 50% on shorts and capris, plus free shipping on orders $50+.Good luck and be sure to enter everyday for a better chance at winning :)Be sure to come back and let us know if you win :)The Rock Of Virginia Win tickets to see Alice In Chains! | Contests"},

They are frustrating for a few reasons and I am sick of them and want them to go away now! Hell I wouldn't wish them on my worse enemy because they are tortuous!I hate having pain 24/7! Especially pain that doctors won't treat because I don't want to go see them and then when I do go see them they just assume I am drug seeking and I'm not. I just want something to control my pain, since what I am on now doesn't do shit for me.I also hate the joint pain that comes with having GI tract and stomach issues. It sucks because once again it is pain that doctors don't treat because they don't see it and don't believe it is there for me all the time *sighs*Why do I have to deal with health issues that doctors don't want to treat? I don't deserve this :( I want to be pain free again.Sorry for venting, but dealing with constant pain and feeling sick all the time when you look fine otherwise sucks and gets to you sometimes :(Great way to earn some extra money for spending time online.

{"title": "New colitis pain because I'm stressed? Not sure, but I don't like it :( ", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2014", "text": "I have a new pain that the only way I can describe it is by saying it is, \"sporadic sharp and right next to my belly button on the left side.\" For most of yesterday it would just come and go for a couple seconds, but cause me extreme pain when it showed up that made it feel longer and made me feel sick. Then at 9:30pm it was a constant pain, so I took a couple 500 mg Naproxen and a couple 50 mg Tramadol and passed out in pain because of it, but all throughout the night it was come and go with it and now it feels like my colon is on FIRE because of it and I feel sick because of the pain :( I'm sure it is from my colitis because I have been stressed so much the last couple weeks from a few family members, even though I don't feel stressed, I guess my colon does and so it is beginning to cause me extreme pain and sickness again :(I'm just hoping it doesn't get me sick for real because I will end up in the ER again and I don't want that :( I have too much to do and I don't want to be that sick :( Besides they can't do much for me at that point besides try to manage it to where I'm not sick and then send me home to deal with the constant pain. Sorry, just need to vent because I don't like to tell my boyfriend what is going on all the time since he has his own stress to deal with right now with trying to get on disability and get his car tags updated since we moved last year and they are outdated :/ He can't get a job and that stresses him out :( He owes the IRS money and is afraid since he can't pay them up front all the money that they are going to freeze his accounts to get the money he owes :( Which means all we would have left of his money is enough for five more months of rent where we live. I guess another stressor for me is also that I have a tendency to horde some things and not want to let them go because I think I may need them in the future for something. Also the fact that I am trying to clean and get organized and downsize more, but since I am a person that cleans in one spot for a bit, then gets bored, I take a break for coffee or a walk, then go back to cleaning another spot in a totally different part of the house *sighs* At least my boyfriend balances me when it comes to cleaning, because he can focus on one area and get it cleaned up even if he needs to take a break for a drink or a walk."},

I have been stressed, more so last week because I was there Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. My hours were longer then normal because of it. However this week I worked my normal days and hours give or take an hour because of having to wait till the high school girl got there to watch my Papa after me, but he did fine on Tuesday, however today (March 6, 2014), we dealt with him falling and I had to hit his life alert button and have them get the paramedics out to help get him up. Not sure how long it took for them to get there, but it felt like forever!!! As I waited with him for the paramedics to get there, I dealt with a flashback about how strong and independent he was before his stroke on December 12, 2004, and how weak and dependent he is on people now. Don't get me wrong, he can do some things on his own on his good days, but on his bad days, he depends on people more then he probably likes too and I know it frustrates and stresses him out. It frustrates and stresses me out too, because it is hard on me too, when he is having bad days. I know if it was me in his situation I couldn't do it. I wouldn't want to depend on people like he has too. It isn't a fun way to live. However, I have respect for him because it is hard to live like he does. I also am glad he is still around, because after my Grandma Sally passed away on May 9, 2012, I didn't think he would last long. Only because most couples that are older, don't last long after their husband or wife passes. I love my Papa and am ready for him to get back to having good days again, because if he doesn't that is going to make him end up in a nursing home again and I don't want to see him in one again because that would depress him so much more and frustrate him so much more. I just needed to vent a bit and reflect on the last couple weeks. I am hoping next week is a better week for my Papa :) Click here to sign up for your two free Quest bar samples today.

Was told from my new GI doctor that my biopsies from my colonoscopy last year didn't show good or bad results, but I do have colitis according to my last GI doctor however they are calling it Atypical colitis right now because they don't know much about it. He was saying he wants to do a procedure to check just my semicolon or something, however that would mean he would stop my Apriso and depending on what he finds he may not put me back on Apriso, even though it is mostly controlling my colitis right now. I still have the lower left pain as a dull ache most of the time, unless my body stresses over something and then my pain skyrockets or even if I'm not stressed and my body is just having a bad day then my pain skyrockets from the lower left constant pain area all the way to where it comes out. However, he was also saying that he is thinking that it may just be IBS or IBD and I tried to tell him, but he kept cutting me off that I have been treated for that and it has never taken my pain away or the symptoms, but he doesn't think I have colitis basically.I was told he would see me in 3 months and we will see how I am doing then. He didn't seem concerned about the constant upper stomach pain and bloating. I see him again on June 2, 2014."},

However, in my opinion, it doesn't look like anything *sighs* I mean it looks like it may be my arthritis getting worse :( If that is the case then it is spreading to my left knee as well *sighs* I am going to need some sort of pain management to deal with the pain between my arthritis and my colitis, because the tramadol and napraxon do nothing for either, much less both when they are acting up :/For those that don't know what colitis is, you can read more about it at this link.Bacon of the Month Club from Pig of the Month BBQMy sister and boyfriend would love this since they love bacon.  NEW! iStabilizer tabFlex Universal Tablet Mount and Flexible Leg Tripod from iStabilizerMilk Chocolate with Vanilla Bean Hot Cocoa (2-pack) from Cissé Trading Co."},

All you pay is the shipping and handling for about $12.95.A planner for a sane and fun third trimester: your last-hurrah list, smart maternity-leave strategies, and crucial conversations to have with your partner before Birth Day.1) Stay under the covers. Start with a yummy breakfast in bed before moving on to a Netflix marathon, celeb mags, and Scrabble with your honey. Then, lunch! More TV! A nap! Snack! Dinner! Relish the fact that nobody needs you now (except that guy on the next pillow), because very soon that will change.2) Do something class-y with friends. Think gourmet cooking, pottery, knitting, or even a one-day seminar at a nearby museum or art gallary, whatever you think would be a good time.3) Make a pregnancy flip book. Print out photos on card stock that your partner and family have taken of you (and your belly) throughout the pregnancy. Assemble them in chronological order and then staple together in one corner. (Or simply order a mini photo book on Lulu). When you flip through the pages with your thumb, it will look as if your belly is magically growing. Take that Pixar!4) Rock out! You've got a good long stretch of the Wiggles and \"Itsy-Bitsy Spider\" coming up-get in your music while you can. Tip: Steer clear of the mosh pits if you go to a concert.5) Write a funny letter to your baby. Keep a record of all the crazy stories from your pregnancy, like that recurring dream you have of giving birth to a hamster. Your child will find it hilarious when he's 10. Write the memories down, tuck the notes into an envelope, and file under \"Open in 2023.\"6) Cultivate a Mommy role model now. You'll need one during those notorious 2 am wakings later.7) Throw a mani-pedi house party. Tap manicurists or pedicurists from a salon, many will make house calls if you can guarantee a certain number of clients. Pick a day, invite a few friends, and get ready to flaunt your toes!8) Have a romantic meal of \"baby\" food. Plan a menu around teeny, tiny items: baby-back ribs or baby lamb chops, roasted baby carrots and peas, and those petits fours you're always drooling over at the bakery.9) Slip into something more comfortable.  Just in case you haven't yet discovered it, sexy maternity lingerie does exist. Pick up an animal-print teddy or a lacy bottom or two (you can find flattering choices at MommyliciousMaternity and BabiesNBellies). Then let the night unfold as it may. And in case you're wondering: the \"spooning\" position works well even when you're a week away from delivery.10) Get your belly on tape. 11) Make a date with Mom. Once your baby's born you might want to scoot out of the house when your mother comes to visit, free sitting! But now, treat her to lunch, pick her brain for parenting wisdom, and be ready to hear, \"It's the best, toughest job in the world\" about, oh 50 times.12) Go away. Now's no time to jet off to Bali, but you can easily make a quick escape.13) Treat yourself to something special. Why should you hold out for a push present when your fave shoe department (not to mention jewelry counter) awaits?14) Organize a sleepover. 15) Ask your hubby to read to your bump. 16) \"What's going to be our birth play?\" There's no way to predict how labor and delivery will unfold (if only!), but it's important to discuss how you'd both like it to happen. Put your wishes on paper so you'll have a document to share with your ob-gyn or midwife. Include whom you'd like to be there for the birth, what you'd like him (or them) to do, and which pain-management options and medical interventions you'd ideally opt for. Some couples also include atmospheric touches (classical music, soft lighting) and plan how they'll handle what-if scenarios (say, a C-section), then be flexible. Otherwise you run the risk of feeling disappointed if it doesn't go exactly the way you hoped it would. For labor and delivery tips for him, visit laborsupport.17) \"Are we doing circumcision?\" The health benefits of circumcising a newborn are greater than the risks, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). For help making your desision go to AAP and the website for the American Academy of Family Physicians, AAFP.18) \"Should I breastfeed?\" This is one decision that may seem to be yours alone, but having an informed and supportive husband increases your odds of breastfeeding longer. If you decide to nurse, discuss your goals. What steps can you take if difficulties arise? How long do you plan to keep it up? Also, share the role you'd like your partner to play. Do you want him to give Baby a bottle of pumped breast milk at night so you can sleep? Or are you okay with your guy sitting out of predawn feedings?19) \"Are we financially prepared to face the costs of parenthood?\" 20) \"What kind of help do we need at home?\"21) Know your rights. Read the Family and Medical Leave Act it protects parents' jobs-without pay-for up to 12 weeks after the birth or adoption of a child.To be eligible, you must be employed by a company that has at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius, and you must have worked there roughly 25 hours a week for at least a year.22) Find out your company policy. Visit your corporate website or read the employee handbook to see what your employer officially offers, a small portion give paid leave, usually 40 to 60 percent of your salary for a set amount of time. Calculate how many sick days, personal days, comp days, and vacation days you have coming to you. Your employer could require you to use them to cover a portion of your leave if you're entitled to it und the FMLA.23) Decide how much time you really want. Maybe you'd prefer to go back to work after eight weeks instead of 12, but on a part-time basis, or you'd like to work from home for awhile. Talk to other moms in the office to learn how much time off they snagged postbaby and how they worked it out, and then think about ways to \"sell\" your plan. You want to make it clear that your company will benefit as well.24) Prepare to talk with your boss. Be ready to discuss how long you except to be away from your job and whom you could train to replace you temporarily. After you've agreed to the terms, follow up with a summary of the details. Such a document isn't legally binding, but if there's confusion down the road, it can help to have written proof.25) Avoid over-committing. The office will survive without you! So don't answer messages or offer to log onto email until you have a sense of how parenting feels for you. Nothing is more important than bonding with your new boss (the baby).Disclaimer: The above came from the American Baby November 2013 magazine article by Marisa Cohen.This contest only has 8 days left for you to get entries in!

I then signed up for the walk and proceeded to talk to a friend I had only been talking to online since I was 14 or 15 and never met before. I enjoyed finally getting to meet my friend and her daughter for the first time ever :) I hope to meet them again at another Hanson concert or just to meet up for lunch somewhere randomly :) During the walk, I got a chance to talk to Taylor at one point, which was nice :)One day I will get to have pictures with them and their autographs, but for now just talking to them on the walks before the shows is icing on the cake for me :) I was going to meet them at the bus after the show, but my feet and knees were killing me and my boyfriend was bored, so I headed back to the hotel instead. I know that my photos aren't the best, but I enjoy them and that is all that counts right???I did get a few samples of four of the songs they sang and am going to be sharing them on my youtube account if you would like to check them out, please do, but be warned they aren't the best ever :/I gotta say that I loved the prank that Hanson did on David Ryan Harris even though I didn't get it on video or in pictures :( It was very enjoyable :) I also want to add that I think Taylor Hanson has a foot fetish or knows someone who does *giggles*Also, want to say on a more serious note, that the venue disrespected Hanson when two of the people that work there for security yelled out stuff a couple of times, when Hanson was getting every to quite down for their a Capella song. Tay and Ike after coming out of the venue before the walk :)  My favorite picture of Zac that I took before the walk :)  Before the walk started and Zac joined Ike and Tay at the table where we signed up for the walk :)  One of my favorite pictures I got of them before the walk ended :)  Just to prove that I took the walk on November 20, 2013 barefoot :)  When I arrived before the show at about 6:00pm or 6:30pm, this was my spot in line. My view when I got in the venue :)  David Ryan Harris performing :)  This is Hanson and David Ryan Harris performing the Christmas song \"Merry Christmas Baby\" :D At the very end where everyone comes on stage to say good night and what a great show it was :)  Me and David Ryan Harris after the show :) I didn't get his autograph because he didn't have anything to sign with, but I did buy his CD along with a Shout and be free shirt and a pack of key chains, because I collect key chains :)  Boyfriends slurpee is on the left and mine is on the right :) I made my boyfriend get one, even though he isn't a fan of them, because I am and I wanted to have more points for my slurpee account online *giggles* Basically whichever way you want to look at it and call it, but since both Thanksgiving and Hanukkah start tomorrow, I thought it would be best to give both recognition on my blog today :) In a little while I will be doing a post for things on Thanksgiving that you can do at the last minute to make sure you are ready as well as a post for Hanukkah at the last minute to make sure you are ready as well tomorrow.

Then we went to the grocery store and brought in the grocerys, once they were put away I turned on Just Dance 3 on the Xbox Kinnect and danced to 6 songs with a friend. So, I got a pretty good workout in today for not having worked out lately and it has me a bit more motivated to workout tomorrow if I'm not to sore, because I want to get my weight and energy back in check again, since I don't like how I am doing right now health wise and weight wise. If I can't work out though, I'm not going to sweat it because I have my left ankle acting up and my lower right back acting up on me since we started moving earlier this month. So, I don't want to overdue things since I don't want to end up in the hospital for an injury or even because I stress my body and get my colitis acting up to where I am sick. That would really suck, because I was close to ending up in the hospital earlier this week because of stress with my Dad *sighs* Anyways, hope you all have had a good day today :DAlso, do you all like to bowl??? How often do you bowl??? I want to be on a bowling league again soon, so might try to get on one come September :) Also, do you all like to dance??? How often do you all dance???

I can only move it and sit it in certain ways. Why can't I get the answers I need and be able to read my body like I used to??? It is frustrating me :( I have also been dealing with breathing issues since I got sick twice in 2011, once in June and then again in October is when my breathing got bad while I was sick and I have been treated a few times for bronchitis since then and the treatments help, but don't take it away, because I still wheeze and depending on what I'm doing, exercising or cleaning, it can get pretty bad, to the point that I try to put up with it over night, before I get up the next morning after not being able to sleep well, and tell my boyfriend to take me to the ER so that I can breathe again."},

Because I know there are readers of mine that love jokes :) *** Jokes of the day *** A biology teacher wished to demonstrate to his students the harmful effects ofalcohol on living organisms. For his experiment, he showed them a beaker withpond water in which there was a thriving civilization of worms. When he addedsome alcohol into the beaker the worms doubled-up and died. \"Now,\" he said,\" what do you learn from this?\" An eager student gave his answer. \"Well the answer is obvious,\" he said \" if you drink alcohol, you'll never haveworms.\" A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, non-stop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - OH, MY G-D!\" Silence followed, andafter a few minutes the captain came back on the intercom and said, \"Ladies andGentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier; but, while I was talking, the flightattendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see thefront of my pants!\" A passenger in Coach said, \"That's nothing. He should see the back of mine!\"-> One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tuckingher son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with a tremor in his voice, \"Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?\" The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. \"I can't dear,\" she said. \"I have tosleep in daddy's room.\" A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice: \"The big sissy.\"- A man who's wife was pregnant couldn't bear to be in the delivery room at thetime of the birth. So he thought he'd ring up later to see if it had come yet. He rang up and the nurse said \"it's a girl but theres another one on the way\" he rang again later and the nurse said \"it's another girl but there's anothercoming\" he rang once more and the nurse said \" it's a boy but there's another coming\" He couldn't stand it any more so he went to the pub and got drunk. An hour later he was really nervous. He was dialling the hospital, handsshaking, and accidently dialled the sports line. he asked \" how many did we getmate\" the person said \"198 all out.... and the last one was a duck\" - A judge grew tired of seeing the same town drunk in front of his bench. Oneday thejudge glared down at the man, who was still intoxicated, and thundered \"It isthe sentence of this court that you be taken from here to a place of execution andtherehanged by the neck until DEAD.\"The drunk promptly fainted.The court bailiff commenced to reviving the man, and looked up at the judge, atwhichtime the judge shrugged and responded \"I've always wanted to do that.\"- A rookie police officer was out for his first ride in a cruiser with anexperienced partner. A call came in telling them to disperse some people who wereloitering.The officers drove to the street and observed a small crowd standing on a corner.Therookierolled down his window and said, \"Let's get off the corner people.\"A fewglances, but no one moved, so he barked again, \"Let's get off that corner...NOW!\"Intimidated, the group of people began to leave, casting puzzled stares in his direction. Proudof his first official act, the young policeman turned to his partner and asked, \"Well,how didI do?\"Pretty good,\" chuckled the vet, \"especially since this is a bus stop.\"- A man goes on a 2-month business trip to Europe and leaves his cat with hisbrother. Three days before his return he calls his brother. Brother 1: So how is my cat doing?Brother 2: He's DeadBrother 1: He's Dead! What do you mean He's Dead! I loved that cat. Couldn't you think of a nicer way to tell me! I'm leaving in 3 days. You could of broke me tothe news easier. You could of told me today that she gotout of the house or something. Then when I called before I left you could of told me, Well, we found her butshe is up on the roof and we're having trouble getting her down. Then when I call you from the airport you could of told me, The Fire Department was there and scared her off the roof and the cat died whenit hit the ground.Brother 2: I'm sorry...you're right...that was insensitive I won't let it happenagain.Brother 1: Alright, alright, forget about it. Anyway, how is Mom doing?Brother 2: She's up on the roof and we're having trouble getting her down.- Software Upgrade      Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slow down in the overall performance, particularly in the flower and jewellery applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. and now Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Desperate  ******************************************** Dear Desperate: First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to enter the command: C:/I THOUGH! T YOU LOVED ME and download Tears 6.2 to install Guilt 3.0.If all works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly. WAV files. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 7.7. Good Luck, Tech! Support  It is a blanket for one of my friends for christmas, but i am stuck till i get more of the blue multi-color yarn to continue :( so for now i am working on a scarf that she requsted :)"},

Over the last few years, it has grown and become an important part of allowing companies to get their messages out to a broad spectrum of consumers.   What we have learned is that most companies would rather market directly to their current customers and have them share the messages instead of going through a separate platform like CALYP. Therefore, we will be shifting our focus to helping clients communicate through their own databases and social media channels.  This means that most paid sharing opportunities in CALYP will be discontinued going forward.  On occasion, there will be paid opportunities in CALYP, and we encourage you to check in periodically to see if those opportunities are for products that you would like to endorse.   Any payments due for November endorsements will be made on December 10th.   Again, we appreciate your support and help in getting brands social media exposure, and we look forward to partnering with you in the future.   All the best,   The CALYP Team By the way, any ads you try to post right now, don't add to your balance, so whatever your balance is right now, that is what you will be paid when December 10, 2012 comes around."},

Hand-selected by the Case for a Cause team (including philanthropist Katie Hamilton Shaffer’s personal wine label – and Member favorite – Toolbox), it's everything a wine lover seeks out, from summer’s poolside favorite rosé and Pinot Grigio to jammy Zinfandel best served grillside. \"Good\" in every way, with $36/case supporting 24 different charities (and standard ground shipping on the house), it's twelve reasons to grab a corkscrew.

Wednesday, July 28, 2010, I got to Richmond, VA at 6:00am and walked from the bus station to the 7/11 where I got some coffee to drink then left and walked to the Comfort Inn and reserved a room for the night, then I walked across the street to the bus stop and took the bus downtown so that I could go find the concert venue and sit in line for a few hours while I waited to check in to my hotel that afternoon. I was number 17 in line and texted with you and Jennifer because I convinced Jennifer to skip work that day so she could entertain me as I waited. Well, at around 1pm I got some flyers to pass out from another fan and then took a ride from another fan to the hotel I was staying at and checked into my room and left everything that I didn't need for the concert in my room. I then went back to the venue and got some water to drink and sat in the a/c for a bit because I was hot and thirsty. Anyways, I then signed up for the 1 mile walk with Hanson and got my ticket for that then proceeded to go on the walk wth Hanson which I started next to Zac Hanson and touched him and talked to him once :) I then ended up next to Taylor and talked to him once, then heard him say \"damn it\" *giggles* I also stood next to Isaac at one point, but I didn't talk to him or touch him *sighs* But it was so exciting to be that close to the three of them and it only took me 14 years to make that happen!!! I then got front row at the concert and was on Taylor's side, so didn't have a good view of Zac till the middle of the concert, but its all good *smiles* I touched Taylor's hand twice and then left the concert and called a cab to take me to the hotel and got there around 1am :P I then went to bed around 1:33am and got up around 6:30am. Thursday, July 29, 2010... I got up around 6:30am and then called Jennifer to get her up at 7:15am then got in the shower and went downstairs to get some coffee to start my day off with.... I then texted you at 9:00am to see what the plans were for the day and you gave me the bestest news ever saying that you were going to come and get me *smiles* I behaved myself as you ran your errands and then we went to your place and you fixed me something to eat after scolding me for not eating while I was there :( Also you gave me a drink I hadn't ever heard of before, but it was good :) We watched a show you recorded because you knew I would probably be interested in it. Then you ate something cause you said my eating made you hungry :P Then we began our session of spanking me all day :P You scolded me for my showing up when I wasn't supposed to in May and my lying to you and Jen back in May... you also dealt with my not bringing my razors :( You also dealt with my convincing Jen to skip work and you recorded that :( I would like a copy of that though... You let me cuddle with you on the couch for awhile and I loved that *smiles* You also wouldn't tell me your middle name *rolls eyes and wonders when she gets to know what it is* You also got me to help you in the kitchen some and I threatened to throw some dirty spoons at you, but didn't follow through with it cause I wasn't brave enough too... You had me stand in the corner a few times... hmmm... you were just the bestest ever to hang out with *SMILES* We left your place and then you drove me to the bus station and made me promise you that I would eat something and I kept that promise for you :) I also got to give you a few hugs and kisses and I loved that cause you give the best hugs and you actually let me kiss you and you kissed me *smiles* Friday, July 30, 2010... I got home around 2:00am then e-mailed you and let you know, then I went to bed for a few hours and called Jen to get her up at like 7:30am then slept on the couch till about 8:15am then got some coffee and got online to text with you at 9:00am then spent most of the day taking it easy and ended up napping for a couple hours and watching TV most of the day after you stopped texting with me. I had the best trip ever and would love to make my spending time with you again happen again and make it a longer time, but know that you have to let me know when that is possible and hope that can happen again soon, because it would keep me on track with my rules you've given me and also hopefully a dd relationship with you!!!    Have you ever met a celebrity?  If not, which one would you like to meet?I have met Chris DaughtryChris Daughtry and Me in McLeansville, NC after a free event he did after \"American Idol\"...

Please be warned that this came from my journal and shows some of my lifestyle that I am into because it works for me and my partner. Alright on Tusesday, July 27, 2010 I spent the day working on my chores and making sure that I had everything for my trip to Richmond, VA for the next couple of days. Wednesday, July 28, 2010, I got to Richmond, VA at 6:00am and walked from the bus station to the 7/11 where I got some coffee to drink then left and walked to the Comfort Inn and reserved a room for the night, then I walked across the street to the bus stop and took the bus downtown so that I could go find the concert venue and sit in line for a few hours while I waited to check in to my hotel that afternoon. I was number 17 in line and texted with you and Jennifer because I convinced Jennifer to skip work that day so she could entertain me as I waited. Well, at around 1pm I got some flyers to pass out from another fan and then took a ride from another fan to the hotel I was staying at and checked into my room and left everything that I didn't need for the concert in my room. I then went back to the venue and got some water to drink and sat in the a/c for a bit because I was hot and thirsty. Anyways, I then signed up for the 1 mile walk with Hanson and got my ticket for that then proceeded to go on the walk wth Hanson which I started next to Zac Hanson and touched him and talked to him once :) I then ended up next to Taylor and talked to him once, then heard him say \"damn it\" *giggles* I also stood next to Isaac at one point, but I didn't talk to him or touch him *sighs* But it was so exciting to be that close to the three of them and it only took me 14 years to make that happen!!! I then got front row at the concert and was on Taylor's side, so didn't have a good view of Zac till the middle of the concert, but its all good *smiles* I touched Taylor's hand twice and then left the concert and called a cab to take me to the hotel and got there around 1am :P I then went to bed around 1:33am and got up around 6:30am. Thursday, July 29, 2010... I got up around 6:30am and then called Jennifer to get her up at 7:15am then got in the shower and went downstairs to get some coffee to start my day off with.... I then texted you at 9:00am to see what the plans were for the day and you gave me the bestest news ever saying that you were going to come and get me *smiles* I behaved myself as you ran your errands and then we went to your place and you fixed me something to eat after scolding me for not eating while I was there :( Also you gave me a drink I hadn't ever heard of before, but it was good :) We watched a show you recorded because you knew I would probably be interested in it. Then you ate something cause you said my eating made you hungry :P Then we began our session of spanking me all day :P You scolded me for my showing up when I wasn't supposed to in May and my lying to you and Jen back in May... you also dealt with my not bringing my razors :( You also dealt with my convincing Jen to skip work and you recorded that :( I would like a copy of that though... You let me cuddle with you on the couch for awhile and I loved that *smiles* You also wouldn't tell me your middle name *rolls eyes and wonders when she gets to know what it is* You also got me to help you in the kitchen some and I threatened to throw some dirty spoons at you, but didn't follow through with it cause I wasn't brave enough too... You had me stand in the corner a few times... hmmm... you were just the bestest ever to hang out with *SMILES* We left your place and then you drove me to the bus station and made me promise you that I would eat something and I kept that promise for you :) I also got to give you a few hugs and kisses and I loved that cause you give the best hugs and you actually let me kiss you and you kissed me *smiles* Friday, July 30, 2010... I got home around 2:00am then e-mailed you and let you know, then I went to bed for a few hours and called Jen to get her up at like 7:30am then slept on the couch till about 8:15am then got some coffee and got online to text with you at 9:00am then spent most of the day taking it easy and ended up napping for a couple hours and watching TV most of the day after you stopped texting with me. I had the best trip ever and would love to make my spending time with you again happen again and make it a longer time, but know that you have to let me know when that is possible and hope that can happen again soon, because it would keep me on track with my rules you've given me and also hopefully a dd relationship with you!!!

The reason why is because after mixing it up it looked like cookie dough and not the way a bread mix was supposed to look, but nonetheless I still went ahead and baked a batch of bread and muffins from it, because that is what it filled up for me, then when it finished baking I took them out and let them cool, then went back to look and found that the bread had sunk in on itself and the taste of it all was just not banana bread.

Loosely described, Moola is something like a free super-jackpot game show, which allows anyone to become a millionaire on the internet, rather than watching others do so on TV. Similar to a TV game show, Moola is free and relies on sponsors to enable millions of people to vie for serious amounts of cash and prizes. The method used to facilitate competition is simple yet powerful: Sponsors give small amounts of money to millions of people, and then Moola allows those people to compete against one another so that individuals may win more or less, depending on how well they compete.To join in on all the fun just click here and sign up today :)Click here to like Optari on Facebook and win their new backpack :)"},

This method was told by a Police friend who had experienced andconfirmed it. It is useful.....even driving at night.Most of the motorists would turn on HIGH or FASTEST SPEED of the wipers duringheavy downpour, yet the visibility in front of the windshield is stillbad.......In the event you face such a situation, just try your SUN GLASSES (any modelwill do), and miracle! All of a sudden, your visibility in front of yourwindshield is perfectly clear, as if there is no rain.Make sure you always have a pair of SUN GLASSES in your car, as you are not onlyhelping yourself to drive safely with good vision, but also might save yourfriend's life by giving him this idea..Try it yourself and share it with your friends! Amazing, you still see the drops>on the windshield, but not the sheet of rain falling.You can see where the rain bounces off the road. It works to eliminate the\"blindness\" from passing semi's spraying you too.Or the \"kickup\" if you are following a semi or car in the rain. They ought toteach that little tip in driver's training. It really does work....This warning is a good one! I wonder how many people know about this, read on……A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. Aresident of Kilgore , Texas she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. Itwas raining, though not excessively, when her car suddenly began to hydro-planeand literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but verystunned at the sudden occurrence!When she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told hersomething that every driver should know - NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOURCRUISE CONTROL ON . She thought she was being cautious by setting the cruisecontrol and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highwaypatrolman told her that if the cruise control is on when your car begins tohydro-plane and your tires lose contact with the pavement, your car willaccelerate to a higher rate of speed making you take off like an airplane. Shetold the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred.The patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the driver's seat sun-visor- NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHENTHE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY, along with the airbag warning We tell our teenagersto set the cruise control and drive a safe speed - but we don't tell them to usethe cruise control only when the pavement is dry.The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides thepatrolman), was a man who had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustainedsevere injuries.NOTE: Some vehicles (like the Toyota Sienna Limited XLE) will not allow you toset the cruise control when the windshield wipers are on. If you send this to 15people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it..You might have saved a life. is going to be here in 25 days!!!"},

They are great for young users who are wanting their own phone.             Straight Talk has amazing smart phones, touch screen phones, and app capable phones with features like voice navigation, camera, video recorder, music player, instant messaging, and Bluetooth!!!             everything you need is a Straight Talk smart phone that I am looking to upgrading to soon!!!             call a friend or family member that lives in another country for a very cheap rate on any one of Straight Talk phones.             Imagine the amount of money you could save by switching to Straight Talk Hook, line and sinker             Straight Talk has two affordable plans to choose from:             ~ The \"All You Need\" plan meets the need of heavy phone users by giving you 1,000 texts, 1,000 minutes, and 30 MB of web data. It is also the plan that I get every month for myself :) It only costs $30.      ~ The \"Unlimited Monthly\" is only $45 and includes calls, texts, picture messaging, and web.      ~ Imagine getting unlimited calls, texts, picture messages, and web for only $499.00 a year!!!      ~ 411 calls are included at no additional charge.      ~ Free activation, reactivation, or termination fees.             What would you buy with the extra money you would be saving???             Straight Talk only uses trusted phone manufacturers like LG, Motorola, Kyocera, Nokia, and Samsung.      Also if you would like to hear a review of the coverage and reception of Straight Talk from an actual costumer other then myself then I recommend you checking out this:             <object width=\"425\" height=\"349\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/jaIMrd83feQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/jaIMrd83feQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>                    Still at lover's leap...

The path of least resistance is saying \"yes\" when you want to say \"no\" and that road is always paved with regrets and mistakes. While compromise is good and a necessary part of healthy relationships, no one should have to fully deny their feelings and remain voiceless while others dominate a situation. It might feel easier to nod your head and passively agree, but in the long run you are being cheated. While there might be a whole list of justifications and excuses for stepping off the path of your principles, staying true to yourself reaps countless more rewards than selling out to appease someone else.

These have NOT been edited yet and they may or may not get finished one day... ******Zac's Crush Ever since 14-year-old, Zac Hanson could remember, he had always had a crush on his next door neighbor Christa Stevenson, who was the same age, as him.  Zac lived with his parents Walker and Diana, his older brothers, Isaac and Taylor and his younger siblings, Jessica, Avery, Mackenzie, and Zoe. Zac's girlfriend Christa lived with her parents, who she hardly ever saw, and her older brother Vince.  For the last week Zac was being such a total brat, that everyone in his family was sick of being around him, not to mention, his parents had threatend to spank him several times, but had yet to follow through with the threat. Which Zac was thankful for, since he hated spankings with a passion.  \"I'm going to the park for awhile,\" Zac annouced after breakfast one morning.  \"Do you have all your chores done?\" Walker questioned.  \"Of course Dad,\" Zac replied, rolling his eyes and walking towards the front door.  \"Good because, if you don't then your going to be getting it good, when you get back if your lying to me. Not to mention, it will be the icing on the cake for all your bratty behaviour this week.\" Zac absent-mindily rubbed his bottom as he opened the front door and replied, \"yes sir,\" before leaving and knowing that he hadn't even started on his chores for the day. But Zac, just let all that go away as he went tothe park to meet Christa.  *At Christa's house*  Knowing that she was grounded for her behaviour while her parents were gone this last week, and knowing that her brother had ordered her to stay at home and clean the house all day while he was at work. Christa knew that it would be unwise of her to leave the house and meet up with Zac, but that didn't stop her, as she wrote her brother a note, to where she could be found at. What she wasn't that stupid to just leave. lol.  Anyways, it didn't take Christa long to walk to the park and find Zac.  \"You made it,\" Christa smiled happily as she ran up to Zac and hugged him.  \"Of course I did,\" Zac replied, hugging Christa back.  \"I didn't think you would be able to because of how you've been acting lately and all,\" Christa replied.  \"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" Zac replied sighing, \"and I shouldn't be here now either, since I haven't done my chores yet.\"  \"You haven't done your chores yet?\" Christa questioned, as she thought about the trouble that Zac was going to be in, when he went home.  \"Hell, I haven't even started them yet. Since I knew that they would take me ALL day and then I wouldn't get to see you today,\" frowned Zac.  \"You're INSANE Zac!?!\" shrieked Christa, \"You know that your parents are going to kill you now!\"  \"Damn, do you have to remind me of that?\" replied Zac as he rubbed his bottom.  \"Uh...yeah, because I don't want you to be in more trouble.\"  \"Well, don't worry about me. I am bringing it on myself, because I want to hang out with you,\" Zac kissed Christa's cheek.  Christa could only blush. Since she wasn't expecting Zac to kiss her.  \"Well, what about you?\" Zac questioned as he sat on the bench, \"Aren't you grounded still?\"  \"Ummm...me?\" Christa stuttered, \"let's not worry about me, since I really don't have to until my parents get back in town,\" Christa absent-mindily rubbed her bottom, before she sat next to Zac.  A couple hours later, Vince arrived at home to find his sister Christa gone and a note that read: Hey Bro,  I needed a break from cleaning. So, I decided to go to the park for awhile. Love,  Christa xoxoxo After reading his sister's note and seeing that it didn't even look like she did any cleaning whatsoever. Vince got back in his car and drove to the park to find Christa. It took Vince about 5 minutes before he spotted his little sister on a park bench making out with a boy. Vince annouced his presence by coughing some to clear his throat.  When Christa and Zac heard the coughing they both quickly seperated and got up to see Vince staring at them angrily.  \"Uhhh...hi...,\" Christa squeaked out.  \"What do you think your doing, young lady?\" demanded Vince.  Christa flinched at the tone of her brother's voice, not to mention the words, 'young lady' which she hated, since it meant she was usually in deep shit.  \"Ummm...I'm ummm...hanging out with...uh...my friend,\" Christa nervously replied.  \"It looked like you were doing more than 'hanging out'. Besides you know your still grounded and it doesn't even look like you cleaned at all.\"  Christa decided that staring at her shoes seemed interesting at that moment. Especially, since she felt like she was two-years-old and not 14 right then.  Vince then turned his attention to Zac, \"Do your parents even know your here?\" \"Yes sir,\" answered Zac truthfully. It got quiet then as Zac thought of running home, Christa stared at her shoes and as Vince thought about handling the situation.  \"Alright let's go,\" Vince declared as he grabbed Christa's upper arm, and escorted her to where his car was, \"your coming to Zac. I'm taking you to your house and letting your parents know how I found you and then I'll deal with you,\" he then used his free hand to swat Christa on the bottom.  \"OW,\" replied Christa as they got to Vince's car, \"that hurt,\" Christa rubbed her bottom where Vince swatted her at. \"Just think, your get more where that came from... and if you think that hurt, just imagine what my belt is going to feel like,\" lectured Vince.  *At Zac's house*  Vince stood in front of the Hanson household, with Zac next to him, as they waited for someone to answer the door. Diana ended up getting the door, and when she saw Zac standing there next to Vince, she knew from the look on Vince's face that it wasn't good news, even before she asked, \"what's gone on this time?\" \"Well, I found Zac, here in the park making out with my sister...,\"  \"You WHAT!?!\" interrupted Diana, as she glared at Zac angrily and tried not to grab him right then and there.  Vince's reply was to push Zac closer to Diana and reply, \"I just thought you might want to know what he was up too.\"  \"Well, I thank you,\" replied Diana, as she grabbed Zac by the upper arm and pulled him in the house, swatting him a good one, and then sending him into the living room to wait for her and Walker.  \"Your welcome,\" Vince replied and turned to leave to his car as he felt a tiny bit sorry for Zac, since he knew how Diana and Walker were strict. Besides, he had to deal with his sister still.  *Driveway of Christa and Vince's house*  \"Your in SO much trouble right now, that you don't have any idea,\" Vince said.  Christa nodded, \"I know and I'm sorry...I won't let it happen again.\"  \"I already know it won't,\" replied Vince as they got out of the car and headed inside.  Christa was headed to the kitchn for a drink, when she stopped, because of hearing what her brother said next, \"If I were you. I wouldn't be anywhere near me until I calm down and figure out how to deal with you.\"  \"Yes sir,\" Christa answered as she headed upstairs. ****** Zac's Crush Part 2 Walker and Diana walked into the living room, where they had Zac wait for them at.  \"Explain to us, what you were caught at the park doing?\" Walker asked Zac calmly.  \"Well,\" Zac started, \"I was on a park bench with Christa and...we started to kiss and...well that's all that we were...doing when Vince...um...showed up.\"  Walker and Diana knew that Zac was leaving something out, so Diana grabbed the phone, then asked, \"Do I have to call Vince and talk to him?\"  Zac gulped, \"I told you everything though,\" but Zac knew he was lying, he just didn't want to admit it.  \"Your lying Zac,\" Diana stated as she dialed Vince's house number and waited for Vince to answer.  Vince answered on the third ring. As soon as Vince said, \"hello,\" Diana asked, \"so what exactly were Zac and Christa doing when you found them?\"  Vince didn't hesitate as he explained that he found Christa and Zac hugging, kissing, and putting their hands in places they shouldn't be. Diana thanked Vince before they hung up, \"Well, what did Vince have to say?\" Walker asked his wife.  \"That he found them, hugging, kissing, and putting their hands where they shouldn't be.\"  Walker didn't say anything, he just shook his head, stood up, and started taking off his belt.  Zac freaked, \"please not the belt. It was an accident, we were just having fun...,\" Walker cut Zac off, \"having fun, huh? I'll show you fun,\" Walker folded his belt in half, \"Fun is going to be you not sitting for a week.\"  \"Please Dad,\" Zac whined, \"It won't happen again.\"  \"Oh I know it won't happen again, but I'm going to make sure of it,\" Walker stated as he sat next to Zac.******Untitled Story It had been about two months, since Vince, my older brother, had spanked me for going to a club and getting drunk. Vince didn't tell our parents what happened that weekend and Zac's parents didn't either. So, the only punishment I had was my brother's. Thank god...although he did spank me pretty good.  During the two months, I have been sneaking out of the house, doing drugs, getting drunk, stealing, and just being a total BRAT to my parents and my brother.  My parents weren't to keen on my brattiness, and therefore, turned me over their knees a few times and grounded me. My brother Vince, had been lecturing me on my behaviour, since he knew about all of it except for the stealing.  Well, now you see what I have been up to lately. So, now I have a whole five days with my brother being in charge of me and knowing that if I get into ANY trouble my brother has to report it to our parents, when they return,and then I'll be punished and depending on what I did, then my brother could be punished to, which is the part that he has always hated, since I am a trouble-maker.  So, my brother would lecture me on my behaviour and ground me, even though we both knew that didn't work well, because I would just get into trouble again the next day.  So, I guess that is why I pretty much stayed out of trouble after he spanked me for the first time ever, two months ago, for going to the club and getting drunk.  My parents were out of town for five days and my brother was at work, when I had decided to go to the mall and steal a few $20 CD's, without getting caught of course. I did make it out of FYE with the CD's just fine and was trying to decide what was going to be the next store I was going to be stealing from, when I was grabbed by my upper arm and spun around and was looking into my boyfriend's face.  \"I know that you didn't pay for those,\" he scolded.  \"Didn't pay for what?\" I questioned, trying to play innocent with him, since that always works. Not.  \"You didn't pay for those CD's. You do realize that this is my third time catching you stealing. don't you?\"  \"How do you always know? How did you know I was even here?\"  \"Oh I wouldn't worry about that, if I were you. I would be more worried about my boyfriend beating my ass and telling my brother, if I were you.\"  \"Oh come on Zac. You were just joking when you said all that.\"  \"Actually I wasn't joking when I told you that and you are going to give those CD's to me until you give me the money for them and as of right now your not to come to the mall UNLESS you have someone with you to make sure your not stealing. If you think I'm kidding about that, then I dare you to try me about it,\" Zac lectured me.  I was to shocked that he would talk to me like that, that I didn't realize we were in the driveway where I lived. ******"},

I will however be saving the pictures to my computer and making a post with them on here to show you all how much fun I had while in Las Vegas, NV this year :) I am sooo glad that I got to spend time with MY sister Seana, her husband Scott, and MY nephew Hayden while in Las Vegas, NV... :) I hope to get to do the same again next year :)"},

It seems like that will take AGES to happen and I hate waiting, but I guess good things come to those who wait right???"},
{"title": "July 27, 2010 to July 30, 2010", "date": "Saturday, July 31, 2010", "text": "Alright on Tusesday, July 27, 2010 I spent the day working on my chores and making sure that I had everything for my trip to Richmond, VA for the next couple of days. Wednesday, July 28, 2010, I got to Richmond, VA at 6:00am and walked from the bus station to the 7/11 where I got some coffee to drink then left and walked to the Comfort Inn and reserved a room for the night, then I walked across the street to the bus stop and took the bus downtown so that I could go find the concert venue and sit in line for a few hours while I waited to check in to my hotel that afternoon. I was number 17 in line and texted with you and Jennifer because I convinced Jennifer to skip work that day so she could entertain me as I waited. Well, at around 1pm I got some flyers to pass out from another fan and then took a ride from another fan to the hotel I was staying at and checked into my room and left everything that I didn't need for the concert in my room. I then went back to the venue and got some water to drink and sat in the a/c for a bit because I was hot and thirsty. Anyways, I then signed up for the 1 mile walk with Hanson and got my ticket for that then proceeded to go on the walk wth Hanson which I started next to Zac Hanson and touched him and talked to him once :) I then ended up next to Taylor and talked to him once, then heard him say \"damn it\" *giggles* I also stood next to Isaac at one point, but I didn't talk to him or touch him *sighs* But it was so exciting to be that close to the three of them and it only took me 14 years to make that happen!!! I then got front row at the concert and was on Taylor's side, so didn't have a good view of Zac till the middle of the concert, but its all good *smiles* I touched Taylor's hand twice and then left the concert and called a cab to take me to the hotel and got there around 1am :P I then went to bed around 1:33am and got up around 6:30am. Thursday, July 29, 2010... I got up around 6:30am and then called Jennifer to get her up at 7:15am then got in the shower and went downstairs to get some coffee to start my day off with.... I then texted you at 9:00am to see what the plans were for the day and you gave me the bestest news ever saying that you were going to come and get me *smiles* I behaved myself as you ran your errands and then we went to your place and you fixed me something to eat after scolding me for not eating while I was there :( Also you gave me a drink I hadn't ever heard of before, but it was good :) We watched a show you recorded because you knew I would probably be interested in it. Then you ate something cause you said my eating made you hungry :P Then we began our session of spanking me all day :P You scolded me for my showing up when I wasn't supposed to in May and my lying to you and Jen back in May... you also dealt with my not bringing my razors :( You also dealt with my convincing Jen to skip work and you recorded that :( I would like a copy of that though... You let me cuddle with you on the couch for awhile and I loved that *smiles* You also wouldn't tell me your middle name *rolls eyes and wonders when she gets to know what it is* You also got me to help you in the kitchen some and I threatened to throw some dirty spoons at you, but didn't follow through with it cause I wasn't brave enough too... You had me stand in the corner a few times... hmmm... you were just the bestest ever to hang out with *SMILES* We left your place and then you drove me to the bus station and made me promise you that I would eat something and I kept that promise for you :) I also got to give you a few hugs and kisses and I loved that cause you give the best hugs and you actually let me kiss you and you kissed me *smiles* Friday, July 30, 2010... I got home around 2:00am then e-mailed you and let you know, then I went to bed for a few hours and called Jen to get her up at like 7:30am then slept on the couch till about 8:15am then got some coffee and got online to text with you at 9:00am then spent most of the day taking it easy and ended up napping for a couple hours and watching TV most of the day after you stopped texting with me. I had the best trip ever and would love to make my spending time with you again happen again and make it a longer time, but know that you have to let me know when that is possible and hope that can happen again soon, because it would keep me on track with my rules you've given me and also hopefully a dd relationship with you!!!"},

I still have to buy my concert ticket and get a hotel room that night, plus make sure that I have some money for a taxi ride or two and some merchandise from the concert. Also, Hanson's newest CD \"Shout It Out\" just came out on June 8, 2010, and my Mom (Valerie) hasn't been able to find it in any stores in Las Vegas, NV or in Henderson, NV :( So, I still don't have the newest Hanson CD yet :( But I know I should have it for sure before Christmas :PWell, I am a HUGE Tetris fan and I just stumbled across this craft blog where they have pictures of Tetris block earrings... http://www.spritestitch.com/?p=2842 :D I would so LOVE some of those for my birthday on June 24th or for Christmas :) Feel free to get me some :) *hint hint*"},

So, I hope he's right cause I want to talk about stuff that is going on between us cause I'm so CONFUSED bout stuff that's going on between us right now and I FUCKING hate that and know that is why I threw a FUCKING tantrum today *sighs*I got my mail from my Dad's house and had a $100 check from my Mom, which is nice cause I wasn't expecting it, but I'm going to be putting it in my savings account because I NEED FUCKING money!!!Why the fuck the the electric bills have to go up again? My fucking electric bill is $237.37 or something like that :(It better not fucking snow tomorrow or Saturday, cause my Dad needs to be able to fucking work and make fucking money so he doesn't lose everything *sighs*Well, I think I'm going to go watch TV for a bit cause Bones is on and I LOVE that show :P"},
