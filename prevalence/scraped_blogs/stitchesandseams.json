{"title": "So Long 2023", "date": "Saturday, January 6, 2024", "text": "The holidays are over and all the sewing I thought I would get to while I was off work didn't quite happen. But I did manage to get two projects done, or mostly done. And I had lots of time for Cyrus snuggles and some reading.First up is a Love Notions Rhapsody, but this time in knit. It seems so many things I've made lately have been wovens that need to be ironed. Ugh. While I do press constantly while sewing, I'm not a big fan of clothes that need to be ironed before wearing. I mean I'll do it, but I won't like it. So, I'm back to sewing knits for a while to cut down on my ironing.The fabric I used is a very nice black/white ITY recently from Gorgeous Fabrics. (There was still some available last time I looked.) I bought 3 yards and I have enough left for a skirt for one of my 2-piece \"dresses\" should I feel the urge. I made no changes to the pattern from my first woven version, except to use the elbow-length balloon sleeves with elasticated hems. We've been having a bit of a cool down weather-wise and my supply of warmer tops is low. I'll still be able to wear this in the office during the hot days since it's usually an AC iceberg zoneHere's the inside with the \"burrito'd\" yoke. I again gathered the lower back instead of using the box pleat per the pattern. The binding and ties were done on my coverstitch machine. The black looper thread shows on the backside of the ties, but I'm OK with it. I'll take applying knit coverstitch binding over woven bias binding any day of the week. But I also seem to remember owning a bias binder sewing machine foot for wovens (like this). I may need to dig that out and reacquaint myself with it.To give the binding strip a bit more body and less curl as it feeds through the binder, I bought some SewKeyse 1 Inch Fusible Knit Stay Tape (that's an Amazon link, which may pay me a penny or two if you use it for a purchase). I usually cut up fusible interfacing scraps and use that on knit binding strips that need some help but this already cut and ready-to-go 1-inch tape seemed like it would be a great addition to the notions collection. And it is. I love that it's ready to go.Here it is on my ironing board being applied to my binding strip. (I finally bought a new board cover and this is the cleanest you'll probably see it.)My other project, which is not quite done yet, is a Seamwork Andi jacket. I really need a casual slightly warm jacket for around the house/yard and running errands, etc. Seeing this pattern made up by others on Instagram is one of the reasons I decided to go with a Seamwork subscription. I shamelessly copied my inspirations by using the same prequilted knit. I bought this navy colorway from Stylemaker Fabrics and I might have another color coming from Minerva. And OMG is this fabric so comfy/cozy! (And kind of a pain to sew with since it sheds its innards and is a bit thick and slippery.)What I did not have ready to go were snaps for the closure. I have a TON of Snapsetter (RIP) snaps that I was thinking would work but I hadn't even looked at them in years and it turns out they are all too small for this jacket and I don't feel confident that the short-ish prongs would be a good match with the fabric thickness even if I had a bigger size. So my jacket got a bit more expensive since I ended up buying a snap press and dies (plus bigger snaps) from KAMSnaps. My order should be here next week and then I'll finish the jacket.Here's the back, which is hanging very crooked on Zillie. I also have not yet added elastic to the hem. I'm still deciding on that and will make up my mind once I can actually snap the jacket closed.Even though this is a very simple and oversized design, I had to go my own way a bit with the pockets because they are shaped with a straight side to be inserted into a straight side seam and I blended between sizes, which created a very curved side seam. It's not a big deal, but I kind of think the instructions should have mentioned/shown that you'll need to apply the pockets more like a patch pocket if you do blend between sizes. Seamwork patterns are mostly geared toward beginners and I can imagine a beginner doing some head scratching on this situation. On the plus side, Seamwork's private member forum is very active and filled with extremely helpful people, so one could ask there if stuck.I cut the pattern pieces to match the \"pattern\" of quilting across the front and side seams, but somehow one of my pockets does not match up at all. I decided to just leave it. Besides the laziness factor, I didn't want to \"waste\" any of the remaining fabric since I should have enough left to colorblock for another pattern that's percolating in my brain. I figure there's so many lines going every which way and the pockets hang more to the side than how it looks on Zillie that no one but me (and now the entire internet) will ever notice. So that's the end of my 2023 sewing. I'll be back when I have my snaps on the jacket. I'm also planning to start a sweatshirt tomorrow so hopefully I'll have that to share soon too. Happy New Year!"},
{"title": "Seamwork Meg Dress (and Beatnik wadder)", "date": "Friday, December 1, 2023", "text": "Yep, you read that correctly. Seamwork. I've been eying the Seamwork Meg dress for a while. There's just something about it that called to me. So I decided to test out a Seamwork membership because with a 15-day trial membership you get a free pattern download plus access to all the other membership stuff (message board, member projects, tips, project sheets, videos, etc.). If I decided to cancel, I'd still be able to keep the pattern at no charge and I wouldn't be charged for the membership — your credit card is not charged during the trial period. Good deal, right? So, I downloaded the pattern to have a look at the drafting, sizing, and instructions. I printed out everything and taped the pattern together. It all seemed in order. (I have some opinions — shocker! — about some of the instructions which I'll share later but overall, they're fine.) And here is my dress (still to be hemmed). And I love it!My measurements put me in a size 20 bodice, but this pattern has a lot of ease and after reading through some of the Seamwork \"Community\" (message board) and seeing some YouTube videos on this and other Seamwork patterns, I think Seamwork patterns run large. I cut an 18 bodice and blended to a 22 at the waist/hip. My measurements would put me in a much larger hip size but there's plenty of design ease in this dress so I stayed at the 22. My sizing decisions worked fine. I also added length to the bodice. Instead of cutting the bottom edge at the 18 lines, I extended to the 22. Kind of a cheater FBA. Seamwork is supposed to draft for a DD in the larger size range, but, again, after my research, I thought I would need more bust length. I was right. The width is fine, but again, lots of design ease.The fabric is rayon voile from Fabricmart. It was supposed to be challis, but it's not. I'm not lucking out with Fabricmart rayons lately. But I do love the actual print. Also, I see that I still need to more evenly distribute the elastic in the channels so the waist is looking a bit wonky. (If only I could distribute my own waist so quickly.)The tie is organza ribbon from deep stash. I'm still \"auditioning\" it and I may end up making a tie from the leftover fabric, of which there is a lot. But I do like the bit of contrast so the ribbon may stay.These are the \"bonus\" sleeves, which are \"puffed\" and have an elastic channel to create the gathered hem flounce. Members get \"free\" bonus views of patterns that you don't get if you just buy the pattern without a membership. I think that's how it works, anyway. The non-bonus sleeves are flutter style.Line drawing of the bonus view.Here's the dress in progress to show how low the neckline is before gathering shortens it. I also added about 6 inches to the skirt length, much of which is now taken up by the waist elastic. I haven't done a final hem yet, but I'm thinking I'll keep most of the extra length.Side note:  Cyrus decided the pattern tasted good and I found this after walking into the sewing room one day. My fault for strewing pattern pieces all over the place. It taped together fine, but it turns out that the bonus view also comes with its own bodice pieces so I didn't need the chewed piece in the end.Now on to my opinions about the instructions. Overall, they are fine and will get the job done, especially if you have some experience. But some of the methods are not necessarily \"Best Practices.\" For example, almost everywhere, you are instructed to finish (zz or serge) seam allowances separately. Technically, that's fine. But it's not necessary to construct the pattern and on my lightweight fabric, serging one layer was horrible. I quickly ditched that after being sure no seams actually had to be flat. If there's no construction need for the seam to be flat/open, then I think the instructions should offer a choice. Ironically, there is no instruction to finish the seams of the CF bodice and facing, which means they end up raw edges which can be fiddly inside the neckline channel if your ribbon insertion doesn't go smoothly. The facing should be interfaced and it's not. This would eliminate one of those raw edges in addition to just giving the facing a bit more something-something IYKWIM. Another \"bad practice\" is you are instructed to sew the bodice sideseams before attaching the facing and doing the topstitching to it. Much, much easier to do all that in the flat and THEN sew the sideseams.Lastly, the pattern uses 5/8\" seam allowances everywhere. I know this is technically OK and standard for Big 4, but I personally hate a 5/8\" seam allowance on a sleevecap. Since this one is gathered, it wasn't a big deal, but if it wasn't, I would have trimmed it down.Out and out mistakes include some typos, a missing instruction to remove basting stitches from outside a seam allowance (the puffed sleevecap), and no instruction to understitch the facing join seam. These are things a sewist with experience would just do so they didn't slow me down, but a beginner would have no idea.So, did I cancel my trial membership? Actually, I did not. I'm enjoying the behind the scenes features and other members and there are a number of other patterns I want to download/try, plus I might actually go through their Design Your Wardrobe class at my own pace since my closet needs a huge overall. I think I'm actually seeing marked improvement from Seamwork patterns and practices since their early days and I'm willing to give them another chance. We'll see how I feel next year at renewal time.* * * * *Now for The Wadder (HotPatterns Beatnik). Ugh. This fabric (French terry) is so nice that I hate to waste it so I'll probably just literally wad this up and put it in a pile for a while until I can repurpose it. But the actual garment is a Big No. It just looks horrible on me. It's just too much fabric in the wrong places and not enough where it's needed, and the neckline sits funny on me. I've wanted to try this pattern for a while and I'm glad I did finally get to it. It's now out of my system. I'll be trying a Cashmerette Stanton next, I think. The topstitching looks so wonky in these pics. That's about the only thing that actually turned out OK, but it doesn't look like it. Hah.Parting Shot:  If you've made it this far, here's Alex prepping the bird for our Thanksgiving last week. He's an excellent Cook (haha, get it?). Seriously, though, he's done the turkey for a couple of years and it's always been SO GOOD. That's one of his 3 dogs, Oreo, standing behind him. Anytime anyone is in the kitchen, so is Oreo. It was a low-key but enjoyable day with my sons and all the dogs. I finished up the last of the leftovers last night. I'm ready for more turkey!"},
{"title": "Finished Fringes on me", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2023", "text": "Not my best photography (is there such a thing for me?), but also not on Zillie so there's that. Here are my finished Chalk & Notch Fringe dresses on me in mirror shots. That harsh overhead lighting and shadows for the Fringe #2 pics are doing me no favors, but whatever. I've now grown too old to care. Much. Hah. I wish this fabric would hold up, but it's just not going to. I suspect I'll be retiring it after a few more trips through the laundry cycle. I'll reclaim those buttons when it goes.This fabric is so much nicer, but it definitely feels a little heavier to wear. Both dresses are extremely comfortable since they are loose fit and flowy. Perfect for the very warm days we're still having. (What happened to that cold spell that was predicted?) This should be the last you'll see of the Fringe dress for a while. But it's a keeper and an easy sew, so it might pop up again after the navy dotty version dies.Cyrus, as usual, is pretty much Velcro'd to me and you can almost see him behind me. He's such a cuddle.I'm just about finished with the HP Beatnik top but I'm not loving it on me. It's very boxy. I'll finish it and it will be a house sweatshirt, which is needed because my made-for-Florida house gets pretty cold on cold days when we have them. And we do always have them."},
{"title": "Second verse, better than the first - Another C&N Fringe Dress", "date": "Monday, November 6, 2023", "text": "While my sewjo didn't disappear again, it was having a severe case of analysis paralysis. I just could NOT decide what I wanted/needed to make next. I have so many things I want to make that I can't make up my mind (sound familiar?).After making my first Chalk & Notch Fringe Dress, I had pulled out a much nicer quality cut of rayon to make a second Fringe Dress, but I kept telling myself I didn't need a second one quite so soon. But then I couldn't decide what to make instead and this fabric and my pattern languished on my cutting table, whispering to me. Since I wasn't coming up with an alternative, I finally decided to just give in  to the whispers and make the darn thing. Here it is. I'm not sure where the fabric came from at this point. Fabricmart? Fabric.com (RIP)? It's been in the stash for years. But it's much, much nicer than the navy dotty challis from the first Fringe. This one is a black rayon crepe with ivory herbs? (no idea) printed on it. In person, they do read as a horizontal and vertical pattern so I cut the front bodice pieces single layer to match the print. I think I did pretty well.  Since I was topstitching the facing, I wanted it to actually show, so I used a matching ivory/beige thread for the facing, and the sleeve cuffs. I went back to black thread for the skirt-to-bodice seam and bottom hem since I didn't think those needed to be quite so visual. Plus, I was playing thread chicken with the ivory and the bottom hem is fairly long. The buttons are silver metal from the button stash. I only had 4 so 4 it was. They are non-functioning since this dress goes on over my head. Which means I still haven't sewn buttonholes on my new machine. And apparently the sewjo knew best since the Fringe #1 is already showing wear/tear. I knew this fabric wasn't going to last. I have an identical cut but with an olive green background. It's not going to get anywhere near a final version of anything and will be regulated to muslin status. I'm disappointed because I really like the navy version, so I'll be on the look out for a similar but high quality fabric for a future Fringe #3. Next up is what I hope to be a very quick HP Beatnik sweatshirt since the temps are dropping here in Florida next week to a frigid 50ish (ha!) and I don't have sweatshirts I want to wear out of the house. I'm going to lengthen the sleeves and probably narrow the neckline and attach ribbing."},
{"title": "Boring Basic", "date": "Monday, October 9, 2023", "text": "I know many sewists don't like sewing basics, but, truthfully, making basics is one reason I'm back in the sewing room. No, basics are not exciting blog content. But they sure are workhorses in my closet. I have a RTW plain(ish) black top that I've never loved even though I wear it a lot to the office because most of my office wardrobe is pretty much a take on basic and/or black these days due to a relaxed dress code and opting for comfort over \"fashion.\" It's been way past time that I make a plain black top I actually like.So, I present my 6 zillionth TNT Ottobre tee (view 4 with the gathered front). This pattern is now 16+ years old and still going strong, both on my cutting table and in my closet. I have more than a few I still wear from when I started making them 16 years ago. (Gotta love indestructible polyester haha!) And if I haven't sewn a knit top directly from one of the multiple views of this pattern, I've used it to fit most any other tee I've sewn.  (In the pic above, the arrow is pointing to fabric I'm planning to use next for a skirt. It will be another boring project, but I imagine I'll get a lot of wear out of that too.)This is what this particular 02/2007 Ottobre Woman issue looks like. It's actually still available, only in Dutch, on the Ottobre website here. I'm pretty sure I'd still wear most everything in this issue. I really should revisit it now that I've re-stocked my tracing paper.I went \"old school\" with this top and used a neckline band instead of a binding.And as usual, I coverstitched the bottom and sleeve hems. Which leads to …… this little doo-dad. I've seen these hem guides a few places on the interwebs lately, and being the notions collector fiend that I am, it was soon in my Amazon cart and on its way to my sewing room. Yes, a stack of Post-Its still works just as well, but this looks cooler. :-) The package comes with two guides, which can interlock or not, and a little clear ruler grid if you want to set the guide up at a measured distance from your needle, which is probably more useful on a sewing machine and not a coverstitch machine. The guides have a removeable, and renewable, stickiness on the back to attach harmlessly to your machine bed. Here's the Amazon link so you can check it out (which is an affiliate link so I might make a fraction of a fraction of a penny if you happen to buy one from the link).  As you can also see in my hemming pic, I've finally found a good use for the sewing clips I bought a while back. I mostly press and coverstitch hems by eye but I usually use a few pins to hold things in place. Except some of the pins inevitably fall out as I'm going around the hem. These clips are a perfect replacement. Old habits die hard so I find the clips are still not as quick to use as pins in most of the rest of my sewing and they had pretty much been collecting dust. I'm glad to put them to use at last."},
{"title": "Chalk and Notch Fringe Dress - Finished", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2023", "text": "My Fringe Dress is done, and overall I like it. I'm still not loving the fabric though. The print/color is good. But the fabric quality is just OK. It's very drapey and comfortable, though I expect it to wear out quickly.The dress sat in Time Out for a week because the bottom edge just seemed so uneven and I didn't want to deal with trying to even it out. (I had eliminated the curved up sides of the pattern and just squared off the hem but that wasn't a factor.)Here's another view. It looks like the sides of the dress are hanging much lower than the front/back.Well, today I had the brilliant idea to finally try on the darn dress. And, guess what? The bottom edge hangs MUCH straighter on my actual body and not Zillie's. The dolman sleeves without arms in them made the sides of the dress hang lower. It's obvious NOW, but when I was looking it on Zillie, all I could see was the floppy unevenness, hence the Time Out. I decided that any residual unevenness is not obvious when I'm wearing it, so I just hemmed it, added buttons, and called it Done. (Do you see my Cyrus—aka Velcro—behind me?)Here's the back view. (I really need to fix Zillie's tilt.)The inseam pockets.And the sleeve \"cuffs\" that are the View B sleeves bands, which aren't really cuffed and there are no tabs. I didn't want to fiddle with those.I also didn't want to fiddle with buttonholes. The dress fits over my head fine so I just sewed the buttons on, by machine, through all the layers. Before I get into my very few quibbles, I'll say the pattern goes together very well, I like it, and I'm sure I'll make it again. Now here we go on the quibbles …The PDF prints in landscape orientation and I found that kind of awkward. It's not a deal breaker and I know I'm being nit-picky, but I do wish at least the instructions were portrait oriented. It's just what feels \"normal\" to me. I kept reading the left side of the page top to the bottom and then the right side, like columns and not rows, and the instructions are oriented in rows not columns, so I was reading out of numerical order and had to keep self-correcting.I found it completely ridiculous that there are about 20 pages devoted to patterns for interfacing. (Outlined in yellow below.)And even if you deselect those sizes in the layers tab of Acrobat, the interfacing pages still print with the page outlines and number watermarks. Yes, I could have checked and done a custom page selection before clicking Print but since I print at the office, I tend to just print everything because I blend between sizes and I want to be sure I don't miss something. Even with the \"key\" telling you what to print for certain sizes, it's difficult to know which pages are actual pattern pieces and which are interfacing pieces. If you're using your own printing supplies, you may want to check what pages you can eliminate from printing. Twenty extra is a lot.After all that, I didn't even use the interfacing patterns, preferring instead to block fuse my interfacing to my fabric and cut out the facing pieces that way. The instructions have you fuse the interfacing to the garment wrong side instead of to the facings, although fusing to the facings is an \"option\" mentioned. Fusing to the garment side of things is way too fiddley for me, especially with this floppy rayon challis. (See here if I didn't explain well.) I'll also mention that the interfacing pattern pieces do not include seam allowances, which can be good in theory but extra fiddley to place accurately. Also, you shouldn't be using interfacing on this dress that is thick/firm enough to be a problem in the seam allowances so I think eliminating the seam allowances from the interfacing pieces is not really necessary here. Plus, I *like* the interfacing to go to the edge of my facings, especially on fabric that ravels when you just look at it sideways. And I don't turn under the edges of my facings - I just overlock/serge those suckers, at least for non-fancy stuff like this. So I guess what I'm saying is the instructions are fancier than I sew. Haha.But the instructions overall are good. Not too verbose and well-illustrated with diagrams/drawings. If you prefer photo instructions or want more fitting help, there's also very good extra information on C&N's sew along pages, here.Like I said above, I do want to make this again and I like the pattern. Any negatives I've detailed above are not show stoppers and are easily remedied or overlooked. I also hope to get a decent pic of me in this one, but who knows when that will happen. Question(s) of the Day: Do any of you watch sewing channels on You Tube? Who are your favorites? I have a few but I'm always looking for new ones. I miss the sewing shows from PBS. Sandra and Nancy and Shirley were gems, weren't they?"},
{"title": "Quickie Update", "date": "Monday, September 25, 2023", "text": "I was able to get the Chalk & Notch Fringe dress pattern put together and cut out on Friday and over the weekend. I even started sewing it yesterday.So far, so good. But I think I hate the fabric and if I continue to hate it, this will be a muslin/toile. The fabric is more lightweight than I was expecting, which I could work with, but it also seems kind of low quality. By that I mean that it just seems like it will fade and show wear fairly quickly. Just a hunch. Hopefully, I'm wrong.The pattern, on the other hand, seems good. Everything is going together nicely so far. I do have a few opinions (surprised?) which I'll detail whenever I make a final post about this dress. Nothing really bad at all — just my own preferences on some things. So now that the sewjo is back, I'm seeing all sorts of things I want to make and there's not enough time in my days. One thing on the short list is this Double Vision glasses case for toting two pairs of glasses in one case. I'm always juggling between my prescription sunglasses and regular glasses and it would be nice to have a pretty single case instead of two ugly boxy ones. The boxy ones are good for protection but I'm not actually going anywhere where I'm slamming down my purse, so an interfaced fabric case should be fine to protect my eyewear from lens scratches while inside my purse. I'm not sure exactly how I ran across this pattern, probably from looking at the designer's sewing room tour on YouTube. But the pattern is only $2.95 and the video tutorial looks like it will be a fast and easy project. Also, good Christmas gift for my sister. I'm not affiliated or anything — just sharing. Wawak has all the interfacings/notions needed, which I ordered (and which brought the cost of the $2.95 pattern up substantially. Haha.). I'm sure I have plenty of quilting cottons in the stash that will work fine for this so at least I'm \"saving money\" on that part. Parting shot: My table in the midst of a project. I need to figure out a second surface for this room so I'm not constantly moving things on/off the cutting table. Maybe a bookcase to the left with a couple of empty shelves for in-progress stuff. I've already filled up the shelves below the table."},
{"title": "What's New?!", "date": "Wednesday, September 20, 2023", "text": "I haven't done any actual sewing since my last post, but I have done some sewing adjacent activities.I've been working on the Chalk and Notch Fringe dress. First was assembling the PDF. This is NOT a no-trim pattern. Boo. I spent an evening in front of the TV trimming the pages. Yes, I know I could do the \"fold a corner thing\" but actually trimming gave me an excuse to do something sew-y that didn't take much brain power. I left the TV to assemble the pages and sort out which pages/pieces I needed and which I didn't. Thankfully, I can use my office printers and not worry about ink or paper because there were a LOT of wasted pages, like 10-ish or so pages just for interfacing patterns and 5-6 that ended up being blank after turning off smaller size layers. I don't use/need interfacing patterns and I either just block fuse (preferred) or I use the actual pattern pieces. I certainly didn't need to print interfacing patterns for a bunch of different sizes but I found the \"key\" for which pages to print kind of fiddly and/or my brain just was not on full power. I generally print ALL the pages (thanks office!) and the sizes around my general base size and then I sort out which of them I actually need to put together. The fabric I'm planning to use is below. It's the Fabric Mart navy blue/dotty rayon from one of my last posts, which is now hanging over my chair since I pre-washed and pressed it.The big (BIG!) sewing-adjacent activity (previewed on Instagram) was bringing in my Designer 1 for service (finally!) and also coming home with this. Meet my new toy! It's not a top of the line anymore but it's certainly at least 50 steps up from my Designer 1. It's weird (and not gonna lie, still a teeny bit annoying) to have to wait for my sewing machine to boot up. But it's also very cool to have a 21st Century sewing machine. This one better not die before I do. Not that my D1 is dead — I expect to pick her up in a couple of weeks.I went into the store set on a Topaz 50. But there were a couple of quirks I just wasn't thrilled with. Silly, minor things but things that would bug me nonetheless. Don't get me wrong, the Topaz is an excellent machine and I almost came home with one but … I spent a good 2+ hours in the store (an independent fabric store slash Viking/Pfaff/Singer dealer) and the saleswomen were very patient with me, letting me go back and forth between machines and do whatever I wanted with no pressure, and in the end, the owner/saleswoman dropped the price of the Sapphire 85 considerably lower than what I have ever seen for a new OR used one and that pretty much sealed the deal for me. If you're ever in my area and need a new machine or sewing stuff, I highly recommend Fabric Warehouse in Lakeland. (Side note and probably one reason for the extra good price on my Sapphire — There's a new Designer Epic 3 coming out next month that's going to cost ~$25K. It's quite a machine from the previews but for that price, it had better drive me to the fabric store too.) Here's the internet on my new machine. Well, sort of. I haven't actually created my account yet.Here's the regular stuff.All of my Designer 1 feet and accessories are 100% compatible, including embroidery hoops, which is great news because I have about every foot made and it's nice to not have to re-buy them. But I knew that before heading to the store which was another reason I stuck with same \"family,\" the main reason being I'm just a Viking girl.But there are some Viking feet I didn't know about until I started looking at new machine stuff, including an \"interchangeable\" walking foot. It's just like a regular walking foot except there are specialty feet options, such as an edge joining foot, a 1/4\" guide foot, and others, so you can dual feed AND precisely topstitch/edgestitch at the same time. Cool, right? I'm not sure how often I'll actually need it, but I was stupidly happy one was included with my new machine. My name is Debbie (hi Debbie!) and I have a machine/accessories problem. ;-) I'm hoping to get my dress cut out before the weekend so I can actually SEW for real on this new machine. I will not be shopping for a while."},
{"title": "Niagara No. 3", "date": "Tuesday, September 12, 2023", "text": "Continuing on with the (unplanned) turquoise and navy theme of the month, I made my third Pattern Niche Niagara top in stash ITY knit from Fabric Mart (I think).For this one, I extended the cut-on-fold pattern pieces so I could cut flat in order to center some of the motifs in a more pleasing manner than willy-nilly. I'm not going to lie - this was a Royal Pain in the Arse since I had 4+ yards of this fabric and wrangling the slipperyness and weight of it over my cutting table and then cutting the big pieces was a Chore. But it all worked out and I'm happy with the design placement (although I could be a tiny bit happier with the lower front bodice but I wasn't about to re-do it for something no one but me will notice/care about.) I do love how the back yoke turned out.This fabric has a border print along each selvedge and I decided to take advantage of it for both the neck binding and by adding sleeve bands.  To go along with my blog return, I also cracked open my Instagram account yesterday and posted a couple of these photos, noting that my binding skills seem to be like riding a bike. Whew! I don't, however, think my current bike riding skills are like binding with a coverstitcher. ;-) Part of the \"skill\" is using scraps of fusible interfacing on the binding strips to give them a bit of oomph and to prevent the edges from curling. Match the direction of stretch in the interfacing to the crosswise stretch of the binding.I guess I've been in a hole, but apparently quilters are using coverstitch binders on their sewing machines to attach quilt bindings? Of course, the sewing machine companies aren't calling them coverstitch binders and are selling them at high dollar with specialty plates so the binder can be attached to the sewing machine. Interesting. Anyway, I saw a tip in a You Tube video (13:15 mark) to use an awl between the foot and binder to help guide the binding, as shown below. It's a good tip and I highly recommend it when coverstitching a binding on.Are you Team All The Pins when you attach gathering to a non-gathered piece? I say the more the merrier and sew very s-l-o-w-l-y over them. Next up will be a skirt to match this top. I'm not sure of the length yet (probably midi so I'm not a complete walking wallpaper) but I do want to try to incorporate more of the border into it. There's now less of the fabric to wrestle so hopefully cutting out will be a little easier."},
{"title": "A Bit of Shopping", "date": "Sunday, September 10, 2023", "text": "I am truly and well back into the sewing thing, as evidenced by my recent shopping sprees. Yes, I have two cabinets (plus some bins in the garage) full of fabric. Does that stop me from adding to the collection? Nope. I feel I'm preaching to the choir.In the top row below are ITY knits purchased from Gorgeous Fabrics. The solid black will become a top of some sort. The b/w print a top and skirt. And the coral/white dots likely another top and skirt. The bottom row are all rayon challis purchased from Fabric Mart. They are bit thinner than I was expecting, but they will still work for tops and dresses. They are being prewashed as I type. I hope to stay away from further fabric purchases since I really have more than enough and I actually WANT to sew some of the stash so I can finally wear it. But I had to dip my toe in a little bit to get the sewjo into high gear. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.I also went on a bit of a PDF pattern buying bender. I now own the Chalk & Notch Fringe, the Itch to Stitch Nittany, and the Love Notions Saltwhistle. I will print them when I'm in the office next week, because free office printing is one of the perks of actually going into the office.The Fringe will be first up in the woven category but not until I've sewn another knit top currently in the works (see below). I will definitely have to muslin this one and I'm sure I'll be adding length to the skirt and straightening the shirt tail hem. The Nittany below has neckline pleats which are impossible to see in this print. There's also an option for a keyhole in the middle of the pleats. Not sure which option I'll try, but this will be another I'll have to muslin.And finally the Saltwhistle, which was on a $5 Friday sale. I'm not in love with the scallops, especially as tiers, but I do like the square neckline. I'll likely make a dress version with short sleeves. I'm sure I'll need a muslin for this one too. At least in Swedish Tracing Paper if not fabric.The biggest purchase is a sister for my Designer 1. But by \"big\" I mean a mere fraction of what I paid new for my original D1. I paid nearly $5K for my original about 20 years ago. (Gah, How has it been that long??!) I paid $170 on Ebay for its sister. Sister seems to work very well, but it does have a couple of issues that will need to be fixed at the local repair shop. First, the thread cover broke off in shipping. Well, one of the hinges holding it in place. (My original D1 with the thread cover flipped up is on the right, the \"new\" one is on the left.) Second, the auto thread cutter \"thingie\" is completely missing so it doesn't cut the bobbin thread. This missing piece wasn't mentioned in the listing and the seller has not responded to any of my inquiries, so Boo on that. But the machine itself seems to work well otherwise so I'm going to keep it anyway and just get those things fixed and still feel I got a good deal. I can snip threads with scissors until then.You're probably wondering why I bought a SECOND machine exactly like my original? Well, the truth is that while I ADORE my D1, it has some things that need fixing too and I've been just limping along for YEARS instead of bringing it in for repairs. I just haven't wanted to be without it while it's in the shop. Yes, I haven't actually been sewing for the last couple of years so I could have EASILY been without it (and I do have other \"vintage\" machines), but sewing and machines were not top of mind. Now that they are again, I just decided I must have a comparable backup. And well, just because. :-) I thought $170 was a reasonable backup price, not that I don't think my original was worth every penny I paid because it was/is and I still love it.It's going to be a shock to be sewing with a working reverse, a light over the needle, and a fix button that I don't have to trick into working by re-selecting my stitch every time I want to end a seam. Yes, I have been sewing without a reverse for years. How ridiculous pitiful lazy is that? So my plan is to bring my original D1 into the shop next weekend and keep its sister at home to sew. Then I'll switch them when my baby is ready. I also might want to look at some new machines. Ahem. I never did spend that Pandemic relief money so who knows? Currently on the cutting table is another Niagara top. My last one was one of the last things I made a couple of years ago before the sewjo went MIA. I still love/wear it and want another. Stay tuned."},
{"title": "Soller Top - It's a Quickie", "date": "Wednesday, September 6, 2023", "text": "This is the Soller top from Itch to Stitch. It was a very fast sew! There's only one front and one back piece plus neck and sleeve bindings, and everything goes together very well. I like the top and the pattern a lot and I can see myself reaching for the Soller for more quick tops to be worn both at the office and around the house. The fabric is from Gorgeous Fabrics, one of the last pieces of fabric I bought before the sewjo up and vanished a couple of years ago. It was listed as a pique finish ITY but it feels more like Liverpool. I like the texture of it. The background is navy, although it shows up close to black here.Below is the \"envelope\" cover for the pattern, with the designer Kennis modeling. As you can see, her finished top is at high hip level. I added about 3 inches in length to mine, 1 inch at the lengthen/shorten lines and 2 inches to the hem. I would have added everything to the hem but because I had to blend sizes dramatically due to Pandemic Butt, I opted to add some of the extra length near the waist to smooth out the resulting curve from the blending.The bindings are \"old school,\" meaning no coverstitch machine was used, and remind me of my sewing days before coverstitchers and sergers and using Kwik Sew methods. (RIP Kwik Sew.) Just attach binding RS to top RS, flip the binding over the neckline edge, and stitch-in-the-ditch from the top to catch the other side of the binding. You can see a hint of my ditch stitching. It really is a good method and faster than setting up my binder on the coverstitch machine.For the vee \"point,\" you clip at the point and attach the binding in a straight line and then stitch at the center to (re)create the vee. The print placement sort of makes my vee look off-center, but it's not. It is actually a true perpendicular line down from neck edge to point.There is some \"interest\" at the upper chest, using clear elastic and a zigzag stitch to create gathers. If you make this top/dress, I would advise cutting your elastic longer than the pattern instructions so you have \"tails\" to hold on to when starting/stopping your zigzagging. You can then trim the excess tails off once your elastic is attached.I did pull out the coverstitcher for the hem. Nothing too exciting here.  The only other change to the pattern/instructions I made was to add about an inch to the bottom of the sleeve and to attach the binding strip as a band and not as a binding for a bit more length. As the pattern is, the sleeves are more like cap sleeves and I wanted a little more coverage. I also edgestitched the seam allowances up.Nothing too fancy here either. I didn't even use my serger to finish the edges, choosing to keep this \"old school\" as well. I did serge the shoulder and side seams which you can alllllmost see down at the bottom left of the photo below.Here's the top with a RTW navy maxi which matches perfectly. I also have more than enough of this fabric left for a matching skirt to create yet another 2-piece dress, which I will probably do at some point. Cyrus isn't yet sure what to make of Zillie. Until recently, she hadn't really been in use much since Cyrus came to live with me.Since I've been using stash fabric for my recent projects, I gave myself permission to shop a couple of Labor Day sales. I really hadn't bought fabric in well over two years, so I have a lot of catching up to do. Hah."},
{"title": "Hurricane Sewing - Melody Dolman", "date": "Thursday, August 31, 2023", "text": "As I've mentioned, my firm has moved to a new building. This new building's management has slightly different policies during hurricane times in Tampa, and I'm here for them (the new policies — hurricanes not so much)! This building shuts down as soon as there is an official Hurricane Warning from the weather service. Well, that official warning for Idalia came Monday afternoon. Which means the building and my office was closed from then through yesterday (Wednesday), and it was sewing time! It felt like a \"snow day\" from my youth. As far as the hurricane, I had nothing but rain Tuesday night and never lost power. It's still rainy today so I'm tired of rain but I'll take that over an actual hurricane.Below is my finished Love Notions Melody Dolman. It's too big on Zillie because Zillie is currently smaller than me. I was able to look at past orders online where I learned this fabric is a rayon challis I bought from Fabricmart in 2020. That's the last of the old dryer fabrics. The sewing part was a breeze (hurricane pun?). But the buttonholes made me want to scream. My (now ancient but still loved) Viking D1 is in sore need of servicing and it just did NOT want to make buttonholes without a fight. Ripping out a black thread buttonhole on b/w fabric is not a pleasant job. After doing that once, I decided to move to Plan B …… which was bringing out my Featherweight and the Singer buttonhole attachment. I shouldn't have grumbled about this because it didn't take long to set up, review You Tube to be sure I was threading and attaching correctly, and then make 6 perfect buttonholes in a row. Plus, it was fun to visit with my Featherweight. Here are the finished Featherweight buttonholes. Sorry, you can't see much with the black thread on b/w. (One of my near-future projects really needs to be a new ironing board cover.)Below you can see the edges of my buttonhole and the buttons I chose for this top, as well as my fading chalk marks for placement. These buttons are from Carolyn years and years ago. Thank you again Carolyn! I went with 6 buttons instead of the 5 per the pattern. I may have even gone for 7 if I had 7 buttons. I like less gaping opportunity.Overall, I think the pattern is pretty good and goes together well. The only other thing I'd change (and I did) would be to interface the entire integrated facing instead of using just a strip per the pattern below. Here's the inside of the shirt. Nothing too exciting here. I attached the cuffs technically wrong but I wanted them to be bands and not cuffs so they're attached opposite of the pattern instructions. At the bottom of the shirt, I turned up a 3/8\" hem, twice, and stitched it from the wrong side. The Melody has a standard camp collar, with good instructions, although I question why they have you snip 1/2\" into a 3/8\" seam allowance. I think that's a typo? But if you've been lounging around your living room watching Netflix for the past couple of years and NOT sewing (who me?), a good refresher is Katrina's video below. Her Lifting Pins and Needles channel is fun to watch.I'm not sure what's up next. Now that I've sewn up the dryer fabric, I have given myself permission to look through my stash. That should reacquaint me with what I have and hopefully inspire a pattern/project choice."},
{"title": "Basic", "date": "Friday, August 25, 2023", "text": "You can't get more basic than this. Sorry for the snoozer but I will actually get a lot of wear out of this, if my current basic black knit skirt is any indication. This is the old formerly black skirt (right) next to the new one (left). Yeah, I was overdue, wouldn't you agree?  I copied pretty much everything from the old skirt, including the slit. The only thing I didn't have on hand was 2\" wide elastic. So I adjusted the top edge and used some of my 50-yard roll of 1-1/2\" elastic from Wawak. I also didn't make a separate elastic casing. I was boring myself with this project and just wanted to be done already so I just serged, turned, and coverstitched it down.Note to self: If you leave your coverstitch machine sitting for 2 years, it would probably be a good idea to dust off the harp before dragging your new black skirt across it. That's the wrong side of the hem/slit edge. Yuck. The harp is clean now though. LOL! Next up is this b/w dotty woven fabric. It was the other piece that had been sitting on my dryer for 2 years with the fabric I recently made into a Rhapsody. I'm forcing myself to use it before I venture into my stash. It's been so long that I don't even remember where I bought it. (Funny story - I was digging through a bin of miscellaneous sewing stuff that had been sitting in the other room. I found bits and pieces of masks and mask makings, some Wonder Clips I forgot I bought, and a brand new, tags still attached, pair of knit joggers that I also forgot about — the \"TNT\" Old Navy RTW that I've been living in around home. I'm sure I bought them as a backup since I love all my others so much. I don't even need them yet since the others are still in excellent condition. I'm usually NOT scatterbrained like this, but this is definitely an indication of how weird the last 3+ years have been.)I'm going to be giving the Love Notions Melody Dolman a try. I don't think I'll be wearing it tied up, but never say never. I'm hoping to get the pattern taped together tomorrow. And maybe some pictures up on the walls in the sewing room. It's so … blank in there.If this top works out, it will be something else I can wear to the office. Or around the house. Speaking of the office, we just moved to a new building a few weeks ago (I think I mentioned that already in another recent post) which means I've lost my trusty work bathroom selfies mirror. A moment of silence, please. The new building, not my firm, owns the bathroom spaces, so I don't think anything will be improving there. I also don't have a true full-length mirror in my house so it looks like I'll be shopping for one of those soon. Have a great weekend! I hope to be checking in again soon with progress on the Melody."},
{"title": "Easy Peasy", "date": "Thursday, August 24, 2023", "text": "This post is really to remove the \"Under (Temporary) Maintenance\" post as the last post, because I really have not done much since my last \"sewing\" post (which was a wadder to bring you up to speed). The good news is I believe I fixed the issues I was having with my blog. Replying to comments seems to work again. I can add new entries to my two blogrolls at the right. My archive of old blog posts at the left is expandable/working again. There are few small things that aren't back to my preference, like typefaces and sizes, but I'm going to just let it roll for now because I just don't feel like spending more time in the HTML bowels of the blog. So, back to the sewing stuff. I am making the absolute easiest thing in the world. A black ponte knit skirt, which uses one pattern piece cut two times. You'd think I'd be done by now. But you'd be wrong. I was going to use my RTW skirt (on its last legs hence this project) to create a pattern, so I'd get lengths and widths correct. Then I went a step further and decided to just modify an actual pattern instead of, I don't know, drawing lines on paper. The problem with drawing lines on paper was I have no idea where any pattern paper is at the moment, so modifying an existing pattern seemed easier. Neither method was going to be particularly hard. It's a tube of fabric with elastic at the top. I used Kwik Sew 3256, which I last sewed 7 years and many pounds ago, and which I actually cut instead of tracing. I used the top section of View A. I still have the skirt hanging in my closet so I could try squeeze it on and figure out adjustments. I added up adding many inches by just adding copy/printer paper (thank you office!) to the sides and bottom with Post-It tape (LOVE this stuff!). That way my original pattern can survive unharmed.I should have had the skirt finished yesterday but I was having the weirdest problem with skipped stitches. My trusty main machine has never done this before. I finally changed the needle and was back to sewing. But that put me off for the afternoon so I've still got the side slits to sew around, and black thread on black fabric + over 40 eyes at night (who are we kidding? Over 60!) don't mix. I hope to finish it up tonight or tomorrow.In the meantime, if you're interested in someone who is undertaking a much more interesting and challenging project than my stupid-easy black skirt, I encourage you to go visit Bunny's blog and follow her as she makes what's going to be a fabulously fancy sparkly wonder! Also since I can't help it, I leave you with another photo of Cyrus. Who is definitely in the running for Most Spoiled Dog in the World."},

But Not.", "date": "Wednesday, August 9, 2023", "text": "Last post I said \"This is either the beginning or the end of my saga with the Elizabeth Suzann Clyde Work Pants.\" Well, I didn't want to leave you hanging, or thinking I had disappeared from the blog again, but it's The End. Of the Clyde Work Pants, that is. And it's not an end with a completed pair of pants to show for it. Although I did end up with quite an impressive pile of ripped out thread. (That's not even half of it.)Below is where I ended things. I did rip out every seam and all the topstitching and I cut them down by a size or two. And then I sewed them back together, and topstitched again. When I tried on the new version, they fit MUCH better, but I still wasn't loving them. It's those pockets, which span front and back. They are just TOO BIG and feel like TOO MUCH fabric in a weird place when I walk. So, I'm giving up because I know I'll never enjoy wearing them (and I'm not about to do any further ripping/altering to eliminate those monster pockets). I might go ahead hem the legs and add elastic to the waist so I can donate them, but I'm definitely not keeping them. So, alas, a wadder to welcome me back to sewing. Hands up if you can relate!Next up is probably going to be a really boring black knit skirt for work. Nothing fancy because we are still not dressing up in any way at work (and I'm only in the office 2 days a week), but my current black knit skirt is fading. Literally. I've worn/laundered the heck out of it and I want/need a new one. I need to check was the fabric stash has to offer.In the meantime, please enjoy two more pics of Cyrus. I'll be back soon."},
{"title": "Clown Pants (or why one should make a muslin)", "date": "Wednesday, July 26, 2023", "text": "This is either the beginning or the end of my saga with the Elizabeth Suzann Clyde Work Pants. Which of those outcomes will be determined by my desire to spend hours with my seam ripper and ability to find something to stream on the ol' tube to keep me occupied while I do so. I note this pattern is now $22. When I bought it, it was free/pay-what-you-can. According to my account on the website, I paid $15. I also think I probably would NOT pay $22. Especially when the very similar Muna and Broad Sculthorpe Pants are available for $16.I bought and assembled this pattern right before my sewjo went on hiatus a couple of years ago. Since it was pretty much begging to be next, I decided to go ahead and give it a whirl. I can definitely use a pair of dog walking pants. They were never slated to become more than very casual, wear mostly at home pants. But I also optimistically thought \"Who knows? Maybe they'll be great.\" And the pattern gods laughed.Did I try them on as I went? No. In hindsight, since I wasn't making a muslin, I definitely should have basted everything together before committing to all the serging and topstitching. Yeah, even crusty old sewists make rookie mistakes. Hubris, thy name is Debbie. The photos below REALLY do not do justice to just how BIG these are on me. I have a large tummy. I have large thighs. And I have enough room in the pants legs for a small animal. Or even a medium-size one.I picked my size from the body and finished garment measurement charts and from notes on the retail side of the ES website noting model measurements vs. the size they were wearing. Someone is fibbing. On the bright side, if you thought you were sized out of this pattern by a couple of sizes, you probably aren't. I think they're salvageable. It's just going to be a question of how much patience I have in me for ripping out every serged and topstiched seam. Right now, I feel up to it. Stay tuned.Other thoughts on this pattern: Assembly of the PDF was easy enough. The instructions are so-so. I mean, they will definitely get the job done and are nicely illustrated, but I don't like the order of assembly. For one example, instead of sewing the crotch seam last from front to back with the legs one inside the other, you sew the crotch seams separately and then the inseams as one long stretch. Pretty sure this is to make topstitching the CF and CB seams easier, but I'd rather do it all in one go. So, it's really just a preference thing on my part and not a slam of the instructions. I also don't think I'm going to be a fan of the method for attaching the waist elastic, but I haven't gotten there yet. But what I really do not like and will slam a bit for is that notches are severely lacking for aligning the pocket pieces and all the leg panels. For the legs, there's one notch at the waist and one notch at the waist. And all the notches are just one single line/snip, so it would be very easy to mix up front and back panels since the panels are all very similar shapes. It would also be very easy to mix up front and back crotch seams for the same reasons. It's not that I need the notches for lining up the pieces, but more for identifying which piece is which. TL;DR: If you do make this pattern, be sure to keep track of and/or label your pattern pieces.  Parting shot: My sewing buddy Cyrus who follows me room to room wherever I go.

{"title": "Rhapsody On Me and a Sewing Room Preview", "date": "Tuesday, July 18, 2023", "text": "Here I am, after work, and with a mirror shot. Proof I am actually still alive. (And chubbier and grayer.) I currently work from home MWF and in the office TT. Today was an office day. We're moving buildings in ~2 weeks so my in-office time for the last month has been mostly spent packing up files into boxes or the shredding bins. It's approximately 400 degrees outside this month (with humidity levels to match) and it doesn't matter how much AC is blowing, my body still knows. Which is to say I was a little drippy today while moving all those files and boxes. Ugh. The new shirt held up well, though it's much more wrinkled after a full day and 2 car rides than what shows in this pic. I also see that part of the back of the top is hung up on my hip. Oh well. This is real life here.   Behind me you can sorta kinda see the table where my sewing machines used to live. Over the weekend, I bought a new table and moved the machines into what will now be my dedicated sewing (and miscellaneous dog stuff and other junk) room. Below is their new home. Along with the ironing board and cracked iron (see previous post). My cutting table is on the other side of the room. Coming around full circle, there's Zillie and a shelf full of mostly non-sewing stuff. Weird fact — my ex's ashes are in the red urn in the top left cube. I'm not completely sure exactly why he is \"living\" with me again. The irony cracks me up regularly. If he were in a grave, he might be rolling over in it. I have a very dark sense of humor. Please disregard. Back to the cutting table, where you can see there is absolutely nothing on the walls in here yet. And there's a stash of big bags of dog food under the table and dog crates to the right of it. Since Alex moved out almost 2 years ago and Tyler moved in \"temporarily\" about 9 months ago, I've been using this room as a catch-all. Now that I'm reclaiming it for sewing, I'll need to figure out new homes for a lot of this stuff. That's the tour at the moment. It's definitely a work in progress. But I think the sewjo is back and I'm excited to get things going in here.Also, a note about comments. I can't reply to them on my computer, only on my phone, and I haven't figured out why yet. Blogger has changed some things in the last couple of years and it's making me a little nuts. Since I'm not a big fan of \"typing\" on my phone, until I figure out what's going on I probably won't be replying individually until I get it fixed. And since my HTML skills are rusty and my patience for troubleshooting is low, it's going to take some time. But I am reading and very much appreciating that you're still out there, helping me knock down the cobwebs off this thing, and saying hi!"},
{"title": "Just like riding a bike (or I sewed a Love Notions Rhapsody Blouse)", "date": "Saturday, July 15, 2023", "text": "I actually cut out and finished a new top in a week. Yay me! I can't tell you the last time that happened. But before I get into the nitty gritty, let me tell you what NOT to do when you return to sewing after an extended absence.1. Don't choose predominately black fabric, especially if using black thread. And really especially if you're over 40 and sewing sometimes at night.  2. Don't think you can outsmart shifty fabric when attempting to make/apply double-fold bias binding without reacquainting yourself with the process and the tools. Yes, I used spray sizing to stiffen it up. Yes, it was better. Yes, I still managed to bungle it in places. Thank heaven for Wonder Tape and glue sticks, and the Galloping Horse Rule.   3. Don't try to move your ironing board with a hot iron standing up on it, or you'll end up with the iron wobbling and then crashing to floor with a horrible BANG! and multiple cracks and chips in the outer pieces. So far, it seems to still work OK but as soon as I saw the chips and cracks, I RAN to my computer/Amazon and ordered a new one, which arrived yesterday. I like this iron a lot so I'd rather have one waiting on stand-by instead of wishing I did.  So, with that fun stuff out of the way, let's jump into it. I bought, downloaded, and printed this pattern at the office long before we even heard of a pandemic. (Remember those days?) And it sat. During that time, Love Notions updated their sizing and I downloaded and printed the update. And still it sat. Until my sewjo finally came back this month, after being AWOL for years. What also sat, and this is embarrassing to admit, was this fabric — on my dryer for years. Yes, at least 2 years. Right on top of my dryer. Somehow I thought that by seeing it on a regular basis, I would force myself to use it. Every time I saw it, I did think about sewing and my heart would flutter a little bit, but I just couldn't get myself to actually start anything. Until last week.Here's the finished top, and like everyone else who's made it, I really like it. I still need to toss it into the laundry before I can wear it to remove all the Wonder Tape and glue left over from struggling with the bias binding. The fabric is a really nice crepe rayon from Blackbird Fabrics.Rear view, where you can hopefully see I converted the back pleat to gathers. I just don't think an inverted back pleat is flattering to my backside. The gathers distribute the fabric better over my terrain in my opinion. Plus, it matches the gathers at the front extended yoke/shoulder seams.Voila! Some of my wobbly binding stitching. Absolutely NO ONE is going to be inspecting my stitch distances, so I called it Good Enough.  Another thing I changed/added, was edgestitching along the front \"shoulder\" seam and …… along the back yoke seam. I think this just gives a more finished look and also holds down seam allowances underneath. I think the pattern is pretty good. I love, love that Love Notions' patterns are No Trim. You just print, lay out the pages, and tape or glue. So easy. So fast. The sizing seems to be accurate to my measurements. I used the full bust front piece and sized from 2X at the neck/chest/armholes gradually to 4x for my Pandemic hips. (How long can I blame the Pandemic for my butt?) The only other adjustment I did was to make a square shoulder adjustment at the front yoke and armholes. Oh, I also used the cap sleeve option but added an inch to its length but that was a preference thing, not a fit thing.The instructions were good, but I changed the order/method of some things to my preference. Specifically, I did the binding before adding the sleeves and closing up the sideseams. And gritted my teeth the entire time. I did NOT use French seams and instead just serged the insides. (Let's not push this return to sewing thing too far.) And I already mentioned the added edgestitching.I haven't knotted the tie ends yet. I need to decide if I like them this length or want them shorter. I didn't really pay attention to that when I tried on the final top and then just didn't want to strip down again. I bought a new table for my machines today and I have one more piece of fabric that has also been sitting on my dryer …* * * * *Thank you to everyone who's still been checking this space and for leaving a comment last week. I'm really hoping to become a more regular blogger again. Lots of (mostly boring) stuff has happened in the last couple of years. I'm sure I'll be throwing in tidbits of all of that at some point."},

So I decided that today was the day I would finally tackle it instead of forever searching the rows for the right color, or more likely, just ignoring sewing altogether. It only took a couple of hours and it's not like I haven't been inside this house most of the last year with time on my hands, so I don't know why the procrastination, but I'm guessing we've all accumulated a lot of those feelings lately so I'm not going to offer any specific excuse except to say, oh well. I meant to take a pic before I started pulling spools off, but whoops. I did remember after pulling off the whites and browns. And here are the racks completely empty. Same as when I was in my rental house, I hung the racks using Command Velcro strips. I love those for this. First, no doors are harmed, and second (and almost as important), no measuring is needed to get everything lined up. I've found that using the Command strips on some painted walls hasn't turned out as well, but a wall is a lot easier to fix than a hole in a door.  I pulled off all the spools and arranged them in groups of colors on a blanket pulled across my bed (which is about 5 steps from the door). Also, see my treadle makeup table? I really don't have room for it anywhere else but I also don't want to get rid of it. Makeup table it is. Although what IS makeup anymore?And then I stared at the piles for a while, trying to decide how I wanted them to run into each other. In the end, I went with whites/beiges at the top, going into grays and then blues, greens, black, yellows, pinks, reds, oranges. I ended up with empty rows for expansion and weird stuff on the bottom row like nylon thread, fusible thread, etc. Because of my coverstitch machine, I tend to buy multiples of the same colors. For many of those, I use straws over the pegs so I can stack spools. For basics, like blacks, whites, grays, and browns, I keep them single so I have room to expand within a color range using the straws if needed but without having to move the entire collection of spools up or down. And since we're on thread, serger cones are kept in 2 drawers of an IKEA unit under my machine table. And bobbins in Bobbin Savers behind my sewing machine.  And that's probably more than you wanted to know about my thread. I have a pattern printed and taped together, but I don't think I have fabric in the house that is suitable. So, another small project today will be getting into some fabric bins in the garage. I actually got rid of a lot of fabric when I moved so I'm not even sure what's out there, but I really, really do NOT want to turn looking in those bins into another organization project. I think I'll take my phone out there and just take some general pics so I have some record of what's there and call it done."},
{"title": "In Quick Succession, Another Niagara", "date": "Tuesday, March 23, 2021", "text": "I trust most of you have recovered from the shock of seeing a post from me. Seriously, thank you for all of your kind comments. While I sincerely appreciate them all, Janet's comment of \"While you were gone, I stopped by for 'advice' a couple of times\" cracked me up for a good few minutes. And Bonnie@SewPlus, how did I not know about your blog before this week? I spent HOURS reading through it, wanting to make everything you've made, watching your daughter grow up (and you grow DOWN!) — and reliving a hurricane or two. I think we're almost neighbors, right? And Carolyn, I'm out of \"retirement.\" This one's for you. :-) So, while the pattern was still on the cutting table, I quickly cut out another Niagara and sewed it up over a couple of days/nights. I made a couple of construction changes on this version, but that's it. Instead of front/back facings for the upper bodice, I made it single layer and bound the neckline opening. We're quickly heading into hot temps here in Florida and keeping the polyester layers to a minimum should be cooler. (Who am I kidding? There's no such thing as \"cooler\" in Florida summer.) This is an ITY knit from Fabric Mart a couple of years ago. It's much brighter than it shows in the two pics above. More like the right side of the pic below. Unless you're new here, I'm sure you know how I love bright colors.No pretty enclosed seams this time, but I'm OK with that. It's faster, lighter, and uses less fabric.And here I am, with my Old Navy joggers. Not sure if I'll ever be able to wear office shoes again. Also, see that OTT light in the background on the left? I found out that if I have it and my iron on at the same time, I'm blowing a fuse/circuit breaker. Every time. So, the light will be on its way out. I've got an LED bulb in my coverstitch machine which is plenty bright, even for my old eyes, plus another regular lamp over my sewing machine/serger so I'm really not going to miss the OTT. * * * * * Now to catch up a little on some non-sewing, mundane life news. First is my car, below. Alex was driving it to pick up some dinner and got sideswiped. (Minor accident; he's fine, but boy was I hungry by the time he finally got home.) I took it into the local dealer (not where I originally bought it) for body work and a couple of service issues. They had it for three and a half weeks and I finally got it back last night. Except they missed a couple of things so it's going to need to go back. Ugh. They promised me a free rental this time, but truthfully, I hardly missed it those three weeks. Thanks Covid. See this reflector where the arrow is pointing to below? That's one of the things they missed. Or two, actually, since there's one on the other side too. There's also an area where the bumper meets the tail light that needs to be re-aligned better. And I asked them to replace the wiper blades and they missed the one on the back. I'm not overly thrilled with this place. The pic below is from when my new fridge was being delivered last year. I got it right before the lockdowns and before all appliances were selling out. Thankfully dodged that bullet since the new fridge was a need, not a want. OK, it was a want too, just earlier than expected.House update:  Shortly after moving here, we had a garage built in the back yard. It's really more workshop than garage, and it's really nice to have all the extra space for junk and projects. Alex update:  We're still sharing this house, but over the past five or so years, he's been building a real estate \"portfolio\" of rentals. In December, after selling one that he had rented out for about three years, Alex bought two more fixer-uppers in New Port Richey, which is about 45 minutes north of Tampa. That makes five houses he now owns. We've been spending many weekends updating floors, kitchens, paint in Alex's latest additions. Below, is the tile that was in place throughout one of the houses, but it was coming up in places, cracked in others, and not very stable.Alex jackhammered it all up and is replacing it with vinyl plank (below). After both \"new\" houses are rented, the plan is to put similar flooring in our house. I don't know if my old knees can take that.To save my knees, I've been mudding the drywall of a wall and closet we added to what was a second living room, to enclose it for an additional bedroom. The light \"fixture\" you see is really a new ceiling fan, just with the blades removed. The closet area used to be a pass through to the kitchen. We also added french doors to the left of this view, but I didn't get a pic.And, finally, the project supervisors … sleeping on the job. I'm glad we don't pay them by the hour."},
{"title": "576 Days", "date": "Wednesday, March 17, 2021", "text": "Five Hundred Seventy-Six Days. That's how long it's been since I last posted. I have no idea how that happened. But I also have no idea how the last year happened either. Holy Toledo! (But I'm pretty sure you're as happy as me to get those damn plates of food off my blog landing page!)It hasn't been quite that long since I've sewn, but it feels close. And with mostly wadders to show for the effort, I just gave up for a while and watched all that Netflix had to offer. Tiger King anyone? Fun fact:  Tiger King is actually a local story here in Tampa, and a couple of street scenes were filmed just a few blocks from my house. I found lots of \"new\" or returning favorites too:  The Queen's Gambit, Good Girls, The Crown, Queen of the South, Greenleaf, Bridgerton, Longmire, and many more. Thankfully, I've kept my job and have been able to work from home since last March, and like most everyone who's been working remotely, I've been working/living in casual tops and stretchy pants. I had ordered some joggers from Old Navy and a few tops from Amazon after I realized that the \"I can make those\" sewjo just wasn't happening. I even resorted to RTW undies, for the first time in at least 15 years. Finally, the sewing fog is beginning to lift. Is it Spring? Vaccines on the way? A new Administration in D.C.? Yes. Life is far from \"normal,\" but I'm beginning to think that light is actually the end of the tunnel and not an oncoming train, and the AWOL sewjo has started whispering. So, what's the new outfit? Stretchy pants and a casual top. Hah. Although I didn't sew the pants (Old Navy again, and I'm actually impressed with the quality of these joggers originally bought on a whim in a different color. I have them in black, navy, gray, and now this light green. No pilling or visible anything after months of constant wear! I even bought duplicates.). But I did sew the top, from a new-to-me Indie pattern company I came across by accident when I clicked on a random review on PR. The name of the company is Pattern Niche. At some point in the recent past, they were New Horizons Designs (which is currently how to find them on PatternReview) but  the company? owner? someone? changed names after Nintendo started using New Horizons or something like that. I really have no idea if that's correct, but I sorta saw something about it in their Facebook Group. Also, I hate Facebook Groups. Anyway … the pattern itself is great. (I'll get into what I *don't* like later.) The price is good (I paid U.S. $9.95). The download was fast. The PDF is well-organized, sizes are layered, and the pattern sheets are NO TRIM. Let me say it again, NO TRIM. I think every single digital pattern company should switch to NO TRIM, and PRONTO! This is not the first time I've used a NO TRIM PDF pattern so I've loved them even before now. But it was the first time I printed a PDF pattern on my home printer, instead of the (free) work printers. I have an HP 5660 inkjet and the print-out was perfect, which isn't always the case on the work printers. From the home print, everything lined up perfectly, and assembly was very quick due to the NO TRIM feature. Did I mention NO TRIM? The whole PDF, including instructions, is 57 U.S. letter-sized pages. The pattern itself is 27 pages. I have no complaints about the PDF. And I still have (free) work paper. :-) The pattern is the Niagara Top and Dress, line drawing below. As you can see, there are multiple views and combos, which can be combined for many different looks. The sleeveless views are not just the sleeved views without sleeves. There are different armhole lines on the pattern for the sleeveless option. I cut the tunic length with the scoop neck and short sleeve options. However, I decided the tunic length was too long in my cotton/Lycra fabric (butt Velcro), so I shortened it about 3 inches shorter than the tunic length. I also lengthened the short sleeves about an inch to be less cap-like. I think I'd like to try this dress length for summer, maybe with some color blocking and a faux button placket (the pattern has a real button placket).The sizing seems to be accurate and the drafting is good. I used my measurements and TNT to compare and blended from the 18 upper bodice to the 24 hips. My hips and tum have seen some \"expansion\" during this, Our Year o' the Pandemic.Front view on good ol' Zillie:Back view:Where things had me starting to grind my teeth were in the instructions and terminology, as I'll describe later. Nothing impacted my sewing of the pattern because I'm experienced and know better, but if one doesn't know what they don't know, well …. So, here we go.The upper bodice is double-layer (faced) and is sewn/turned using the \"burrito\" method, once for the front upper bodice and then again for the back. This is a good method and the instructions and diagrams for this are fine, although \"burrito\" is never mentioned. Which it doesn't have to be, but it would be nice to add it in for those newer to sewing so the term becomes familiar to them since it's becoming ubiquitous. Here's the inside view:Here is where I understitched the wrong side of the upper bodice. This step is NOT included in the pattern instructions. I think this is a necessary step. (Apologies for the blurry photo.)Also not included is edgestitching the right side of the upper bodice. This is not an absolutely necessary step but it should be at least mentioned as optional. And then there's some questionable terminology:Calling the upper bodice pieces just \"bodice\" and the lower bodice pieces \"skirt.\"Calling the upper bodice facing a lining.Calling basting \"two long straight lines between the markers.\"Calling notches \"markers.\" Especially when sometimes they are called notches in the same instructions.Instructing to hem from the wrong side by \"edgestitching.\" I guess this helps keep things straight, but then say it's a option if you're wobbly but also give real hemming instructions.I often read Indie pattern instructions and feel like they really need a good editor, someone who is an experienced and properly educated (either formally or self-taught using standards) sewist. (Sorry purists. I hate the word \"sewer\" when reading.) The solution would be to have such a tester just for instructions. Personally, I would probably do this just for a \"free\" pattern because I think I'm good at it and I'd much rather edit than sew tests on a deadline. Pattern designers - want a ruthless editor? Hit me up. LOLLastly for this pattern, here's the top when it was still tunic length before I added the sleeves and trimmed off about 3 inches. I didn't know where else to stick this pic. :-) In other sewing news, I finally bought myself a clear foot for my coverstitch machine. Obviously, if I felt a huge need for it, I would've bought one years ago. But it's nice to have it and it was nice to just order it to arrive to my porch instead of trying to find a dealer with one and making a special trip. Especially in These Uncertain Times. In life news, especially for my \"oldie\" readers … last July we said goodbye to Dani (b/w dog on left below). She was almost 14 and her heart was failing. Our hearts were broken, but we knew it was time. We loved her a lot and still expect to hear her bark at dogs on TV.About a month before we lost Dani, this big goofy pit bull found us. Her name is Cali. She looks ferocious but …… this is her true self. And her best friend.And yes, I did get on the mask making/wearing bandwagon. Stay safe out there! I'll be back soon. Definitely less than 576 days."},
{"title": "Dinner is served (aka meal prepping)", "date": "Tuesday, August 20, 2019", "text": "(Not sewing related, unless you count the possibilities of extra hours which can then be spent sewing.)I am NOT affiliated with anything I'm talking about here. I just stumbled upon this Meal Prepping plan and the related digital cookbooks, tried one out, liked the results very much, Instagrammed my cooked dinners, and had requests to share (both the recipes and the actual dinners! Hah!). So here I am. Sharing.Meals above, left to right, top to bottom (which is the reverse order that I cooked them):Sweet & Spicy Pineapple ChickenPork Loin in a Creamy Basil SauceBarbecue Paprika ChickenCarnitasWhite Chicken ChiliCilantro Lime ChickenAsian Fusion BBQ  ChickenKorean Beef TacosThai Peanut ChickenA few words about the website where these recipes/booklets live. It's www.laurengreutman.com and the recipe booklets can be found here. Although I had not heard of her before stumbling onto the recipe booklets via another completely unrelated website, Lauren Greutman markets herself as a frugal-living, \"Personal Finance Expert\" and she has appeared on numerous American TV talk and morning shows and has been featured in various magazines. I say all this not because I care about all that stuff but because YOU might care and think I'm getting a kickback or affiliate fee from her. I'm not. I get nothing from this plug. I'm just sharing something I like. Like with sewing patterns, only this time, it's dinner.The recipes/meal planning stuff Lauren sells fits into her \"frugal living\" lifestyle but you'll mostly see other stuff, and not these recipes, on her website pages until you start digging. I make no judgment on the financial info and associated planners, etc. she markets. I just know that I think her recipe booklets are well worth the $5.97 each they cost. And here's why.Lauren estimates in her booklets that she spends about $150-$165 for the 20 meals. But she shops at Aldi (famously inexpensive U.S. grocery store); I don't. Her pricing is from years ago; mine is from August 2019. She also didn't include some \"pantry items\" (those things you usually have on hand); I had to since I had just moved and had been not keeping stocked up in anticipation of the move. Finally, she made 20 meals; I made 18, because I just didn't think I needed to crockpot-cook spaghetti and meatballs, so that was the one meal from the booklet that I didn't make or eat . I still feel spaghetti/meatballs as a crockpot meal is kind of pointless but the other meals and the methods overcome any imaginary points deductions for that one. And hey, I guess *she* likes spaghetti/meatballs in the crockpot and it's her book, so ….   :-)I didn't track every last dime because I went to one regular grocery store and also the local farmer's market and I also bought a few other things not intended for the crockpot (drinks, toiletries, dog food, useless junk, etc.) and I wasn't doing this to save money. I spent about $220 total, so deducting for non-dinner items, that's still pretty good for 18 dinners and many take-to-work lunches. But it's not really the cost that has me sold—it's the method of putting together the meals and the daily time savings and mental space freedom from NOT needing to decide what's for dinner every night and then making it. That, to me, is nearly priceless.The method is essentially one big assembly line of adding ingredients to freezer bags. Once I got home from the store(s), the whole process took me about 2-3 hours. But I haven't cooked a dinner from scratch since and we've been eating some delicious meals. There is some \"side\" prep work, such as cooking rice or noodles, or adding an ingredient or two the morning of or when it's nearly cooked, but that's it. Those \"side\" preps take maybe 15 minutes.The booklets include complete shopping lists that you can re-print as needed. And they include the \"one touch\" assembly line cheat sheets for assembling the freezer bags. This is the genius part because you deal with each ingredient just one time and then move on to the next. You do not assemble each meal separately. Instead, you create an assembly line of freezer bags and add ingredients to the bags as you move through the cheat sheets (which are grouped into categories such as Meats, Spices, Liquids, etc. to make it even more organized and easy). When done, each bag contains a full meal (2 of each meal). And surprisingly, my kitchen wasn't even that messy once I was done. I just had to wipe down a cutting board, put away the remainder of the dry/pantry ingredients, and load the bags into my freezer. If you have helpers (spouse, partner, kids), it would go even faster than the 2-3 hours it took me alone.Photo credit: www.laurengreutman.comAfter the cheat sheets/assembly line pages, each meal has its own page with a photo and instructions specific to that meal (crock times, any \"side\" prep, etc.). The booklet also includes a regular (non-assembly line) recipe for each meal should you want to make it by itself at a later time.As I write this, it's been a little over 2 weeks since I made the freezer meals (August 4) and this past Sunday we started getting into the repeats. I usually take leftovers for lunch at work and some meals have been enough for 2 nights *and* my work lunch, plus we ate out (sushi!) and opted for pizza for 2 Friday nights. I figure I'll need to go \"big\" grocery shopping again this coming Saturday morning and do the prepping after. So, from August 4 to August 24, I will not have thought \"What's for dinner?\"and instead, it will have been ready to go when I get home from work. I love that.I started out with Lauren's Meal Plan 3 booklet because when I was deciding to do this, I thought it had a good mix of recipes. I've now purchased the other booklets because I didn't want to take any chance of not being able to. Again, I am not affiliated. I do not benefit from anything I've written here in any way. I just really, really like the way Lauren's method is organized, how much time it saves, how tasty the meals are, and even that I'm saving money—although that was not my main goal for doing this. Just having good dinners ready to go after work was my desire. The other benefits are a bonus.It seems as though Lauren has been doing this a while, going by references I've seen on her website to other booklets beyond the 1-4 currently for sale and the way the PDFs I bought are named. I don't know why those others aren't available any more. I would definitely have bought those too. Hah.Let me know if you have any more questions and definitely let me know if you try this and what you think. I'm obviously a fan!"},
{"title": "Hidden Gem - Cashmerette Cedar Dolman Top ", "date": "Friday, August 9, 2019", "text": "First things first. Yes, I have been absent from the blog for a freakin' long time. With that out of the way, soon I'll be buying myself a new home computer, so that should get me posting more often instead of waiting until I can \"sneak\" in a post from work (it's not really sneaking, but finding time because my work days are usually very busy). I've missed having a home desk.Speaking of home … that's the biggest reason I've been MIA. I have moved yet again. (That's the new house from the listing photo below.) But this time (and hopefully the last for a LONG time), to a home I own. Relatively speaking because the mortgage company would probably have a bit of a say in actual percentage of ownership at this point. But it's good to be a homeowner again and in control of my living situation. I'm still in the City of Tampa; just a tiny bit further north. Instead of 7 minutes to work, it's now around 12 because of 2 additional traffic lights to get through. The new house is great. Lots more room all around. I won't have a dedicated sewing room (gasp!) but my bedroom is big enough to accommodate all of my regular bedroom furniture AND all of my machines and still feel roomy. It will work great for me … that is, as soon as I can finish unpacking and organizing.This is the view from the LR into the dining area and kitchen, just after moving day. It looks a little better in here now, but not much. I want to hang shelves on the walls for books and a few deco items (very few since dusting is not my priority these days), but I haven't found the right shelves yet. I also need shelves in my bedroom so I can deal with my sewing stuff. I'm highly motivated to get on with those shelves, even if I have to settle for temporary versions, because not having them is holding up so much unpacking. And sewing.So, on to the last sewing I did before I embarked on months of house hunting, packing, buying, and moving.It's the Cedar Dolman Top by Cashmerette. And, for me, it's a hidden gem for two reasons: Letting it sit too long and not immediately looking past the envelope styling suggestions. Oh, and a third — nice fit! I'll have to double-check when I unpack this pattern again, but I believe I blended from size 16E/F at shoulder/bust to a 20 at hip. Whatever my blend was, it was straightforward going by my measurements to pick pattern sizing. I never have to adjust this mostly unfitted style during the day. It stays in place and doesn't slide forward or back as would a RTW loose-fit dolman that doesn't really fit, because my custom Cedar fits at both my shoulders and my hips instead of fitting one area and hoping for the best in the other.I was given this pattern in PDF form by Cashmerette months and months ago, with no strings to test, review, photograph, or anything. And it sat in my download folder gathering digital dust. I finally opened the file, printed it, and brought it home. Where it sat collecting actual dust for a while longer. I'm not sure exactly what prompted me to at last have a go at it, but I did. I think I chose it because it looked fast and easy (spoiler alert: It is!) and because I was seeing lots of hem-tied tops out and about and I wanted in on that.Looking past the pattern meant concentrating on the line drawings and not the athletic-wear styling and fabrication. I wanted a knit top I could wear to the office and out on the weekend. I'm so glad I finally cracked open the Cedar Dolman using some ITY dottie b/w knit because I have worn this top at least once a week since I finished it. I love it! It's comfortable. It's even trendy. And when I can finally get back to my machines, a second version is going to be the first thing I make.The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that I swapped out a \"self-drafted\" (using that term very loosely) vee neckline for the pattern's scoop neckline. I didn't find anything wrong with the pattern's scoop shape (except for my dislike of neckline facings in knits); I just prefer vees. I would show you the pattern piece with my changes, but it's still in a moving box somewhere. Below you can see the top on Zilly posing in a corner of my new bedroom.Below is the inside view. I changed the order of construction a little bit by (1) sewing fronts to backs along the shoulder and overlocking, (2) turning and coverstitching the neckline, and (3) sewing the CF seam and pressing the unfinished seam allowances open. I then picked up where the pattern instructs to attach the tie and hem facing, which is a very nice finish for the ties and gives extra oomph to the hem, and well-drafted so it all fits together perfectly.Here I am in a mirror selfie in the former house. Photobomb by Chili. It was still pre-summer temps because I'm wearing pants. It's now near 90°F every day. And so, so steamy. Ahhh. Florida.And here I am last week in work bathroom selfies with matching skirt. Because if you've been reading my blog for any amount of time, you know about me and my 2-piece \"dresses.\" Plus, I needed to use up the extra fabric instead of packing it. The skirt is actually the very last thing I sewed before packing up all my sewing tools and supplies. It's McCall's 7386, version too-many-to-count.And OMG that bathroom lighting does me no favors. I can't wait to get set up for pics in my new back yard. It's going to be great — brick pavers, natural light, tripod, privacy! (None of the stuff in the photos below is mine; these are more listing photos.) If only I could get Gillian to come down and take the photos! :-)So that's what I've been up to. Plus work. You can also catch me on the Curvy Sewing Collective doing Pattern Roundups! See you soon!"},
{"title": "Thoughts on Blank Slate Rose Tee", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2019", "text": "I like knit top patterns that are more than a basic tee, such as Jalie 2806, HotPatterns Sunshine Top, my beloved Ottobre tees, etc., and which have a bit of design \"fullness\" in front to cover my own \"fullness.\" Enter the Blank Slate Rose. I bought/downloaded this pattern about 8 months ago and it's been in my queue for a while. Finally, its turn came.The pattern calls for a woven fabric to be used where you see a print in the pattern photo, and the designer and most others I've seen who've made it (#bsprosetshirt) have used solids for the rest. If you know anything about me, you know I'm a prints and knits girl. Give me All the Print Knits!I had some Liverpool scraps left from my Slouchy Cardi which I used to \"opposite\" color block. I did interface, (with a non-stretch fusible) the pieces which called for woven to be used, mostly because the b/w print is a *very* drapey, silky knit and it definitely needed some stability when used around the neckline. There are front and back facings on the inside which I also interfaced, but with a knit fusible on those, for a bit more \"oomph.\" I did not interface the solid black pieces at all.I'm very happy with how the neckline turned out, even though I generally hate facings in knits. The shape, width, and depth are perfect for me. Next time, I will definitely just bind the back neckline or turn and coverstitch, but a facing on the front in this design is actually needed for stability, and to cover all the piecing so the insides are pretty too.The pattern went together well but it's not for an abundance of accurate markings. Look at the notches above ... they aren't even close to being correct. Sigh. I suppose it's a good thing these notches weren't even mentioned in the instructions, right? :-) Speaking of which, the instructions are  illustrated with mostly photos, which is OK, but the instructions for attaching the facings are just plain a bad method and will give you a lump at the shoulder seams if you follow them. My advice is to sew the facing shoulder seams together/press and the bodice shoulder seams together/press, and then join the facing to bodice at the neckline, RS together, stitch, and turn. In other words, the usual way. :-)As usual, I laid my TNT Ottobre tee over the pattern pieces and compared. Below is the back. Can you see how straight up/down this original pattern is below my TNT? I'm not that shape, so I reshaped the armholes and waist/hip curves. I did the same for the front, which was also straight up/down.Below is the pattern sleeve behind my Ottobre sleeve. Yikes. Good thing I was already planning to use my Ottobre sleeve.I've been wanting to add a flounce to a short-sleeve knit top for a while and finally I did. Watch out, because I love it and I'm going to add flounces to all of my short sleeves. Maybe kidding.Seriously, how fun is this?I dug out my 1/4\" downturn feller for my coverstitch machine …… ran the flounces through it before they were attached to anything …… and Voila! Perfect hems on a curve. Now I'm really adding flounces everywhere. :-)I'm very happy with my top and will definitely make it again because there are a lot of color/print blocking possibilities with the neckline, and all of those pieces were accurate and sewed together well. But if I'm being honest, I don't think this top would have fit me as I prefer below the neckline without sewing a muslin and tweaking if I hadn't substituted my TNT shaping. I'm just curvier than it is (was).After finishing the top, I had some scraps of the print left. Too big to toss, but maybe too small to be anything. Well, with some creative cutting and thanking my stars that the fabric is 4-way stretch, I was able to eek out a McCall's 7386 skirt. I love this skirt. I must have at least 8 of them in my closet now. I love the slightly flippy, slightly pencil, slightly A-line shape all in one skirt. It's perfect for the office. I'm sure I'll keep making it for years.The finished 2-piece dress on Zillie …… and on me with those awesome work bathroom selfies.Oh, and remember I said I had to creatively cut the skirt pieces? Well, I also had to piece a section, which turned out to be the CB hem area, which hardly shows now. I'll never point it out off this blog."},

How about a FREE, fast & easy sewing pattern that will fit lots of bodies?This is the Slouchy Cardi from In the Folds, offered for free download (FREE!) by Peppermint Magazine, here.Click on the sizing chart below to enlarge it (or look at the sizing chart at the Peppermint Magazine site linked above). This pattern is drafted to be loose-fitting with a lot of ease, to give it that slouchy look. I'm not a huge fan of quite so much slouch so I picked my size by the finished measurements for Size F, which is still bigger than my actual measurements and gives me minimal ease, which is fine since the knit I used is plenty stretchy. (It's a Liverpool knit from Cali Fabrics, which is now sold out.) Because of the generous size range and sizING, this Slouchy Cardi will fit many shapes and sizes.Here's the schematic for the pattern pieces. I wanted to point out the band piece and how long it is. (It's the sheets on the right starting at 35 and going straight down to 28.) Once you've got both band pieces sewn together and pressed, that's a LOT of curved band to wrestle with and attach evenly to the cardi body. Do not skimp on marking pattern notches (of which there are plenty, yay!) and do not skimp on pins. Do not do what I did and think you can just wing it, because you'll have to pin/re-pin about 378 times to get the band distributed evenly around the cardi body. Yeah. Not marking those notches was no shortcut.And here's another of the fantastic work bathroom selfies. To make things even better, of course I used black fabric so you can't see any details.In order to zoom in so you can see a few details, it meant including items that really showed the bathroom part of the \"work bathroom selfie.\" It's hard to believe this scribble erasing is from a former graphic designer, but hey … I'm at work and this computer has no real photo-editing software so it was either this or a toilet and tampon dispenser. Hah. Anyway, the sleeves are finished with a wide cuff. This sleeve is not too long for me; I'm just holding the cuff in an attempt to show it better. I'm pretty certain that worked better in my mind. If you click the photo to enlarge it, you might also be able to slightly see the curved band around the cardi body. What you won't be able to see is the sideseam pockets, because I didn't add them. I was already below the pattern's stated fabric requirements and pockets just weren't going to fit.Below you can see that this is actually a fairly long cardigan. I really love how easy but elegant the curved band is. With this cardi's slight cocoon shape, longer length, and dropped shoulders, I'm feeling 1980s goodness all over again. All I need is my shoulder pads and Aqua Net.The last two pics are essentially the same. All I moved was my head, trying for that artful pose or something. Yeah, no.And that's pretty much all I have to say about that (Forrest Gump). The dress I'm wearing is a Cashmerette Turner, made a couple of years ago, and still in rotation.I know this essentially was a drive-by review, but that's just about how fast it is to cut and sew this Slouchy Cardi. Especially if you do 99% with your serger. I did use my sewing machine to edgestich around the entire band (but not the cuffs) and that's it.* * * * *On a different and more serious note, thank you for all of your kind words after my last post. The boys are doing OK. It was a shock, and still is, but we're moving on. All of the blended family came together in St. Augustine for a \"Celebration of Life.\" It was everything it should've been and Mike would have loved it."},
{"title": "Love Notions Forte and Other Stuff", "date": "Thursday, December 20, 2018", "text": "I'm back today with more of what I've been making recently (and more work bathroom selfies than should be in one post). Speaking of work—I'm off from tomorrow through January 1, which is TWELVE days (woot!) and I'm really hoping to get a few things done in the sewing room. December has sucked (see below) and I'm so ready for the New Year.In the meantime, let's get back to the sewing stuff. Above is my Love Notions Forte Dress, sewn in October. I like the finished dress, but I took a few detours from the pattern to get there.This is my second Love Notions pattern made up. My first was the free Laundry Day Tee (previously blogged here and here). LN has a \"trimless\" print-out, which I found worked better on the Forte than it did for me on the Laundry Day Tee. Me or the printer or the pattern? I have no idea. What *was* my fault was not checking which pages I needed for the View B dress I was making and instead, I printed all 104 pages. Yes, ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR pages. Good for me that I print at work. Bad if you're paying for supplies.Another backhanded compliment (complaint) I have is that the pages are laid out such that you're only assembling one pattern piece at a time and don't need a huge tabletop to do so BUT … the \"map\" for the assembly is too light and low-resolution for my old eyes to see it clearly. The assembly diagrams are the pink boxes below. If you're looking at the PDF on a computer, you can theoretically zoom in to see the diagrams better (still low-res though). But if you're staring at the printed pages, it's a blurry mess. I did let the designer know and she responded, so hopefully this will be improved at some point.There are a number of hints and links to tutorials, etc. that are clickable within the PDF when viewing on-screen. Again, useless if you're looking at just paper. So, I have very mixed feelings on these features because once I'm ready to sew, I'm not next to a computer in my present set-up.The pattern is touted to have a \"full bust\" version included. I looked at the tester photos and saw too many on which what is supposed to be an underbust seam bisected the bust instead. I don't know if those testers used the regular or full bust pieces. I don't know if they made any adjustments. I only know that after holding the pattern piece up to my own bust, I needed to do something. My quick fix was to just add more length, as shown by pink-lined addition below. I lost most of the inverted vee shape of the seam with this quick fix but at least it's under my bust. On a future version, I'll probably adjust my adjustment to get back some of that inverted vee shape.I'll also lower and widen the neckline on future versions. This one is technically fine but higher/narrower than I prefer. Part of this finished shape/height is because I actually added a half inch to the height because some tester photos looked very low. Again, no info on what the testers may or may not have done so I was just guessing. The other part of the finished shape is because I used my coverstitch to bind the neckline instead of turning and topstitching. (Binding also meant I had to change up the order of construction so I could start/stop the binding at the center front.)The binding looks great. The pattern matching across the CF seam, not so much. I stitched/ripped literally three times and it didn't improve. I decided to employ the 3-foot galloping horse rule. (That's the rule that if something can't be seen from 3 feet away while riding a galloping horse as you pass by, then it's good.) Seriously, not one person has come up to me to complain that for 2-1/2 inches down the center front seam, the pattern doesn't quite line up.See … far less noticeable at this distance. Even less so on a live body.Another problem I had with this dress was the sideseams didn't match. I'm confident I matched the correct seams and I'm also confident that pattern itself matches as it should. I think the fabric just stretched out from hanging on Zillie for a week or so. I tried to force it by easing the seams and ended up with this:So I pressed, steamed, and clappered the heck out of the seams.Better, but still wonky. Plus, I really wasn't happy with how the dress hung over my backside. I have erect posture and there was just too much length in the back bodice area before it hit my butt so it just hung badly instead of skimming. I thought I took a pic but I didn't find it, so you'll have to take my word on that.So I took a hard left (figure of speech) and unstitched those wonky sideseams and then cut off the lower back …… so I could add an adjusted back waist seam to get rid of the excess. Again, not scoring perfect 10s in the pattern matching but I was now limited by remaining fabric so I didn't even try.And it looks fine. The sideseams aren't rippled anymore either.My phone makes little animations when I take a lot of similar photos in a row. It cracks me up, and this one was actually pretty good. I really like the front drape of the skirt section. It's fun to wear because it has a lot of movement.Now for some other October/November sewing. Up first, HotPatterns Garden Party T.The pattern is great. My fabric and trim are crap. I'll be trying this again in another fabric. One that doesn't hold static, doesn't flip up, and doesn't feel like wearing plastic. And this from a polyester-print-lovin' girl.One more pair of black Hudsons for cooler weather. Love these. Wear them all the time. All. The. Time. This is the best black ponte ever. From Cali Fabrics. I'm not affiliated at all, I just love this fabric. Go buy some here.Lastly, another Itch to Stitch Nottingham top and McCall's 7386 skirt.I used my lowered neckline from last time.I love my clapper when pressing neckbands, so they stay curved and flat.I also added about an inch to this version of the top (first version here) on the lengthen/shorten lines and I like the length of this one.Also did the \"faux tie\" thing again.One last work bathroom selfie.* * * * *And now on a more somber note about why this December sucks. Many of you know that my marriage ended about 6-1/2 years ago. Very long story short, I was finally divorced two weeks ago, on December 5, here in Tampa. (My ex had been living in Virginia all these years but had flown down to Tampa for this.) After court, he drove to St. Augustine, where Tyler and Michael (my step) live. The three of them went to dinner that same night and while walking in the tourist areas of St. Augustine, my ex had a sudden and massive heart attack and passed away just minutes later. All of this is to say that it was huge shock and we're all pretty sad. (Luckily Alex did have dinner with him in Tampa the night before.) I couldn't decide whether it was appropriate to put this on the blog but all of my family has been on the blog at some point and so many of you have been there from the beginning so it feels like a kind of closure."},
{"title": "HP Nexus T-Shirt Dress", "date": "Friday, November 30, 2018", "text": "Happy End of November! And, yep, it's been a while. Again. I've sewn a number of things over the last few months and have at least one more blog post in the wings with photos loaded and waiting, so hopefully I'll get that published soon too. Today, however, I'm going backwards and starting with what I made most recently. As in, last weekend. The photos are kind of meh and as usual include some from the work bathroom but … hey … that's me. So, let's get started. Spoiler alert — I'm not thrilled with this pattern.The pattern is the HotPatterns Nexus T-Shirt Dress, pattern shown below. I bought the downloadable PDF version.Pros for HP PDFs — no trimming. You just butt the edges and tape.Cons - No layers, so in places you end up with a million indiscernible lines overlapping in place. And the pieces are not laid out with printer limitations in mind, so near the edges there is usually something missing. Mostly,  you can work around this. Sometimes, it's highly irritating. Also, for this particular dress, the front and back pieces are split into two sections that are to be taped together. Except, there is only one addition piece to be added to two base pieces. So you either have to print the addition pages again or trace the one you have. That itself isn't a huge problem but there's no mention of there being only one add-on piece instead of the two needed anywhere in the instructions so you could be caught out and feel a need to swear. Or is that just me? (That's the piece below.) My photo above is after reworking the dress. This photo below is an in-progress shot before I reworked it. The main thing I want to point out is how twisted everything is. Is any of this twisting reflected in the line drawings above? Hint: No, it's not.Below are what the pattern pieces look like. There is a center front seam and the ties are single-layer so the wrong side of them will show.In the original design, the ties are supposed to overlap, kind of like a wrap dress, with one crossing your chest inside and being pulled tight and anchored into the side seam and then the \"outside\" tie connects to a \"connector\" tie sewn into the opposite side seam. But because the main ties originate from the center front, nothing lays nicely and it's a lumpy, droopy mess.To salvage what was going to be a wadder, I removed the \"connector\" tie sewn from the side seam and then brought both real ties to the outside at the center front and tied them there. The whole dress lays so much better and the lower \"skirt\" isn't sticking between my legs.The only thing I need to go back and fix is to sew the CF seam below the knot a little higher. You can see my black slip when I move the ties out of the way. The ties mostly cover the \"hole,\" until the wind blows and they don't, so this is a fix I'll be making this weekend while I still have black thread in the machine.Before I realized how much I hated the original design, I tried facing the tie, but it ended up way too thick so I removed it. (That's my Love Notions Forte hanging in the background below, which is the next blog post up.)This is a really bad, small pic of the final tie with the facing removed and zigzagged 3/8\" hem. I'm pretty sure you can't really see anything.We had a cold snap here in Tampa this week, so this is how I really wore it, with a black RTW cardi and acid green tights.While I like a lot of HotPatterns' designs and they were one of the pioneers in modern Indie patterns and deserve a high-five for still bringing it, I'm finding myself wishing they'd take on some of the features I've come to rely on from newer Indies. Such as photos of finished garments on a variety of bodies (heck, even ONE photo on a body instead of all drawings would be wonderful), great PDFs, and better instructions. I don't need hand-holding for assembly in the least, but I don't want to be scratching my head because something doesn't make sense or is wrong or is just plain missing. So by \"better,\" I mean accurate. Speaking of missing, more notches and marks would also not be unwelcome. And finally, the elephant in the room is the completely bogus size chart and measurements. At first glance, it looks like there are a lot of useful measurements. Except if you use them to pick a size, you'll end up with a garment 4 sizes too big. And while I'm wishing, I'd also really like some finished garment measurements.I know if these things were offered, there'd be tons more customers for them, and I have a real interest in seeing HotPatterns stick around since I really do like nearly all of their designs."},
{"title": "One More Hot Patterns Classix Nouveau Primavera Dress", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2018", "text": "I last made this dress just about 1 year ago. I've worn it a LOT since. It's the perfect combination of great fabric, easy wear, easy care. Every time I wear it, I always tell myself to make another. I finally listened.Another classy work bathroom selfie.The pattern:Bodice, in progress. Like last time, I fully lined the bodice to eliminate the facings. I also raised the neckline another 3/4\". The last version is passable, but it still teeters on low-cut. Teeters. Hah. That's the only alteration I made to this version, having incorporated the incremental fixes from last time into my actual pattern pieces. It was nice to pretty much just cut and sew.Lots 'o gathering at the front waist.CB stripe matching like a BOSS! If you look close, you can see there's actually a seam in there.Almost BOSSy matching at the side, but not quite.I had a brain fart and forgot to match the pocket facing. The eagle-eyed among you will also notice that I didn't even attempt to match at the bodice side seams. Well, I did, but I cut either the front or the back in the opposite direction so what I thought was matching, really wasn't. Not a big deal since my hands are always either in the pocket or hanging next to it blocking the opening and my arms block the sides. And it's done and quite wearable, so there's that.The 2-inch hem facing. I love wide facings. I don't always like slowing down and cutting out the extra pieces, but I'm always happy when I do.More bathroom \"glamour shots.\"I'm glad to have this one in the wardrobe now too. I'm putting this pattern away for a little while, but I'm sure it will make another appearance at some point. Mindless dressing at 7 a.m. for hot Florida summer weather is what I'm all about these days."},
{"title": "Itch to Stitch Nottingham - My thoughts", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2018", "text": "How does so much time go by between posts?? I really always intend to post more often but then either my sewjo disappears or my blogjo (is that a thing?) does, or both. And then I make excuses to myself or figure no one wants to just read about my day-to-day, especially with no pics! But anyway ... here I am. And I sewed! (I thought this pic was both creepy and hilarious, in a 'The Shining' sort of way.)This past Memorial Day Weekend was the most productive I've been in a short time in months! I made two tops and three skirts. Yay!Today, I'm going to talk about the Nottingham top from Itch to Stitch. Link to pattern here (not an affiliate link).This is the first Itch to Stitch pattern I've actually sewn. I've bought a few and downloaded the freebies and they are in my queue but see comment about sewjo above. Plus Magpie Syndrome. I know ... preaching to the choir! :-) But I love me a twisty top and so this one jumped into first position.Overall, the pattern is good. The drafting is accurate, the price is very reasonable (especially if bought during the first week of release) compared to other Indies and non-sale Big 4, the PDF pages go together quickly (even quicker if you use the Itch to Stitch tutorial here), and the construction instructions are fine. But I do have some opinions I'll share below. Whoa Deb, you have an opinion? What a surprise! Hah. I crack myself up.If like me, you really wanted to see what the pattern pieces for the twist look like, voila. The top section is just a basic tee, with all the twisty stuff going on near the bottom. The pattern is PDF only but available for large format and created with layers so you can print what you need. There are 33 pages for the whole thing and it took me about 20-30 minutes to assemble. I'm one that very much prefers PDFs over tracing.I was hoping that I'd be able to quickly morph my TNT tee to this pattern, and that worked out very well. Truthfully, there aren't a huge number of differences between my TNT and this pattern, but there are enough, so why reinvent the wheel when I can just cut and sew, you know?So my first \"opinion\" concerns the neckline. Kennis (the pattern designer) calls it a scoop neck. It is not a scoop. A look at the \"tester\" round-up pics will confirm that. It's a jewel neck. I do not like jewel necks on me. Which leads me to my next \"opinion.\" It's pretty easy to offer additional neckline styles for simple knit tops (which this one is in the upper torso). A true scoop neck and vee neck would've been great inclusions. Not that I can't do this myself, but it just seems nicer to have the choices already in the pattern. I mean, it comes with three sleeve variations so why not a choice of necklines? For mine, I lowered the pattern neckline at least two inches. And as you can see by photos of me wearing it, it's nowhere near a low neckline even with those two inches removed. I also increased the width to open up the neckline even more.I added a band, whereas the pattern is a \"facing\" turned outward to look like a band.My next \"opinion\" is about the sleeve and armhole and sewing them together. Since I was using my TNT upper bodice, I also used my TNT armhole and sleeve. I like the armholes in my knit tops to be high and narrow (curving more inward at the upper chest than not). I do not want extra fabric across my chest nor below my armpit. The Nottingham armhole is lower than I like and it's also set wider under a wider shoulder seam. Many of the \"tester\" photos bear this out. I won't point out which ones specifically since maybe the wearer actually prefers hers that way. But I do see a trend that makes me wonder. Plus, I've seen the pattern. Hah.What I will complain (and not just opine) about is that the instructions have you set in this sleeve like for a woven blouse. Why? And why is there so much asymmetry and height in the sleeve cap for a knit sleeve? My pink mark shows the sleeve pattern for the size I was sewing. In reality, I had traced my TNT sleeve and used that. You can see the difference. Yes, technically I'm sure the pattern sleeve works. But it's too much work when it doesn't need to be.The sizing is generous. There is a lot of upper body ease to create the pretty draping toward the twist. Pay attention to the finished measurements and your fabric's characteristics. The measurement chart would have me in a 20. My TNT is closer to this pattern's 14-16 in the upper chest and I morphed to the 18 toward the hip and still have plenty of room and drape. The pattern's elbow-length sleeve is narrow. My TNT sleeve equates to roughly a size 20 sleeve for this pattern.If you have a larger bust, you probably won't need an FBA but I would advise to add length to the front piece, tapering to nothing by the side seam. There are lengthen/shorten lines provided, which is a nice touch on such a weirdly shaped pattern piece. (You could also do a traditional FBA but you'd have to do it twice since the pattern piece is a full piece, not a cut-on-fold piece.) In fact, unless you're very petite with a smaller bust, I would suggest adding length all around. I'm 5'5\" and the overall length of this top out of the \"envelope\" (off the printer?) is fine on me with a skirt, but would definitely be too short with pants (which I wear a little below my skirt waist). There are a lot of  inspirational \"tester\" pics on the pattern's release blog page but I wish there was more info about their height and about the whys of their size choices. I saw a number of length variances but no explanation. Next time, I'll likely add an inch.One little addition I made, which you can see in the above and below pics, was to add a 'faux\" tie. It's just a simple tube of fabric, about twelve inches long, pulled through the hole created by the twist. I think this balances and finishes the bottom edge. The tie will be more apparent when I wear this top with the solid navy skirt that also came out of the sewing room this weekend. The twist gives me a spot to hang my work pass, which you can see in the bathroom selfies below.If you've read my blog for any time, you probably know my love for 2-piece dresses (aka top and matching skirt). I'm really happy with how this set turned out. The skirt is my trusty McCall's 7386, which is a cross between an A-line and trumpet skirt and is SO FAST to cut and sew. The separates will mix/match nicely with other pieces in my wardrobe.Overall, I like this pattern a lot. I'll definitely be making it again soon. It's distinct enough to not want too many in my wardrobe, but a solid white will mimic a blouse nicely and another print will be a great weekend top. And maybe one with a vee neck, one with long sleeves for winter .........."},
{"title": "Cashmerettte Rivermont Review", "date": "Saturday, February 3, 2018", "text": "I know, it's crazy. Two blog posts from me within days ;-)Here I am in my Cashmerette Rivermont dress. In the bathroom at work. So classy. My face says it all, no?Obligatory pattern cover.And line drawings.And size chart.Since I don't fit into any one size on the size chart, I do the morph-o-roo between a few sizes. Following the Cashmerette instructions to choose by my bust size doesn't work for me. I end up with a too-wide neckline and a bodice that falls off my shoulders. So, I pick for my bust size but ALSO for my upper chest/shoulder size by blending smaller for those areas. For Rivermont, that meant between 14-16 (C/D cup) at neck/upper chest and underarm, outward to the 20 at waist/hip. Kind of like my \"cheater FBA\" but in this instance it's my \"cheater NSA\" (narrow shoulder adjustment). (And OMG, now that I've typed NSA twice, should I be worried? Hah.) You can see what I did looking at the yellow highlighting below.This gives me a pretty good fit throughout shoulders, underarm, and bust, no?Overall, I like the pattern and think it's drafted well, and I do recommend it. But I do have a couple of mostly minor complaints. First up, is the pocket. While I love pockets, especially in my work clothes, the Rivermont pocket is HUGE. Immediately below looking at the pattern pieces, you may be able to get the general idea of how deep this pocket is. Look how close the bottom of the pocket is relative to the back vent.Or, if that doesn't tell you the story, look at this photo, where, with my hand to the bottom of the pocket bag, half of my forearm is in the pocket too. That is a deep pocket! It's easily shortened for next time, though, so not a deal breaker by any means.While I'm talking about the pockets, I'll point out that I used a black tech knit for the pocket facing. The main fabric is fairly lofty and textured and I thought a smoother fabric would be a better choice. It is. I really like how the pockets feel with my hands in them - the techno knit (same as I used for my black Hudson pants) is so nice. The main fabric is also awesome! I used exactly zero creative imagination for it, since it was part of a Rivermont kit offered by Cashmerette. I just fell in love with it when I saw it. It was a little pricier than I usually go for, but very worth it. It's definitely quality stuff.The other nit I want to pick about the pattern is the neckline facings. If you've been reading my blog for any amount of time, you'll know my feelings on facings for knits. Hint: Not a favorite. At all. The front facing is kind of wimpy. It's nice that it's sewn into the shoulder and armhole seams, but that wasn't enough to tame it.I understitched it. I pressed the heck out of it. Sat the clapper on it. And even left it pinned on Zillie for days. It wasn't enough.So I brought out the big guns ... my elastic thread. Which I pulled through the channel created by the understitching, just enough to make it taut. Similar to my Gaping Neckline Fix, here.And I added Steam-A-Seam under the facing edges to \"glue\" them down so they wouldn't move. The neckline now lays flat and the facing remains in place. I still hate facings though. (You can also clearly see how deep the pockets are.)The back lays better, because it's a bit deeper and is going over a more convex curve of my upper back which holds it in place better than the more concave curve of a typical female upper chest. Also, pattern matching like a BOSS. Hehehe...Here's my finished dress on Zillie (sans hem). Front neckline flat? Check. Not too wide? Check.And another wonderful bathroom selfie. (I know I'm getting ancient, but that lighting really does me no favors. Ugh.) This will be a great multi-seasonal addition to my wardrobe. And so comfy too!And during the colder months, I've got a matching unstructured jacket to wear over it. (Or, with jeans or the navy skirt that's in my sewing queue.)I used Simplicity 1945, which I've made a few times before. I omitted the center back seam to avoid pattern matching and fabric waste.Zillie models the ensemble, complete with serger thread tails before hemming:Parting shot: This wonderful fabric is impossible to mark on the wrong side with my preferred washaway markers. I actually tailor-tacked for the first time ever. I felt so faaaannncy. :-)"},
{"title": "The New Dress", "date": "Wednesday, January 31, 2018", "text": "Above, my latest finished garment, and I L.O.V.E. it!Backstory: I have a RTW dress almost exactly like it. I like the RTW dress a lot too and have been wanting to clone it. It's really just a simple knit shift dress with an \"open\" vee neck with ties. This is the RTW below. I meant to take a pic of it on either me or Zillie, but I forgot. If I think about it later, I'll add such a pic to this post.I decided I could pretty easily re-create the RTW dress with my TNT Ottobre tee pattern. (I have been using that TNT for ELEVEN years now, it's originally from the 02/2007 issue!) The RTW has sewn bust darts. My TNT does not – it has extra length at the bust area which is eased into the side seam at bust level. I prefer the non-dart version.Below, is my visual comparison between the RTW dress and my tee pattern, and how I started to assess what was going to be needed in a pattern.This pic is when I got more serious and took measurements, noting similarities, differences, and necessary landmarks. I'm being \"thrifty\" (lazy) and using some pattern tissue from patterns I'll never sew as my tracing paper. The red arrows show my lines for the new dress.The rest of the lines are from whatever was originally on the tissue.I drafted a facing for the front neckline. It's probably really hard to tell what's going on with the lines from the original pattern on the tissue. The pic below is the facing overlaid on the front pattern piece.Here it is by itself where you can hopefully see the overall shape of the pattern piece, ignoring the printed lines. The only \"line\" that matters here is where it I drew in \"FOLD.\" Right above FOLD is where the vee shaping is, which is not cut on the fold. Clear?This is what the actual facing looks like using the pattern piece above. It's interfaced and the bottom edge is serged. The vee is sewn (right sides together) and then turned right side out. The shoulders and armholes are basted together and sewn as one when attaching the sleeves and back. The neck opening where you see the binding is also basted together before the binding is attached. The binding is applied to the raw edge(s) of the neck opening. Easier to do than describe.The RTW dress has back waist darts, which produce some nice subtle shaping. I measured the end and middle points and the uptake of the existing darts. I transferred those landmarks as big dots to the pattern tissue. The janky looking dart outline is just to give me a visual clue for what those dots mean. In case I put this pattern away for 5 years. Or a week. :-)Here are the sewn darts. As you can see, there's not a lot of uptake, but enough to lessen the \"sack effect\" while still camouflaging the back rolls. Hah.The sleeve is nothing special. Ignore those lines all over from the original pattern. I already had a long sleeve created for my TNT Ottobre. I just traced it for this one so I could keep all the pieces together. Sometimes I'm actually not lazy. It's just a straight sleeve to be elasticated at the wrist, so it doesn't need much shaping.The elastic cuff.Below is the RTW neckline. The binding is all one piece, attached in one go, leaving lengths past the neck opening which become ties.My copy.I'm still kind of in shock at how perfectly the binding/tie went on my copy. I truly expected to need at least 2-3 tries. I luuuurrvvve my CS machine and binders! And Lady Luck.Much of the success lies with the fabric used for the binding. It's a Telio doubleknit which has nice body and drape at the same time. I bought this to make a navy Jalie cardi, which is next up on the cutting table, but it turned out to be perfect for this binding/tie too.Here's the neckline/tie open. I made the point of my vee a little higher than the RTW dress so it's not All Cleavage All The Time with it open.This is the reverse side of the binding.It's hard to tell because it blends in so well, but the coverstitch looper was threaded with navy woolly nylon. Since the underside was going to show on the tie sections of the binding, I was hoping the woolly nylon would look more substantial and intentional than plain thread. It does. Yay. The random dog hair, on the other hand, not so much.And on Zillie. I finished the dress Sunday, hemmed it Monday night after work, and wore it Tuesday (yesterday). I am so happy with it. Most of its success is the fabric, but a lot is the effortlessness of a well-fitting knit sheath. I already bought more of this fabric. It's from Cali Fabrics but going quickly. As of today, there are only 6 yards left. Cali Fabrics is quickly becoming my new favorite fabric store. Great quality, lovely customer service and attention to detail, good prices, and fast shipping to Florida from California! I only wish they'd show more pics of their fabrics so I can get a better feel for drape and scale. (I have never been compensated in any way to say that. I'm just an actual customer spending my own actual money.)One more pic, in front of Alex's shocking orange truck. Which kind of goes with the dress, no?Parting shot: Snow, here in Tampa a couple of weeks ago. OK, actually frost. But I still had to scrape my car windshield before work. This is not how it's supposed to work here in Florida."},
{"title": "Late to the Party … Again — True Bias Hudson Pants Review", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2017", "text": "So, this pattern has been out since mid-2014 and currently has at least 30 reviews on Pattern Review, (plus more if you count the men's and kid's versions and reviews not on PR). I bought it about 2 years ago. Good intentions blah, blah, blah. Finally, its time had come.Here I am wearing my adjusted second pair with the goofiest of goofy expressions. But you come here for the sewing and chit chat, not my (non)modeling/posing skills. The short verdict is: I love them! My wordier thoughts follow below.The temps in Tampa dropped quite a bit a couple of weeks ago and I really needed casual long pants for after work, walking the dogs, running to the grocery store, etc. (We're back up to the 80s today, and I'm kind of missing the chillier weather.) Making Hudson Pants had been on my to-do list forEVER but kept getting pushed. And every time I'd want to wear those casual long pants and NOT find them in my wardrobe, I scolded myself for not taking a weekend to Just Sew Them.Finally, my Hudson sewjo and weekend coincided and I got started. Better two years later than never. My first pair is below. They are the better pair to look at since they have a lot more visual interest than my next solid black pair. The fabrics are deep stash/leftovers from at least 10 years ago. And it holds up like iron. The bomber jacket I made from both the \"print\" and the solid is still going strong and I wear it on dog walks All. The. Time. This means I now have a dog walking suit. Hahaha. The \"print\" is a ponte with some, but not a lot, of stretch. It must be poly the way it's not changed at all over the years, but it feels like cotton. I'm pretty sure it's from Fabric.com back in the days that Stephen was still at the helm. The solid is also ponte, a rayon blend I believe.I don't have a photo of me wearing them. Life is not fair.The size chart appears less generous than it is in the actual wearing. I had read some reviews from other sewists on the higher end of the measurements reporting plenty of room in their finished Hudsons even though they themselves were quite outside the given numbers. In other words, these are very casual pants with a lot of ease. Basically, if you can pull 34-36\" of elastic up and over your butt, you're good with the size 18. (That elastic measurement is about what you'd use in the waistband for the size 18 waist.)I did make adjustments, though. One, because said other sewists/reviewers have proportionately thin legs. I do not. Two, my \"muslin\" fabric isn't the stretchiest kid on the block. Or something like that.While these are not particularly low-rise, my muffin-top waist and cake-eating butt will be better served with a higher cut. (More on this below.) I added one inch to the front and back rise. In the front pattern right below, you can see that said inch was added below the pocket so messing with the pocket pieces would not be required. Yay!I also added inner thigh space, pointed to by the red arrows, tapering to nothing around knee level.The pattern calls for 2-inch wide elastic. Of course I did not have any on hand. I \"made\" my own. It was a little trickier to feed through the casing, but not terrible, and now that it's in and stitched over, I can't even tell it's really two pieces. I will probably never buy 2-inch wide elastic now. Heh.I also cheated and didn't thread a tie all the way around. I made the buttonholes in the waistband as instructed and then just threaded a short \"faux\" waist tie through the buttonholes without going around the waist in between. I won't tell if you won't.This is as close to modeled as we're doing today. (This was actually a week ago.)Trying on and wearing the brown, first, pair told me I definitely needed more room over the caboose. I could be a plumber in these pants if you catch my drift. I added a wedge to the CB, tapering to nothing at the waist. I also thought I wanted a bit more length in the rise all around. Ultimately, I was wrong about that last part and will go back to adding just 1 inch to the rise, not the 1.5 inches I added for the second, black, pair.Here's where the second, black, pair hits me ... right over the belly button. I don't mind too much because I'm never going to tuck into these, but if I'm aiming for best fit, they'd be better with 1/2\" less height in the rise.For the black waistband, I cheated even more and completely omitted a tie and the buttonholes. As mentioned, I'm never going to tuck into these pants and the bulge from a tie looks weird under untucked shirts.The last thing I did differently on both pairs and which step I think is glaringly missing from the instructions and sew-along, is to edgestitch the pocket just past the band. It's a nicer finish and holds everything in place better. Speaking of the pockets ... I feel that they are right on the very edge of being too shallow. They're fine as is. My hands fit. I just want them a little bigger/deeper. I'll alter this for a next pair.This fabric is from Cali Fabrics, my new favorite online fabric store. Cali calls it \"techno knit,\" which feels very much like a thin scuba. It's nicely stretchy with 100% recovery, comfortable to wear, and doesn't pill. Cali is sold out of black. I hope this is a fabric they will carry again. I know these Hudsons are boring with no contrast and hard to see details but they are definitely a basic I sorely needed in my wardrobe and I'm so happy to have them.Overall, I think the Hudson Pants is a good pattern. It sews up quickly, the PDF is easy to assemble accurately, not too many pages to tape together, and nothing was out of whack in the pattern pieces or instructions. It was the first True Bias pattern I've tried so I've had a good first impression. I've had my eye on Jalie's similar Vanessa pant and may give into buying that one too, if only to compare. Because I'm weird like that.This is the realistic shot of how they'll be worn most of the time."},
{"title": "Alex, I'll Take Potpourri for $400", "date": "Monday, November 6, 2017", "text": "(Blogpost title referring to Jeopardy! and the mish-mash stream of consciousness that follows.)It's been 3 months since my last confes.... kidding!... blogpost. Not as bad as last time when it was more like 6. I always want to blog but feel like I don't have enough thoughts to meaningfully fill up a post. Then a month goes by and I forget half of what I wanted to share to begin with or life just moves on, or both. So, here I am. Bear with me if things get ramble-y but I'm determined to get this done and posted. The biggest news of the last few months is that (1) Tyler is out of the Marine Corps after 7+ years and (2) he got married. I'm not sure which he was happier about. KIDDING! He also just bought a house in St. Augustine and he and wife Angela moved in last week. He's now an actual Florida resident again and is less than 3 hours away. My (step)son Michael and his wife and son also live in St. Augustine so all of my boys are in the state and an easy drive. The official wedding pics aren't available yet but I'll share the few I have. I didn't take many pics that day, knowing I'd be able to borrow from everyone else's cell. I just wanted to enjoy the day, not the phone.  My boys, Left to Right: Michael, Alex, Tyler. The \"baby,\" Alex (25), turned out the tallest. A fact he never forgets to mention. Tyler had as his groomsmen his brothers and two Marine buddies, one of whom was his best man. He's definitely made some lifetime USMC friends. Rah. Weird that he's now a former Marine.Tyler and Angela in St. Peter's, an historic Catholic church in Beaufort, SC. They both looked beautiful. :-) Loved Angela's romantic and very tastefully feminine dress.On the church steps.Arriving in a 1957 Chevy to the reception, which was held at Traditions on Parris Island.The Hollywood kiss!After the reception at the \"after party.\" Angela had changed into this dress. Tyler kept his tux on.And, no. I didn't make my dress. I thought about it but my sewing time is so limited that I really didn't want to pressure myself. So I went shopping. Where I found even more pressure. Hah. I must have hit the stores in the drought of fancy dresses right after June brides and before the Holidays. There was almost nothing. But I did find the above dress at Dillard's and tried it on. I don't know that I would've tried it on had my choices not been so limited. It's basically a sheath and I don't usually go for those. But this was actually not bad, and ... on sale for $49. Seriously. I couldn't believe it was so inexpensive. So even though it was too big, by at least 2 sizes, I bought it because I knew I could do the alterations. (I wouldn't LIKE doing the alterations but I knew I could do them.)I spent one entire weekend unpicking the CB seam in the dress and lining, removing the really long CB invisible zipper, taking in the dress at CB and sides, and re-hemming dress and lining for me and my sparkly shoes. I also added gathering to the shoulders of the cover-up so the armhole seam wouldn't be 3 inches down my arm. It worked in a pinch, looked pretty, and actually held up for the whole day/evening.The funniest thing about this dress? It is pretty much the EXACT color of the bride's mother's dress. You would think we had planned it. And both of us matched the groomsmens' vests. Once we get the final formal photos, we're all just going to be so color coordinated! And puffy-eyed from bawling our eyes out. Her mom and I are criers. Even Tyler was teared up as Angela came down the aisle. Tissues for everyone! LOLMoving on to sewing …I started this McCall's 7381 well before the wedding. I thought I might wear it to the rehearsal dinner. Yeah, that didn't happen. Which is OK. It was actually on the cold side in SC that week so I would've frozen in this anyway. It was actually below 60 degrees F. Brrrrr.I did finish it this past weekend and lucky you, you get more work bathroom photos. Dark, blurry, and so unflattering.The dress is OK. I don't think it's super flattering on me but it's not the worst either. It is comfortable and it does fit. It's just got a bit too much waist floof to be my best silhouette (which you can see better on Zillie below). The dress may grow on me and I love this fabric, but even if it doesn't, I'm happy I made it. I liked the dress pattern when it first came out and I've wanted to try it. I'm not sure how I'll feel about ironing it when it comes out of the laundry. If nothing else, that may relegate it to occasional wear only. Not a big iron-er here anymore. Press-er when sewing, yes. Ironing, newp.Pattern notes: I sewed it without too much pattern alteration. I did alter for my square shoulders since this is a woven (rayon challis from Fabricmart). I blended from 16-ish neck/chest to 20-22-ish at waist hips. I recall the pattern being lettered (S-M-L-etc) instead of numbered sizes, so blending was kind of an \"by eye\" thing. I also added about 6 inches to the above-knee view, since I wanted below-knee. I did not do an FBustA, but did a FBicepA (hah, so witty) of about 1 inch. The sleeves eased in very well, probably due to the give of the rayon. I haven't sewn a set-in sleeve in forEVER and I was not looking forward to fighting with excess ease. Luckily, I didn't have to. Dodged that bullet. All in all, it's a good pattern. I would recommend it.It should be obvious in the pics above and below that I added pockets and have my hand jammed down in one. Pockets. Yay!Here it is on Zillie. See the waist floof? It's kind of blouson-y, kind of not. I think it would be much better if my waist didn't have its own blousons.Closer view of the bodice. I'm not sure if you can tell without me pointing it out, but I did sew down all the pleats (shoulders and waist, 12 total). I was not about to press pleats each time this comes out of the laundry, on top of regular dress ironing. No way.Next up is the True Bias Hudson pant that's now a couple of years old. Nancy mentioned on Instagram that she converted one of her TNT woven pants patterns to a pattern for knits. I could do that, but I also like to just sew new-to-me patterns. Especially new-to-me *popular* patterns. I like to see for myself if the bandwagon is worth jumping on. I'm guessing I'm not alone. I'll keep you posted.Signing off for now. I'll be back when I've got more wedding pics! I bet you can't wait. :-)"},
{"title": "Another Hot Patterns 1120: Primavera Dress", "date": "Wednesday, August 9, 2017", "text": "It's been 6 years since I first made this dress. (Old blog post here.) I'm much happier with this one than the last because I tweaked the fit better. And it doesn't look like a quasi skeleton costume (reference to previous fabric). Time flies, because I certainly wasn't planning on a 6-year break from the first try. This pattern is currently on clearance on the HotPatterns website. I guess it seems like an old pattern now to them, but it's actually still on trend. I would recommend the pattern. It's got some nice shaping and details that could be a bit tricky/time consuming to just hack yourself.Once again, you're getting work bathroom selfies. I did get a new, more portable, little tripod thingie but I haven't tried it out yet so the bathroom it is. Wild-eyed sideways glance.I already had the pattern cut from last time but I did need to review my notes to deal with the fitting problems. First up was raising the scandalously low neckline. Not quite sure who would ever wear it as it was. Even with the 2 inches I added, it's still on the low side on me, but I'm not flashing anyone anymore so that's good. The bust darts (which are French darts) needed no adjustment, nor did I need to add bust room. Here's the finished dress on Zillie. The gathers at center front make me think I'm disguising my tummy. I'm probably not, but it's a good thought.The pattern is originally designed with a facing which gets sewn into the waist seam. Since I recently finished the Turner dress, which has a fully lined bodice, it inspired me to ditch the facing and copy the lined bodice idea. I'm not a fan of facings in general and I usually have problems with HP's facings in particular so I try to eliminate them whenever I can. It did take a little reimagining the construction steps, but it wasn't too complicated.In this photo below you can also see how the pockets are made. It's really one big pocket which spans the front of the skirt, but it functions as two separate sideseam pockets. Even though it's one piece and you could actually touch hands inside across it, you don't really notice it's not normal separate pockets since the shape is such that your hands just go downward and don't want to meet up.Closer pocket bag pic. I recall having a hard time figuring out these pockets from the instructions the first time but I had no problem at all this time so I guess I was just being a blockhead before.I did interface the pocket facing piece, which gives the opening a bit of stability, which you can see below.  You might also see that I forgot to snip the seam allowance to lay flat around the pocket facing and my sleeve hem needs a bit of trimming too. And by \"needs,\" I mean I've already worn this as-is and am too lazy to go back and trim anything. ;-)I did face the hem as per the instructions, and I understitched the joining seam before coverstitching the hem facing in place. I really like the extra something that a wide, faced hem adds to a knit dress. It just feels fancier and more substantial and it definitely hangs nicer.The sleeves are kind of a hybrid between set-in and raglan. HotPatterns calls it semi-raglan. The armsyce is set inward further than a true set-in sleeve and there's a shoulder dart.I didn't reshape the shoulder dart for my very square shoulders as I usually do with darted raglans and I love the semi-structured shape that resulted. Slight Crystal Carrington vibe, but my shoulders are narrow so the illusion of a little width there is a good thing on me.The understitched inside neckline.Below shows I edgestitched waistline to stabilize joining seam allowances, skipping the gathered areas. I used a small ZZ for this to allow some give when sitting, etc.Rear view. Not quite as symmetric as I thought I had it laid out before cutting. Oh well. Plus, even though I adjusted the back this time, I still had to take in the CB seam about an inch at the neckline, tapering to nothing by mid upper back, and I still needed to remove an additional 3/4\" from the back bodice length, tapering to nothing at the sideseams. You can see this if you're looking for it. Tweaking the fit would have been a whole lot easier if I had basted that CB seam instead of sewing it for reals AND adding the understitched lining. The dress had to stand in time out for a week before I wanted to deal with it again. But I'm glad I did. I really like the dress. It's comfortable any time but especially good for hot Florida summer days.Me, still in that bathroom. Woo.Parting funny shots. While I was nearly done sewing this dress, I noticed the spool was running dangerously low. I was on the homestretch attaching the hem facing, which would leave only coverstitching (with different thread spools) to do after this seam. Could I make it? It was going to be close.And then the bobbin ran out. Yeah. (Really should get that bobbin sensor fixed.)See ya next time!

{"title": "Turner Two", "date": "Friday, July 14, 2017", "text": "I finally was able to revisit the Cashmerette Turner dress (pattern link HERE (nayy) and previous review HERE).This fabric, from Fabricmart, sat in my stash for exactly 4 minutes before it was on the cutting table with Turner pattern pieces on it. It's a fun, summery ITY print with just enough body. Side note: I wish Fabricmart would stop labeling all ITYs the same and divide them up a bit by weight. I made no changes from my last pattern modifications (narrowing the shoulders/neckline) except to lower the front vee about an inch, which equals a net 1-inch raise from the original pattern neckline. At this level, it's not quite cleavage revealing, which does well for me at work. I also added about an inch to the skirt length for no particular reason except to change it up. Sewing is a fickle wench. :-)In addition to the few minor pattern issues I mentioned in my original Turner review, there are a couple of \"truing\" mistakes, which are easily corrected. By mentioning them here, maybe Jenny of Cashmerette will make note of them for the next print runs/editions of the pattern.First, the sleeve hem allowance is not shaped correctly for a perfect fold-up.Second, the side seams finish in a point at the hem edge. I trimmed the point so it blended into the curve of the hem edge, which makes for a smoother hem turn-up on a circle-ish skirt.No mistakes here! I'm just showing off the nice point at the vee. :-)I remembered to add my pass card loop. I just love having these when I don't have pockets.And I added a self-fabric sash (interfaced with scraps of Perfect Fuse), which means I really didn't need the pass card loop. Hey, it's nice to have options! With that sash in place, I'm easily imagining a hack to Turner into a faux wrap dress. Excuse the bad pun. Maybe it won't take me another 6-7 months for my next go.Happy Friday! I'm hoping to continue this weekend with my next sewing project."},
{"title": "Found! ", "date": "Thursday, July 6, 2017", "text": "I found both my sewjo and that big stack of missing patterns. Life is good.Here's me today, back in the work bathroom for selfies, sporting the new 2-piece dress (aka skirt and top). And boy do I need a haircut!But first, the missing patterns. I have no explanation for not looking in this little chest/box which I walk past at least ten times a day, except that I must have just mentally ruled it out, thinking I already checked it. So glad I decided to double-check my assumption. It was like Christmas and my birthday all in one! And good to know that I haven't quite lost my mind. Yet.Last post, I talked about mashing up my TNT Ottobre tee with the Love Notions Laundry Day Tee, the main reason being that I felt the overall upper bodice shape of the LDT was not the shape I knew I prefer for my tees. I did keep the LDT neckline and neckband piece, and swing shaping at the hemline, and I'm happy with those. The vee neckline shape is very nice and the band went on without a gape or pucker. I'll definitely use this neckline shape again. (Side note: Does anyone remember the Jalie 2005 tee and how that neckline stormed the online sewing world?)I probably should've planned the seam on the band better relative to the print, but overall it's just not that noticeable from a regular distance, especially given the focus-pulling wild print. Or it's laziness. Or both. You be the judge.Here's the top before any hems were sewn. Even after we all know the CF of the band isn't symmetrical, are you really noticing that? Yeah, I didn't think so. :-)For the skirt, I used one of the long-lost-but-now-found patterns. I liked the flippy-ness/trumpet shape of all the lengths when I originally bought it, and still did once the pattern re-surfaced. The length I sewed is between Views D and E. I can see me using this pattern a LOT since it's only 2 pattern pieces and 3 seams and takes less than a yard of fabric for even my generous posterior.So-so pattern matching at the sideseams. It's not an exact pattern to match so good enough is good enough, and about all that can be expected.A quick hanger shot of the skirt. I decided to place the horizontal stripes section at the top of the skirt so they would be \"hidden\" under the top when worn. I thought it would be too much of a good thing to see one more row of those stripes. The eyes wouldn't know where to rest. I'm happy with that decision.The whole outfit on Zillie.I'll be back soon because I have another finished project to share, and I'm expecting a fun sewing blogger meet-up tomorrow. Stay tuned!"},
{"title": "Laundry Day Tee. Or Not.", "date": "Monday, June 19, 2017", "text": "Yes, I'm actually posting twice in the same month. I'll wait while you get off the floor.So apparently one of the best ways to kickstart a missing sewjo is to write a blog post about how little desire you have to sew. And in a similar vein, when in that same blogpost you lament about not liking any fabric choices you've seen lately … well, you know where that's going. Yep. A few yards may have jumped into my shopping cart during Fabricmart's latest Pyramid sale. And then possibly a few more a week later during the Knits sale.That's all good news. But I am not without hiccups and speed bumps in this story.Let's begin.First, last year I had bought a crap-ton of patterns during one of the BMV all-brands sales. My order arrived. I ooohed. I ahhed. I made plans. I bought fabric. I dreamed. I put the patterns … well, that's just it. I have NO IDEA where I put those patterns (or a few others) and I've been looking for them on/off for MONTHS. My house is not big. I'm fairly organized. I cannot solve this mystery. I give up. I've decided I'll repurchase some of them during the next BMV all-brand sale. (And then I'll find the missing stack.)So I moved on for the time being. While I may not have been sewing myself these past months, I still have been reading sewing blogs and websites and checking into Facebook sewing/pattern groups regularly. I've seen more than a few Love Notions Laundry Day Tees made up and modeled, with lots of raving about the pattern. Being the lemming that I am, or maybe because it was free when you join the LN Facebook group, I downloaded the PDF and printed it last week, with plans to use some of the newly acquired Fabricmart yardage. Yesterday, I got the pattern out to tape the sheets together, which I did. I know it's free and all, but I wasn't extremely impressed, starting with the fact the PDF is supposed to be \"trimless.\" This means you don't need to slice off unprinted page margins to accurately join the pages into one cohesive layout. I found I still needed to trim. Not a big deal. I'm used to it. I'm not ready to blame Love Notions on this yet because I haven't double-checked my printer settings (and I'm not sure I will spend time to do so), but do be warned in case it's a legit problem.What really bugged me was the pattern itself. See below.First, the front and back aren't separate pieces. If you're away from your printer when you realize this and can't print a quick duplicate, it means you have to trace or tape the jigsaw puzzle back together. It also means you're going to be ticked off. I absolutely do not see the point in this (the print layout, not the being ticked off). Well, OK, there is a slight point if you're printing to a commercial print house's large format printer and paying by the sheet, but even then, give us the option of more sheets with the other half of the damn pattern so we can decide for ourselves which pages to print.Next, it should be obvious that if the front and back pieces are identical,  except for necklines, there's a good chance it won't fit a curvy body. Pretty sure my front and back aren't anywhere close to identical. I won't even talk about the sleeve being cut on the fold. Guess it's a good thing after all that I didn't do all that \"extra\" printing. ;-) I'm not truly knocking this pattern because (1) I haven't actually sewn it and (2) it does get lots of love and I have seen some very nice finished tees. But I did conclude it wasn't for me and the symmetrical drafting makes me hesitant to try a paid-for LN pattern.Side note on the LDT - Does anyone understand what the heck is meant by this? It totally does not make sense.I decided what I was really after was the overall trapeze shape of the LDT and looked for my Cashmerette Concord pattern to just do that simple hack. Apparently my paper version of the Concord is with the other missing patterns mentioned above. Grrr, that MIA list just keeps getting longer. But I knew I also had a PDF version (from testing) that was already trimmed and ready to tape, and I was able to locate that one. Except … I was missing at least 6 of the pages. Six pages that would fall right across the bodice. I have no idea how that happened. Apparently, I'm getting old and senile. Missing patterns. Missing pattern pages. Missing brain.Instead of giving up, I reached for my so very trusty TNT, the Ottobre Woman tee from the 02/2007 issue (cover below) and added the flare and length of the LDT.And then I cut it out of this, with enough left for a matching skirt cuz I love me some 2-piece dresses. Yes, I know it's only a skirt and a top. I just like saying 2-piece dress. It sounds fancier. Humor me. :-)And then I was done \"sewing\" for the day. I've made a deal with myself to spend at least 15 minutes a weekday on this until it's done. I think I'll stick with it because I'm excited about the print placement for this one and want to see it finished. If I had started with the Ottobre, I'd be done by now. I hope I learned that lesson."},
{"title": "Quick Update", "date": "Tuesday, June 6, 2017", "text": "It's pretty sad that I've now got to start any blog post with \"Yes, I'm alive\" but when 6+ months go by, I guess it's to be expected. (Yes, I'm alive.)Sewing has taken a back burner for a while. I've had limited sewing time and when I did manage to eek out something, I ended up with wadders. Very frustrating. And the \"best\" way to instantly kill the sewjo. I'm still dreaming/thinking about sewing and will get back to it, but I'm also having trouble finding inspirational fabric. In other words, I'm not seeing very much lately that is ME. I keep looking, but I keep deciding that what's in the cart isn't really doing it for me and just close the check-out window. I'm pretty sure it's not my sewing ennui that is creating my \"problem.\" I'm just not loving what's available at the moment (this \"moment has been going on for months!). And while I still have a substantial stash, even it is pretty depleted of favorites (what I want to sew/wear), so that's not much of a help either. Ahh. First-world problems. If you'd like to share any online fabric stores with great prints I may have missed, please feel free to enable me in the comments. :-)So, if not sewing, what have I been doing? Well for starters, I've been working at my job during the weekdays. I've been here 3 years now . On weekends, I've been 50% of the \"rehab crew\" for Alex's real estate investment adventures. He's just finished fixing-up and renting out his third property. It's been a lot of fun to work with him and I'm beaming with pride at his success but I'm definitely too old and out of shape to do this more than part-time! A couple of months just on weekends kicks my butt.Here are the Before/During/After pics of the kitchen we just completed.Last month, my stepson Michael got married. Here he is below with his beautiful bride Hannah. (Do you see the peacock behind them?)The goofball groomsmen brothers. For any of you long-time readers, can you believe Alex is my \"baby\" and he's already 25. The years just fly!Tyler is still in the Marine Corps (a Sergeant now) … for about 4 more months. Then he will leave the Corps, marry his fiancée Angela (below) in October, and start new adventures. Overall, life is good. There just hasn't been much sewing going on and my intentions to check in are on that infamous road. Hopefully, I'll be revving up the machines soon. I need things!"},
{"title": "Cashmerette Turner Dress Reveal and Thoughts", "date": "Thursday, December 29, 2016", "text": "I finished my first go with the Cashmerette Turner dress a few days ago, and I have some thoughts. (Suprised? Hah.) My overall opinion is that it's a great, easy-to-sew dress pattern for those of us with some fluff and boobage. Especially those of us with fluff and boobage who've been eyeing the Kitschy-Koo Lady Skater dress for a long while without pulling the trigger. I'm glad I waited.This is the finished dress. The neckline looks better on Zillie, which is my fault for being lazy in the process, and which I'll get into more below.This is how I'll probably wear it most days, since it's chilly in the office and I like a pop of color with black and white. You're getting from-the-top-of-the-mountain shots since instead of dragging my tripod outside for pics, I dragged Alex and, well, he's taller than the tripod.Here's the finished dress on its own (well, on me), with no cardi camouflage for my lumpy bits. :-)And the rear view. No back wrinkles. I believe there's a small sway back alteration built into the pattern. If so, good on ya Cashmerette!Lots of swing in the skirt, which I like. A lot. With my arms going backward, I've got a slight Hunchback of Notre Dame thing going on. Nice.So, let's get into the nitty-gritty of the pattern itself and my opinions on it. Because I do have a few. I hope they are taken as honest and constructive criticism because that's how I roll. Remember, my overall opinion is that it's a great dress. And although I've been a Cashmerette tester and have received free patterns in the past, I didn't test this dress at all and I wasn't given the pattern. Disclaimers out of the way, OK, here we go.I don't have extremely narrow shoulders but they are on the narrow side. (And very square.) Cashmerette's draft is for a much wider shoulder than mine. And less sloped than most patterns (less sloped for me is good).I'm not a big fan of the instructions for choosing size. I get (and appreciate) that you should choose by your full bust since these patterns are drafted for larger busts, but I think the instruction doesn't go far enough. There are other things going on in the bodice area beside boobs. So, if you already know you have narrow shoulders, size down for the upper bodice. If you're unsure, make a muslin. I believe Cashmerette are at least consistent, so if you need narrower in one, you're going to need narrower in all.Above is my first go at the bodice. Using the instructions, I chose the size which was closest to my bust and waist measurements. This put me in the 18. I went up a cup size from my actual measurement since I knew the boob area is drafted with negative ease and I didn't want a sausage casing. :-) The resulting shoulders are definitely much too wide on me. If you look carefully, you can see my nude-colored bra strap on your left. The other strap isn't showing only because my arm is lifted to take the pic and the fabric moved. And while I don't mind some cleavage now and then, I don't like it at work and this was to be a office-bound dress. It's a pretty and flattering neckline, just not work appropriate for me.Here's the first bodice on Zillie (with a past skirt still on her below). Size 18 E/F.Here's the second bodice with the neckline raised (sigh, too much) and narrowed. Size 16 E/F blended to an 18 at waist and below. My \"sweet spot\" for the neckline depth on the next make will be somewhere in the middle. The width, however, is now perfect.My neckline alterations. I added about an inch to the width to narrow the neckline opening. Even going all the way to the 12's stock width would still be too wide on me. I want those straps covered dammit. :-) I raised the vee about two inches. Which is about an inch too much in the final dress. I was counting on the weight of the skirt pulling the bodice down somewhat but it really didn't. I could've futzed with the neckline before finishing the waist seam, but laziness won. Who wants to pick out understitching after all? I'll live with this neckline and probably add a bright and pretty scarf to visually lower the focus.Two things I want to point out here (besides the dog hair). One you can see in the photo above, and one you can't. First, as you can see above, the shoulder join results in a much sharper angle than the curve I created with my added tissue. If you leave it as-is without smoothing, be sure to trim your seam allowances well in this area so the fabric turns and lays nicely. Otherwise, you're going to get puckers. My 2 cents is to just make it a smoother curve before you cut your fabric. I'm not really a fan of these angular front/back neckline joins.Second, let's talk about the waist seam. I've seen many comments out on the interwebs about how high the waist seam is on this dress. So I thought I'd outsmart myself and just add 1/2\" to it when I was cutting the bodice pieces. I sewed Bodice 2 to the skirt and tried it on. You know where this is going, right? Yeah. I unpicked the skirt (and my little pass card loop which you can't see in any of the pics but which is there and I love it), cut off that 1/2\" and reattached the skirt. And it's now at a much more flattering spot for me and lets the skirt skim the lumps. It's amazing how much difference 1/2\" can make. So much for outsmarting myself. Unless you're very long-waisted and/or tall, you're probably going to want the seam as drafted. But at the very least, if you do add to it, BASTE the skirt on and check. The seam will hit a different spot with the weight of the skirt.Oh, a third. I bought the downloadable PDF version. I just want to note that it's not a paper pig and the pieces went together quickly and accurately. I'm on Team PDF. I love me some instant gratification, especially when I can print at work. And even trim the pages during down time. Shhhh. I didn't say that. :-)Here's the completed dress inside-out. As you can see, the bodice is fully lined. Which I like and which makes finishing the neckline easy-peasy. However, there are a few things in the instructions for this which I don't like. First, you are instructed to trim 1/8\" from the lining neckline before you sew the shoulder seams (to allow for turn of cloth and keeping the seam to the inside). Nope. The pieces aren't going to line up as well if you trim before sewing. Sew the shoulder seams and THEN trim the 1/8\" from the lining neckline edge. It just works better. Next quiggle: you're instructed to sew the lining and outer necklines together and then clip the vee. OK. But ... you really should add a small piece of fusible interfacing to the vee area before you clip. At least I would. And did. I want a bit of added stability to my clippage.And, finally, you are instructed to understitch at 1/4\". Nope, it should be 1/8\", or less, as shown above. (Jenny of Cashmerette confirmed on the sew-along pages that this is, indeed, a typo.)The hem is 1.5\". Love a deep hem on knits. I didn't add or remove anything from the length of the skirt and turned a generous 1.5\" hem. The finished dress hits just below my kneecap. I'm 5'5\".The instructions have you sew the waist seam and add clear elastic while you're doing so. Eh. Clear elastic is a pain on its best day. Feel free to sew swear-free and use regular elastic (The instructions tell you this, but the supply list doesn't. Just remember to add a seam allowance to your elastic since the instructions don't.). Or, do like me and omit elastic altogether. I sewed the seam with a very, very slight zigzag and then used a 4-thread overcast with my serger very close to the seam stitching. (See above.) That waist ain't going nowheres.More insides. The sleeve hems are 1\". Which is a good amount IMO.Other pattern criticisms:1. There are no body landmark markings. Such as bust point, waist, etc. Major boo.2. There is no finished length given. Regular boo.3. There are no neckline variations. Easy enough to DIY, and Jenny has created a blog page with instructions, but still, it would've been so much nicer to have variations drawn on the pattern, especially at this price point.4. And pockets. There really should be a pocket option. Again, I can DIY, but I shouldn't have to.As I said, overall I think the dress is a winner and I'll definitely make it again. It's flattering. Love, love the in-built FBA. Love the fast sew. Love the twirl! I'll probably use the skirt pieces to make an actual skirt, since they're perfect and now ready to go.Yes, I know I promised a post on pattern ease. Still coming, but blog laziness is a tough mother.Happy New Year!"},
{"title": "A New Work Outfit: HotPatterns 1189 and Kwik Sew 3256", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2016", "text": "I just can't resist this work bathroom for selfies. It has a huge mirror and great lighting. Plus it's a solo room, so  no chance of being embarrassingly \"caught.\" I finished this top on Sunday and the skirt last night and wore them both to work today. The top is a Hot Patterns Fast & Fabulous Shirt-Tail T. It's definitely a fast sew and the first-try fit is better than the similar Maria Denmark Kirsten Kimono Tee I made earlier in the year. I like the lower scoop neck of the F&FSTT better than the boatneck KKT and the shoulder seams hit me better. The KKT tends to pull backward. The F&FSTT also has a bit more drafted-in waist shaping, which could easily be added to the KKT if one were so inclined. The F&FSTT also has a couple more styling options with the cuffed sleeves and the optional piecing and/or flounces. As for overall sizing, I agree with other reviewers that this pattern runs large. Even larger than most HPs on me. I used a straight 14. This is at least one size smaller, and maybe two depending on the style, at the hips than what I usually cut for HPs. My fabric (an ITY) is sorta striped so I chose the pieced front. Unfortunately, the striping isn't obvious enough that the piecing is truly noticeable. Still, I do like the way the zebra stripe changes direction. I'll make this again and either use a more obvious stripe or, more likely, color/pattern block it.The back is seamed and I chose not to perfectly match across that seam for more visual interest.This actually looks more pieced than the front. Hah.This fabric is pretty lightweight and I felt the sleeve cuffs wouldn't stay cuffed without some help so I interfaced them with some Palmer/Pletsch Light fusible interfacing. I like the extra body it added to the cuffs.I wish I had added some interfacing to the neckband. It's OK the way it is, but it would be a lot better if it had more heft. The neckline is also a tiny bit too wide for me. It's better out of the envelope than most HPs on me, but note that the neckline is the same size/width for all sizes so you'll definitely want to think about muslining it. I thought about it, and plunged ahead anyway. :-)The neckband non-heft and width and having a long scrap left over inspired a necktie/scarf. I like that the tie adds visual interest (Does this print actually need more visual interest?) and takes the \"T\" up a notch for office wear and under cardigan.All I did was use a 3-thread rolled hem to lettuce the edge a little bit. Easy-peasy, and now I have a scarf to wear with other things too.Here's how I was actually dressed today. Tampa was in the 40s this morning. OMG. I've been meaning to make a longer black ponte skirt for quite a while and finally got around to it Sunday/Monday. I pulled out this old Kwik Sew pattern. I'm sure many of you have it also, and have probably made it. The longer View A was a thing about 10 years ago. I think it's pretty much a classic and I've always had a thing for flounces. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to use this pattern since I short-changed myself some skirts over the years. I did add back waist darts by tracing them from my TNT Magic Pencil and before that I shortened the whole skirt from the top about 4 inches (since it's pretty straight down from the waist and the flounce was already attached and who wants to rip all that out?). Without shortening it, it would've been nearly a maxi on 5'5\" me. Whenever I make it again, I'll also probably narrow it too since it's on the wide side and I'd like it more pegged. It's a KS Plus pattern and I'm on the edge between their Regular and Plus sizes. I did keep the slit, although I noted many of the old reviews on PR mentioned sewing it closed. I'm not sure why since it's low on the leg, even after I chopped off the top, so it's not even remotely revealing. I like the added visual interest. Here's a couple of totally dorkus pics in my back yard after work, with the sun doing odd shadowy things to my face. I still have the post on Big 4 ease coming but it's more fun to post finished projects. I'm hoping to finish it during the upcoming long Thanksgiving weekend. I'm really looking forward to the time off and hope to get into the sewing room some more."},
{"title": "Butterick 6222 - Done", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2016", "text": "I seem to be on an every other month blogging schedule. Ergh. I really don't like that. I miss blogging. I miss you all.But back to the post at hand. Here's a dress I finished a couple of weeks ago. In order to get some photos of me in it, I resorted to work bathroom selfies. I'm so classy that way. I should sneak in my tripod. The lighting is awesome in here.The pattern is Butterick 6222 by Connie Crawford. I'm into swingy dresses at the moment and I've always had a sweet spot for ruffles so this was a no-brainer buy during one of the Club BMV sales. I can leave Connie Crawford herself (I've met her) but I have to admit to the irony of actually liking a number of her Butterick patterns. Well, the styles anyway. I get irked at the actual pattern sheets since there's no layout of the pattern pieces. I love those layouts (both for studying shapes and for knowing which pieces I need to cut from the tissue) and miss them tremendously in her patterns. Butterick, I hope you're paying attention.The pattern calls for wovens but I went rogue and used an ITY knit from either Fabric.com or Fabricmart. They both blend together at this point. Ha.This is one of those non-numerically sized patterns. In other words, S-M-L-XL-XXL-3X-4X, etc. Another thing I'm not fond of with the CC patterns which are sized thus. Plus, the smaller range is in one envelope and the larger in another. I always opt for the smaller range in CC since I need that sizing for my upper body. For this dress, I blended from the M in the upper areas to the L/XL below. I probably could've gone just to the L below but a little more swing in the skirt wasn't going to be a bad thing so I erred on the side of more. It worked out fine, especially since I used a knit.There's enough ease in my dress using this blended sizing to work for a woven if I ever decide to go that route. But I doubt I will. I'm a wash and wear girl. Ain't got no time for ironing before work. :-) Using a knit, though, added some weight/drag and made the neckline lower than I'm comfortable wearing in the office (or out of it) without a cami so a cami underneath will be the way I'll wear it. (I made this cami years ago from Ressy's Powerdry knit when my coverstitch machine was new. Does anyone remember that? It's still going strong. And I think I may even have more in the stash somewhere.) There are side bust darts since it's for a woven and they hit me at the exact right place. I might have to do a slight FBA in a woven, but maybe not. I'll probably never know. ;-)I edgestitched the diagonal seams, front and back, to define them more. It shows up better in real life.I also omitted the neckline facings and just turned and topstitched, running the stitching down the seam which joins the two front bodice pieces. Kind of a faux wrap effect. I actually was going to go with the facings but they didn't fit properly. I'm not sure yet if it was me, the fabric, or the pattern, and I haven't gone back to check, so just make a mental note for yourself to check if you make this dress.There's a LOT of hemming on this dress between the circular skirt and the circular overskirrt/ruffle. I just sat myself in front of the TV with glass head pins and pinned about every 2 inches, eyeballing about 1/2\" for the ruffle and 5/8\" for the skirt. After pinning, I took the pieces to the ironing board and pressed the hems into place and then topstitched.A little twirl action. This dress has lots of movement and it's fun to wear.Trust  me, you're glad I cropped out my face on that one. What WAS I doing with my eyes?And a 3/4 view, where you can see that I forgot to add a loop for my ID card. I was so mad at myself for the lapse but there was no way I was going back to unpick overlocking and topstitching. So I hook the card onto the ruffle, and it ends up sliding down by the end of the day, where it is in this photo. Maybe I'll add a loop under the ruffle. It's not attached in the side seam so this should actually be pretty easy to do. We'll see how much it bugs me without it.Final verdict: I love my dress. It's comfortable. It's flattering. And it was an easy sew. I'd recommend the pattern. The worst part was cutting the flouncy pieces since they're so wide and I used slippery ITY, and then hemming it all. Nothing really hard, just more on the tedious side of things. Which reminds me of one thing I did hate about the pattern. The pieces for the front skirt and ruffle are actually just one piece for the skirt with a separate cutting line for the ruffle. I wish they were separate pieces because if I ever do make this again, I'll have to tape those pieces back together to cut the front skirt again. I did make alignment marks, but still.I'd say that I'll see you in another couple of months, but I actually have a post in the works on McVoguerick pattern ease to address some conversations I've seen and/or participated in on Pattern Review. The Big 3 aren't undeserving of some criticism but sizing and ease are not one of the things they do wrong. It's Us, not Them, and I'll speak to that soon."},
{"title": "Hot Patterns 1138 - Or, I finally finished something", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2016", "text": "My posts are now so far and few between that I feel like I should start every one off with \"Yep, still alive.\" Blame Instagram. Blame my lack of home technology. I really need a new desktop computer but don't want to spend the bucks on it. I have a decent laptop but I really dislike blogging on it, so I'm just not doing it. Plus, I just haven't been sewing as much. A lot of that was some weight gain and not feeling motivated to sew for a body I wasn't keeping, but I'm back on track again after a kickstart with the Whole30 program.Whole30 is a \"whole\" 'nother post but the short version is that I like it. I don't feel deprived at all and have found it pretty easy to eat this way. Mostly because its how I want to eat, how I used to eat. I just got lazy the last year and slid down a slippery slope. But I have a wedding to attend in May 2017 (my stepson Michael) and I'm determined to look great again by then.So onto my latest finished project, the HotPatterns Metropolitan Verano dress. It seems that this very easy sew takes me FOREVER to finish. The last time I made it, I had started it and then lost *that* job and so it sat on Zillie. It sat on Zillie this time too, but not for any bad reason. I was just focused on other things. And once again, I'm wondering why I let it sit. I love my new dress. It's easy and comfortable to wear and I think it's flattering. I'm really not into shifts or boxy silhouettes. They look horrible on me. This dress with its elastic waist will also still fit for a while as I go down in sizes, which is great.Speaking of sizes, this is the same straight 12 I made last time except this time I tilted the upper back bodice inward on the fold to remove a little neckline width since I had to take two darts in the back neck last time to compensate for gaping. My down-n-dirty fix worked; no darts needed. Now I am not a 12 in anything but Hot Patterns so please, please do muslins (even partial) for these patterns. They run big from their measurement chart, but it's pretty consistent across the pattern line.No great photography here at Chez Stitches and Seams. Work bathroom selfies all the way. Heh heh.Here's how the untwisted fronts sat and sat, mocking me.The pattern calls for a neckline facing and while it's pretty much OK in my first make of this dress, I'm not in love. So I tossed that pattern piece (figuratively) and just turned the edge twice and stitched. I like this finish much, much better, even if it take 437 pins.Here's what it looks like on the inside. This method means changing the construction order so that the center front is sewn after finishing the neckline and then just stitched as high as you want the neckline to plunge (or not).I also took the same shortcuts for the waist as I did last time. I did not overlock the seams and created a casing from the seam allowances between the bodice and skirt. I threaded elastic through and just ran it over the sideseam and under the front twist/knot. Easy-peasy and no one but us knows the difference. The other change from the pattern that I made was to cut the back pieces on the fold to eliminate unnecessary seams.I didn't add my super nifty card key loop on this, because I forgot. But I realized I can just clip it into the knot/twist, which is just as handy.Extra goofy face.And here's the flip-flop pic once I got home, so you can see the fit a little better. With a little Chili photobomber.I've got another Cashmerette Concord tee (with a Hot Patterns inspired hack) cut out. Hopefully, I'll be back here with that sooner rather than later.Stay well!"},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 4154 - A Winner! (The reveal and the review)", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2016", "text": "Long time, no see. Kinda like my sewing mojo these days. My mental list of things I want to make always overtakes the Department of Time and Energy. Summer is (and has been) here in Florida and it's back to hot and humid. I always call this time of year the Florida \"winter,\" which only means that I compare this time of wanting to stay inside and avoid the weather to actual winter months for colder climates. I wouldn't want to go outside in January in Wisconsin, for example, and neither do I want to spend much time outside here in Tampa in July/August. Well, at least not very far from ice-cold cocktails and the air-conditioner for a quick cool-down. :-)Well, I did finally trap some sewjo and set about to make a new summer dress. (I have at least 20 more summer garments I want to make. Yeah, don't hold your breath.)From the Kwik Sew website: Dresses have semi-fitted bodice with center front seam, V-neckline finished with self-fabric facing, front and back partial gathers at waist seam, tie ends at sides to be tied in front and back zipper closure. Dress A: Narrow hemmed short sleeves, straight skirt with front and back waist darts and back vent. Dress B: Armholes finished with bias tape and narrow-hemmed flared skirt.I made view B, but added the view A sleeves. KS patterns are sized XS-S-M-L-XL, which corresponds to measurement ranges per size given on the envelope. The letter size usually correlates to the larger of the measurement range so if you're in between sizes, keep that in mind. My experience with KS is also that they tend to have more ease than I want. I started with the M for neckline/shoulders/bodice and morphed to L/LX at waist and below. This pattern has gathers at the waist which I figured would give the girls plenty of breathing room, and I was right. No FBA was done or was needed. Before cutting the pattern, I made my usual 3/8\" square shoulder adjustment with KS patterns and raised the M armhole 3/8\" to match the shoulder adjustment. This worked well. The armholes hit my armpits high, like I prefer. Not too high, but just enough. For next time, though, I probably will move the side front armhole inward toward my chest as it's sitting a bit too wide for my personal preference. Nothing that screams \"bad fit\" or anything, just not how I want it to be in a perfect dress. The only other \"alteration\" I made was to add an inch to the bottom hem when I cut, for insurance. I turned a 1.25\" hem in the end and I like the finished length so this was a good call, although I don't think it would be too short if I didn't add that inch.While I really like the finished dress and the pattern overall, I absolutely HATE the facings. First of all, this pattern is supposed to be for knits and wovens and while the facings are interfaced, there's no way in a knit they would ever stand up per the pattern photograph. Which is actually a happy accident for me, because I do prefer them falling into a \"lapel\" and opening the neckline somewhat. It's a much more flattering look on me. I stitched and understitched the facings and still they wanted to roll outward. Grrr. I knew this would happen but didn't heed my inner voice. I even topstitched the entire neckline edge and down the \"vee\" and still they rolled. I settled on the sledge hammer approach and just fused the damn things completely at the front and strategically on the back neckline, using some 3/8\" Steam-a-Seam. It worked. I'm good. But next time, I'm either changing the neckline and binding it or I'm making a self-fabric upper lining.I did make a few changes to the construction, mostly because I was using a knit. A heavy knit. (This is a rayon knit from the Nicole Miller collection at Joann's. Yes, Joann's. And I actually ordered it online instead of in person. This was a first for me. The fabric is very, very nice. I highly recommend it.)First, I eliminated all ease in the sleeve cap by cutting a smaller size and sewed it in flat. And while I did follow the instructions for creating the waist gathers front and back (which you can see in the photo above), in the end it wasn't really necessary since I made an interior \"casing\" by sewing the bodice and skirt seam allowances together and inserting 3/8\" elastic. The rayon knit is very heavy and I knew it would need some support for the waist seam to actually stay at my waist. I'm glad I did this and I recommend it for anyone making the knit version of this dress. I also eliminated the back zip and CB bodice seam. I knew I'd be able to put this dress on over my head. And I can. Easily. I did keep the back skirt in two pieces to conserve fabric but I think I'd consider using the front one-piece pattern for the back too next time because it's drapey-er/swishy-er than the back. But since I can't see it, I don't even think about it.The last change I made was to add a key card loop thingie like I did for my last dress. I love this feature on that dress! And yes, I could've hooked the card onto the tie front, but I didn't want to distort the sash, so the loop is in the seam under the ties. Which also means it won't show if/when I wear this dress outside of the office. And here's the dress on me, complete with goofy work bathroom mirror selfie face. And back view. You can't see a CB seam in the skirt (yay!) but you can see how it's not quite as swishy. It still looks nice and I'm not unhappy with it. Yep, I'm in the bathroom. I wish Gillian lived closer (and I bet she does too every January!) because I'd definitely bribe her to be my blog photo buddy. What's on your summer sewing list?"},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 3873 and Cashmerette Concord Mash-Up: Reveal", "date": "Monday, May 9, 2016", "text": "I took this past Thursday and Friday off with big plans to sew for 4 days. Well, all I managed to finish was my mash-up of Kwik Sew 3873 with a Cashmerette Concord Tee bodice, but I'm happy with my new dress so it's a win. The weather was just too nice on Saturday to stay inside all day but the biggest speed bump was my second thoughts about all these prints together, resulting in a bad case of analysis paralysis. Cutting went very quickly, especially considering how many pieces there are. Since I was using 3 different fabrics and most pattern pieces were able to be \"nested,\" I still have plenty left of each print for future projects. I had the print mix in my mind before I started, but once I had everything cut out, I started second-guessing myself and visualizing Mrs. Frizzle. I ended up staring at it all on my cutting table for about a day before I finally decided to just do it. Once I actually started, the sewing went fast. The Kwik Sew pieces for the skirt curvy sections have notches that line up perfectly, making alignment and construction very straightforward. And since I morphed the already-tested Cashmerette Concord Tee for the bodice section, fitting alterations were eliminated. With the bodice and skirt sections stitched, it was time for some more navel gazing. I had initially cut out sleeves from the same print as the bodice but then thought maybe I wanted contrasting sleeves. I put out a call for an informal poll on Instagram and the opinions were about equal for both options. I decided the matching sleeves were a little less Crazytown and since I already had them cut out, they won. I'm happy with that decision. A contrast neckband finished up the print mixing.I shortened the sleeves about 2-1/2 inches compared to the KS pattern (not the Concord sleeve) because while I wanted to try the longer short sleeve length, I decided it was too frumpy on me. After the first full try-on, I also shortened the back bodice 1 inch at the center graduating to 0 at the side seams. This was more to fine-tune the morph of the Concord in lieu of a real muslin. It also meant frog-stitching the back waist seam, but since I hadn't serged that seam, it was fairly painless.Finally, since I have to carry a key card at work and without pockets I have nowhere to hang it, I added a loop at the front right waist seam for clipping the card onto it. I have to say that I LOVE this feature. Dorky, but so useful!All of the mirror pics show how I wore this dress to work today, including my key card. It's the end of the day so I'm a little wilted but life is life. I'm never going to win for most beautiful blog pics. Hah. And one more just because. The bottom \"hem\" isn't really. I just left the cut edge raw. After wearing all day, I think it probably grew a little too long and I may go ahead and hem it at some point when I want to veg with Netflix and pin a million pins on a very wide skirt hem. In other words, don't anyone hold their breath on that one. :-)Final verdict: I love the dress! It fits nicely, thanks to the Concord bodice (by the way, if you're busty/curvy, go get this tee now! I am not affiliated, yada yada ... just really happy with the pattern). The dress skims lumps and bumps,and the twirl/swish factor is awesome. I even like the print mix again. It feels summery and fun. I'll definitely be visiting this pattern morph again, just in a more subdued way. I think I'd like it as a skirt too.Parting shot: My Mother's Day gift from Alex ...

Hmmm. :-)It's not the pattern that's the problem here. The Cashmerette Concord pattern is really great. I just started to dislike the fabric and had to force myself to keep at it. Now that it's done, I like it again. I just hated sewing with it. It's a thin rayon/lycra knit and it wanted to wiggle all over the place. At some point early on, once I declared this a \"wearable muslin,\" I pretty much just gave up on stripe matching. If it happened, yay. If not, I wasn't going to care. I see a few spots in the pics that could be better but I still just don't care. This is a casual tee. No one in real life will even notice. It's fine. I just point out these things for other sewists, to keep it real. In actual life, nope. So, as you can see, I used 3 different fabrics for the tee. Had I known how much I hated sewing with this fabric, it would be a b/w-only striped tee. :-) But I soldiered on, and here's a crappy cellphone-pointed-at-the-mirror pic.And another cell pic from during the process when I was gauging the neckline width. (Did you notice the cool-geeky dinosaur necklace?) If you remember, I had some concerns last post about the open-ness of the neckline since I'm a bit narrow-shouldered. To compensate, I cut a 14 for the neck/shoulders. This is 2 sizes smaller than my size per the instructions (using my full bust measurement). It worked well. In the photo below, the neckband isn't attached and my bra straps are only just visible. Meaning, with the neckband, I'd have full coverage. Jenny (from Cashmerette) confirmed the neckline is \"pretty open.\" My conclusion, it's a nice width but definitely go narrower if you have narrow shoulders. Or, cut a wider neckband. :-)Close-up of neckband, sewn on with the sewing machine, and then coverstitched. I used the pattern piece for the neckband and I was a little concerned that it was going to take a ton of stretching to get it to fit the neck opening. It did but it also worked absolutely fine for this fabric. Still, I think I'm going to add a wee bit of length for poly knits such as ITYs. I have a really good feel for neckbands at this point in my sewing so it's one of those \"I'll know it when I see feel it\" kind of things. :-)I also added the contrast band to the sleeve hems. (I like things in odd numbers, especially threes.) Although I cut the shortest sleeves in the pattern with a hem allowance (I didn't know I was going to use bands), I trimmed it off before attaching the bands. I like the finished length of the sleeves. The width is also good for me. I don't have skinny biceps but they aren't particularly meaty in proportion to the rest of me.I color blocked the back as well as the front. I whacked at the pattern visually (meaning without measurements) so the back yoke length has no relation to the front. I was more interested in pleasing proportions viewing head on vs. how the two met around my armpit. The back yoke joining seam is one of those places where things could be more even. But it's my back. I just don't care.I started with the shortest length and then proceeded to add 2 inches to it. And, yes, you guessed it …it's about 2 inches too long. I know it technically looks OK but 2 inches up is better on me. Since this is rayon, I'm going to see if a trip or two through the laundry takes care of things. This thin rayon does tend to like to keep shrinking a bit.So, what I haven't specifically mentioned yet but I think is obvious from the photos is how well this tee fits me and the girls. The pattern is divided into C/D, E/F, and G/H cup sizes. I used the E/F as instructed because it was closer to my waist measurement. Yes, I said waist. It's an hourglass v. apple kind of thing, I'm guessing. I think the neckline options are nice. My only criticism on the necklines is the finish for the vee. It's more of a \"scrubs\" neckband, which I think is eh. I'm sure it's aimed at beginners, but I don't necessarily agree with \"dumbing down\" a tee pattern. But if I had been an actual tester as I initially agreed, maybe I could've changed some minds. We'll never know. :-) As for differing sleeve and hem lengths, these aren't really aimed at me since I can easily make those adjustments. For those who like to have it all in the package, it's good to have so no complaint there.You may be thinking it's difficult to get excited about a tee pattern which costs $14/$18, but if you're a curvy lady who hasn't found tee nirvana in any other pattern, I say go for it. It will pay off in the long run. If you've been reading my blog for a while, you know that I love my Ottobre TNT. Well, that Ottobre magazine was probably in the $12-$15 range and I've made SO MANY variations on that tee that the cost of the magazine isn't even a factor anymore. (Yes, I know there are multiple patterns in the magazine but I didn't sew them.)Don't tell my Ottobre bestie, but I think this Concord even fits me a little better. I like it enough that I'm subbing it into the bodice for the Kwik Sew dress pattern I showed last post."},
{"title": "In the works and on deck", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2016", "text": "(Can you believe it? TWO posts from me in the same week!)So it's Spring here in Tampa. For about another minute until it's All Summer-All Humid-All The Time … for months. And I'm ready for some new clothes.First up, is the new Cashmerette Concord tee. This should have been a very quick sew over this past weekend. To be fair, it IS a quick sew. It just wasn't a quick decision on sizing so actually starting took some time. And let's not mention Netflix sucking me in.In-Progress ConcordI was originally to be a tester but my sewing is so scarce and scattered these days that I pretty much just wussed out. Jenny very kindly sent me a paper pattern anyway. I'm a bad tester. But I am an honest reviewer, so maybe it will all work out?Concord back pattern with curves!With the paper pattern in hand, it meant I had to trace. It also meant I had to \"sacrifice\" some old never-used costume pattern so I had tracing paper to use, or something resembling it. (I know I have actual pattern tracing paper but I have no idea where it ended up after the move last July.) Tracing isn't a big deal. I have to be honest, though, and say I actually prefer PDFs just because I don't have to trace and I can just print another if I mess up.So back to the sizing conundrum. I tend to run a little bit narrow in the shoulders and from the Concords I'd been seeing on blogs and Instagram, it looked to me like the neckline runs wide. After cutting and partially sewing, I agree with myself that it does have a wide-set neck opening. In the pic above, the neckband isn't yet sewn on (and in real life it's not even cut out), so the neck opening looks even wider than it will when finished.Although my B-W-H measurements would put me in the 18-20 range, I started with the E/F cup and traced at 14 for the neckline and shoulders, gradually increasing to 16 at underarm/bust level, and then out to 20+ for hips/bum.So far, everything is going great. Except my fiddly fabric. I thought I would do some colorblocking, and as you can see, I did. But I'm probably going to be sorry. This rayon knit is very flimsy and there is definite rippling where the two colors come together. I'm pretty sure that the neckband stitching will be meh too. So, I'm dubbing this a wearable muslin and we'll see how it goes.The pattern itself is very nice. It's nothing earth-shattering for me because I now have years of fitting/altering experience (and a few TNT tees), but I can see that it's going to be a good fit (pun intended) for busty/curvy ladies who don't want to roll their own (paying homage to 4/20 today hahaha!). It should be very easy to get a great tee with a more modern fit than most other commercial tee patterns right out of the envelope. Just heed the possibility of a wide neckline. Oh, and maybe slim sleeves. They looked on the smaller side to me as I was tracing/cutting but I'm withholding final judgment since I haven't actually sewed up the sideseams/sleeves and tried it on yet.The instructions look comprehensive and I love the 3/8\" seam allowances. At the larger end of the plus pattern spectrum, that 3/8\" seam allowance can make a real difference in pattern layout on fabric. Plus, it's just so much easier to sew and serge with a 3/8\" SA. Jenny also says that there's a slight forward shoulder adjustment built-in. (This doesn't help me, of the erect posture brigade, but it might be of interest to you?)I'm hoping to finish this up tonight and tomorrow night after work so I can then start on …… Kwik Sew 3873. And yes, they still don't have the best illustrations/photos. But at least you can see the seamlines and I think it's going to be a fun summer dress with mix/match prints.The sleeves definitely need some de-frumping and KS has always run big in the armhole for me. If the Concord trial above is a win, I may just morph the two together (or if not, use my TNT).Stay tuned. I promise I'll be back soon with an update on both."},
{"title": "Maria Denmark Kirsten Kimono Tee", "date": "Tuesday, April 12, 2016", "text": "A couple of weeks ago, Gillian of Crafting a Rainbow went on a tee bender, cutting and sewing four (4!!!) tees in less than a weekend. Me, I can barely sew four seams in a row lately. Anyway, Gillian's post inspired me to download and try the free Kirsten Kimono tee from Maria Denmark. It's only two pattern pieces (plus a neckband) and I would've had it finished last weekend had I not made a really boneheaded mistake at the finish line. More on that later. Anyway, here's the finished tee. I added an interfaced self-fabric sash to add some waist definition (and give me a place to hang my pass card at work).I don't remember the exact sheet count for the PDF and the file isn't on this computer for me to check but it wasn't too many, and it went together quickly and with no alignment issues. (Edited to add: I've checked the pattern and it's 20 pages, 8 of which are instructions. So, only 12 pages to put together.) Seam allowances are not included but it was easy enough to add them with my rotary blade attachment as I cut out the pattern. I went back and forth over sizing and in the end picked too big for the neck/shoulders. I ended up adding two pleats to the center front to take up the excess. No big deal on the finished top, as they look intentional. However, the pic below is NOT the finished top. I thought it was nearly done last weekend, until I realized that I had mixed up the back and front and those pleats below are really the back. (See the shoulder seams riding \"forward\"?) Of course, I didn't realize my mistake until after I had attached and coverstitched the neckband. I ripped it all out and was able to finally finish it this past weekend. It wasn't too traumatic, just frustrating to have to put off finishing for another week.As I mentioned, the tee is only two pieces - a front and a back so not too complicated. But one part that was a nice surprise was how well the underarm hem turned under. Often on dolman/kimono sleeves, the underarm hem has to be fudged when it doesn't turn under evenly. Not so here. (The coverstitching looks a little messy because you're seeing my ending threads run under the loops.)The finished tee, this time with the pleats in front. The next time I make this, I'll narrow the upper width so I can eliminate the pleats, although I do like them on this top for little interest. All in all, a great fast project and pattern, or it would've been if I didn't mix up front and back the first go-round. And, hey, FREE!And for a parting shot, if you follow me on Instagram (link upper left), you'll have already seen this photo of the grasshoppers that have invaded my neighbor's yard. They're cool and ewww at the same time."},
{"title": "This and That", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2016", "text": "Yeah, it's been a minute since my last post. Er, no excuse. Just no blogging mojo. Right up there with the mostly missing sewjo. But there has a been a little teeny tiny bit of sewing so I'll document it for posterity. Nothing exciting, but at least I've finished some things. Which lately is a major accomplishment. :-)First up, but the last things made, are a Hot Patterns Sunshine Top (the original) and a circle-ish Simplicity skirt. I haven't worn the two together yet, but I have worn the top. It's so nice to have a new Sunshine in my wardrobe. For this one, I went down to the size 14 for the neckband and shoulders, which is perfect. I had sewn it before with a 16 neck/shoulders and it fit, but flashing a bra strap was likely without deploying some strategically placed Hollywood tape. Now, no more worries for that. I think this top took me 5 weeks to sew. Not literally all sewing time, but for some reason I just couldn't force myself to sew even though I knew I wanted this top DONE and it took about that long in 10-minute spurts. Ahhh. That sewjo is a mysterious beast, no? I'm hoping it returns with a vengeance soon because there are things I want NEED in my wardrobe.Stripe matching like a boss at the sideseams. Just don't look at my completely mismatched sleeves. I totally spaced on those and then was too lazy to fix it. It's really not a problem, so while I'm pointing it out here, I've already forgotten about it in real life.Here's the famous and flattering neckline. And finally a clear photo. I have no idea why my camera didn't like the full-length shots but if I had to re-do them again, this blog post was never going to happen.Here's a crappy (sense a theme?) mirror shot of the finished SBCC Mimosa top, which is what I was sewing last time I blogged. I did actually finish it fairly soon after and I've worn it a TON. I really, really needed a white blouse for work. It's a great layering piece and the front tie makes it a little less boring white shell and more pretty white blouse.Less blown-out photo, easier to see details. One of these days I'm going to remember to cut the ties different lengths so they finish at the same length when tied.I also got a wild hair and sewed two doggie hoodies. It's a Kwik Sew something ... too lazy to go look.Now Alex and Charlie semi-match. Actually, the wild hair was Alex egging me on to do it. Dani didn't get one. She doesn't get cold easily and would probably freak out if we tried to put her legs through the sleeves. She's got quirks. Alex putting the final touches on his investment house. It rented in a week and the tenants have been in it for almost a month now. Go Alex!And lastly, for no good reason, here's a pic of one of the two new palm trees in my yard. Summer is coming.Hopefully, I'll be back here soon. I've got a new project on the cutting table."},
{"title": "Did I Say Simple Plans? Hah", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016", "text": "So those simple plans I mentioned last post? Yeah. Well. I sewed about 2 seams.Life happened. Namely, the time I volunteered to help Alex work on his investment house this past weekend multiplied and wore me out.Alex was out of town this past weekend visiting his brother and nephew and I was to supervise the installation of new carpet on Saturday morning while also installing tile around the new bathroom vanity. One thing led to another ... namely, the carpet installation was pushed back a few hours, the tile saw I needed to rent from Home Depot hadn't been returned by the previous renters, etc., etc. So, I ended up just standing around the house a lot either waiting for or watching/talking with the carpet installer. Time not exactly wasted but not very productive either. And standing around on tile floors all day is tiring even if you do nothing.Sunday was supposed to be miserable weather-wise (turned out the storm blew past quickly) so I planned to \"take off\" from Alex's house and hunker down in mine to work on the blouse. Before the weekend started I had really planned to spend both Sunday and Monday as sewing days but since Saturday was a bust, I had to regroup. I did get the Mimosa top cut out and interfaced but not much further. The ties are sewn (but not turned and/or pressed) if that counts. Baby steps. And it's also football playoffs time and some really good games further distracted me. Ah well.So, while I have no sewing photos to share, I do have some from Alex's house.First, the new carpet. Only the two bedrooms have carpeting and they are small, but it still took 3+ hours for installation. The bathroom, after we tore out the yucky old vanity (a few weeks ago).Alex working on the new vanity, cutting holes in the back to fit around the existing plumbing. This is in the living room — isn't that a cute little built-in in the wall? The house was built in 1952.Finally, what I did Monday. I still need to go back and grout. The optical illusions from the missing grout make things looks a little crooked and unfinished — but it's all pretty straight IRL. The tiles go around the whole sink area and onto the little side wall to the left of the sink. The big splooosh above the tile will be covered when we do the final paint. There was a very ugly and very 1980s oak towel ring there previously.I plan to grout the tile Friday after work so I can get back to sewing the rest of the weekend. But we've seen how my plans have been going so I'm not holding my breath."},
{"title": "Simple Plans", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2016", "text": "I need a plain white blouse. It's something I often wish was in my closet when getting dressed for work, but finding fabric was more difficult than I imagined, mostly because what's available online seems to be too sheer or too fancy and what's available locally ... er ... isn't available. At least until a couple of weeks ago when I was in Hancock Fabrics to stock up on some thread. And, um, yeah, I also bought a couple more fabrics.I didn't want high-end fabric because I want the blouse/top to be a workhorse, which means the ability to throw it in the laundry every week and to take it from the dryer back to the closet without a stop at the ironing board. In other words, polyester. But nothing that felt too icky.I think I found a winner in this textured white woven poly. The photo below shows the texture (crinkling) a little closer up. (I may have also bought the same fabric in black. And 1 yard of the stretch woven destined to become a Magic Pencil may have flown into my shopping cart too.)So I think the white fabric will become a SBCC Mimosa top (above) this weekend. I've already promised Saturday to Alex for tiling in his investment house, but that still leaves me Sunday and  Monday, since Monday is a holiday. Yay long weekends!In the meantime, here are some gratuitous family pics ... my (step)grandson turns 1 today. He's the most chill baby/lil' dude I've ever met.Happy Birthday Dean!And my other \"babies\" on duty. Not a pedestrian or mailman goes by without their permission. Or so they think.P.S. Thank you for all the super nice comments about my dotty Appleton dress. I still haven't fixed the tie ride-up issue so it's still just decorating Zillie and it's been rather cold here (for here) anyway so I haven't been extra motivated, but I'm hoping to fix it this weekend too."},
{"title": "Cashmerette Appleton Dress in Review", "date": "Friday, January 1, 2016", "text": "Although technically I started this dress in December, I'm calling this my first make of 2016 since I finished, photographed, and blogged it today.Overall, I like my finished dress and it's a great pattern. But ... there are a couple of things I changed during construction and a couple more I hope to change for a next version. The main thing is I'm not sure how I feel about the boobaliciousness on display with the ties riding up right under my bra. The ties are just sitting too high for my preference. I'm pointing the finger at me on this one, though. Meaning, it's due to my belly growing over the last couple of years from indulging in too many goodies and not enough sit-ups coupled with the body changes that creep up with age and so the ties just ride up even though they actually start in the right place to hit my true waist. I'm thinking maybe I'll add some belt holders but until then, I will likely wear this dress with a light gray cardi to camouflage the belly in profile view, at least until I get on with those sit-ups (don't hold your breath on that one). From the front, which is how you're seeing me in these pics, it looks fine. Great, even. :-) As a comparison to the Muse Gillian wrap dress, I prefer the Gillian's sewn in waistband for keeping both the ties and my waist in check. I do L.O.V.E. the color and the dots, and the fabric is a nice ITY that drapes and swishes just right. I can't remember if it came from Fabric.com or Fabricmart but it was last year (I mean more than just yesterday), so I'm sure it's gone from wherever. It was a good match for this pattern.So, onto the changes I made and what I'll do next time ...First, simple, but I fused the opening ... er ... open with Steam-a-Seam. The fabric is slippery and I knew the \"flaps\" would probably work their way through the hole and look weird. Next, I interfaced the ties. Not any of the neckline pieces, just the ties. You can see how they are attached separately onto the neckline pieces below. I prefer my waist ties to have some body so they don't collapse into themselves and get lost in the fluff that is my waist. If I had actually tested this pattern, I would've suggested adding the interfacing at least as an option. Something I will change for next time is to move the shoulder seam backward. I do not have forward shoulders at all, just the opposite in fact, so the shoulder seams are riding a bit forward on me. (I don't know if this pattern is drafted for a more forward shoulder. Jenny?) This will be a fiddly pattern alteration, though, because there are a lot of pieces coming together here and the nice no-gape neckline is achieved by having these pieces fit together in a certain way. Alternatively, I may just make an erect back alteration to the back piece, which would be easier. I'm still evaluating the finished dress in my mirror. The other thing I'll change for next time is to lengthen the ties about 12 inches. I want to be able to tie a bow and have the tie ends hang lower than they do at this length. Plus, I would make them different lengths so they are the same finished length when tied. Below, I've made a loop with just the longer side. There's not enough tie to make an adult bow vs. a little girl bow on the hip. This is an easy enough change once I do the math to figure out which tie needs to be longer than the other. Here you can see the \"structure\" adding the interfacing gives the ties when going around the back. And you can see the deep hem. I thought the pattern wasn't going to be long enough and added a total of about 4 inches by spreading 1 inch in the middle and adding the rest at the hem edge. Yeah, that was overkill. I ended up making a 1.5 inch double-fold hem. But I do like the added weight of this hem so I'd probably do it again. As for the pattern itself, I was using the paper version provided to me for free by Jenny (with no strings attached and if you know my blog, you know I tell it like it is). It's nicely drafted and comes with a lovely and comprehensive instruction book. From the instructions, I found it to be very straightforward figuring out what size vs. bust cup to choose. For the record, I used the E/F cup piece and cut a 20 at neckline/shoulders/waist and then morphed out to 24 for the hips (tummy in my case) on the front piece only. The fit is good through the shoulders, but I think the 18 up top might be even better. I went big due to the abundant negative ease in the bust as a \"just in case.\" But in any case, no linebacker shoulders drafted here.It's more than roomy enough around the hips/butt/belly and since the fronts wrap almost to the sideseam at each side, I don't have any fear of the wrap flying open and exposing anything better left covered. Beginners may find assembling the neckline pieces a bit tricky, but soldier on ... it works.I can see why this pattern has been popular from its release. It's a pretty dress, flattering to and designed for curves. So nice to pretty much just cut, sew, wear.A couple more gratuitous shots ..."},
{"title": "2015 in Review", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2015", "text": "Warning: VERY photo-intensive post. I'm doing a huge photo dump here of my last year since my blogging pretty much went south and unless you follow me on Instagram, this will all be new to you. I understand that not everyone is going to be interested in my mundane, boring year but I'm documenting it as much for my own recollection as to catch you up. Feel free to scroll down and move on. I won't be insulted :-)All in all 2015 wasn't terrible and overall better than 2014. But it started out crappy because the house in the city I started renting in April 2014 turned out to have a major slumlord as an owner and I hated everything about it. I've never lived in such a horrible place and it really took a toll on me. (First world problems, I know.) But once I found a new place, moved, and (mostly) settled in, my mental state did a 180 and things have been rolling along ever since. (I'm still in the city, with a 7-minute morning commute. It's awesome!) Even the sewjo has returned and now that the holidays and my related travels are pretty much in the rear view, I expect some serious output to start happening. If for no other reason than I NEED NEW CLOTHES. So here's some \"highlights\" of my last year, sewing- and family-wise, at least those moments documented via cell pics.I think this is the first thing I started and finished in 2015. I still wear it (which you'll see below in the December pics).My \"baby\" Alex turning into a man.A visit to The Tattooed Moose and the Marine in Charleston, SC.At the bar at Parris Island. Quite a different experience from boot camp there.And then I wrecked my car on the drive back to Florida. No injuries and the car is now good as new. The damage was mostly plastic and the radiator and looks worse here than the bill reflected. Thank heaven.Seeing the Blue Angels practice over Beaufort, SC on my trip back to pick up my fixed car.Another sewing project. I wear the HECK out of this. It's comfortable, flattering, and professional looking. It's the Muse Jenna cardi over a Simplicity pull-on tank dress with an elasticated waist. I'm too lazy to look up the pattern number.A work bathroom selfie and another Simplicity dress and I'm still too lazy to look it up. It's the faux wrap that was popular a few years ago, which took me a while to get around to.One of the MANY reasons I moved house. Yeah, it's what you think it is. OMG.A long weekend get-away to the beach with Alex, his then-gf, and the pups. Much needed.Just sitting and chillin' at our fun little rental cottage.Isn't it cute? We could walk everywhere, and did.A quick maxi tank dress I made for the beach trip and which subsequently got a lot of wear over the summer. I think this is the last of the cheap rayon knit from Fabric.com.A rare (for me) blogger meet-up. Mr. Celie's Pants was there too but he was holding the camera. This was so much fun and I'm glad Renee and Jordan have an excuse (her dad) to return sometime. I want a repeat. They are SO nice!Still enjoying my job and still very thankful to have it. We \"found\" pup #3, Charlie, in July, the week before we moved. He's a Chi-Weenie and is adorable. I still can't believe I have 3 dogs again. Alex is a mean negotiator and it's all his fault. And they all love him more than me.WTFThe herd.The new place, as of July. It's a lot smaller than my previous houses and I've had to get rid of a LOT of stuff, but I'm of that \"downsize\" age anyway and it's nice to not be tied to housework and ... stuff. Plus, it's so bright and pretty inside and I'm happy. The new small sewing room. It's mostly unpacked now but it's very small and my cutting table lives in another room and my pattern cabinet and much of my fabric live in the garage. I'm slowly moving some of the best stash inside and will eventually get rid of the unloved remainder but for now, it's working.New kitchen before we hung shelves.The Great Tampa Flood. That's my street. We spent a lot of time (and cash) at Ikea those first couple of months after moving in. That's Alex pushing the cart in the warehouse.I bought Alex a new BBQ/smoker he had been eyeing and he's been perfecting his wings and ribs since. We've had delicious food pretty much every weekend since football season started. Momma knew what she was doing buying that BBQ.  ;-)In November, we saw America at the 2015 Ribfest in St. Pete. A bunch of \"old\" people my age (hahaha) enjoying them and the Doobie Bros and Santana tribute bands. It was a great day with great music, but Alex makes much better ribs. A treat for myself (and Alex) from Black Friday and the proceeds from selling so much of my crap that didn't fit in the new house. (Have you noticed how bright every pic of my new house is? Sigh.)The Cook men, minus Alex who stayed home with the pups, from when I went to see Tyler's performance 2 weeks ago in a church Christmas production in SC. This was the first time seeing my ex in 4 years. It was ... interesting. We all just ignored him and had a good time. I'm not kidding. Hahaha. Tyler at church practice the night before the Big Performance.And the church band performing \"Carol of the Bells,\" which you'll recognize as a Trans Siberian Orchestra tune. They rocked it, and the rest of their performance!The infinity scarf I made (on request) for my soon-to-be stepdaughter-in-law. While in SC two weeks ago, my stepson Michael asked for this and also for my help in picking out an engagement ring!!! for his gf (and the mother of his son, which makes me a step-grammie OMG). Here's me with the \"boys\" on Christmas Eve in St. Augustine ... it was about 400 degrees that night, so we felt as blurry as we look here ... and ... ... Michael proposed to Hannah (see her scarf heehee!) ...... and Tyler filmed it all (bad language warning if you watch it).Michael and Hannah's son, Dean, who will be 1 in January.And, finally, the sewing project (Cashmerette Appleton) I started at the beginning of the month and which I WILL finish this weekend.Happy New Year!!"},

I didn't think I'd be neglecting my blog for so long but I'm finally sewing again and so I should be more regular here now. I feel like I have lots to catch you up on and I will over the next few posts or so. But for now, I'm just going to talk about the first finished sewing project to come off my machines in close to (if not over) a year. Although time has flown, I still can't believe it's been that long. And boy do I NEED clothes.Here's McCall's 7254, one of the newer releases. Although I've been off-blog, I've still been buying patterns. :-) I cut out and started sewing it this past Saturday and finished on Sunday. It's a very quick sew and I can see adding at least one more to my wardrobe soon. I sewed a blend between the L and XL (the only two sizes in this envelope) and made no other alterations, and the only thing I'd change for a next time is to narrow the shoulders a bit. So nice to have a Win after such a long absence.I sewed View C, which is the view on the left in the second row below. The instructions call for interfacing one layer of the all-in-one collar/front panel/peplum. I didn't for two reasons. First, LAZY. And second, it's a casual, unstructured knit jacket and I thought interfacing only one side of the panel would do weird things to the hand/drape of the knit. This was confirmed when I read some reviews, so I'm glad I left it off. My finished jacket hangs nicely and I'm not missing the interfacing at all.Here's a shot of the inside. Seeing this, I'm thinking that with the right combo of two-sided fabrics, it could easily be reversible. My fabric came from Fabric Mart last year-ish and is not reversible. It's a textured knit which I think is part cotton, part synthetic. I had a near-disaster with the iron but luckily it was on the inside of the two-sided facing and doesn't show. Whew! And the back. I edgestitched the entire collar/facing/peplum piece and also the princess seams to hold the two-sided panel together better and to set off the seams (which shows more in real life than here in pics). The instructions don't mention either of these steps, but I would recommend at least edgestitching the collar/facing piece so it doesn't roll outward.Here's a quick nighttime shot of where my machines are set up. Lots of windows in here but not enough room for a cutting table or fabric and pattern stash so I've had to spread out into other rooms and my pattern cabinet and most of my fabric currently live in the garage. It's still a work in progress but I'm slowly getting there. I'm hoping to get a good portion of my fabric into the house but I need to do some rearranging of armoires/shelving first. Up next is the new Cashmerette Appleton dress. I was supposed to test this before its release but my lifestuff interfered. Jenny was very nice to send me a pattern (and fabric kit) anyway. I finished cutting it out tonight and hope to start sewing it tomorrow night. Stay tuned for a review on it soon.After the dress, I'm wanting to make a long-ish black skirt. Once that's done, I'll pair it with the jacket and take some photos of me in everything. Thanks to those who sent notes of concern and search parties. I'm doing great and happy to know you're still out there. I'll see you again here very soon!"},

While this little video was all over the internet recently, the actual costume was balled up in my sewing \"nook\" (not quite a room yet) needing an armpit and shoulder re-sewn. It seems those little T-Rex arms truly are not meant for Ninja-ing. But they're good for at least one more stint now.For long-time readers, the human behind the T-Rex Ninja is the same young man (Tyler's friend Reko) for whom I made the Renaissance Faire costume a few years ago. If you watch American Ninja Warrior, he's also the fire-breathing, mohawked, caped Ninja seen here:In quasi-sewing news, I'm nearing the end of the moving-in/unpacking phase (OMG finally!) and this is now on its way to me. Sewing will commence soon-ish. And regular blogging at some point after that. I'm really Jonesin' and I really, REALLY need new clothes!!I'm loving my new place, and the pain and sheer crappiness of yet another move this past July is finally starting to fade in the rear view. But it was totally worth it. The new house is so bright and cheerful and my whole mood has been brighter and more cheerful to match. I totally get how a doomy/gloomy environment can wreak havoc with one's mental health. Anyway, I just wanted to stop and say hey. Hey!"},

And now my sewing machines, fabric, and entire sewing room are boxed up because I'm moving house next Saturday. I wish I didn't have to move but my current house is disgusting and my landlord is a pig. And that's being generous. Being in such a depressing environment has definitely zapped the sewjo. But the home situation will soon be looking up. I've spent a lot of time searching for a nicer place in the same general area close to downtown Tampa and I finally found one a few weeks ago. It's a lot smaller and I won't have a dedicated sewing room right away but until Alex moves out on his own, I'll take over one of the formal rooms and we'll make it work. (It's not like we're hosting formal dinners these days.)I'm also looking forward to lower rent for a nicer place and a cute back yard for the pups. By now I'm used to walking them at 6 am before work but it will be nice not to have to on rainy mornings. The rest of my life is good. The job is still going well. I really enjoy my workgroup. My best friend moved back to the area a few months ago and I love having her nearby again. I can't wait to have her over to my new place. And I can't wait to be sewing again because you know just as soon as you pack up the stash, the urge to serge (hah!) comes roaring back.

I think I've fixed everything but if you find a missing image, link, whatever, please do let me know so I can fix it.I really haven't been sewing much. OK, at all. Although I did start a project this past Sunday. We'll see how that goes. I also may have signed up for Netflix and binge-watched Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards. I'm hoping now that the seasons have changed my sewjo will come back around.In the meantime, the biggest “news” is that while on my way back from my visit to see the Marine in SC two weekends ago, I hit a really big something on the Interstate (I'm thinking piece of semi truck tire but it was dark and rainy so who really knows) and wrecked my car. The wreck wasn't too bad, as far as direct front-end collisions go. No one was hurt at all, and I was still close enough to Tyler that I got two more days' visit out of it while my car made its way to the body shop and adjuster. But it had to stay in SC for repairs and I had to get back to Florida to work.My car is fixed (yay! I miss it very much and while it's good I have a rental, said rental is craptastic) so I'm heading back to SC after work tomorrow for a post-midnight arrival. Tyler and I will meet up again for a Thursday-Friday visit and then I'll head home sometime Friday afternoon. I kind of want to drive back in daylight this time, just in case. There's a Blue Angels airshow at his base this weekend, which would be fun to see, but it means there are no hotel rooms to be had so staying through the weekend isn't an option. Plus, we may be kind of sick of each other by this point. Hahaha. Just kidding. I love you Tyler.Up until the wreck, the visit to SC was fun. We went to Charleston, stayed in a fancy hotel, ate lots, drank more, and shopped a little. I did my first Uber trips around Charleston.We visited boot camp at Parris Island which is just 10 minutes away from Tyler's base. That was fun for both of us. If you're a long-time reader, you may remember that I was sick as a dog when Tyler graduated boot camp 4+ years ago so my memory of that first visit was very fuzzy. And now that he's a sergeant, most of the Drill Instructors don't even outrank him so he strutted around this time like ... well.  a sergeant. Hah. Perspective is everything.We even got to see the Marine Corps Band and Silent Drill Platoon back in Beaufort (Tyler's base). We still don't know why they were there, but they were and we had seats.

Well, not anything worthy of keeping or blogging about. I've had a slew of wadders and the sewjo took a hike.  I've also been doing some social things with friends the last few weekends, which also cuts into the sewing time. Good for me. Bad for the blog.And, finally, I've been working on restoring the missing photos around the blog. I've still got a long way to go, but the Coverstitch Stuff is back. The Fly Zipper tute is next also done. I've decided NOT to keep up a separate website/domain and to put everything on the blog so it doesn't take a hike again. It's very slow going but eventually it will all be here. The hardest part was rounding up all the photos from my prior computer and getting them onto a thumb drive to grab from the laptop. That part has been done. Gah ... I really miss my old computer. It still runs Win2K hahahaha! So that's about it.In the meantime, I have a new phone finally (LOVING it!) and I'm on Instagram.

{"title": "Kwik Sew 3764 Done", "date": "Sunday, January 25, 2015", "text": "It's done. I really hope whatever my next project is turns out to be something I like better than the last few. I don't dislike this jacket but the fabric is not going to hold up or be washable and it's actually pretty darn warm, which means it won't get worn a whole lot here in Florida. Plus, the zipper isn't really correct (it's a 2-say separating zip) and it gets caught every time I zip it. There's really no taming the chenille next to the zipper teeth. When I first made/hacked this pattern, I added a back yoke and CB seam. I decided to keep these when I was retracing smaller.Yeah, you can't see them at all and what you can see looks all off-grain. It's not, though, which you'll see below in the inside shots.I had thoughts to line this and even cut a lining. But I decided I didn't want to fight with the chenille anymore and besides being a warm layer already, the black inside looks and feels OK without a lining. I serged most seams with black thread but left the CB seam flat and just serged the raw edges of the seam allowances separately. I also stitched down the back facing. All stitching just sinks right into the chenille so you can't see from the right side that the facing is sewn down.Here's a closer shot of the back side of the fabric. It's just strange stuff but it definitely feels nice and snuggly. I skipped the zippered welt pockets. I was already fighting with the main zipper and the chenille and I didn't want to make pockets I'd be fighting with. Instead I added simple patch pockets, which you have to squint very hard to even see in the photo below. I like that they're mostly invisible but still there to hold key cards or my phone.A wearable muslin, for sure, and at least know I know the new size and minor adjustments fit. I think I'll make this again soon with stretch denim. I really do like the pattern and I do need things for weekends and casual Fridays. A leather version of this or the Style Arc Ziggy or the new Islander moto jacket are still on the must-make list but further down the road. I think I need to hit a thrift store for some leather something to practice with."},
{"title": "What's on Zillie?", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2015", "text": "Zillie (my dressform) holds my in-progress, or in this case, stalled projects. I liked this fabric because it's all of my colors and a little sparkly too. But it's been in the stash for YEARS and so I'm not entirely sad to be tossing it. A little sad, yes, but onward and upward.This is the pattern. The problems are there in the photo, if only I had paid more attention. But I wanted to try a different silhouette than my usual. Yeah, no. There is just way too much fullness and fabric at belly and below. Camouflage is one thing. Ridiculous added volume is another. Plus the way the print \"landed\" is also unfortunate. From the side ... can you see how much width this thing adds? Would make an awesome maternity tent. ;-) Needless to say, I won't be finishing this one. And you won't be able to convince me otherwise.Next up is KS 3764.I'll be finishing this one, if only as a wearable muslin until the fabric disintegrates. Which, I'm guessing, won't be too long from now. This is also years-old stash, bought from a co-op. I think it's really cheap upholstery fabric. It's not a knit. Just a bunch of chenille on an open-weave kind of backing. Weird stuff. And I have purple too. But the last time I made this KS pattern, I hacked it to make a RTW knock-off and I was much bigger than I am now so I had to trace smaller and start somewhere. Cheap upholstery fabric is as good a place to start as any.It will be OK as a muslin. I really would like to make a leather moto jacket sometime soonish (like before 2016?), but I have no idea where to get good leather or how many hides I'd need, etc., etc. so that project will be a while before I even start. And then bright, shiny will likely distract me for a while along the way too. Maybe I can get Peter to shop leather for me?? I'm planning to finish the jacket this weekend and hopefully make something else that I actually like. The week whoooooshed by with the Monday holiday and I'm happy to be heading into another weekend. Maybe I'll even get through a few things on my list.Thanks for all the very nice comments on my last post about the sneaky way to fix a gaping neckline. I'm not brilliant, though  ... just doggedly determined not to surrender. Hah. A few personal notes ...The job is still going splendidly. I really like my workgroup and what we're doing. No, it's not a creative design job but the money is the same and it's 100% stress/drama-free. At this stage in my life, that's much more important. I can be creative on my own time, right?I've started looking for a new place for Alex and me to live. I love my city neighborhood and my 7-minute commute but this house and my landlord have major problems that can't be solved by me. I'm not in a hurry this time, so it may be months before anything actually happens on that front. But if you hear of any great Tampa rentals, let me know. Not sure I mentioned it earlier, but the Marine was promoted to Sergeant. He's doing well but looking forward to getting out in 3 years. He has other life plans and wants to get at them. At least he's now only 6 hours away so we'll see each other more often between now and then.I'm also now a quasi-grandma. My stepson and his girlfriend had a baby boy last week. Alex is beyond thrilled about being an uncle. I'm hoping to see them all soon. They live on the other side of Florida, about 3 hours away. I just need to figure out dog care. Alex's dad will be coming from VA to meet his grandson in a couple of weeks and Alex will drive over then to see them all.And that about rounds out what I've been up to. And, Susanna, I haven't forgot you. Just slow-going around here."},
{"title": "Fixing a gaping neck, after the fact", "date": "Saturday, January 17, 2015", "text": "So you've just sewn your knit neckline/neckband carefully and correctly and STILL end up with The Gapes, like this:And then you end up with a big case of The Mehs when you had such high hopes for a cute top/dress using that pretty fabric you just bought (or sacrificed from the stash).Well first, stop beating yourself up. It happens to all of us and doesn't make you a sewing failure. Sometimes bad things just happen to good fabric and/or techniques. Next, get yourself some elastic thread, like this:And a big-eyed, blunt-end needlepoint needle, like this (the blunt end is important so you don't snag the fabric and make a difficult task of threading the elastic through):Cut a LONG piece of the elastic thread, roughly 2-1/2 times the length of the neckline area you need to fix, stretch it a couple of times, and thread your needle with it. Then, push the needle under the stitching that's holding down the neckline/neckband, starting at one shoulder seam.Make sure you get the needle up into the space above the stitches, like threading elastic through a casing (which is pretty much exactly what this will end up as). Work the needle/elastic through the whole length of the gaping area and leave a long tail on the end you started from (this is why you need to use a long length of elastic).Push the needle out at the back of the other shoulder seam and into/through the serger stitches (or seam allowances if you haven't serged) of the shoulder seam, and ...... tie a knot. Make sure your knot is behind the shoulder seam, since you've pressed those to the back (right?) and want any elastic tension to pull toward the back.Next, go back to that long elastic tail you left at the beginning and pull the elastic taut enough to cause rippling but not enough to create actual gathers. The neckline isn't going to lay flat now, but that's OK because it *will* lay flat on you.And tie it off at the starting shoulder seam, again behind the actual seam. (If you leave your needle threaded while you do this, getting through the loops of the knot is easier.) Finally, unthread the needle and trim your thread tails. Now be happy again because your new top/dress with that fabric you can't believe you just \"wasted\" is now a keeper! Look Ma! No gapes and ...... no gathering. I won't tell anyone if you won't. ;-)This little fix works for front necklines/neckbands too. Just run your elastic through the front instead of the back and make your knots in front of the shoulder seams. If you need to fix back AND front, do it in two steps, using two lengths of elastic (or 3, if you have a vee or wrap neck) so you can keep the \"drawing up\" effect of the elastic separate, which will work better than one long piece of elastic thread doing all the work in different locations. You're welcome. :-)"},
{"title": "First Make of 2015 - Meh", "date": "Saturday, January 10, 2015", "text": "I sewed up this skirt and top 2-piece dress last weekend and while it's OK, it's not fabulous. Part of the \"meh\" is because the fabric is just not a nice ITY. I swear, Fabric.com labels everything ITY now and I'm starting to think they're on crack. It's an OK knit, but it's certainly not one of their better ones. It's a bit on the sueded/clingy side. Not *too* clingy, but more like collapsing on me, if you can understanding what I mean. Hard to explain. Still, it's better than the uber-clingy, pill-y, icky rayon crap I'm still trying to get out of the stash. ;-) I like the print, though, which is why I went ahead and used it, ignoring that little voice in my head.The other part of the \"meh\" is because apparently *I* was on crack when I was sewing up the Jalie top. A top, mind you, that I have made 6 squillion times. Let me tell you, it makes a HUGE difference if you sew RS together where the gathers flip over instead of WS together. Heh. It took me nearly a whole day to figure out why the flip-over wasn't working and where I had gone wrong. (Note: When all else fails, READ the feckin' instructions!) Once I got out the seam ripper and re-sewed correctly, things worked out fine. But what an idiot moment I had. Plus, the neckband, sewed on with my coverstitcher and a binder, isn't snug against my back neck, which never happens with my binders. Until now apparently. I'll fix that with some elastic thread threaded through the backside stitching, once I pick it up from Hancock's. I just covered it up with a cardi in the meantime. I won't tell if you won't.Love the skirt though. I used the Simplicity KA pattern above, which is a semi-circle skirt for wovens and calls for a zipper. I omitted the zipper because knit. And I also took off 2\" from each side seam of the smallest size in the envelope, 20 (for a total of 8\", if you're counting), because, again, knit. I didn't just do this willy-nilly ... I have a couple of semi-circle RTW knit skirts I was copying inspired by and so I could use them as eyeballing/measurement guides. I used the contoured waistband pattern pieces (also cut down 2\" per side seam to match the skirt waist) and sewed all the units together, leaving an opening in the facing for inserting elastic, and serged 1:1 onto the skirt waist. Once it was attached, I inserted the 1-1/4\" wide elastic, which was cut to about 4\" less than my actual waist measurement. The result is an elastic-waist pull-on skirt with a waistband that sits flat both on and off me. I didn't even stitch the opening closed on the inside because I had the seam allowances from the opening folded/flipped in such a way that the opening and elastic is invisible from the inside. I know that's hard to visualize from my words, so you'll just have to trust me on that. I know the skirt will get lots of wear since I love the shape and black/white is almost a neutral. I think I'll make it again in another knit too because it's fun to wear flippy, girly skirts. I also think I'll like the top better after a few small adjustments ... namely, the back neckband, and maybe shortening it another inch and also sewing the sideseams a little tighter. I've also sewed up a \"muslin\" of the Burda WOF casual pants I showed a couple of posts back, and am now trying to decide what fabric to get for a final pair, plus matching jacket. I thought a nice ponte would work, but now I'm second-guessing. My \"muslin\" was a NOT-nice ponte (also from crack-tastic Fabric.com in the same shipment) which was not supposed to be muslin fabric but it was way too polyestery/shiny to be taken seriously. I could have sent it back but I decided I did need to muslin since I haven't sewn pants in years (yikes) and it's probably a good thing I did because I do need to make a few adjustments. All of that was just a long-winded way to say that while the project is definitely still in the queue, it's stalled at the moment. I'll get into the sewing room this weekend around football playoffs, but I may encounter analysis paralysis since I have a lot of things I want to make and no idea where to start. Hopefully, I'll come out with something. I just don't know what that something is yet."},

(Click on that link to Gillian's blog to see the other bloggers participating and don't forget to include a link to yourself if you recapped. I noticed more than a few blog links missing.) It took me a LOT of time last year to pull everything together so I almost didn't want to do it again this year but I always enjoy everyone else's round-ups/reflections, so ....The good news is that compiling this 2014 recap was actually easier than I was anticipating. The bad news is that's because my sewing output for 2014 SUCKED. Hah. But I completely understand why and it's not really that big of a deal ... now.Before I get to the sewing, my biggest \"miss,\" as I'm sure you can all guess, was unexpectedly losing my job this past April and in the middle of a house move, and my biggest \"hit\" was finally becoming a permanent, salaried employee at my current job. This job and the last are, as they say, as different as night and day and it's so easy to see that everything happens for a reason, well, at least when you're viewing the reason from your rear-view mirror. :-) I like this job and my coworkers very much and the firm treats us all very well. Yay me for hanging in there through it all (and Yay! for your support), but I have to say that I HATE being poor (who doesn't?) and I'm so glad to be past that speed bump. I've learned that nothing is forever, and I really hope that I get to be the chooser of any job changes from now on. But since I have no crystal ball, I will be once again building up the savings account. Cuz you just never know.So onto the sewing stuff. I went through my 2015 blog posts and pulled photos in no real order of what I made during the year. It's funny how the \"misses\" coincide with job/situational unhappiness and once I was settled in here at the new job, I made more keepers.I still like this SBCC Mimosa top and hate to tag it as a \"miss,\" but the truth is it doesn't get worn very often anymore because it has to be ironed, and even then, it wrinkles so much during wear so it looks like it needs to be ironed before I've even finished wearing it for the day. I would like to replace it with a wrinkle-free poly version or another less iron-needy fabric.SBCC Mimosa - original blog post hereI hate this dress. But just THIS dress, not the pattern mix I did to come up with it. The fabric just isn't right. I've only kept it because I would like to try again with a better fabric. It also kind of reminds me of the Colette Dahlia, which is weird because I don't really like the Dahlia.Pattern Mix/Hack - original blog post hereI've never worn this one. The print just isn't right for the style and the neckline doesn't want to cooperate so I know I'd be fussing with it constantly. Need to donate it and just move on.McCall's 6752 - original blog post hereAnother fabric fail. First, the fabric is that horrible cheap rayon knit from Fabric.com that so many of us fell for. Second, I'm not liking the weird \"lines\" of the print. Worn once and now collecting dust. Another donation candidate.KS4026/Broke Woman's Myrtle - original blog post hereThe cardi ultimately is a fail, even though I love the color. I don't like the length/width combo and the sweaterknit fabric is not cooperative with the back neckband. I was inspired by the Muse Jenna cardi and am much, MUCH happier with the real pattern. The skirt was a test for a pattern which I've never seen released. Hmmm. I like the skirt but it's another item which needs serious ironing.Jalie cardi hack - original blog post hereFinally, some winners. Whew! I was getting worried there, and no wonder that on top of everything else in the beginning of the year, the sewjo took a hike.This dress I wear. All. The. Time. Since these pics were taken, I shortened it to hit at my knee instead of below it. It works for both summer and winter. I need 10 more.Think anyone will notice?Muse Gillian - original blog post hereAnother Muse. You will see there is a theme starting here. Kat, hurry up with the next one. :-) I'm so glad to have my beloved teal skirt back in rotation since making the Muse cardi and KS tank twinset. The weather has been warm/cold/warm/cold even moreso than usual lately but we're heading into very cold this week and this set will definitely see an outing.Muse Jenna #1 and KS 2759 - original blog post hereAnother Muse cardi which is another hit, and the Butterick skirt I dubbed my Carolyn Corporate Skirt, also a hit. I need more of both of this and the above skirts.Muse Jenna #2 and Carolyn Skirt (B4877) - original blog post hereMy HotPatterns Uptown/Downtown sweaterknit dress.This dress is so comfortable and I like how it pairs with nearly anything, especially the matching Muse cardi above.HP Uptown/Downtown - original blog post hereAnd the summer version here, which I also wore a LOT.Original blog post hereSpeaking of summer (and sunburns?), I also wore this dress often during the warmer months. It's funny how the interlock version was one of my biggest misses from 2013 yet a remake in other fabrics is a 2014 hit.Vogue 8805, original blog post hereThe skirt below is an unknown. I haven't worn it yet. Not because I don't like it but because I forgot about it. Hah. It inadvertently got buried in the sewing room. The mind is a terrible thing to  ... er ...what was that? ;-)Simplicy 1697 (skirt) - original blog post hereAnd last chronologically, but certainly not least ... my Muse Natalie dress. When I first saw the pattern lines I never would've guessed how much I would end up liking the dress. It gets worn at least every 10 days. I try NOT to wear the same dresses each week, but sometimes I sneak favorites in because I don't think anyone else is really keeping track.Muse Natalie - original blog post hereHere's to kicking 2014 in the ass to the curb and welcoming 2015 with open arms!

{"title": "About Me", "date": "Thursday, January 1, 2015", "text": "I'm Debbie Cook. Welcome to my blog. I live and work in Tampa, FL, and I'm Mom to 2 grown sons, one a U.S. Marine and one still living at home. I'm also adopted mom to 2 very cute and very spoiled pooches. I put up with the oppressive Florida humidity and ravenous mosquitos as a trade-off for sunshine and warmth nearly every day of the year. I love to sew, but I didn't know it until I was more than grown up. My mom and grandmothers sewed my whole life and while I never had real lessons from them, I found out later that I had actually learned a lot just by watching and helping. With these \"custom dressmakers\" available, I never felt the need to sew for myself or sit in front of my own machine unless I was mending, hemming or sewing on Boy Scout badges.Fast forward to my late-30s and the sewing bug finally bit and I haven't stopped since. I've sewn almost everything - home dec, quilting, gifts, lingerie & more, but sewing clothes for myself is what I really love and I sew most of my wardrobe because I have fun doing it and because it fits me better than anything I'd find in a store. I stash fabric and patterns a LOT, and I seem to be collecting vintage sewing machines too. I use everything though, so it's all good, right?I like to share what goes on in my sewing room and some of what goes on in my enjoyably-boring life. I've been blogging about it all for almost 10 years now.I try to answer questions and comments when I can, but honestly, I'm pretty bad about it. I'd rather spend my free time in the sewing room or trying new-to-me restaurants.

{"title": "Reappearing briefly ... and a Giveaway", "date": "Monday, December 22, 2014", "text": "First, before we get into this post click this link and enter the CSC giveaway running in connection with my review there of the Hot Patterns Uptown/Downtown Knit dress. It ends at midnight EST tonight. HURRY!Then, leave a comment on this post to double your chances because Trudy and Jeremy have also generously gifted a second copy of this great pattern for a giveaway here. I will do the drawing sometime this weekend. Probably Saturday, but with Christmas and all, I'm not promising. As long as the comments are still open on this post, the giveaway is still open.OK, back to this post.I am SO behind on everything. The Marine (Tyler) arrived last week, unexpectedly, and I kind of just threw my hands up and decided to have fun with him instead of honoring obligations. He changed bases and is now 8 hours closer for the next 3 years. Yay! He left Thursday but he'll be here again this Wednesday for the long Christmas weekend. Double yay! It had been 9 months since I had seen him and it was such a treat to have so many days with him. Plus, Alex was at his dad's in Virginia last weekend which gave Tyler and I some alone time. We did lots of stuff, none of which involved my sewing room. Hah.But I did reacquaint myself in there this weekend and with my old BWOFs, and traced a couple of patterns to make a \"track suit\" for weekend wear. I'm sorely lacking in casual clothes at the moment. Even before starting, I didn't forget what a Royal PITA it is to trace BWOFs, which made me procrastinate throughout the whole process, but both patterns are now traced. And that's all the \"sewing\" I've done lately. I would MUCH RATHER tape together a hundred PDFs. But, as I was looking through the magazine inserts, I saw so many patterns I want to make. Even TEN YEARS later, many of these BWOFs are fashionable and so much more interesting than most of what's out there in printed or PDF patterns. Sigh. No pain, no gain, right? Looks like I'll need to invest in some Swedish Tracing Paper.Here's what I'm making, hopefully. And proof that BWOF/BS loves to recycle ... does this one look familiar? Actually, I think this pattern is older and the one I did trace is the \"newer\" version. I may get some motivation to lay out my tracing over this pattern sheet and really compare. Now, go enter the giveaways! I'm hoping to be back here briefly before Christmas, but if not, Merry Merry to everyone!!"},
{"title": "Pattern Testing and Review: Muse Natalie", "date": "Monday, December 8, 2014", "text": "This is the pattern I mentioned I was testing, the latest offering from Muse, aka what is becoming my new favorite indie pattern company. Not because I received two patterns for \"free\" (quotes because testing isn't really free to me, or any tester, when you account for time, materials, etc. but I know that and volunteered with eyes wide open) but because I really like what I've seen and sewn from Muse so far. And I did buy the Jenna cardigan pattern with my own money so it's not all fluff and unicorns here. :-)This dress is Natalie. Side note ... although I've heard/read grumblings around the interwebs about the practice among indies of naming patterns instead of or in addition to numbering them, I actually prefer the names. I can NEVER remember a pattern number (especially if they've been reissued), but I always remember the names. So names over numbers gets a thumbs-up from me and my forgetful brain every time. (You can also read about the inspiration for the Muse pattern names when you click over to the Muse site.)This pattern testing cycle was pretty much like the last testing I did for Muse. I was given a preview of the pattern to see if I would be interested, along with a schedule of when to have my testing finished. No photos were required but I caught a nice day on a weekend after finishing the dress so I've had these waiting for this post. At first, I wasn't sure about this design for me and volunteered to only review the instructions, PDF print-out, cutting layout, and pattern pieces. But then, being the fickle sewist I am, I decided to just go for it, figuring nothing ventured, nothing gained. And I'm glad I did. I like the final dress a lot.  It's definitely a very feminine dress and my curves probably make it a little more so, but, hey, I've got curves. I have worn it to the office and while the vee is low, it's not work-inappropriate low. I also wore a black cardi over the dress in the office. Because office air conditioning.The dress falls like an empire waist but wrong side out on Zillie below you can see that it's not really an empire at all. There's a triangle inset, gathering at bust and CF (optional at CF), and diagonal seaming down the front. The neckline is finished with a mitered attached band and was sized perfectly to fit the neck opening and lay flat on the body underneath. The back is cut on fold. Truthfully, I kind of wish there was some cool seaming at the back too and I contemplated adding at least a CB seam when sewing this, but laziness over pattern matching won over. And this print is cool/busy enough so any more seaming would've been lost anyway.I cut a straight 44 with no adjustments except to square the shoulders (my usual) while cutting out the pattern.It fits perfectly, no FBA needed due to the gathers and diagonal seams. For a next make of the dress, I will add 1-1/2\" to the length because while the pattern is drafted for a 5'10\" woman (yes!), it would have been shorter than my preference on my 5'5\" self if I had hemmed it more than a smidge. So I cut a shaped hem facing instead. I could have just turned up a 3/8\" hem but I prefer a deep hem on drapey knits so they have some weight. The sleeves, on the other hand, were much too long for me. I cut off about 2\" and still hemmed them with a 1-1/2\" turn-up. But that's to be expected if the fit model is 5'10\", no? Better too long than too short anyway. The dress was cut out and sewn in one day. It's a fast project. While testing, I noted some corrections and slight improvements to the pattern markings and cutting layout and I think every one of them was incorporated into the final. I thought the pre-release instructions were fine as-is, with no corrections needed, although other testers must have had suggestions since the release notes mention those changes being included too. This tells me that again Kat, the designer behind Muse, listened to her testers and adjusted her pattern and release schedule to make necessary changes. As a tester, it's gratifying to know that the testing does matter and we're not here for just a happy shiny blog tour to sell patterns.I'll state it again, I was NOT asked to post this review or any photos. What I'm writing and showing here is by my own choice. I like the pattern and my final dress. If you like it too and want to buy it, that's your choice. I get nothing if you do, or if you don't.Now if you do decide you're interested,  the full sale price, less transaction fees, of all Natalie patterns  sold during the first week of launch (December 8-14, 2014) will be donated to the Wellington branch of the Cats Protection League and you can get 15% off the Natalie pattern during launch week with the code NATALIE. A win for the kitties and a win for you.I have a few projects running through my mind that I want to tackle soon so this will be it for me and pattern testing for a while. Stay tuned for my overly ambitious to-do list. ;-) I hope the sewjo holds up."},
{"title": "Ahhh Goodbye Long Weekend I Have Loved You So", "date": "Sunday, November 30, 2014", "text": "I can't believe I have to go back to work in the morning. Well, it's a good thing ... past unemployment, etc., but I was really REALLY enjoying the paid time off. Something I haven't had for almost a year. I hope all of my American readers had a great Thanksgiving! It was very low-key here, just Alex and me, but we cooked (and ate) like we were expecting another dozen. I'm really craving a salad so the leftovers will be set aside tonight and maybe only come out one more time tomorrow before they are tossed. (Don't worry ... Alex has already made sure that not much is being tossed.)I didn't sew a whole lot over the last four days, but I did what us sewistas do when we're not sewing ... BUY FABRIC. Hahaha. I went to Hancock's yesterday for thread on sale, a couple of invisible zips also on sale, and to see if they still had any of the gray pinstripe left at $3.99/yd. Yes, yes, and yes. Although the fabric initially wasn't coming up as on sale, but the clerk did honor the sign above the bolt, so yay. I left the store spending less than $25, which I count as a win. The pinstripes may be pants soon. Or it may be a blatant copy of Carolyn's latest dress.I wasn't nearly so thrifty online last night where nearly $100 worth of knits fell into my Fabric.com shopping basket.And I just spent my CSC / Smuggler's Daughter winnings to take advantage of the \"notwalmart\" discount code before it expires tonight. A cool fabric was calling my name (below left). I have no idea what to make with it, but I want it nonetheless. I may have been channeling my inner Shams. I'm hoping it speaks to me when I have it in my hands. Another piece may have jumped in the cart too.And this from the woman who never used to wear black. Hmmm. The times they are a changin'.The sewing I did do this weekend is still embargoed. I've been testing yet again. I promise ... this is not turning into a pattern testing blog. At first, I was only going to look over the pattern itself and the instructions since X and I both thought the pattern wasn't really my style. However, I don't really have a style, per se, since I tend to just buy/make/wear what I like and what I think looks good on me with maybe only one eye toward \"fashionable,\" and the more I looked at the pattern, the more I decided I did want to at least try it. All I can share before it's released (which will be soon I'm told) is a little sneaky peek.Yeah,that helps a lot, doesn't it? But since I did manage to get outside for some pics today, when I can share them, they won't be of the usual crappy variety. Ahem. Still, I am not a model and I seriously had to delete about 10 for every 1 I kept. I'm much better at the au naturale bathroom mirror shots. Not sure how much sewing is going to happen during the week, but I hope at least some since my upcoming Saturday afternoon is already booked with a trip to nowhere on my boss' boat. It's called \"The Holiday Death Cruise to Nowhere (with boxed wine)\" to give you some idea of the warped senses of humor in my work group. I'm proud? to say I fit right in. Alex is invited too but I'm not sure yet if he really wants to go. Might be kind of boring for him. But still, a boat ride around Tampa Bay can't be all bad even if you're 22 stuck with a bunch of oldies. ;-)Have a great week!"},
{"title": "It's Time for More Crappy Photos", "date": "Wednesday, November 19, 2014", "text": "Maybe Santa will bring me a better camera, but for now we're all stuck with a simple Point and Shoot and/or my phone. But at least you get me and not Zillie, right? (cough:cough)So here's what I wore yesterday, which is the newest Jenna cardigan paired with the Kwik Sew tank and the Butterick \"Carolyn\" skirt. Love! this skirt. I want two more. I've been wanting a pinstripe skirt for a while now and I'm so glad it's finally in my closet. I may go back to Hancock's for more of the fabric to make a pair of pants too. It was a steal at only $3.99/yard.Bought these last night in anticipation of The Big Freeze today. Brrrr! They are very comfy.I did finish the Hot Patterns Uptown/Downtown Knit Dress last night, motivation rising as the temps kept falling. It was in the THIRTIES people. Good god! This is what I wore today ... Yeah, you can't see the dress very well in these work bathroom cell phone pics, but I like it a lot and it was nice and cozy. New boots, check. Scarf I made last night from scraps of that dress I made and hated, check. And a RTW cardi. Gillian, if you're reading, this is the curved hem RTW cardi I mentioned. Somehow that curve minimizes my hips. I want more of these too. My head looks huge in these pics and I have no chin. Lovely. Here I was trying to show more of the dress not hang myself. Not sure it worked out as planned. :-)And now I'm off to brave the cold again with some dinner out. And tomorrow night is our firm's holiday party for clients, at which I'm \"working\" (hello overtime!). Everyone says it's lots of fun. I believe them ... the caterers were in all day today setting up bars and food stations all over both of the floors we inhabit in the building. Nice! Staff gets its own party next month."},
{"title": "The mini SWAP continues", "date": "Monday, November 17, 2014", "text": "Lots of sewing has been going on but you'll have to settle for Zillie doing the modeling for now. And crappy nighttime indoor photography, which is doing horrible things to the colors. I finished the next Jenna cardi. You saw a sneak peek of this one last post.While I didn't use the gathered front version, I did use the shoulder yoke pieces for a contrast and applied them over top. Also contrasting is the neck, button, and sleeve bands. I have used what seems like a TON of this gray sweater knit in the last 10 days, as you'll see. It's been in my stash for so many years I've lost count. And I still have at least 2 yards left. Holy cow ... it must have been a really good deal whenever/wherever I bought it. I also made another KS tank so the cardi becomes a twinset. But I made this one with a little \"twist.\" It's party in the front, business in the back. A un-mullet. Ha. This way I get a plain gray-fronted tank to layer under the cardi and other things when the mood strikes. I'm a little proud of myself for thinking of this. I know it will come in handy.Next in the queue was this Simplicity gored skirt. Trust me, it's purple, not red/maroon, and matches the new cardi. This pattern is made for a woven but I used a knit. I omitted the back zip and inserted some elastic into the sides of the waistband to snug it in when worn. I have no idea what this knit fabric is. It looks like a double-knit or golf/pique knit but it's really stretchy and drapey. It's also been in my stash for a long time. A. Really. Long. Time. As you can tell, I'm on a flippy skirt jag at the moment. The skirt ... again, really purple, not red ... also coordinates with the other Jenna. Looks like Zillie is leaning like the Tower of Pisa. Weird.I'm now in the process of making this HP Uptown/Downtown knit dress, with yet more of the gray sweater knit. It's my plan to have it finished tomorrow night so I can wear it Wednesday, when it's supposed to be quite FRIGID here. What the heck northerners ... keep that stuff up your way, OK? It's not even Thanksgiving and we're dropping into the 30s?? Yikes. Good thing I've been sewing (and buying) cardigans.I still have to add the waist elastic and sleeve bands, plus decide on either a hem or hem band for the bottom. I wore the heck out of my summer version of this dress and decided I definitely needed a winter one. The plain gray is going to be a great blank canvas for layering. Obviously the new Jenna matches perfectly. I kept the neckline lowered per the last make and didn't add length to the neckband even though this knit is a lot less stretchy ... which made for a bit of gathering which I actually quite like. Happy accident.Here are the patterns, for anyone interested.Muse Jenna for the cardigans.Kwik Sew 2759 for the tank underlayer.Simplicity 1697 for the purple-not-red skirt. Hot Patterns 1090 Uptown//Downtown Knit Dress.The new job is going well. Thanks again for all the good wishes. I'm working with a really great and fun group of people in a really great firm. I'm so thrilled that a permanent position opened up at just the right time. And I really, REALLY hope this is the last job I have to get for a good long time. It's going to take a little while to get my finances caught up but it's so nice to finally know it will happen. I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving, and your virtual support is truly one of the things on the list."},
{"title": "The start of a mini SWAP with my Carolyn Skirt", "date": "Sunday, November 9, 2014", "text": "After the wadder from last weekend's sewing, I went in a different direction for the pinstripe skirt after finding this inspiration photo on Pinterest. I'm calling mine the Carolyn Skirt because (1) pinstripes are very corporate and Carolyn is all about sewing a corporate wardrobe and (2) she's also all about finding inspirational fashion pieces and interpreting them for herself.My skirt didn't need much interpretation since I already had this Butterick 4877 pattern stashed and my skirt is pretty much a straight copy. But I did have to do a bit of pattern hacking, first for the size and then for design details. The pattern is from my bigger days and the size range I bought is too big for me now. I graded it down two sizes, using the pattern's actual grading upward as my guide downward. That sounds a lot more complicated than it actually was. Essentially all I did was to chop off  1-1/2\" from each side seam and shorten the waist facings to match. I had previously made this skirt 2-3 times in the larger size range in a couple of the different views and loved the fit of them all so I had high hopes for a new smaller version. I wish it wasn't OOP because it's an awesome draft for women with curves. If you're curvy, I definitely recommend picking it up should you come across it.  So, anyway ... my Carolyn Skirt. I started with View A (the white skirt), shortened the flounce by 5 inches, and then traced it and spit it so I could make the chevrons at the seams per the inspiration photo. I had to cut the flounce pieces (there's 6 of them total after the splitting) single layer so I could be sure my seams would create actual chevrons and not almost-chevrons. I think I did very well with the stripe matching and the skirt copying. I added topstitching which the inspiration didn't have, but I wanted to really set off the seams. My skirt sits at my knee instead of above it, which is more flattering on me. And I'm as happy with the fit of my smaller version as I was with the original makes.I debated a machined blind hem but decided for the faster method of just topstitching a narrow hem, figuring it blends with the other topstitching and, really, NO ONE is going to be looking at my hem. I'm not aiming for couture here. ;-)I did think to take a pic of the serged/overlocked edge for anyone that's new to sewing a curved hem where the outside edge is larger than the turn-up. The trick is to turn up the differential on the serger so it very slightly gathers the edge and then to softly turn the hem under without straightening out the gathers. You can see in the photo below that the edge is already cupping inward. Work with that cupping so you can pin a hem that turns smoothly without actual gathers/ripples. Then press (up and down motion) it in place and sew it right side up so the feed dogs help in easing the longer edge too. Next up is another Jenna cardi (in progress below), which will go with this skirt and another skirt already cut and waiting. I'm hoping to finish the cardi in the morning, and that will probably be it for sewing this weekend as I have a bunch of errands to run and then dinner with a friend. Plus I'm hoping to do a little housecleaning too. But that's last on the list because ... well, it's housework. No pics on me until next week at the earliest since it's supposed to be still raining tomorrow. And one of my errands is to hopefully get a hair cut."},

Besides needing more Jenna cardis, I need more of these skirts. I ended up tucking in the underlayer tank, which works well I think. Gives me a waist too. Now please go have a look at the Curvy Sewing Collective's entries into the Wrapalong Sewalong and vote for your favorite here. I won't lie by saying I hope it's for me cuz the top three vote-getters each get a $50 gift certificate from Smuggler's Daughter for fabric, and you all KNOW how fabric deprived I've been. :-)But even if not for me, please go vote.

{"title": "Muse Jenna Plus Kwik Sew 2759 = New Twinset Love", "date": "Sunday, October 26, 2014", "text": "Here's my almost complete Jenna cardigan over the tank from Kwik Sew 2759. I still have buttons to sew onto the cardi tonight while plopped in front of the television. I decided on shank buttons from the button stash and so there's no way NOT to do these by hand. Oh, the sacrifices ...  ;-)The fabric is an acrylic/poly lightweight sweater knit purchased from Hancock's on Friday during my aerobic lunchtime shopping. I say \"aerobic\" because I was out of the office, into my car, in Hancock's (3 miles away), through the fabric and cutting table for 4 selections, a stop at the pattern cabinets to pull 8 Simplicities I had on a list for the sale, through the checkout, and back to my desk in a little over an hour. Whew! It's probably a really good thing that I was so time limited because I saw a LOT of fabrics that were asking to come home with me, made worse by my fabric shopping withdrawals for the last many months.I picked this fabric with the Jenna in mind and to hopefully match this Sophia knit KS skirt I made last year. I love the skirt but don't wear it much because I'm not so in love with the pairing possibilities in my closet. I made a knit HotPatterns top which goes with the skirt perfectly but the fabric is just so clingy that I tend to avoid wearing it. The new knit doesn't match exactly but I think it blends well enough at a reasonable distance to fool the naked eye, so I'm very happy the skirt has a new mate and I'll be wearing this tomorrow. (Plus I did hem the Gillian dress shorter which means TWO new outfits to wear this week!) The underlayer of the twinset is the tank from this classic Kwik Sew 2759. And, yes, you're probably thinking I could've used the cardigan from this or even the Jalie I hacked instead of buying the Jenna, and you'd be sorta right. Except, one, I really wanted to try the Jenna, especially after my recent success with the Gillian. I'm not immune to the call of new patterns/designers and I've really liked all the Jenna makes I've seen around the interwebs. And, two, there's enough shaping subtleties between Jenna and the other two to make the Jenna much more current-trend fit-wise. Jenna's more fitted, with nice sideseam shaping and high armholes (something KS is notorious for NOT drafting).After cutting the Jenna, I had enough left from the 2 yds I bought to eek out a tank. So, out came my personal pattern catalog for a quick look to see what I had on hand, and then the tracing paper. I know KS always runs big on me and those armholes always low, so I traced a M everywhere and raised the armholes to the XS height, and while tracing made my usual square shoulder adjustment. The finished tank fits very well. I just wish I had added an inch in length because this thing is pretty short as drafted and I had to turn the tiniest of hems when I would've preferred to hem this knit a bit deeper. Oh well. Sew and learn. I like how the print worked out for neck and armhole bands, even though I will NEVER wear this single layer. So I'll just enjoy the bands in the mirror and on the hanger. :-)For the Jenna, I cut at the 42 for the shoulders/neckline and morphed out to the 46 for the rest, also adding a square shoulder alteration before I cut the pattern. There was nothing particularly scientific about this, just my gut after sewing the Gillian in a straight 46 that I probably could've gone down a size or two but the wrap styling forgives sizing accuracy a lot. My gut was correct and the finished cardi fits just as I was wanting. Which you'll see when I get photos of it on me instead of Zillie.I had a few problems with the page alignment marks on my printout but I haven't studied it enough to blame the draft or the printer. Whichever it was, the actual pattern lines fit together without issue, which makes me lean toward the marks being the culprit. The whole thing prints out on 30-ish (I forget the exact count and the PDF is at the office) pages, which tape together just as quickly as unfolding and pressing tissue. I know I'm an oddball, but I actually prefer most PDFs over tissue. I've always had an aversion to pattern tissue. It's gotten better over the years, but I still don't love it.The only drafting issue I found with the Jenna is very minor and does not affect fit at all. Where the side seams come together creates a \"bump\" at the bottom edge, which will affect how the hem band sews on and lays if left alone. (Don't stare too long at my sad matching at the sideseams. This is what eyeballing will get you. And I actually cut this single layer!)Solution: trim the bump away.Everything else fit together perfectly, including the neckband and center front bands. No overage, no shortage, so nice even edges top and bottom on all the bands. Here's the top button waiting for handsewing tonight. And a glimpse of the teal topstitching.Overall, I'm very pleased with the two offerings from Muse, after sewing and fitting them both, and I know that you'll be seeing more of these patterns made up in the near future because I love me some pretty cardigans for our Florida winters and who doesn't love a nicely detailed wrap dress? (So, Kat ... when is your next pattern due??)I want to get back into the sewing room later today to start on something else because the mojo is on FIRE, but the grocery store and weekly trip to the dog beach call first so we'll see how far I get on the next project."},
{"title": "Hopping on the Hop", "date": "Friday, October 24, 2014", "text": "I bet Manju thought I was never going to respond to her nomination! Hah. I'm just a procrastinator. But thank you for nominating me. I'd like to thank the Academy .... er ... oops.I'm  probably now one of the last stops on this Blog Hop of Why I Write, and  I don't do a lot of hops/memes/awards for various reasons (all lazy and  selfish of course!), but I have to say I've really been enjoying  reading everyone else's so I figured what the heck. And it's a slow day  at work (yes, WORK!!!) so I can look busy while typing this and have the  added bonus of not using up sewing time this weekend, because I have BIG  plans for weekend sewing starting TONIGHT, after coming back from a  mad-dash lunch hour stop into Hancock's for the Simplicity sale and to  put a small dent into rebuilding my stash. (Run-on sentence much?)Sidenote: I  never realized how many brown/white/ivory prints I have/had until  that's about all that was left in the knit prints section of the stash.  Yes, I like brown and prints and even brown prints, but good lord ...  was I holding a self-contest these past years to see if I could binge buy all the browns? I'm  SO happy to now have a few different colors to choose from, and enough  to keep me busy over the next few weeks at least.OK, enough blabber ... let's get to the task at hand.1. Why do I write?Well,  that's easy. Part of me likes to show off share what I've made with others who Just Get It. I've lived with only  males for the last 30 years (yikes!) and while they have all enjoyed the  my sewing when it came to their own special request projects, I would  inevitably get the glazed eyes/deer in the headlights treatment for  most everything else. Part of me wants to keep some sort of  journal/diary of my sewing projects. Part of me wants to share the love  of the craft with hints and helps that I have picked up along the way.2.  How is my blog different from others of the same genre?It's not  really. It's just me being me with some sewing. And  sometimes my sons and  the dogs. (Speaking of which ... the Marine is being promoted to SERGEANT in two weeks!! Can I get an OORAH!!) And some life stuff. And  definitely shoes.3. What am I working on  right now? Um, this blog post. Oh, I guess that wasn't meant LITERALLY.  Hah. It's Friday and I'm a goofball. I must be on a fabric high since  lunch.I have a few things I want to work on right away now that I have NEW FABRIC burning a hole .... er ... where am I going with this metaphor?? ... starting with the Muse Jenna cardi I bought and downloaded today and will tape together tonight. It will be interesting to compare it to my Jalie hack. I also have a HotPatterns dress pattern bought eons ago I'd like to make from the new print I bought today. But first, I'm going to shorten the hem length of the newly made Muse Gillian wrap dress an inch or two. I haven't worn it to work yet because I decided I do want it a little shorter, and the energy isn't always there after working, making dinner, and dog walks. So, I'm hoping to get that done tonight so that Saturday and Sunday are free to SEW, SEW, SEW all the new things!4. What is my writing process?Blue moon? When the iron's hot? Hell has frozen over? Pigs are flying? I don't really have a process. I just write what comes to mind, usually after a sewing project but sometimes completely unrelated to sewing, and I write when I feel like it. Well, more like when I have the spare time. I always *want* to write more than I actually do, but there's only so many hours in the day and often the blog has to come last. But I usually manage to get something on it fairly regularly just so the comment 'ho in me (Hi Carolyn) gets her fix. :-) I never schedule a post. When you see a new post it means I have just clicked the Publish button. I'm just not that organized and I don't really see the point. If a post is ready, it's ready. For sewing projects, the post will start to percolate as I'm making the whatever. I take pics along the way so I don't forget what I want to say about a particular detail and then when I'm ready to write, I load up all the photos, edit them, and upload them to Blogger. THEN I begin on the words. And inevitably I've missed a typo or three after I click Publish so I go back and read/re-read and try to find and correct them. I think that about covers it. I'm home now, having emailed myself the draft so I could finish and post it. I think I'm supposed to nominate two bloggers for the next stops on the tour. I didn't ask in advance so I will understand if you choose to bow out. First is Carolyn of Diary of a Sewing Fanatic. Did I miss her already hopping, because I don't think so and I can't believe no one has nominated her yet. I think she needs no introduction but I REALLY think she needs to send half of her ponte stash to Florida. ;-) Next is Dawn of Two On Two Off. I love her wit, her love of prints, and the Alaskiana she occasionally shares. Alaska is definitely on my Bucket List of places to visit.I'm off to tape together a pattern and re-hem that dress while the brown thread is still in the machine. Hopefully I'll be back Sunday with something newly made."},
{"title": "Muse Gillian: The Reveal, and an Honest Review", "date": "Saturday, October 18, 2014", "text": "Warning: This is an untypically photo-heavy post. The planets aligned and I had a nice day, a dress I'm very happy with, a son willing to take multiple photos (I don't have a camera remote and my camera only takes two shots at a time, and I quickly tire of running back and forth and smoothing clothes in the process), and -- a good hair day. :-)So, let's get to it.This is the Gillian wrap dress by Muse Patterns. The Gillian pattern can also be made as separates, a wrap top and a wrap skirt. As you can see, I made the dress. It's available in sizes 30 - 48, which correspond to bust sizes 30\" - 48\". Kat of Muse invited me to test the pattern before its release and I  agreed, because this is a style that I would wear. Which is one big  reason this new indie pattern line stands out from others for me. While there are a number of indie patterns I admire from afar, I know I'd never wear most of them, either due to body type or age (cough:29:cough). Muse  offers patterns I would actually wear (two so far, but I'm hoping for more if this dress is any indication) , and I think ladies of all ages will want to wear. The styles are not beginner basics which you can find from other indies  or the Big 4. Now that's not to say an advanced beginner couldn't make  this dress, but don't expect this to be a teach-me-to-sew pattern.I asked during testing what bust cup Kat designs for and she answered  \"B.\" I'm a DD and didn't have to make a full bust adjustment. But both  knits and wraps are very forgiving for full busts, so I'm not sure I  should really doubt the B cup sizing. I do know that if you are full-busted, you will find alterations for the girls are probably  not needed. Yes, even you Michelle. :-)Testers were given a little over 2 weeks to turn-around testing the pattern, instructions, and garment view of their choice. We were asked to provide feedback. We were not required to provide photos. I'm sad to admit that I failed miserably in one aspect -- finishing the dress before the release. I had every intention, but the fabric gods did not cooperate. I had ordered new fabric because the fabric requirements had me thinking this dress is a bit of a fabric piggy (more on this later), calling for 3.5+ yards. My stash was not yielding any appropriate pieces that length. So, my fabric order arrived ... SANS the 4-yard cut of the print I had planned to use. Grrrr. Does the universe not know I NEED fabric??I did read the instructions thoroughly, printed and assembled the PDF (no problems there), checked the cutting layout, and assembled the dress in my mind visualizing the instructions as best as I could. So, even though I didn't sew the dress during the testing schedule, I found a number of issues in the instructions and cutting layout and I'm happy to report that corrections and/or clarification, as appropriate, were incorporated into the final release. So know that Kat is a pattern designer who takes her testers seriously and doesn't have a release date set in stone if corrections are mandated. (Kat was very responsive during the testing process. If anything, it was me who could have been more chatty.) As a tester, it's also gratifying to know that I wasn't just spitting into the wind and wasting my time. The one thing about the instructions, after receiving the released version, I would still like to see improved upon are some of the illustrations. They aren't sparse or horrible as is, but I think a few could be more spatially correct. And that just might be the graphic designer in me. Your mileage may vary. The illustrations certainly didn't hinder me from ending up with a pretty new dress.I also found a few \"problems\" when actually sewing the dress, but only one is not due to body type or my own stupidity. Details for all below.The one drafting \"problem\" I found you can see below, but it's very minor and easily corrected. The shoulder seam joining the front and back yokes results in a bit of a wonky shape at the top of the armscye.  Solution: Trim it off. That's it. Definitely not a deal breaker. This next alteration, below, is due to my very erect back/posture and square shoulders. I did not make either alteration before cutting fabric because I was testing. But I did want a wearable dress if possible, so after I had the bodice mostly completed, I tried it on and decided I really needed to remove an inch from the CB length above the shoulder blades (erect posture) to avoid the neckband sitting in my back hairline. I have this same issue with Jalie and Burda, so I know it's me and not them. The chalk line below shows what I trimmed away before sewing on the neckband.Speaking of fabric, I did end up using stash after all (an ITY print and ribbed brown poly for contrast) because I decided that I would see if I could squeeze the pattern onto a 3-yard piece. I'm happy to report that I easily could, and I even lengthened the waist ties by 16\" each so I could tie them in front, instead in back as designed. (Back ties look fine on other ladies and I'm not judging, I swear. But on me I feel like Holly Hobbie or pregnant or something). But, I didn't cut long sleeves or self-fabric yokes and I didn't follow the layout exactly because I thought I was in squeeze mode. The important takeaway from this is to note that the cutting layout reflects cutting every single piece from the same fabric. If you're planning on any contrast pieces (and you should, so the unique design elements stand out!), then the fabric requirements will vary. I'm thinking if you do contrast yokes, neckband, midriff, and ties, you can get by with 2-2.5 yds for the main dress and about 1 yd for the contrast.The next alteration was due to my petite-ness-above-the-waist-ness. Yes, that's a sewing term, why do you ask? ;-) The instructions have you construct the bodice, skirt, and midriff pieces as separate units and then you attach the skirt and finally the bodice. This is actually pretty cool because sewing the skirt hem is done way at the beginning and once you assemble the units, you have a finished dress instead of a dress needing a hem.I dutifully followed the instructions, and then tried it on. Oops. As you can see below, there was gaping in the wrap and extra length above my waist. Solution: frog stitch the bodice from the midriff, cut off 3/4\" from the bottom edge of the bodice, and reattach to the midriff, which worked a treat. So, I advise that if you're fitting as you sew, BASTE the bodice to the midriff and evaluate. (This \"extra\" length is another reason why I think full-busted girls will have more fitting forgiveness. You can keep the underbust length and taper a shorter bodice as you go toward the bodice back, and no one will be the wiser. Well, unless you're REALLY long-waisted.) Look Ma! No gape!The next \"problem\" I had with construction was due to my own stubbornness. See this opening in the sideseam below? It's for the tie to slide through so the dress actually wraps. This is a real wrap dress, BTW, not faux. Well, that hole was almost my undoing. I kept following the instructions halfway and then thinking they just were not going to work. I emailed Kat and she so very diplomatically told me that her more experienced testers seemed to have the most problems with this step, while her less experienced testers just trusted the instructions and didn't overthink things. (Kat's actual words were much nicer than this.) So, I returned to the instructions one last time and followed them exactly, and THEY WERE GENIUS. Good lord, did I feel like an idiot. So, just follow those instructions. Don't overthink, don't doubt, don't stop halfway through and scratch your head. They work. And it's pure drafting magic. Really.The rest of the photos are detail shots. Here you can see the edgestitching at the neckband and you get a glimpse of my \"ribbed\" constrast.The gathering into the yoke.The back contrast yoke and gathering below it.I added contrast bands to the sleeve hems to tie into the contrast yokes.The wrong side of the wrap skirt section.The wrap sections overlap fully. Even in a strong wind, no good china will be shared with the world. You can't see for the print, but the hem edges of the wrap sections are curved, which can be a little tricky to sew without puckers. My advice: washable basting glue (Elmer's school glue works great), working slowly and methodically around the hem, and forcing yourself to give the glue a few minutes to dry thoroughly.On Zillie. Likes: The feminine details with a slight vintage vibe, such as the yokes; the soft gathers into the yokes; the wide (but not too wide) midriff, which is sturdy without being interfaced (thankfully, since I'm still out of interfacing) and which I edgestitched with a \"stretchy\" triple straight stitch; the different views so you get a dress, a top, and a skirt in the same pattern; a neckband that doesn't gape; thorough instructions; and fit. I should've mentioned it specifically earlier, but the fit is very good. My full bust measures 46\". I sewed the 46. I'm a hourglass with the sand settling in the bottom of the glass. ;-) I made no fit adjustments except those mentioned above. Things I will change for the next one: Remove bodice length above the waist on my pattern; adjust the pattern for my erect posture and square shoulders; maybe remove a little skirt length, although this length is fine on me I think I might want it shorter; and add pockets. My hands kept wanting pockets as I tried it on and then when taking the pics. Easy enough to add sideseam pockets, though.Overall, I think this is a win. And for $12, I think it's more than fairly priced compared to other indies, especially those which are basic shapes and easily found in the Big 3/4 catalogs.I did receive the pre-release and final pattern at no charge, but I think you can tell that this is a pretty thorough review and not just fluff to help a bloggie friend sell a pattern (truthfully, I don't know Kat at all except through emails during this testing process and reading her blog before her patterns were launched, so I'm not sure that really even qualifies us as bloggie friends and not just sewists who blog!). I hope I also gave you a little insight into what was expected from my testing, what I provided (and didn't), and how my feedback was incorporated into the final product. This is not the first time I've tested something for \"free.\" I used to be a software tester for Corel Corporation, starting as an unpaid beta tester and then later \"promoted\" to a paid alpha tester, and a technical editor for McGraw-Hill. I'm telling you this to give some insight into the fact that I just enjoy testing. I'm a geek. I like the challenge. I like being a part of something new. I like sewing. And I LURVE patterns. For me, that's payment enough. And when it's not, I'll stop testing."},
{"title": "Sneak Peek: Muse Patterns Gillian", "date": "Monday, October 13, 2014", "text": "(The browns do match but my camera apparently wasn't liking an indoor night shot and decided to make up its own colors.)I've been testing the newest pattern from Muse, the Gillian wrap dress, which was just released yesterday. I'm hoping to have this dress finished in the next day or two and you can then expect an honest review from me. Yes, I received the tester and final pattern for free, but if you know me, you know that I'm all about keeping it real. There will be no sugarcoating here. I'll tell you now, though, that if you're thinking of buying it soon to take advantage of the new release discount, you won't be wasting your money. You can find the discount code on the Muse blog, here. (This plug is completely unsolicited and I receive nothing for it.)In non-sewing news, I started my new job this past Thursday. I didn't have to go far ... just one floor up from where I've been temping since May. It's the same firm, but a permanent position opened up in another department and some new friends I've made here let me know early and cheerleaded for my getting an interview and the job. I'm eternally grateful! It's a really wonderful place, with lots of friendly people, great benefits, and the fantastic perks and resources working in a large law firm brings. I'm technically still temp for about 25 more days, but that's how the agency fee works. I don't anticipate any roadblocks to being on the real payroll at the start of November. Then you'll hear the screams of joy (and relief) ... and the thump of the fabric delivery box ... no matter where you live. ;-)Thank you all again for hanging in there with me during the ups and downs, and for sending all those good vibes. I truly believe they worked! Now keep them crossed for 25 more days. :-)And, Corgi Karen ... yes,  let's get together for lunch or something SOON!"},

{"title": "Banishing the Blues", "date": "Monday, October 6, 2014", "text": "A few of you commented that maybe my blue suit would be lucky. Which got me thinking that maybe it has been UNlucky. Well, I don't really believe that but I do know that I had wanted to NOT wear that darn blue suit again, luck or no luck. I was just tired of it. One thing I did come home with from Saturday's shopping marathon was a jacket I loved. Too expensive, but I bought it anyway to ... well ... dwell on it. I could always return it once I came to my senses. ;-) Well, I decided to throw caution to the wind (dollar-wise). Ya gotta spend money to make money, right? Haha. So here's what I wore today. The ponte skirt and ITY drape neck top are me-made. The jacket is purchased. It's a knit with leather trim and faux welt pockets (which I wish were real but whatever). The silver necklace is new too. The burgundy shoes are not new. I felt like a million bucks, and the interview went well. Not necessarily related, but looking good never hurts, right? And the jacket will join my permanent wardrobe, since I had to shorten the sleeves almost 3 inches last night, so I'll be enjoying and hopefully wearing it a lot soon. It will go with a lot of solid colors since I like b/w prints with colors. Just not on interviews. I like that it's knit, because it can be dressed up or down and is so, so comfy to wear. I can see me copying this once I can afford EmmaOneSock again. ;-)So, I'll be returning the two blue print tops (aftering taking copious notes for a Jalie sweetheart hack) and keeping the jacket and necklace. And maybe a dress that also was a contender if I had been able to find a black jacket. ;-) But only if I get the job. Otherwise, it will go back too.And now for something completely different ... here's me modeling the Jalie cardi hack. I think it could be a bit narrower at the sideseams. It's hard to tell since my hands are kinda pulling it downward.Thanks for all the prayers and good wishes. I'll let you know soon if they worked."},
{"title": "Preaching to the Choir", "date": "Saturday, October 4, 2014", "text": "I decided that I would go out today and buy a new suit. I have exactly ONE solid color suit for interviews. It's blue (not navy) and I'm not really a blue wearing girl. I don't know why, I'm just not.So, I walk into JCPenney (cheap is highly desired right now or else I'd be shopping at Dillards or Nordstroms or a few others) and was overwhelmed in a good way by all the styles and colors. I saw A MILLION dresses I would wear in a heartbeat. And another MILLION tops. Prints and fabric combos I could never find to sew. And they were all already made up. No muslins, no pattern alterations. Hence Ready. To. Wear.Which made me seriously consider giving up sewing, since my stash is so depleted and I'm going to have to spend $$ to clothe myself one way or the other.So, I start looking for suits. First of all, finding a suit (or separates) with a matching SKIRT is near impossible. I don't want a pantsuit. Not for interviewing. Not really even for not interviewing.Second, RTW jackets don't fit me. Not unless they're Petites. Apparently, I have T-rex arms. Any RTW jacket sleeve is at least 2 inches too long. I would hem them, no problem, if there wasn't a vent/button thing going on that would interfere. I don't even want to try to learn how to deal with shortening those. Third, what the HELL size am I? My already-owned blue suit is a RTW 18P, modified. The jacket fits mostly great, just a leeeeetle wide in the shoulders but, really, only I can tell that. The skirt was way too big when I lost all that weight so I did take it in and shortened it as well as taking in the sideseams of the jacket to give it more curves to match mine. The suit still fits fine. The pencil skirt is a little snugger now since I'm still juggling a 20-ish lb. weight gain over the last couple of years, but it's not too tight.So, did ANY 16 or 18 fit me? Yeah, you know the answer: Not. Even. Close. Arghhhh. Even though I have other 16s and 18s that I wear regularly. And until the 20-lb gain, even 14s.I tried on every jacket in Penneys. I went to Lane Bryant and tried on the ONE black jacket they had. Huge. I went to Macy's and tried on a bunch more there. Some of the jackets would've been passable (and significantly more expensive) but the skirts were a no-go. Either too tight or too short. (Can you believe I was considering buying TWO skirts to take apart to refashion into one? Yeah, me either. And why can't separates include one or two NON-pencil shapes? I love me a me-made pencil but my butt doesn't love RTW pencil skirts. What do the booty girls who don't sew DO?) I even ventured to Macy's \"Womens\" (plus) department. Which was on the third floor, waaaaaaaaay in the back corner in a completely separate room-type area past some ugly clearance section, like they didn't even want to admit they HAD a plus department. Which, apparently, they didn't, because OMG the hideousness. After two hours of torture, it was clear that I wasn't buying a new suit today. So, I regrouped and decided to buy a new top to match my blue suit. I've kinda not had anything specific to wear with the suit (see above comment about me and no blue) and have been making do with a b/w top as contrast and to tie in wearing black shoes or my plain ivory SBCC Mimosa. The blue of the suit is a kinda hard-to-match shade of blue. Figures. I bought the suit ONLY because it actually fit me, not because I fell in love with the color. After returning to the call of the prints (and prices) at Penney's, I brought home two knit tops with some blue in them.The first one, here, reminds me of the Jalie sweetheart top, modified with a drape. I really like the shape of this top (just not the blue!). But ... ... for kicks, I decided to try it on inside-out in the fitting room to see how it was made, thinking about copying it later. (See Peter, you're not the only one.) And look at how COOL this is!! I had no idea until I was wearing it inside-out that the self-facing for the drape was asymmetrical like this. I am SO modifying that Jalie pattern and copying this.This is the other top. It's one of those uber-trendy crossover drapey styles, which is hard to discern in this photo. It's not really conservative enough print-wise for an interview, so I considered this a present to myself just because I need one. I'm sure I'll be buying one of the patterns that are currently out for this style since I do like it on me. And I might end up returning this one to the store because, well, blue. And brokeness.And, so to come full circle ... I still half-way would like to be able to not NEED to sew my clothes because there are so many pretty choices in the stores, but the reality is I can't. They just don't fit. Oh, and why the sudden urge for a new suit? Well, I have an interview Monday at 3 PM, and I REALLY want this job. So, cross those fingers and toes again for me please!Also, thank you SO MUCH for the kind offers of notions and fabrics. Please know that it really touches my heart and I sincerely appreciate the generosity. If this or another job doesn't materialize, I may just have to take y'all up on those offers ... but, really, the bigger concern will be paying rent next month. So, you may see me actually begging in a few weeks. But let's stay positive and not think about that yet. :-)"},
{"title": "Jalie Cardi Hacking", "date": "Saturday, September 20, 2014", "text": "You may already know but there's a new indie pattern company, Muse, and their first release is the really cute Jenna cardigan. If I had extra money right now (no, didn't get that job), I'd have bought the pattern. But since I didn't and, darn it I wasn't a tester (hint, hint), I had to settle for using it as inspiration. So I dug out my TNT Jalie 2566 twinset pattern and proceeded to hack away.The hacking was pretty easy actually. I chopped off about 9\" from the length and then added a 3\" band at the hem and a 2\" band at the sleeves. Both bands are folded, so the cutting width was actually 6-1/2\" and 4-1/2\", including seam allowances. The Jalie is also a vee neck with a continuous neck/button band vs. the Jenna's jewel neckline and separate neck and button bands. I left mine as is, since I prefer the vee over a jewel neck anyway.I was really second-guessing cutting off all that length since such a short side seam looked almost comical to me, but the fabric is a cheap stashed sweater knit and I had enough to try it again if the hacking was a disaster. It wasn't. :-) The finished cardi could even be an inch shorter and still be all right. What I didn't have extra of is interfacing. Even if I have to keep sewing from stash until that real job materializes, I'm going to have to break down and order some more interfacing since I'm seriously running out and nothing available local is even close to being suitable. (Will work for interfacing. hehehe) Having to be extra frugal these days, I did some creative piecing for the front bands. Interfacing definitely was not optional for this squishy sweater knit since I had to put in 6 tiny buttonholes on a very narrow band. I am not exaggerating when I say I was holding my breath during each one, just waiting for my machine's auto buttonholer to screw up. Luckily, they all came out perfectly. And mostly spaced evenly. Since the budget is also not allowing extraneous thread purchases, I went with what I have for the serger. I used overlocker grays in the needles to blend and regular turquoise in the loopers so the loops wouldn't contrast when the cardi flips open. The knit is actually much more aqua than the baby blue it appears to be in the top photo so these threads were a pretty good match.Inside view - good blending job, right? I'm happy with it.The buttons are Mother of Pearl from the Carolyn Norman collection. ;-) Mother of Pearl naturally has some teal-ish iridescence and goes nicely with this knit. Too bad the photo lies, but trust me ... they look really nice. And they're tiny so fit perfectly on the narrow band.Lots of topstitching around the hem and sleeve bands and around the button/neck band.I had just enough thread on this spool. Whew!I'll probably wear it open, like this, but for the main photo it looked nicer buttoned up.The blouse is a SBCC Mimosa made last year. I also made the skirt but I can't talk about that yet. ;-) The cardi is a perfect match for it and now I have a new outfit for Monday. It's still hot outside here and will be for a long while yet, but inside A/C is always chilly so layers are a must.Even though my Jalie/Jenna hack is a successful knock-off and I can hack further for Jenna's gathered shoulder yoke view, I would still like to buy (or win) the actual pattern at some point because I think it's so cute and the sewing nerd in me wants to see the original. What can I say? I read patterns like others read magazines. ;-)"},

It's close and free, and the dogs love it. Chili now knows where we're heading as soon as he sees the towels come out. He's so darn smart, that dog. Tonight after dinner, I had some reserve energy (how did THAT happen?) and got back to the dress. Now all that's left are the hems.I made View B, the one shown in the red print on the envelope. Lots of sewers in blogland have also made this view and I've liked them all, so it was time to be a sheep. :-)  The only real alteration I made was to add 4 inches to the bottom of the skirt. All reviews (and my own eyes) said the skirt was SHORT. I cut the size 16 for the neck/shoulders and morphed to the 22 by the waist/hips, since laying my TNT Magic Pencil over the skirt told me that was the best size to use. I also added additional length to the cowl facing to help prevent inside-out-ness, especially since this ITY knit slips and curls almost on its own. I may yet still add a little weight to the facing to keep it in place.I haven't tried it on yet, and I'm a little worried that it may be more revealing than I'm comfortable with. If so, I'll have to don a cami for an underlayer.Does anyone else do this .... get the whole thing nearly finished and then don't try it on?

I'm not in the love with the fabric, so that has a bearing on my feelings for the dress. It's just a crappy thin rayon knit that feels like a nightgown. I would like the dress much better in an ITY. The print is cool, which is why I bought the fabric to begin with. But it's definitely a low-quality knit and nothing will change that. I expect I'll make it again whenever I can afford to buy some new fabric because I do actually like the style of the dress on me, if not the fabric.I hinted in a previous post at showing how I used my TNT tee for sizing this dress.

And better fabric choices. Definitely better fabric choices.So, here we go ... I placed my TNT back piece over the KS back pattern piece. My goal here and on the front bodice piece was to get the widths right for me but to also keep in mind matching up to the KS waist width where it matched closest because the skirt would need to be attached at that seam and I didn't want extra, or worse, too little, at the matching seam. I also wanted to use my TNT armhole since KS armholes are notoriously low, especially on me.Here's the tracing. It's basically a S at the neck/shoulder/upper chest and then moving to M/L through bust level and then down to the waist seam.This is where I thought I had more pics. I had already created a drape front from my TNT so I used that piece to gauge the sizing for the KS. You can kinda sorta see the edge of TNT drape front at the right of this photo. The final tracing follows the same sizing variations as the back ... S up top, gradually to a M/L by the waist. The bottom length is longer than the KS pattern only because I knew I was adding a wide casing for the waist elastic (which is what Myrtle-izes this) and there was enough tissue below the bodice to just do it in one pass. For the back, I had to tape on extra.I knew I'd never use armhole facings even if I decide later to make a sleeveless version so I just traced my TNT sleeve on that part of pattern tissue so I'd have a copy of the sleeve with this dress and not have to dig out the original.Here are the finished front and back bodice pieces, where you can see the elastic casing taped onto the back piece and just cut onto the front. I added the width of the elastic (1-3/8\" I think without looking). And that's it. Since I ended the waist at the actual KS L waist width, I used the L skirt pieces without alteration. Also, I find most pattern drape fronts to be on the short side, which makes the cowl more fiddly. I added 1-1/2\" to the drape section as I was cutting. I had no problems when wearing this dress with the cowl flipping outward or anything so this was enough extra for me. I know the Myrtle has a \"self-lined\" front, which is really just the whole front doubled and then folded where the drape edge would be if it wasn't \"self-lined.\" I thought about doing this, but decided it would be too hot and the fabric would stick to itself and not lay nicely. And since I added the sleeves, I didn't need to worry about finishing armhole edges with anything other than my serger.And one last shot. Maybe one day, I'll venture outside for some better pics and a different pose. Well, if I ever find the camera cord or can afford a new one. :-( (I hope I'm not sounding too whiney. I *am* appreciative of having an income, just impatient for the new permanent job and salary to happen already.)"},

But I promised pics of this dress and since I actually wore it to work today, here's my promise fulfilled. On top of bad light, etc., the print/pattern is really wreaking havoc with the autofocus, like wearing stripes on TV. All in all, a less than great photographic result (see blog title above), but better than nothing I suppose.I do like the dress shape (except for Bustle Butt) and will consider this my wearable (cough:cough) muslin. I can see me making this again at some point, but maybe without all the mistakes? ;-) Not sure why there's a white stripe across my butt, maybe a flash phantom? And I thought Bustle Butt was bad enough!To cover the Bustle Butt, I threw on the coral cardi. I think I'm channeling Halloween now. Even though the fabric was a bee-yotch to cut and sew, it's very comfortable to wear. I like the dress as long as I'm not looking at my rear end in a mirror. And, considering I'm usually sitting at a desk, everyone else is mostly spared that sight too.I haven't gotten back to my Broke Myrtle yet (I probably shouldn't call it that and apologize to Colette), but the weekend is coming and since Alex is away, I don't have any responsibilities except to sew. And walk dogs. :-)"},

Plus sleeves (which, unfortunately, are missing from the Colette version). Pretty close match, eh? Just goes to show there's really nothing new under the sun. This one's not done yet. I still have to hem the sleeves and since it's a crappy thin rayon knit, I need to let it sit/stretch on Zillie for a couple of days before I hem the bottom.Hopefully, I'll get back to the dress mid-week and have some pics before next weekend, both of the dress on me and how I used my Otto TNT tee to make sure the KS would fit."},
{"title": "I Made the Dress, But I Didn't Make It Work", "date": "Sunday, July 20, 2014", "text": "The dress is done, so there's that. But bad fabric cutting and extra fullness (mine and the dress') killed it. I will show it on me at some point but Sundays here are not the days I want to model for the camera. Trust me, you don't want that either.So, before I come clean with the ugliness, let's explore some other points. The morph of the two patterns (S2281 and S4122) worked out well and I may even revisit it in the future. After the pain has left my memory. The part I don't like isn't from the morph, but from S2281 alone, but more on that in a bit. I like the open, wide-yoked neckline much better than the original S2281 design. High necklines and me don't get along. I didn't want to lose the pleated raglan sleeves from S2281 but I also wasn't willing to put even more time into re/creating them for this morph. Maybe another time.This is the inside view. I ditched the waistband \"facing\" cuz ... well ... fiddly poly fabric and unmotivation (Now a word. You're welcome.). I did interface it and with that, it's more than stable enough. The yoke is faced, and interfaced.I edgestitched the yoke ...... and the waistband, and all my seams lined up great so yay for an accurate morph.Here's where it starts to get ugly ...Good lord ... was I drunk when cutting that fabric? Let this illustrate how cutting single layer can be a project saver. And, more importantly, how not can be a project killer.I admit I'm usually an eyeballer ... that is, I lay out my pattern pieces and align by eye and not by ruler. This is NOT because I don't know the importance of accurate grain. It's because I have excellent spatial skills. Not a brag ... it just is. (On the other hand, I can't carry a tune in a bucket.) And because of those spatial skills, most of the time I'm spot on. Except when I'm not. As you can see below. To be fair, this looks a lot worse in a still photo with the waistband hung up on some dressform phantom than it does in real life. But even then, she ain't purty. And I have no excuse except that I'm human and not everything that comes out of my sewing room is rainbows and unicorns. ;-)And to add insult to crooked injury ... look at that first photo again (below for convenience) ... I inadvertently lined up the bodice and waistband pieces so perfectly that YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE WAISTBAND. Hahahaha ... if you can't laugh, you'll scream. :-)But even if I had perfectly cut fabric, I'd still hate the result. Because of the bustle butt. Yes, Bustle Butt. I'm trademarking that one. Why did I think I'd want (or need) gathers across my backside? Again I ask, was I drunk? If my front was as flat as Zillie's, it might even be passable. But my tummy is anything but flat and my actual side view in this dress is ...well ... let's just politely say thick and leave it at that.About the only good thing with the result is ... remember that side invisible zipper I was dreading? Well, it turned out perfectly ...... because I didn't need it! I sewed one sideseam for real and basted the other to see if I really needed a zip. And I didn't. Whew. Dodged that bullet. IF I wear this dress for real, it will be with an overlayer to cover the Bustle Butt (tm). And that atrocious fabric cutting.At least this Doomed Project From Hell is done and I can move on to something, ANYTHING, else. :-)Have a great week!"},
{"title": "Trying to turn \"What Was I Thinking\" into a \"Make It Work\" moment", "date": "Saturday, July 12, 2014", "text": "So, I recently went to Joann's to pick up some thread with a 50% off thread coupon. Or so I thought. Joann's is NOT a short trip for me anymore, having moved out of the 'burbs and into Tampa proper. Upon my arrival, I headed straight to the thread racks with my empty spools in tow so I could replace by color code. I just toss my empties into a Ziplock so I don't have to keep track of make a list.After about 15 minutes, when I was done choosing my threads (about 12 spools), I wandered over to the pattern area and was happy to see a big \"$2.99\" sale sticker on the Simplicity drawers. I proceeded to spend another 30-40 minutes browsing the catalog and drawers and narrowing my choices down to just two Simplicity patterns. I'm broke these days so even this felt like a splurge. Giving myself a $30 limit in the store to include my pattern and thread and whatever else, I next browsed the fabrics and found some for the dress pattern I had in hand. Plus two others from clearance. I figured I needed a pick-me-up new dress and I had a long weekend for adjustments and sewing.Can you guess where this is going?I waited in the crowded checkout line and, finally, it was my turn. I dutifully handed over my thread coupon and my fabric coupon. And then had a mild heart attack when the total was well over $70. Apparently, my thread coupon started the NEXT day ... AND ... Simplicity patterns weren't on sale. It was a stupid (small print) New Look sale sticker on the Simplicity drawers. But by now, I really wanted to make the new dress since I had already invested time and mental sewing. So, I handed back most of thread ... some I couldn't do without, sale or no ... and one of the Simplicity patterns, and used my 40% coupon for the other, 2281. I've never paid so much for a Simplicity pattern in my life ($10-ish!!). And I still busted my budget. Can you guess where this is going?I've decided I really don't even like the pattern for me. I was set to make the view shown in red and with the waistband contrast. I was so intent on fabric selection and since in my mind the pattern would only be $2.99 \"wasted,\" I totally missed how high the neckline is. Ugh. But since I had already bought the damn thing at the high price -- and the fabric -- I decided I could make my adjustments and then just wing it for cutting down the neckline. Which I started to do ... even taking pics along the way to detail my adjustments here on the blog (see below). Except I still wasn't feeling it. And so it sat for most of last weekend. Until I was sitting on my bed and noticed the shirt I had recently worn still hanging on my \"closet annex\"...Simplicity 4122. A past TNT that I've made many times, after adjusting the yoke to be more scooped.So, the rest of my \"sewing\" time last weekend was spent thinking about and then actually morphing a tracing of parts of S4122 into S2281. And here's where I am so far today.We'll see. Part of me just wants to dump the project and move on to a quick palate cleanser, especially since I'm decidedly NOT looking forward to a side insertion invisible zipper."},

Plus, farmer's tan. ;-)Here's the before (right) and after (left). It's not hugely dramatic but there's enough difference to see less sack and more shape. I left the pleats at the center front of the skirt but it's hard to see them in the pic. Whatevs. They're there. And my tummy thanks me for that. This shows the back, with the new empire seam, already serged, and the new sideseam sewn pre-serging.Yes, I was lazy and sewed it all the way down through the finished hem. And, of course, this would be the week that Carolyn posts about slow sewing and nice interiors. Hah. This ain't no couture dress. Never was. Never will be. But it's being worn, and no one but us is going to see the inside anyway, so I count that as a win.There will be slower sewing this weekend because I think I'm going to be fitting a new dress pattern, for a woven. Good thing I have 3 days to procrastinate and over-analyze.Happy Fourth!"},
{"title": "A Couple of Round Tuits", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2014", "text": "The cardi make and the dress re-make have been on my To Do list forEVER. I made the dress 3-4 years ago and shortly after it became too big. Since I love the print and colors, I've wanted to re-do it. I've also wanted a lightweight short-sleeved brown cascade cardi for far too long. I need the extra layer in an air-conditioned office and brown goes with so much in my wardrobe (and matches this dress too, actually, although the colors are off in the photo).I'm happy to report that both items are now in my current wardrobe. The cardi is a quick sew, using Simplicity 1945, which I had used once before for a beige winter version. I had it cut out last weekend but needed to get some more dark brown thread before I could sew it. Both of which I did yesterday. There's no pattern indication for short sleeves so I just eyeballed it and folded up the pattern pieces evenly so all the seams would match. The dress re-make was a little more convoluted, especially since I also wanted to shorten it about 4 inches but without losing any of the brown \"stripe\" at the bottom, which meant taking the length from the waist, which meant ripping apart almost the whole dang dress. I cheated and cut the seams apart. I was making it smaller anyway, so losing seam allowances wasn't a big deal. But since this knit is kind of spring-y with a mind of its own, I had to cut very slowly to keep things even or else I would've ended up with very jagged cuts.The original make had a front empire seam but no matching horizontal back seam. It does now, because I had to remove the unwanted length that way. Along with shortening the length about 4\", I removed about 10-12\" in circumference, split across the sideseams.I took a before pic but haven't taken the after yet, since it's lazy Sunday and I'm not camera-ready. I'll do that when I wear it and show you the difference."},

{"title": "Uptown, Downtown Done. (And the Giveaway winner.)", "date": "Saturday, June 21, 2014", "text": "Here's the finished Uptown/Downtown dressed down for casual wear. I walked the dogs in it tonight! The knit is very drapey rayon/Lycra from Fabric.com a couple of years ago. I know lots of you also bought this and other prints when they showed up at Fabric.com and Fabricmart. I think I still have one or two left. It's not a great quality and thinner than I prefer but it will make a very comfortable one- or two-season summer dress.I'll wear it with this knit cardi and heels at the office. The cardi got a slight makeover this afternoon after I finished the dress and while I still had the coral thread in the machines. It was too big and putting off a frumpy vibe, even for such a vibrant color. I hacked 1-1/2\" from the sleeves and resewed the sideseams smaller and shapelier. I've been wanting to do this for over two years. Sheesh. Why do these simple fixes always get put off for so long? Back to the dress, I ended up removing 1-1/2\" from the bodice length and since I used a 5/8\" seam allowance instead of the pattern's 3/8\" allowance when sewing the waist seam, I effectively used (and should have cut) the medium bodice length, as shown by the pink line below. As I found out, the longest length is REALLY long on the finished dress -- even if it doesn't look like it from the pattern.Other alterations/changes ... I've finally learned to go smaller than I usually first think with HPs for the shoulders/chest area and for this dress I cut the neckline at 12, the shoulders and upper torso (and sleeves) at 14, and blended to 16 at the waist seam and below.I also lowered the neckline another 1-1/2\" for more of a scoop and pegged the skirt using my TNT Magic Pencil as my template. Because I knew I wasn't going to use the hem band, I also lengthened the skirt 1-1/2\" which gave me a nice wide hem allowance.As I mentioned last post, the dress pieces go together like a dream. And the instructions are good too, not that I really needed them for this easy dress ... but I always like to read pattern instructions so I can report on them. This is a good pattern for beginners and, well, anyone. And with so many sizes, it's also good for lots of bodies. As usual for me with HP, no FBA done or needed.I did deviate from the instructions for the waist elastic. I never sew a joining seam such as this at the same time as applying the elastic. Too fiddly. ;-) Instead, I sewed with a 5/8\" seam allowance (1 below), then used a narrow ZZ to sew the seam allowances together close to the raw edge (2 below), leaving an opening to insert the elastic. After the elastic is inserted, sized, and adjusted evenly inside the \"casing,\" I use a 3-step ZZ (3 below) while stretching the elastic and fabric flat, which holds the elastic in place and prevents it from twisting. The neckband is just a straight band, which works OK even for my more scooped neckline, but I think a shaped neckband (a la the Sunshine top) would be better. Next time, I will try a morph.The sleeves are also finished with straight bands, which adds a little more somethin' somethin' than just a hem.The bands work well here and I like the look.Now for the Giveaway announcement ... I asked Alex to pick a number and he chose 17, which is \"L\".L, please send your info to me at dcook100 at gmail dot com and the Primavera pattern will be on its way to you."},
{"title": "Driving Down That Good Intentions Paved Road", "date": "Friday, June 20, 2014", "text": "I really thought I'd be back earlier in the week to show my finished dress, but I ran into a speed bump on that road. More on it in a bit.As many of you guessed, the dress I'm making is indeed the Hot Patterns Uptown Downtown. As soon as I post this, I'm going to close comments on the last post and tomorrow announce a winner for this Hot Patterns dress (below), the Classix Nouveau Primavera. I ended up with two, one I bought and one which was gifted. So I'm paying forward the gifted copy, which is uncut, but the envelope has been opened and the little flap on the back with fabric details is smudged. But you can get that info from the HP website. So back to my current make ... The pattern goes together like a dream, but I cut and sewed the longest length for the bodice section and as soon as I sewed the seam, zigzagged a casing in the seam allowance, and threaded my elastic through, I decided it's too long and needs to be shortened. Yeah, I should've basted, and my (over)confidence did me in. The thought of ripping all that out of the fine rayon knit put the brakes on the project for these past weekday nights. But I've now been staring at it for DAYS (and wishing I could just wear the darn thing already) and I've decided I can lose the tiny bit of skirt length from the top after all so I'll just cut the zigzags away and then do a proper frog on the main joining seam. All of this will be done while plopped in front of the tube tonight and hopefully by the time I announce the giveaway winner tomorrow, I'll also finally have a finished dress to share. And speaking of Hot Patterns ... OMG ... after getting Trudy's teases on my phone for the last couple of days, I've just tonight seen the updated Pussycat. And. I. Want. This blouse is so me. I will definitely be saving my pennies for this one."},

I expect to finish it tonight, or mostly finish, but I need to take a break and get to the grocery store. I thought I'd post a sneak peak while I'm out and make a little \"contest\"/giveaway. I have a duplicate all-sizes (different) dress pattern from the same indie company as I'm currently sewing. So, if you guess what dress pattern (yes, dress) the above is, your name will be entered into the giveaway draw, winner to be announced next Saturday. I'll mail the pattern anywhere, so this is open to everyone. Once I post the finished dress and identify the pattern (tomorrow evening at the earliest), the contest will close.I spent some time yesterday organizing the sewing room a little more. I still have a LONG way to go! One of the things that was bugging me the most was not having my thread organized and handy so I got my thread racks hung and loaded. This reminded me of a little tip I picked up somewhere years and years ago, and I thought I'd share it here for anyone who hasn't heard it before. You'd think with FOUR thread racks, I wouldn't run out of space. Hah! While there are some empty spots at the moment, that's only because I haven't replaced some used up spools yet. Usually, it's bursting with spools. To make more space, get thee some plastic straws. Cut them about 4\" long and slice/cut them lengthwise. This slice lets the straw curl tighter to fit into the spool hole easier. Slide the straw onto a spoke on your rack and double or triple your storage-per-spoke, depending on spool height. Obviously, there are no strict rules here and you cut your straws to whatever length works best for you.Finally, here's a little peek into the \"new\" space. It's pretty tight in here even if it looks roomier than it is. The fabric is mess. Some rolled, some flat. All just stuck willy-nilly wherever in the cubbies. I thought I wanted it rolled, but have decided against that. The thought of getting it all organized makes my head hurt so I'm just dealing with it as is for now. There's also still more fabric in bins/boxes in various places throughout the house. It's a mess. Speaking of hanging stuff, have any of you used the Command hooks and/or Velcro-ish hanger thingies? Those things ROCK ... as long as everything doesn't come crashing down in a couple of months. ;-)"},

And that's the extent of the useable dog beach pics. It was way too  bright to see my shots on the camera screen so most were blurs or  shadows. But we all had a great time, photographic evidence notwithstanding.Yesterday, I dug out a spot in the disaster that is my sewing room. I've still got fabric and other crap from the move everywhere. Plus my sewing table won't make the turn into the room so it now has a spot on the back porch, disassembled, until I chuck it. Once I have a steady income again, I'm going to have to buy a foldable cutting table, like the one I used to have. And a big clothes rack. OMG. No closet space. Urgh. And no space for my ironing board so it's living in the hallway just outside the sewing room door. Anyway ... at the long-term temp job I've been working until something permanent happens, I've seen some ladies my general age and build rocking some shift dresses. Which is a style I like in theory, just usually not on me. But I noticed their dresses were synthenic drapey knits and the wheels started turning. And then stopped on some stashed ITY and Vogue 8805, which I made before from interlock and which was so ugly and unflattering, I tossed it before ever finishing. But I held onto the pattern. I hardly ever toss a pattern even if it has taken a walk to Wadderville. I suppose when I run low on pattern cabinet space, I might rethink that but until then ... I'm glad I gave it another go because I think I have a winner, even if I'm a bit late to the colorblocking party. The print hides lumps, the ITY skims me and shows shape instead of a sack silhouette, and the third fabric gives an unexpected accent and pop of color in all that brown. Pardon the beach hair and red face. Oh, the sacrifices I make in the name of blogging. ;-).And the back view ... which really is straight but hanging crooked for this pic. Of course. Keeping it real here at Stitches and Seams. :-)I scooped the neckline lower than the original pattern, eliminated the keyhole back opening, and then  trimmed off the seam allowances and bound it with a 3/8\"-A binder on my coverstitcher.Blurry close-up of third fabric inset.And one more gratuitous shot.

Thankfully, Tyler came down to help and one of Alex's real friends (we've known him since they were both 4 years old) busted his rear end for us.

I don't want to go into detail online but nothing ever made sense there and this is no big shock either. Whatever.

Hey, it's been COLD here. Really.The front and back pattern pieces I rubbed off. No seam allowances, of course, but I added them as I rotary cut the fabric.The sleeve pattern was adapted from my TNT Ottobre tee since it's impossible to lay a sewn sleeve flat and rub off a pattern. Well, probably not impossible, but certainly more fiddly time than I was willing to spend. All I did to adapt the sleeve pattern I had was to measure the armhole opening from the pieces above and add to the underarm seam of the TNT sleeve so they matched. Highly scientific.This is my TNT front bodice laid over the tracing to give you an idea of shape.All of the outside edges of the cardi are finished with bands. On the RTW cardi, they are knitted in, but in a different stitch (or something ... I don't knit) so they look like separate bands. When sewing, they had to actually be separate bands. I just measured the widths of the RTW bands and doubled that so I could fold in half for a finished edge, and then added seam allowances to the measurements. Then I measured around the outside pattern edges to figure the lengths needed for each section.I winged it for the sleeve cuffs. ;-) The neckline band is folded around the neck edge to create a shawl collar, and hand-stitched at the CB to hold it in place. This was done on the RTW cardi too.To construct, you sew the body together like any other knit top, including sleeves and sideseams. Then the bands are pressed in half RS out and added to the raw edges like this: The bottom band (green) first, then the front (blue) band, and lastly the neckline (pink) band. The bottom edge of the front (blue) band has to be finished and turned before sewing on the band, and the same for the front edges of the neckline (pink) band. And that's it. Really easy \"drafting\" and sewing."},
{"title": "SBCC Mimosa 2 - First Make of 2014", "date": "Sunday, January 5, 2014", "text": "There's not a lot to add to my first go at the Mimosa, except that the ties are certainly more visible for this version on their own. The pattern is a winner, but since it's definitely distinctive, I'm afraid I will need to let it rest a while. At least with this one, it's a neutral that should go with many things in all seasons. The fabric is an ivory rayon \"leftover\" from the stash, with a slight \"ribbed\" texture, which you can sort of see in the pic below. I love this fabric, but it's so drapey that it wiggles something awful to sew with and it wrinkles as soon as you look at it. (Which is making me think ... hmmm ... maybe I need a third one after all, in a synthetic blend.) I started this one on Wednesday like I had planned but because I had to sew very slowly and carefully due to the fabric acting like it was cut on the bias all around, I didn't finish it until today. I'm glad I took my time though, because it did turn out to be a lovely blouse.I cut the raglan shoulder dart with the exact alteration I showed a couple of posts ago and I'm happy to report that it's just right. No more poof ... even though it looks poofy here, but that's because Zillie is wearing a bra over shoulder pads to mimic my square shoulders and that combination creates dents.I made a self-fabric bias facing for the back neckline, which turned out nicely despite the wiggly fabric. I hemmed the sleeves and bottom with a machine blind hem stitch, which photographs horribly as in the first pic above, but it looks smooth and nearly invisible in real life. I suppose I could've done the hems by hand, but they likely wouldn't have turned out any better. Here's the sewing table after finishing today. I've got a bit of cleaning up to do and then I need to decide what's up next. I really want to sew a pattern from the stash, but there's another indie that's calling my name and it's really hard to tune it out. I'm trying to convince myself that instead of caving in right away, I'll \"reward\" myself with it after sewing at least two stashed patterns first. Wish me luck on that, and have a great week! Right now, it's time for Downton Abbey!"},
{"title": "My Top Fives", "date": "Wednesday, January 1, 2014", "text": "Hard to believe that during all these years blogging, I've never done a recap (it's true!). But because I've been enjoying everyone else's 2013 recaps popping up this week, I decided to spend way too much time gathering photos jump on Gillian's Top 5 bandwagaon too. Thanks Gillian and my sewing blogger friends for giving me the needed kick in the @ss push. If you've got a few hours you want to kill, click the link to Gillian's blog because it's the page where all the recappers have been posting links to their lists. I've already found a few new-to-me blogs. Fun!So, first up is a composite of I think everything I've made this year. I've had some ups and downs during 2013 which definitely directly affected the mojo, but after seeing it all and counting around 40-ish pieces, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course there were many, MANY more projects in my mind that haven't yet become reality, but that's what 2014 is for, right? (That's probably all of the \"Reflection\" you're going to get as I tend to not look backward.)Top 5 Hits - in no particular order1. Simplicity 2474. This simple top, which takes a mere 28\" of fabric, became a true wardrobe workhorse. It pairs with both my purple and black Magic Pencils. Even from Joann's Polly and Esther, it works all year round, by itself on the hottest days and under a cardi on the coldest. I'm definitely going to have to add one or two more of these during 2014.2. Frankenpattern top, using KS2694 to copy a fav RTW top. This, and the original RTW, are in regular rotation all the time. I have to fight the urge to wear them both to work each week. If I could have a uniform, this top in different prints and a coordinating Magic Pencil would be it. Another one I need to make again. 3. Self-drafted (term used loosely) skirt which was created from the ashes of a wadder dress and a Jalie 2806 top. This outfit had lots of wear during the summer. Bright and comfortable, and cheap! 4. I think this is my favorite make of 2013. It's a 2-piece dress using Butterick 5429 for the top and Simplicity 2185 for the skirt. I love the colors, the slinky fabric, the border print used at the waist hem to break it up, and the swish factor. I get compliments every time I wear this.5. Last, but not least, my latest project ... the Skinny Bitch Curvy Chick Mimosa. I've worn this once and already know it's going into high rotation status. I'm planning to start (and maybe finish?) another one Wednesday. Great \"sleeper\" pattern!Top 5 Misses - in no particular order1. McCall's 6397. Cute, right? Never worn. Not because I don't like it. But because first I needed something to wear under it. The blouse shown isn't comfortable. Now, alas, I've gained a few and the dress is too snug. It's still in my closet waiting for me to drop 10 (15?) and find an underlayer. As is the first summer version, which I wore ALL the time ... those 10-ish pounds ago.2. Vogue 8825. I tried this on and hated it on me. I dubbed it the tree trunk and thus it has never been worn. I swore I was trashing it that day. But I still want to love it somehow so it's been in a wadder ball in my sewing room for almost a year now. If nothing else, I'm going to rescue the fabric for something. I still love the style/pattern and am hoping it's just a bad fabric pairing. But fearing another weeping willow, I haven't yet tried it again.3. Right after the tree trunk, came this never worn, never even finished, wadder. Vogue 8805. Debbie, just step away from the shapeless shifts. But then Lara of Thornberry just made another, slightly redesigned and in a woven and now I'm tempted again ... for a summer weekend dress. Someone slap me. I also just realized this dress is still hanging (unfinished) in my laundry room. Come tomorrow, it will be GONE. 4. Butterick 5749. Never worn because it started out short and snug. Now it's longer after adding a hem band but snugger after adding some pounds. It kills me that I \"wasted\" this fabric. It's still hanging in my closet, waiting. Sigh. Because the dress is made from so may pieces, I can't even rescue the fabric. Bigger sigh.5. Butterick 5489. UFO, so never worn. I just kind of fell out of love with it before it was done. I may finish it. Or I may be distracted yet again but the next bright and shiny pattern. Who wants to place a bet?Honorable Mentions - in no particular order 1. Another Butterick 5429/Simplicity 2185 combo. This gets worn a lot. It's comfortable and I like the print. I need a color pop cardi so it can be added to the \"winter\" rotation. 2. Simplicity 3768. I've had this pattern for YEARS and finally decided to make the shorts and top from it. Both are winners. I LIVE in these shorts on the weekend. And the linen version gets worn often too.3. I started this Hot Patterns 1138 Metropolitan Verano right before I lost that job and it sat, haunting me. Once I picked myself up and finally finished it, it became a summer wardrobe staple. It's bright, comfortable, cute, and so easy to just slip on with sandals and run out the door. Perfect for Florida.4. The top from Simplicity 3768 also gets worn a lot. It's a rayon knit so it's comfortable and it's flattering even with the extra tummy I've got right now.5. The SBCC Tonic tee. While I still love my Ottobre TNT tee and won't be giving it up anytime soon, it was really nice to find this indie company and have succeess both with their patterns and with my email interactions with the owner/designer. I'm sure this tee will be added to the weekend rotation as soon as I do my laundry. One thing I've realized, I'm definitely lacking in new me-made casual items.Goals - in no particular order1. Keep blogging. This won't be hard. :-) Sometimes I'm light on the posts, but that's just the normal ebb and flow of life. I really enjoy this medium, sharing, and ... of course, the comments. You all are a GREAT group of people and I enjoy each and every one of you. Thank you sincerely for reading, for giving support and prayer when needed, and for having my back. 2. Speaking of comments ... one of my goals for the blog is to look into making it easier to reply to comments in order and actually do that. I know a lot of questions go unanswered and I do regret it. OK, sometimes the answers are more \"work\" than I feel like putting into an answer, but usually the questions are things I want to answer and can do so quickly. I want to get better at this.3. I'd really like to meet each of you, so if you're ever in the Tampa, Florida area and I'm available, let's do it! Renee, Barbara, Laura, Karen, Ronda, Andrea ... I'm looking at YOU.4.  Get into the sewing room during the week. This is directly related to the fact that I don't have a cable hook-up in there right now, as I hobbled it to the living room instead. It's been like this for a year now and I'm about out of excuses for not calling the cable company to come add an outlet. I really need background noise/dialog when I'm sewing. It helps now that I've re-upped my Amazon Prime subscription and can stream video and radio to my Kindle, but I would still like the big TV to be available so I can catch up on my shows while I sew. I'm just a multi-tasker at heart.5. Make a dent in the pattern stash. I'm so easily distracted by new patterns but I've got an amazing collection of \"old\" patterns that really deserve a chance too. I'm sure I'll keep buying, but I'm going to try really hard to make it a priority to hit the stash on a regular basis. Inspirations - again, in no particular orderCarolyn and Barbara had really good posts about keeping it real in the sewing blogger stratosphere and I'm down with that at heart. I mean all you need to do is look at my blog to believe that. Tripod and mirror shots reign supreme. While I'd actually love to have better, more \"artsy\" photos (the graphic artist in me cringes regularly at my own photos), the truth is it probably ain't gonna happen. It already takes a lot of time for the crappy pics and (hopefully not so crappy) content. At this point, I don't think I'm willing to put in even more time to step it up.That said, I love pretty much ALL sewing blogs. The shiny ones, the basic ones, the ones in between. As long as I get a feel for the writer, I'm in. My sidebar blogroll grows weekly, and I look at and enjoy them all. Truly.I don't intentionally want to leave anyone out but since this is a post of Fives, I'm going to close with 5 of my favorites. Five of the blogs I click on as soon as I see a new post. Know that there are many more than 5, but I'll leave it at 5 for now. Oh, scratch that! I just couldn't do it. I could NOT narrow it down to 5. I don't think I could narrow it down to even 25. So instead, I will say that every blog in my sidebar inspires me in many ways. From patterns and fabric, to giggles and warped senses of humor, family vacations, pickling fresh veggies, pet antics, new notions, vintage machines, Chelsea flea market finds, moose meat in Alaska, posing with strangers in London, fabric collections neatly folded on shelves in New Jersey, bike riding in Baltimore, grandkids, weddings, new sons and daughters, Me Made Mays, sewing dares, sew-alongs, hand-picked zips, Kasha linings, studded dresses, refashions, remodels, meet ups, husband comments, TNTs, What WAS I thinkings, prints, solids, faux leather, new shoes (especially new shoes), nailpolishes, new haircuts, Mood, Minerva, Chihuahuas on treadmills, designer knock-offs, Project Runway recaps, the pointing finger of the Pressanatrix, recipes, tutorials, honest opinions, velvet chef jackets, and EVERYTHING else in between. You all are The Best!Happy New Year! May the sewing gods and goddesses shine brightly on you in 2014!"},
{"title": "Modeled Mimosa", "date": "Monday, December 30, 2013", "text": "After 5 days off, I sure didn't want to get up when the alarm went off this morning but it was a little bit easier throwing off the covers knowing I had a new outfit to wear. Plus, I had to pee. TMI? Hahahaha ... sorry in advance for any young women reading, but the truth is once you're past a certain age, your bladder just doesn't let you sleep in. Isn't getting older grand?OK, not exactly how I planned to start this post, but once the thought came, it just wouldn't go away.So here's the OOTD. I really (as in REALLY!) like this top. So much so that I just might be popping out another one come Wednesday. The fit is perfect, with minimal alteration. The neckline is just right, both in shape and depth. The ties are adorable yet not too cutesy for a woman of my age (cough:29:cough). It's an easy sew. And the instant gratification PDF is very reasonably priced at $10.Here's the lowdown on the minimal alterations, besides the 1-1/2\" I added at the hem while cutting. Love that little arm thingie that slides onto my rotary cutter.1. Moved the bust dart downward. See age comments above. Nothing complicated here. I just drew a box around the dart, cut it out, slid it straight down, and filled in the empty space with tissue.2. Added 3/8\" at the shoulder-neckline point of the raglan sleeve. My bra straps were covered in the muslin, but I just felt I wanted a smidge more. The smidge added was the perfect amount.3. Fiddled with the raglan dart in the fabric, until I ended up with this new seamline you see in red below. I've had the poof problem with darted raglans before, so I'm definitely chalking this one up to my particular shoulders and not the pattern. For next time, the poof has been trimmed from the pattern so I should be able to just sew and go.Parting shot: This pic is for Barbara. A quick blurry and crooked mirror selfie in the messy sewing room after throwing on my black knit dog-walking pants. IOW, the real me. And yes, I love this top so much I left it on to walk the dogs. They were impressed.I sewed 4 items during my mini sewcation ... a SBCC Tonic tee, a pretty well sewn (vs. down and dirty since I was also testing construction) muslin for the SBCC Mimosa top, the final Mimosa, and a slightly modified Magic Pencil to wear with the Mimosa. My sewing plans are always grander than reality, but I'm good with 4 items over 5 days, especially considering I didn't spend every waking hour in the sewing room. The mojo is still whispering to me, so maybe I can pick back up mid-week when I'm off from work again for New Year's Day.Here's the final Mimosa with the Magic Pencil. The Mimosa is from a black/taupe crepe print from deep in the stash, which I thought was synthetic but after pressing the heck out of it without any heat damage, I'm reconsidering and may do a burn test on scraps just to quiet my curiosity. The Magic Pencil is from a putty colored doubleknit purchased from Lucy's Fabrics years ago. I miss that shop. (I added a bottom band instead of a turn-up hem, which is the slight modification.) I also have a short-sleeved jacket from this same fabric so I guess I have an actual suit now too. I really like this top. It's easy to sew, feminine, flattering, and comfortable to wear. Especially after too many holiday treats. ;-) The pattern is a winner, both for style and drafting. The only alterations I made were to move the bust dart down and to fiddle with the shoulder seam in the raglan sleeve to fit my square shoulders. Even with what I thought was an adequate pattern adjustment from the muslin, I still ended up with a poof at the shoulder and so I just sewed the poof out in the real fabric and will adjust my pattern to match, hopefully tomorrow night while it's still fresh in my mind the pattern is still laying on the floor. Oh, I also added about 1-1/2\" to the bottom length and kept it. I wanted this top a little longer in case I want to belt it. There's not a lot of waist shaping in the pattern, but with a drapey fabric such as this, it still hangs nicely. In fabric with more body, I might want to add back waist darts or curve the sideseams inward. Either of those is easy to do as a final step, so I won't alter the pattern. What drew me to the Mimosa was the tie coming from the raglan seams. And then I went and chose a fabric that completely obliterated this design feature. If I had been more forward thinking (i.e., before I had sewn, trimmed, and turned), I would've piped the ties. Instead, I used narrow purchased bias tubing from the stash. And now the ties are visible again.I used purchased black bias binding for the back neckline and sewed on the front facing last and different from the pattern instructions, so that the front raglan seams and bias are caught in the facing and covered. Hard to explain, but a little cleaner finish this way. Although a slightly bulkier finish too, so I'm still undecided on what I'll do next time. And, yes, there will be a next time. I really like this top!I'll share the minimal alterations on my pattern pieces next time."},
{"title": "Slow Start", "date": "Saturday, December 28, 2013", "text": "I have been sewing, just not as fast and constant as I want. I'm blaming Christmas dinner hangover. Ugh. I feel like I've gained 20 lbs this month. I haven't, but I haven't been very good either. I *know* what my New Year's resolution will be, and I don't even usually make resolutions. But I want to fit into ALL of my clothes again and now that I'm settled into my job, the pity party (read: food medication) is over.Wednesday night, Alex was whining (not really) that his purchased key lanyard had met its demise. I'm not sure exactly when he started wearing his keys around his neck, but whenever it was (probably at least as long as he's been driving), he's been doing it ever since. Having to put his keys in his pocket Thursday morning threw off his entire workday zen/balance. Overly dramatic much? Hahaha.So, sewing mom and stash to the rescue of course! Grosgrain ribbon? Check. Key fob hardware? Check. (Yes, really ... and I even have more.) Tag to disguise a mom-sewn item? Check.My choices for wide-ish grosgrain ribbon in the stash were limited. I needed one I could fold in half (for strength) and which was not entirely too girlie. This brown/aqua stripe fit the bill best. The unpressed ribbon is on the right below. Cutting the length of ribbon, pressing in half, and then stitching the halves together and over/through the hardware took all of about 10 minutes. 15 tops. A thread change and then sewing on the label cut from some old pair of jeans years ago took another 2-3 minutes.And that was the extent of my Thursday sewing. But all was right in Alex's world again as he left for work Friday morning. And he even likes this hardware better than the lame clip of the purchased version. So I call that a sewing win, even if it was only 20 minutes.Yesterday, having had success with the SBCC Tonic tee, I bought and downloaded the SBCC Mimosa top and muslined it. Both for fit and for construction testing.The 16 PDF pages for this top were also to be butted together when taped, instead of overlapping, but the \"missing bits\" of the pattern lines were easy enough to fill in where needed. Even though I did pay for this pattern vs. the free Tonic, I still didn't really mind filling in the lines since the butting up/taping is easier than trimming 2 sides and then overlapping sheets. In other words, this method was a lot faster and I think even more accurate in the long run. For the Mimosa, the separate pages/tiles of the PDF print-out were also numbered so there was no guessing as to what page went where if the printed pages happened to spit out of the printer out of order. Which they did with the Tonic. Ahem. My fault on that.Before I get into the fit of the muslin, I want to mention a few observations. First, if you look at the coral Mimosa from the SBCC website above, you should notice a back neck facing. It doesn't exist in the final pattern. Instead, there is a pattern piece for bias binding. I think this is better. But don't expect instructions for attaching it. As I mentioned with the Tonic, these are not learn-to-sew patterns. In fact, there's not even a cutting layout given. Which I actually like since I never follow suggested layouts anyway and it saves on printing output too. Grain and fold lines are marked as you'd expect, which is all that's really needed.The instructions are fine (with one semi-mistake, noted below) but they are in bitmap format instead of a vector PDF. If you don't know the difference, in layman's terms ... a bitmap is like a digital photograph where resolution (file size and pixels) counts, and if resolution is too low, you won't be able to print a clear (unpixelated) rendition. This is the case here. I hope the pattern designer is reading, because I want to suggest that she keep the instructions in the infinitely scaleable vector format and save as PDF, like the Tonic instructions, because the print-out as-is is only so-so. Readable, but blurry. And so easy to make perfect if staying with vectors.Onto the muslin. Overall, pretty darn good for a first muslin and the top looks like I expected from the SBCC website. I cut the same sizing as for the Tonic ... which was a straight XL for all of the front and back shoulders/neck/arms, then blending to XL+1/2\" for the back bodice starting below the armpits. I did not do an FBA and there is plenty of bust width/length for me. But the bust dart is pointing about 1-1/2\" too high for these non-perky girls. That's an easy fix and I've already box-cut around the dart and moved it down on the pattern to be ready for the real fabric today. I also cut the pattern the full length of the biggest size because the hem allowance is only 3/4\". I think I might want another 1\" and will cut the next one with that additional length to see. I anticipate that most of that will be used as hem allowance, since I prefer a deeper hem.While my bra straps are technically covered, the neck opening still feels a little wide over my shoulders. I added about 3/8\" to the width at each shoulder for the next make, and will show the altered pattern piece when I show the final fabric top. Lastly, as far as fit, the dart in the raglan sleeve poofed on me, because I didn't make a square shoulder alteration for the muslin. I've now done that for the next make (same pattern piece to be shown next time).The semi-mistake in the pattern that I mentioned above is the mark for where to place the ties. It's just not in the right place to allow for the seam allowance to attach the facing. (The sleeve notches don't match up to the bodice either, but that may be as designed ... IOW for identification only ... since you're never instructed to actually align the marks.) As long as you remember to ignore that mark for the ties and just place them lower with the seam allowance in mind, you'll be fine.Finally, I also think I may change up the sewing order and attach the front neck facing before I've attached the back bias but after joining the front raglan seams (did you follow that?), because as you can see in the 2 photos above, my joins are not exactly even. :-) I'm still thinking on this and probably won't make up my mind until I'm actually at the sewing machine with the real one.Which is where I'm headed now ..."},
{"title": "SBCC Tonic Tee", "date": "Thursday, December 26, 2013", "text": "This is my Christmas outfit. And my little photobomber. We were quite casual around here today. Hello wrinkled shorts. :-) What's all that green stuff, I hear you northerners asking. Why, that's grass and tropical plants. Hee hee. No White Christmas here. But then I'm guessing you also weren't dripping sweat as you pulled the Christmas ham from the oven. ;-)This is the fit of the Tonic, pretty much out of the \"envelope\" ... (pssst ... there's not really an envelope since it's a downloadable PDF). After deciding on size (more on that below), the only change that I made, and kept, was my square shoulder adjustment which I made before cutting the pattern. I also added 2 inches to the bottom length and 1 inch to the sleeve hem on paper, and then ended up cutting both off in the fabric after sewing the sideseams and trying on the tee. So, while at 5'5\" I'm not technically a true petite, I am a petite in the chest, shoulders, and armholes. Something I've known and usually have to adjust for in other patterns. Armholes are ALWAYS too low on me as drafted, but not this one! How nice. Also, no FBA was done or needed. The photobomber strikes again.The sewing instructions are simple/easy but really good and very nicely illustrated. Some PR reviewers commented that there is no instruction to stabilize the shoulder seams, but this is NOT a teach-you-to-sew pattern so I'm OK with that. Besides, I don't stabilize every shoulder seam I sew anyway. It depends on the fabric. (I did use Design Plus on these shoulders.)(Mini rant ahead.) I'm of the opinion that you if you're serious about your sewing projects, you should be serious about educating yourself. In other words, reference books either purchased or borrowed from the library, videos, classes, sewing friends with a little more experience, and even free blogs and YouTube. Yes, it's nice when you learn something new from a pattern or blog but I don't expect to learn it all from one place at one time and I always give myself permission to use a different method than a pattern instructs if I know what works better for me or something just isn't making sense. Just jumping in as a newb to start is great, but after dipping your toe, knowledge is power. I feel empowered and much more confident when I've equipped myself with information before I start a project. So, back to the pattern. The only quibbles I have is with the print-out of the pattern. I'm really glad I read the PR reviews first, because I probably would not have caught that the individual sheets are to be butted up against each other instead of overlapped as with most other PDF patterns. But since most home printers don't print to the absolute edge of the page, some of the pattern lines go missing. On this simple (and FREE) tee, it didn't bother me at all. But I'm not sure if I would feel quite the same on a more detailed pattern. I think it really would depend on how the layout landed on the page tiles. But on the other hand, I LOVED not trimming the pages and overlapping before taping. This pattern printed in 16 pages and I had it off my printer and taped in 30 minutes or less. Once I had it taped together, I got out my TNT Ottobre tee, which has been my Holy Grail of tees and tee morphs for years now. My Ottobre is NOT from a straight tracing out of the magazine. The pattern was a good foundation but there was also some finessing to get it to Holy Grail status. So, to see how similar the Tonic was hot off the printer was a very nice surprise. And a little bit of a shock. ;-) I traced a straight XL (from the Curvy Chick side of the size range) for the front. For the back, I blended from XL at neck/shoulder/armhole to XL + 1/2\" at the hips. The 1/2\" is pretty much right in the middle of the XL and 1X, and was where my TNT \"told\" me to blend. The waist shaping of the Tonic lined up well with my Ottobre, which told me the SBCC petite body length would work for me. As I mentioned above, I added 2\" to the bottom which I ended up cutting off. But I always cut my tees too long because I want the insurance I'm too lazy to just measure. Even my TNT pattern has the extra length on it, as you can see above.Overall verdict: Winner winner chicken dinner! It fits great out of the envelope, nice instructions, and it was free!! What more could you ask for? Oh, the link, you say? Well, here it is again: SBCC Tonic Tee Before I sign off for some sleep before starting my woooSEWCATIONwooo tomorrow, here are a couple of tips for sewing the neckband of this tee (and others, as applicable):The pattern comes with a piece for the neckband, to be folded in half WS together and pressed flat. It is intentionally longer than the actual neck hole. You are instructed to leave one shoulder seam open so you can apply the neckband in the flat. (I don't mind the minimal extra bulk at the last-sewn shoulder seam. I do this all the time when using my CS binder.) You are also instructed to gently stretch the neckband around the tighter curves of the neck opening. This is all well and fine. But what if you don't know how your neckband fabric is going to behave?Well, get out the pins!Put the tee on your sewing table, not your lap, so you can work flat and eliminate fabric dragging down with gravity. Leave a little \"grabber\" end and then start with one pin at the open front shoulder. (If you leave the right shoulder open, when you sew on the neckband you'll be sewing the already-sewn/serged left shoulder seam allowance to the back naturally as you go over it, instead of trying to wrestle that seam allowance and the neckband at the same time.) Then work your way around the neck opening 1-2\" at a time, gently stretching the neckband as you go. Don't stretch enough to create actual gathers and curls in the tee fabric, but only enough to create gentle waves.Now here is the scandalous part. Leave the pins in and SEW OVER THEM. Sew from the top so you can see the neckband and keep your stitching even on it so you'll end up with an even band, and just sew S-L-O-W-L-Y and steady, leaving the needle down if you need to adjust as you go. I guarantee that as long as you are sewing slowly and steadily, your needle will not hit a pin and instead it will work its way around a pin to find the fabric, just like it's actually engineered to do. You only break needles when sewing over pins at Danica Patrick speed.Below, you can see the backside with my stitching ... and the pins still in place. I practice what I preach. ;-) Most of the time I don't use this many pins but the print is a poly knit and the neck band is rayon/Lycra and they just weren't behaving nicely together. It's a lot faster to just pin the suckers down than to fight with them on the sewing machine, so sometimes I do actually use a crap-ton of pins. As with most everything in sewing, it just depends.Another tip ... leave the tails at the beginning and end until you've sewn the second shoulder seam. It will give you something to hold onto when starting or ending the seam.Final tip of the night ... press the seam allowances to the tee with steam and then lay your clapper on the front neckband until it cools to create a shape memory in the fabric (before topstitching or edgestitching). If you don 't have a clapper, something heavy but porous over a press cloth works too. It has to be porous so it can absorb the steam/moisture.And, t-t-t-t-hat's all folks. Good night!"},

Wish granted. :-)Yep, our office is officially closed until Monday. Can I get a woohoooooo?Our \"deal\" was that instead of leaving early on Christmas Eve (today), we'd have the Thursday and Friday afterward off. (Personally, I love that deal!) But someone must've dipped into the Elf Juice early because at 10:00 a.m., word came around that the office was now closed and we could go home until Monday. Can I get another woohoooooo?So, what's a sewing girl with some extra Christmas bonus cash to do? Well, I thought about stopping in at Joann's ... I do need those buttons to cover to finish Ms. Moneypenny ... but I quickly put that store out of my mind since it's right across the street from the Mall ... a place I strive to avoid most of the time anyway, but especially in December, and ALWAYS on December 24. Ms. Moneypenny will have to wait a little longer.And then I remembered a free pattern download I wanted to try before I buy a for-sale pattern. Enter the Skinny B*tch Curvy Chick Tonic Tee (hey, I didn't name the company and really, I'm not offended at all, but some of you may be, hence the asterisk).I really like the Mimosa but since there's a free tester and I have some free time, I thought I'd give the Tonic a whirl first. Then I'll feel better about parting with some cash (and tape) for the Mimosa.I'll let you know what I think ... but I have to mention that before even starting, I had a little problem with downloading and Betsy, the designer/owner of SBCC, answered my email within an hour. And on Christmas Eve! Nice! I've since printed and taped the PDF pattern and have my TNT laid on top. It looks very promising.Merry Christmas everyone! I hope Santa brings you everything on your list.I might be doing a little online fabric browsing shopping tonight while Rudolph makes his rounds."},

Seriously, it was 39 this morning. (Do you think I can convince Peter to put ME on his Coatmas list??) The good thing (if there is a good thing about 39 degrees in Florida) is that it quickly warms up to the 70s/80s during the day. It will warm up again by next week but we'll still have a few weeks of cold coming in January/February. That's about all I can take of \"winter\" anymore. Twenty-five years in the Sunshine State has me spoiled.I remembered to check my camera this time and it looks like I'm in focus again.Yay! Even I was getting tired of that blurry pic from the last post being what I saw here. It was just a silly dial that I must've nudged inadvertently which threw off the camera's focus setting. Silly, maybe, but oh-so-important.I'm finally wearing the turquoise Sophia knit skirt I made last month, using ol' standby KS3287. Love this pattern!  I even had an unsolicitation from one of the partners today. Gotta love those. This week Zillie is wearing an in-progress Hot Patterns Miss Moneypenny. You may think my camera is acting up again, but this time it's the fabric. It's a dotty satin which photographs like crap from a distance.I started it this past weekend and still have hems and buttons/buttonholes to do. I'm thinking covered buttons, which means a trip to Joann's, which means waiting for payday (tomorrow). This is the fabric close up.And this is what it looks like a little farther away. I'm not sure if I like all that shine, but I'll probably wear a cardi or jacket over it, so the shine will be toned down somewhat.This is the pattern. Hot Patterns has it on clearance right now for $7.95. Go buy it here before it's too late! I promise I am NOT being paid or otherwise compensated for saying this. I bought my own copy a couple of years ago, and reviewed it on PR here, with links to photos that show alterations, etc. It's one of HP's earlier releases so the instructions are a little bit obtuse and/or quirky in spots and they are not illustrated, but the pattern itself goes together nicely with few alterations even accounting for any quiggles I noted in my PR review. But the bottom line is it's a flattering and feminine vintage style with a modern edge, which I think has staying power in most office wardrobes. Have I convinced you yet? ;-) Hurry up before it's gone forever."},

{"title": "CJ Patterns #426 Princess Wrap - As a 2-Piece Dress", "date": "Tuesday, December 3, 2013", "text": "The CJ Princess Wrap top is done, along with a modified Magic Pencil skirt to make a 2-piece \"dress.\" I don't have any FBA instructions or pics for the top since I didn't need/make one. In fact, the only alterations I made were (1) square shoulders and (2) adding about 2\" of length at the hemline. Style changes were binding the neckline with a binder on my CS machine instead of turning under and topstitching per the instructions, and to lengthen the short sleeve to 3/4 length. There is a long sleeve pattern piece, but since the short sleeve was already cut, I just used it and cut the fabric longer. (More on the pattern and sizing below.)In the pics above and below, you can better see the gathered wrap and the bound neckline.The Magic Pencil skirt was modified to a flippy-er and more A-line shape per a Neue Mode pattern made earlier (I'm too lazy to link to that post right now ... maybe later) and incorporating modest side slits.CJ's sizing is different from other patterns, since she sizes for UNwashed natural fiber knits and expects some shrinkage. I don't particularly like this, especially since I was using a non-shrinking poly knit (a matte jersey from Fabric.com bought a couple of years ago), but CJ does include lots of sizing information on the instruction sheets which makes it easier to pick a starting size based on your ease preferences and fabric choice. If you're unsure, take the time to make a \"down and dirty\" knit muslin ... or at least don't use your best fabric the first time. For me, I had already made this top (altered bigger beyond the pattern back then) and still actually have it so I could try it on for a better idea of my current size. Plus, I have a lot more fitting experience since I first bought the pattern and a TNT tee pattern to compare with. Both of those, plus the excellent sizing tips included in the instructions, certainly eliminated any outright guessing.Below, is the hint sheet for what to do when you're between sizes.And this is a close-up of the finished garment measurements sheet. Since the *finished* bust measurements of the size LG are just about my true full bust measurement and I knew I didn't want extreme negative ease in this top, I traced between the LG and XL for the vertical seams and it worked out perfectly. You can also see that the finished bust measurement for this top is inches bigger than the hip measurement in all sizes, which to me means that this pattern is geared toward the busty. A good thing for me and it meant no FBA was needed (even on my first make when I was bustier). Sorry that I don't have any real help for you on a FBA Rebecca Grace ... but since it has princess seams, if I needed an FBA, I would just distribute additional fabric needed among those seams and  panels.This is the whole sheet showing finished measurements for all of the patterns CJ was selling at the time I bought this one (years and years ago). There have been patterns released since I bought this pattern so I'm not sure if the paper measurement sheet has been updated to include all of those too. But all patterns are included in a PDF download from the website, here.In addition to all the measurements and sizing tips, there's also a section that explains the ease in CJ patterns, which I think is extremely helpful for accurate sizing choices.The actual sewing of the pattern is a breeze. It's drafted beautifully, with notches where they should be and which match up perfectly. The sleeve fits the armhole with no easing. The neckline sits in a nice spot, not too low. The shoulders stay a normal length vs. linebacker in the larger sizes. The instructions are good and well-illustrated.The only complaint I have about the actual pattern pieces is that they're drafted with 5/8\" seam allowances everywhere. This is OK for fitting insurance on the vertical seams, but too wide for sewing in a knit sleeve without tons of pins and/or adjusting fabric every few inches. I've already noted on the pattern to trim those seam allowances down to 3/8\". I may even get a wild hair and trim them before I put the pattern away. ;-)And a semi-complaint is the neckline finishing instructions, but a complaint only on behalf of others. Turning under and topstitching is OK if your fabric is not prewashed and will shrink. But if it's been through the laundry or is a non-shrinking synthetic, you're probably going to need some sort of stablizer/elastic with such a long wrapline in order to prevent gaping. (My CS binding utilizes a differential feed to eliminate a saggy neckline.) An experienced sewer will know this. A beginner may not. But then, while this pattern is easy to construct, I don't think it's necessarily actually aimed at true beginners. That's not to say a beginner shouldn't try it. Just that they may need additional techniques in their sewing arsenal. I'm already thinking about trying the other top in this pattern, and wishing I had gone ahead and ordered one or two others during the sale. I forgot how much I liked this pattern."},

Stopped by the grocery store for a few things NOT Turkey Day related, and then came home to clean up the house before Tyler's arrival. Vacuumed the family room, the kitchen (pre-mop), the living/dining rooms (barely, since no one ever goes in there), my bedroom, and finally ... the sewing room, which was in dire need what with the layer of thread (and pins ... oops) covering the carpet. While in there, I made my way with the vacuum into the corner with the mirror, where I had laid down a pattern (which shall remain nameless) to deal with putting away later. As I bent over to lift it  up so I could vacuum under it, I spied the corner of another pattern. \"Hmmm ... what is that?\" I wondered. You know what's coming, right?Shuffle, shuffle ...... the missing Christine Jonson wrap top.Yay!!! Geez ... getting old is rough. Not only did I \"lose\" the pattern for a bit (which I have NEVER done before), but I have no memory whatsoever of taking it out, pressing it flat, and then apparently laying it aside on the floor. But at least I found the pattern BEFORE I ended up ordering it again, which would've been today during the last day of the sale, even if somewhere along the way I seem to have misplaced my brain. (BTW, you can order CJ Patterns from Pattern Review and they will ship internationally. I'm thinking CJ will also ship internationally since the PR sales ship direct from CJ. Maybe worth another inquiry if you're interested.)Thanksgiving yesterday was fun. Tyler arrived around 8:30 Wednesday night, with (surprise!) another Marine. By Thursday morning, he had (surprise!) another friend here too. Around noon, two of Alex's friends showed up (not a surprise). We pretty much doubled our expected eaters since Tyler himself was last-minute. And even though I actually reduced my usual quantity of food bought and prepared, we STILL had a TON to eat and now a TON of leftovers in the fridge. (But I do love me a turkey sandwich.)Tyler, friend, and Alex are taking off for my stepson Michael's over in St. Augustine tonight for a night of barhopping and whatever 3 brothers do (I intentionally don't ask for details), with Alex returning home tomorrow night sometime and Tyler/friend going northward back to base. Which means I will have a day alone for just me and the CJ Wrap. Hoping the mojo stays hungry ... we have patterns and turkey to get through. And pie. ;-)Parting shot - As promised, the HP top and the (wrinkled from being at a desk all day) KS skirt after work this past Tuesday."},
{"title": "Skirt and Top - aka Useful Basics", "date": "Sunday, November 24, 2013", "text": "This is the skirt I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. It sat on Zillie waiting for its mate, which I finally provided today. I made the skirt (KS3287) many times before, but in a larger size. This was one of those times I'm glad I traced the pattern, because I ended up needing to trace again but 2 sizes down. I love this skirt for the flippy shape but easy knit wear and construction. I will probably still be making this skirt when I'm 80.  :-) This one is from a yard (less, really) of turquoise Sophia knit purchased from Fabric.com a couple of months ago. Sophia wears like iron. The top is the Hot Patterns Metroplitan Tie Me Down top, made from a Fabric.com ITY knit purchased to go with the solid Sophia. It's another I've made before and another I needed to retrace smaller. (Not complaining.) HP's sizing is consistent, I think, after having made a number of them but the actual sizing definitely doesn't match the measurements given on the back of the envelope. I made a straight 14 (no alterations) but per the envelope should use at least an 18. That's a GI-normous amount of ease. So, what I'm saying is ignore the envelope and use your tape measure on the pattern pieces themselves. And your common sense. And heed HP's advice to muslin if you're still unsure. This sizing is good news for those at the upper end of the HP measurement chart but probably not so good for the smallest ladies if the smaller sizes have similar ease. (I can't speak to the men's patterns.)The patterns.The shoulders are gathered into the seam and also shirred with 3 rows of elastic cord. The cap sleeves are gathered to the armhole at the top. Sorry for the blurry pic. :-(The back waist, is also shirred with one row of elastic cording which provides nice but subtle shaping.I used my cording foot and a narrow zig zag stitch. The cording foot holds the cord in place perfectly so there's no worry about stitching through the cord. You only have to keep your eyes on your sewing path. (These pics are from a years-ago project and part of a PR review here, in which you'll find more shirring details if you're curious.)This is how much elastic cord I had left over. Whew! The HP pattern calls for facings to hold the tie in place and finish the neck edge. I used the facings on my previous make of the top and they were fine, since they are shaped and get sewn into the sleeves which eliminates facing floppage, but I really like to eliminate facings whenever possible. For this make, I \"stole\" the brilliant instructions from Jalie's Scarf Collar top. You can download the instructions as a PDF from Jalie here.Is it me, or does anyone else think the model in the solid knit is either Tasia from Sewaholic or her long-lost twin sister?The infamous Jalie \"burrito\" but using the HP instead. Hard to believe a whole top plus ties are in there, right?The only pattern modification I made to the HP was to widen the bottom of the ties and point them. While I don't have the too-big first make anymore, I did make a note on the pattern that the ties as drafted were on the skimpy side. I'm glad I widened them. I like the added width much better. I'm not sure if I'm wearing this outfit tomorrow, but when I do, I'll get a pic of me in it."},

Also apparent is that I don't know what I'm doing in the sewing room or when printing PDFs, and that everything I found wrong (or disagreed with) is 100% my fault. I *do* know this isn't the best example of customer service/vendor response I've seen and that I won't be buying anymore from this company. I hope you have a better experience.(I have no idea about the reference to something I \"took down.\" Every post on this pattern remains in public view.)Edited 11-20-13: I see today that StephC has now deleted all her comments from this post (which you can see the remnants of below), so I'm adding them back here because I think they belong as part of this original posting.============================================ StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Well, you spent an entire week laboring away at posts about how much you dislike my work, I considered it necessary to respond in some form. I chose to respond kindly and with actual knowledge/evidence to address your issues. I think that's pretty decent of me, and useful. I'm pleased you made this post, it means we get a chance to chat publicly about this, which is great.You don't know more than me about sewing. I have been sewing at least twice as long as you have, and my exposure is wider. I don't see why I should ignore what you wrote. You were very obviously and deliberately calling me out, personally, however much you cloaked it in concern for the community and addressed me as \"indie pattern designers.\" My name is Steph, pleased to meet you, Debbie.If you care about the community, I suggest you find a way to fix pattern sizing and start a company of your own. Why not?When I first read your posts (a week after they were published), I was *devastated* because I had in my head you were a sewing teacher. All I could think of was \"How could I completely miss the mark with a teacher?\" Much of the way I approach the work has to do with making the sewing accessible, to create the simplest/best sewing experience for relatively new sewists, based on continual observations in the classroom. Then I realized you weren't a teacher and that your criticisms were either :1)difference of opinion (not a big deal, but please don't act like your opinion is gospel because I'll roll my eyes super hard. Circular neckline binding is hard for beginners/ints to handle so it's symmetrical, and it’s boring to me to write and teach binding again. Facings open up greater design options, when executed well).2)lack of understanding about the process (we nested the bodices at first because it's cheaper to print, and rejected it because it was cluttered and crazy looking and difficult. We opted for clarity, even though it's more expensive to print and ship.)3)your lack of skill. I'm sorry, your neckline gaped because you didn't follow the instructions. That's all. I am not trying to put you down, I am not taking out a bad day on you, and I did you the human courtesy of addressing you directly here. It is a simple statement of fact that the neckline gaped because you handled it poorly. That's not my fault.Anyway I figured I could address some of your issues, through knowledge and explanation of techniques.I am not unreasonable, I am not unkind, I am *excellent* at customer service, thankyouverymuch. Had you written me a *word* of an email, a whisper of an Etsy conversation, a tweet, ANYthing, I would have been right there to help you out with your concerns. You did not. Instead, you chose to do what you did here on your blog. That is fine and is your choice. I am helpful, I am good at what I do, I turn myself inside out to teach great sewing practices and get people making things, and I answer my customer service emails swiftly. If you expect me to be obsequious on top of that, too bad. Instead, you chose to do what you did without any notification to me. Somehow I'm a jerk? No way, friend. I don't mind criticism, I don't mind being disagreed with. Check out pretty much *anything* I've ever written. Criticism makes the work better, and anyone who doesn't understand that is a nitwit. It was laughable what you wrote about owning up to mistakes. I do that, I have done it several times. But here, I did not do anything except *gasp* defend myself in fairly mild terms. Is it also offensive that I have the temerity to say I know more about the way sewing/machines/stitches/sewists work than you do, after having taught hundreds upon hundreds of women to sew? I *can* say that, I earned it.I am really happy to keep discussing but we're going to have a conversation like grown women, I’m not a catty girl who moons bitterly over sour grapes.

There are many ways to do this. To declare there is only one way, or one best way, or only one way to teach beginners this concept is ridiculous and doing those beginners a disservice.\"Absolutely. I could not agree more, and this is precisely my point. One of several. I teach beginners a certain way because I do it a lot. I know what tends to click easiest. Then, once we've built a basic skill set, we can diverge into finding the best options for the individual. But we have to start some place. :) Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 7:35 PM, November 17, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": But Rachel, I don't see how I was rude here.

Was it my use of italics? I can tone that down, for sure. Instead, I see that I stood up for my work. I am not Burda, I am not Vogue, I am a person who cares about good and useful sewing who also makes patterns.Why is it offensive that I address issues that arise, publicly when called for? I don't mind someone disagreeing with me, I rather like it, but there were things written here that needed to be addressed because they are either differences of opinion or untrue. I answered clearly and in the place where the issues were brought up. I did not choose to respond with a snippy series of blog posts or conjecture or personal attacks, but with demonstrations of solid sewing tecniques.Is this not one of the criticisms against other pattern companies, that they are out of touch? That their techniques don't work? That learning to sew has such a huge steep learning curve thanks to the badly written/made big 4 patterns that it completely turns off excited new sewists? I am not saying my methods and patterns are perfect, nothing is perfect, but I constantly strive to do better and I've been making patterns for *a year*. Give me five or ten and let's see how we can improve things to make sewing a viable part of 21st century living. That's what I'm saying.

Barbies? Are we being ageist? I didn't go there, and I don't see how it is relevant to the discussion.No, I don't always do what the customer tells me to do. Yes, that does upset people sometimes. That is a far cry from not caring about my customers. No customer service has 100% satisfaction, but I resent being told I don't care about my customers. Me engaging publicly with criticisms and untruths about my work is me caring, especially when I can back up my words/opinions with actual solid sewing techniques and content I created. This is not me being \"up myself,\" though I can understand why it might come across as such to someone unfamiliar with the work I do, especially with a headline like this one. Fair enough. I assure you, I don't waste brain cells on sour grapes. I'm also curious what the grapes are in this particular scenario? That's unclear to me.I haven't attacked anyone personally, I have been clear, direct, intelligent and occasionally used capital letters/italics. I am respectfully standing up for myself and for good work I believe in. I am engaging the community. Isn't that what we want from pattern makers, the thing that is not much done? Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 9:42 PM, November 17, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Hey Katie-I see your point, absolutely. The thing is, I'm not corporate. I never will be. I'm indie. Along with being indie is the right/responsibility to seek out authenticity, to experiment, to change, to grow, to respond. And to have an opinion.I have thought about it, quite a lot, about indie v corporate and what that means. I came to the conclusion that I can't ride two horses at the same time. I can not talk corporate and be indie. It is not going to work. I figure if I can back up my words with deeds (or in-depth technique videos) and engage honestly and openly, then that's what I would do.I think I made a mistake earlier on in trying too hard to \"sound\" corporate, because it's not what I am. Trying too hard to be something I'm not was blocking me every time I turned around, as an artist and an educator. I was trying to do things \"by the book.\" But the thing is, there is not a book for this, for what we're doing. So I choose to engage as a human being, extending the benefit of the doubt as much as possible and never responding to things in anger. Because I am a human being and because y'all are too. Respect.Twitter is a cheeky, rough and tumble place. If I can't have a sense of humor about things like this on Twitter, then when can I?

Technically, my business is registered as a Sole Trader and not a corporation.

I think I come off a little snotty here between the colorful title Debbie chose (seriously, what are the grapes?) and my refusal to stoop to anonymous personal attacks. That's unfortunate but unavoidable, given the circumstances. I agree with you that it's important to build trust and a relationship with one's students. That's what I do, in the classroom and online. I take my students' sewing seriously and go to great effort to do everything in my power to respond thoughtfully to emails, Etsy messages, Flickr comments, sewingcake comments, facebook and twitter, even when that means I sit in front of the computer typing for hours on end. I skype to sort out sewing issues, too. That is why I was surprised by such a concentrated blogging effort on Debbie's part, and the fact my customer service has been called into question. I am not yet able to read minds, unfortunately. If I had had an email, a word, I would have been right there to sort out the issues and check things, to be kind and helpful and responsive. But I was never extended any such opportunity and had to see my work unfairly criticized before the ink had even dried. Fair enough, but there were several things mentioned that are not actual issues on the pattern. Really, truly, I don't do sarcasm. It's a nasty, mean little beast that terrifies me and translates weirdly from America to Australia so I gave it up a while ago. (These aussies' sarcasm is one a whole other plane and I just can't keep up so I opt out...:)) I honestly like Debbie's dresses and think they turned out beautifully well in both instances. Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 11:45 PM, November 17, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Hey Jennifer-My comments were useful, they are linked to content that will help improve the sewing. If someone left me those comments, I'd check it out and see what was what. I can admit when I don't know something, and do on a regular basis. I might even tweet out or feature good tutorials that improve the sewing, because the sewing is what matters to me.But I don't think I've ever had a comment like that before, to be honest, because I don't spend weeks at a time blogging non-stop about how much I hate a particular thing. I focus on building up and spotlighting positive things.I'm curious if you checked out my investigation of straight v knit stitch? I approached it with an open mind, not hiding what I was doing, and clearly showing the results. I also said repeatedly that you have to do what works for you in your sewing room. I say that all the time, repeatedly, and it's also written into most of what I publish. I don't see myself as a dictator or whatever, I see my role as a facilitator and I take that seriously. And I'm protective about my new sewists. I don't mind if you use straight and like it, it's your sewing and your sewing room. It's not wrong. But in the majority of cases, it's not right either. That's what I'm getting at. :) Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 11:51 PM, November 17, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Thanks, Audrey. Maybe just maybe we can get a group hug in sometime. ;) Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 12:20 AM, November 18, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Hey Unknown- Yeah, the thing is, I'm not in an ivory tower, I'm being forcibly locked in one and I'm standing at the top of it hollering bloody murder out the window that I don't have the slightest desire to be there. But I guess all you hear is the shouting.... Debbie taught me to put in fly zips and I held her in extremely high regard for many years, directing people to her excellent tutorial at every opportunity and raving about the quality of her teaching. Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 12:23 AM, November 18, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Hey Diana-I... Didn't say anything of the sort. I actually said (and sincerely meant) that I like the dresses, they're great and I have learned techniques here in the past. I never blamed Debbie for any kind of sloppiness. The fact is that her reporting of the \"errata\" was inaccurate. I have a right to point that out. There's plenty of people from a variety of age groups who sew Cake. It's lovely, and this kind of kerfuffle doesn't happen. I am at a loss about why this keeps becoming an issue of age, am I really so threatening? Why is that?OH! Hamster power! I love it! Mine was too, a very temperamental but solid Kenmore thing in a \"harvest wheat\" kind of color... :) I wonder what happened to it... Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 12:41 AM, November 18, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Sure I do, and I appreciate your concern. *They* are also concerned and wish I would learn to keep my fool mouth shut and told me so. Flip is not indeed my intent, I'm quite open to a constructive and clear dialog, and I knew by posting I'd get the chance to chat about things. I think it's likely a communication style issue, that's kind of you. I tend to call a spade a spade and get on with life, and yes, I know that gets me misunderstood sometimes. I definitely could have phrased my comments that were posted above in a softer way, absolutely. At least I didn't threaten anyone, right? :)I didn't say never! :) Not at all, that's the thing.... If it works for you do it. But- it's not really a good default, it's not safe. I like to play it safe for my newbies, I figure ints-advanced can and will do exactly as they please, but if I beginner tries to sew something and it falls apart, she may well walk away from sewing forever and that's the part that bothers me. I've seen/heard it happen too often, and to be perfectly honest it's why I'm doing what I'm doing. To get people to love the sewing, and not fear it.I didn't want to start a pattern company, fwiw, I did it because I saw a galling gap between the types of clothes people wear and the ones we're offered to stitch. (No, I don't think all other patterns are bad, that's not what I'm saying..But there *is* a definite yawning gap.) I did it because people kept telling me I should. I did it to keep busy. I did it because I figured I could make a difference in sewing rooms and stoke the fires of the 21st century sewing revival. I did it because I have devoted hours and hours of my life to \"translating\" poor instructions for people in classes as I taught them the art of pattern surgery. People get to thinking that sewing is a really really hard thing to learn, some kind of almost magical skill and it's not. The learning curve is really steep at the beginning due to the way 20th century sewing is set up, and I don't think it has to be. Sewing is a skill that a LOT of people put to use for thousands of years, and it's joy. Like cooking, really. Everyone eats, everyone wears clothes.I did not start Cake because I'm an ego-maniac or a starry eyed idealist or an ivory-tower dweller or a jerk or whatever may be thought of me.It's far too much hard work to keep going with only that as a motivator. :) Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 3:15 AM, November 18, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Well, I didn't see that as a remark on age but on experience in a particular field, but ok, I see what you mean. I did not mean \"shut up, I'm better\" at all. I did very much mean \"if you sew it this way, your neckline won't gape.\" Because... It won't. Like you said I said, I respect the work Debbie has done especially in the area of fly fronts. I can't tell you how many newbs I sent there over the years. Like a little child? Point taken. How should I respond in the future to a similar situation, so as not to be so childish? Not responding at all doesn't work for me. Is it the italics and the capital letters? I am not being sarcastic, I want to know. Posted by StephC to Stitches and Seams at 4:06 AM, November 18, 2013  ***StephC has left a new comment on your post \"Sour Grapes?\": Fourkid- I am so humbled that you took the time to craft those responses. Thank you. I *do* want to track down all the bugs. They annoy the living daylights out of me because they get in the way of the sewing. I brought an editor on board.When I saw the errata posted here I was sick about it and assumed Debbie was right. Because why wouldn't she be? I dropped everything I was doing to go check, only to find next to nothing, and to see my customers worrying and upset themselves here unnecessarily.There *is* a small difference between the midriff and the bodice, but it is less than a seam allowance. I checked the pattern when I saw the post, and found nothing like what was mentioned except a 4mm difference in the bodice lengths when laid out end to end as she did. When cut, this is not a huge difference and not when the pieces are laid on top of each other for seaming.I knew the pattern would be alright when it arrived and hoped no one dumped RV in the bin without opening her up. Besides, I'd been advised to let this alone.I'm learning what you mean about fast response off the cuff, and will go to bed and then go work. Thank you again for the wording suggestions.

I'm proud of and thankful for you all, but especially to my son, Tyler, currently a corporal in the Corps and who re-enlisted a few weeks ago for another 4. Ooorah!Next, I know you've all been on the edges of your seats waiting to see what I finally paired with the dress. cough:cough(Don't know why it's so blurry. I must've knocked some setting on my camera without realizing it and since I've already changed to loungewear, this is going to be as good as it gets today!) As you can see, nothing exciting here ... just a RTW cami I pulled from my closet. It's actually a light ivory, but seems to blend in just fine with the white of the print. Right now, it's still warm here so bare arms and legs were just fine today and give me a while longer to decide what to do for a warmer layer. I like the dress a lot. It's comfortable to wear. I love the print. And I LOVE the pockets!Yesterday was my sewing mojo day. I pulled out this oldie-but-goodie Kwik Sew and, after retracing a smaller size, whipped up a teal Sophia knit skirt. The pics I quickly took last night are ick. I'll get another one soon. Plus, I really want to make a top to go with it, so you'll probably get a whole outfit post after that's done.I started the day with a trip to Joann's for elastic. I also knew there was a Simplicity sale. I haven't bought a Simplicity pattern in ages because I haven't been to Joann's in ages and, really, it's just easier to shop online at BMV during their sales (I so wish Simplicity would follow their lead). But apparently I like BMV patterns better because I really struggled to find 10 Simplicities to fill my 5 for $5 (limit 10) quota. Here's what came home with me. Mostly skirts, it seems, but a few tops too.I was nearly shocked (SHOCKED) to see this selection of Foldover Elastic and ruffled elastic trim on the notions wall when grabbing the elastic I went in for.I was also shocked by some of the nice fabrics I saw/touched. If I hadn't already promised myself NO FABRIC, the cutting line would've put me off anyway. I came home with zero yardage. #proudofmyselfSo that's it for this Monday, a semi-holiday on which I had to work. But the upside is that traffic was nice and light and I was home before 5:30 tonight. If you had the day off, I hope you spent it sewing!Now off to read some blogs and catch up on my Sunday DVR queue. And read my new patterns. ;-)"},
{"title": "Simplicity 2187 Finished: Verdict is Yes and No", "date": "Saturday, November 9, 2013", "text": "The dress is finished and I like it, so that gets a Yes. I also cut and finished a black Ottobre tee with 3/4 sleeves and I like it too, so another Yes. The problem is, I don't think I really like them together. Hence the No in the blog title.The dress really needs something underneath due to the low neckline and low-cut armholes. I'm just not sure yet if black is the right color here.I was originally thinking black tee underneath with black tights but now I'm second-guessing that. My first choice would be a tee the same shade of teal as in the dress print, but the odds of finding that in either fabric or RTW are about zero. So maybe white? But I really don't want to make a white tee right now since I have other things on my list. Maybe I've got something shoved in a drawer that I've forgotten about. I think I'll have a look after dinner. (Are you sufficiently bored with my internal monologue yet?)So, let's move on to some close-ups ...Murphy's Law is that the tee turned out perfectly without really trying. Some of my best binding in a while. I did interface the binding strip before feeding it through the binder on my CS machine since the black fabric is a thinnish rayon knit which I know from experience needs a little help with extra body for the binding.The sash is great and holds its shape, since I did my fusible interfacing jigsaw puzzle shown last post. Love. LOVE the pockets. The pocket edges got some Design Plus fusible lightweight bias strips in the facing seam. (I was obviously on a fusible interfacing bender during this construction.)The shoulder gathers. If there's a next time for this pattern (and there very well may be since it's a nice pattern and goes together quickly, and only uses 2 yds), I will move those more to the center, but as-is, they'll do for a first make. Rear view. The back bodice blouses over the sash, which looks nice in real life but kinda skimpy here in this pic.Inside view. Fold-over facings for the crossover. Which I fused in place with Steam-a-Seam Lite (see bender comment above) to discourage floppage.No real need to serge/finish the edges since it's a knit, but I just think it looks better.The back neckline is finished with purchased wide bias binding, per the pattern. The pattern also instructs to finish the sleeve/armhole openings the same way but (1) I was short on binding and (2) a simple turn under and coverstitch was more than adequate. And easier. ;-)The tee. Black photographs so horribly, so forgive the pixelation. As you can see, I stuck on a trim I found while searching out the bias tape. It was the perfect length for the front neckline. I didn't trim the length at all. Hopefully, it will wash OK.See what I mean about the binding? Perfection, and on the first pass with no testing. I should've known I wouldn't like the tee with the dress just from that. In other sewing news ...Two weekends ago, I made my friend her Halloween costume. Easy sewing, so I didn't mind. Plus she paid me. :-) She went as \"Sexy Pebbles\" ... with her Bam-Bam, of course. Fun!"},
{"title": "Scrappy Progress", "date": "Tuesday, November 5, 2013", "text": "I made my way into the sewing room tonight. I was \"forced\" because Alex needed a pair of his shorts repaired at the crotch, and since I already had black thread in the machine and the shorts are black, well, it just made sense. Then I decided that while I was already in there, I would stay for a little while and add the casing and elastic to the waist of the dress-in-progress.I was on a roll, so I continued on.Guess what this is? Maybe you have one too? It's a pile of interfacing scraps too big to toss but too small for most applications. Except tonight ... The fabric I'm using is a drapey knit. Which is good for the dress. Not so good for the self-fabric waist sash. So I called out to my miserly self and starting \"piecing\" the interfacing scraps onto the sash before it gets sewn up. For this, it really doesn't matter if the pieces are perfect (they aren't). It really only needs some extra body so the sash doesn't collapse on itself around my waist. It took a bit longer than just cutting one solid piece of the fusible, but slowing down to piece the scraps instead let me make a little dent in that pile I keep around.The actual sewing of the sash will wait until the next session, but since it's only a couple of seams and a turn and press, that part will go fast.Here's where the dress stands tonight. You can see the elastic tail hanging out the bottom. While I did made the casing and insert the elastic, I never said that I actually tried it on yet to size the elastic. ;-) It's looking less sack-like now that it has a waist."},
{"title": "Almost a Drive By", "date": "Monday, November 4, 2013", "text": "Just a bit of this and that during a quick lunchtime blog post ...Last Sunday afternoon, I started organizing patterns which hadn't yet made it into my \"catalogs\" and cabinet drawers. By Sunday night, it looked like this. It was a lot worse before it got to this stage. By then, all I had to do was squeeze them into the cabinet, which itself took a little re-arranging. But it's now done and my \"on deck\" pile is a lot more manageable. Until the next shiny thing attracts my attention ... I meant to sew all weekend, but my mojo temporarily disappeared Saturday. I blame a rainy day which made me want to do nothing but catch up on DVR'd TV shows and lounge in my PJs most of the day. I finally got going in the sewing room on Sunday, and this was the pattern that's been patiently waiting its turn. This is where I stopped last night. All that's left to do is add the elastic into the waist and hem sleeves/skirt. Right now, it's looking shapeless but even without the elastic in the waist, it looks a lot better on me than Zillie. You'll have to trust me on that. I would've probably finished it except for a really stupid move on my part. I attached the two front bodice sections *upside down.* Yes, really. I didn't notice until I went to sew the sideseams and nothing was matching up correctly. Of course I had already serged everything together. My seam ripper and I bonded for an hour or so. We're like >< this. :-) I'm also planning on making a black cami or tee to wear underneath since it's very low-cut (by design) and the armholes are pretty low too. And it will eventually be winter and I'll want another layer. Florida winter, but still. I hope I have energy to get back into the sewing room before next weekend. I've already used up my \"extra\" hour from this weekend by staying up too late last night.I'll leave you with some photos of me and my boys from last weekened. We had lunch at Bahama Breeze on the Courtney Campbell Causeway (a road over the Bay that goes between Tampa and Clearwater). It was a gorgeous day, the food was great, and it was nice to see Tyler ... even if he only breezed through for a day and a half. So many places to be, things to do, friends/brothers to see ... :-)Have a great week if I don't make it back before Saturday!"},
{"title": "Cake Patterns Red Velvet 0369 Take 2", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2013", "text": "Here's the remake. Yeah, I know it's hard to tell the difference, but trust me ... this one feels and hangs a lot better, especially after switching out the original doubleknit used for the skirt in favor of a thinner and drapier rayon/Lycra. And, of course, ditching the butt pleat. \"Butt pleat\" doesn't even *sound* attractive, does it? ;-)I realize it's hard to see any front pleat details at all in the black so I tried to lighten up the pic a bit. Even then, it wasn't very cooperative and this is the best I could do.I felt girly and swirly wearing this today and received unsolicitations from just about everyone in the office, so it's obviously a Win! pattern/style for me (as many of you confirmed), especially now that I've worked through the quirks and annoyances of the first go.These photos were taken after I got home from work and now that I've worn it all day, I don't think I'd change anything else not mentioned earlier but I do want to triple emphasize (tripleemphasize-tripleemphasize-tripeemphasize!) interfacing the midriff band.Not only does the midriff hold up the entire full skirt, it also sits where your body naturally bends and scrunches. The interfacing kept the dress' midriff - and mine - neat, supported, and flat all day long. Or in my case, the illusion of flat. ;-)In non-sewing news, the Marine officially re-enlisted this past weekend. On the blue Boise State football field!! He still has about 10 months left on his initial tour, but starting next August, he'll be in for at least another four years. Hopefully, I'll be able to share soon what his next job in the Corps is going to be but we need to wait for the Top Secret security clearance to go through first and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that process. Needless to say, Proud Mom here! And even better, he's heading down to Florida tomorrow for the weekend. It's been over 6 months since I've seen him, so I can't wait!"},
{"title": "Second Slice of Red Velvet", "date": "Saturday, October 19, 2013", "text": "Without a lot of tweaking, I do have a wearable (and liked) Red Velvet dress. I'll wait until I'm camera-ready to show the whole dress, since I think Zillie does it a disservice (sorry old girl!). But for now, here's a run-down on the tweaks and hacks.I decided to interface the midriff, which is why it looks white from the wrong side. Since I now think drapey fabrics will give the best results for this dress even though doubleknit is a recommended fabric, I recommend fusible knit interfacing for one and all. The midriff needs a bit of structure so it doesn't collapse on itself or stretch out from the weight of the skirt (or get caught in any lumps/bumps ... ahem, I'm just sayin') and with the fusible, it gets that structure. Cut/fuse with the stretch going around your body.I reduced the depth of the midriff pieces by 1-1/2\" and added another 5/8\" to the bottom of the bodice, which puts it at over 4\" I added to the bodice length. Clearly, the narrow shouldered/full busted will have some alterations to do above and beyond \"connecting the dots.\" Not saying this is necessarily a pattern error, just that this bodice is likely not going to be one-size-fits-all for anyone above a B cup or for whom gravity has played its tricks. Check the tuck location too, as I found them too far out to the sideseams for my particular boobage, although I actually sewed them as-is and can live with it.In case you're curious why you're seeing white overlocking down the sideseam of a black skirt ... I decided I'd rather use white all the way down so it doesn't show through the bodice. I used black thread in the actual seam-sewing for all. Yes, I could've switched to white for the bodice, but ... um ... lazy? Also, Rebecca, I do sew most knits with a sewing machine straight stitch first and then overlock/serge to finish the seam allowances. Unless it's a really simple pattern. This pattern is simple enough except there's a tight curve in the underarm of the bodice that would be very tricky to navigate with just a serger as the seam-maker.Since I'm not in a factory and it's easy enough to move between my machines, I usually do. I'm pretty sure the seam police aren't going to come calling. ;-)The next tweak was to lose the neckline facings. They are just a problem waiting to happen. Instead, I measured the neckline after sewing the shoulder/overarm seams and then cut a 1-1/2\" strip 4 inches shorter and sewed that into a circle. I quarter-marked both the neckline and the band, aligned right sides and match/pinned at the marks, and sewed them together with a 1/2\" seam allowance, stretching the \"binding\" as I sewed. I then flipped the binding to the inside and pressed, favoring the right side (which means a little of the right side of the neckline was rolled/pressed to the wrong side - which you can see below).This is a finishing method that anyone with just basic equipment can do.If you're new to knits, I highly recommend Easy Sewing the KWIK SEW Way. (Full disclosure: that's an Amazon link and I'll earn pennies if you buy from it. Well, dollars if you ALL buy from it, but that's not likely to happen.)  Ignore the out-of-date styles in the book and just concentrate on the  top-notch methods. Sometimes you can't learn *everything* for free on  the internet. ;-) To finish, I coverstitched from the right side and trimmed the excess binding close to the coverstitching loops on the back. A twin needle will work fine here. Or even a simple single needle stitch. Truly.The final hack was to remove the pleat from the back but to keep the swish factor. And to keep it easy by not drafting something from scratch or Frankenpatterning another skirt. I did mention my lazy streak, right?This is the pattern piece for the skirt. Front and back use the same piece, cut on the fold (twice).To eliminate the pleat, I folded the pattern piece the same as if I were prepping the front to sew the pleat. If you have the pattern, this will be self-explanatory. Then I aligned the CF notch (which I had to add myself and is highlighted in green here) with the fold and followed the edge of the piece the rest of the way down, truing the resulting unevenness at the bottom.And that's it.I hope you take away a few tidbits from this whole \"series\" ... but mainly that this is not an awful pattern and I never meant to imply that I hated it, or even disliked it. Yes, there were some annoyances and I think this particular pattern (which is my only experience with Cake) needs some refinement but overall the style is nice, the instructions, while not perfect, are better than most Big 3/4 instructions for knits, and I really didn't put a lot of work into the pattern itself before I ended up with something I will look forward to wearing. It was all these blog posts that took up my time. Hahaha. So, if you've been tempted to try this one ... bookmark my blog for reference, and then go for it! Just save your best fabric for your second slice of Cake. ;-)Dear Indie Pattern Designer,First, I want you to know that I LOVE that you are out there, providing more choices and variety. As a stitcher and habitual pattern buyer and stasher, I very selfishly want you to succeed. And, as a former business owner, I know running your own company is not as easy as it looks from the sidelines. So please know that what follows are suggestions and constructive criticisms that are meant to be helpful and not mean-spirited.So, deep breath, here we go ...You have a website/store, so please carve out a spot there where I can learn about your processes, your training, your vision. I want to know if you're the designer and the patternmaker, or whether you outsource patternmaking, which is really OK, but if so, tell me how you oversee that. I want to know if you're formally trained, self-taught, or somewhere in between (sewing, designing, patternmaking ... all of them). I want to know what inspired you to take this leap. I want to know where you're going. Test, test, test. And proactively. Seek out testers from all experience levels (and even body types), and make sure you get them. Make contacts directly and don't just wait for volunteers to catch a blog post asking for sign-ups because some of your best potential testers may miss a post or two, or even your entire blog. Provide your testers with an actual process of what and how to test. Make sure you check in with them and encourage an open dialog, even, and especially, if things aren't going well for them. Don your thick skin and encourage them to find errors, in both your instructions and the pattern pieces. Don't wait for your first round of paying customers to be the guinea pigs. Sure you can tease us with pics from your testers, but don't sell us a pattern until the tests (and press checks) are complete and the corrections have been made.And because mistakes inevitably do sneak through from time to time, plan for it in advance. Create an errata webpage for each design and provide the URL in the pattern instructions as the first step (and keep that page updated). If you offer downloadable/PDF versions of your pattern, make sure you test that too.Pay attention to where important pattern landmarks fall between the pages and adjust your layout if necessary.Think about those who blend between sizes with an eye toward nesting different sizes whenever you can.Tell your customers what body (and bust) type you're designing for, and provide finished measurements for bust-waist-hip  so there is a jumping off point for individual alterations and expectations. And then be consistent throughout all of your styles.And, finally, consider your price points and the expectations created. Do your patterns fully deliver? If they do, I'm fine with the price. But if not .... Thanks for reading. I'm looking forward to your next release!Sincerely,Debbie"},

And I'm not about to NOT get a wearable something out of this pattern since I'm already pretty close. So, yes ... I'm making another one, which will be virtually the same but with some pattern hacking and a much thinner black knit for the skirt to eliminate the unneeded bulk.Heather asked about the black/white color scheme chosen and if I was changing my stance on not wearing black. The real answer is simply that I was shopping my stash. But yes, I'm relaxing on the black aversion a bit and do wear it now, but always paired with a print. Plus, black in an office setting is always acceptable. Right Carolyn? :-)I cut the new pieces tonight, eliminating the back pleat in a slapdash hack and kicking the facings to the curb. I  also removed 1-1/2\" from the midriff band and will baste to see if that's enough, and I added 5/8\" to the bodice length. On the plus side of all this, it's a very fast pattern to cut. I want to thank all of you for your comments over the last few days' posts. I spent a LOT of hours on those posts and the review, and I must be honest and tell you that it's very rewarding to know you're out there reading and interacting. I do have one more post in me which will also be related to all of this, but I'm kinda burned out on writing at the moment so I'll let that one percolate in my head a little longer before I commit it to typed words. And I'll get to the off-blog emails soon too.Oh, and before I turn off the lappie for the night ... Amanda asked what stitch I use for knits instead of the lightning stitch. Many experts and everyday sewists recommend using a slight zigzag for sewing knits, but honestly ... I just use a straight stitch, with a stretch needle, and my machine on its knit setting. Of course, your mileage may vary and so will your machine. I think the best advice is to test on knit samples or even wearable muslins and come up with what works best for YOU! By the way, the reasons I hate the lightning stitch are it can easily eat and/or warp your fabric because it's so thread dense and even worse, it can be extremely tedious to rip out ... which is why I think newbies and first-pattern sews are better served with a different stitch.Nighty-night!(And Ronda, thanks for thinking of me and waiting 'til late Friday for that MTC. It was waiting for me bright and early this morning.)"},

Choose the origami-style scissor pleated skirt, or reverse it for a flat boxy-pleat effect. A cleverly concealed ticket pocket holds a few coins, cards, or lipstick.\"Pattern Sizing: Bodice 30\"-59\"; Waist 25\"-55\". (My bust is 44, my waist is 37.)Did it look like the photo/drawing on the pattern envelope once you were done sewing with it? Yes and no. The actual skirt section is much fuller than the scissor-pleat view line drawings would lead you to believe. Were the instructions easy to follow? Easy, yes, but I think there is room for improvement, especially because Cake advertises \"Our sewing instructions are different -- focused on providing a clear and stress-free sewing experience with clear diagrams for visual learners. The more experienced sewist will appreciate the easy-to-skim instructions format, including a Construction Overview and technique symbols!\" I *am* an experienced sewist and I thought non-standard symbols to be more cutesy than helpful. There are no alignment notches, so make your own when you're cutting, and if you've got 40+ eyes syndrome, keep the \"cheaters\" or magnifying glass handy because the illustrations, while nicely drawn, are tiny. There are also no hip width measurements at all. None. If you've got hips like me or a pronounced hourglass figure, some of that scissor pleat is going to end up as fitting ease.I also think some of the construction methods, while fast, do not give the best results. Facings on a knit neckline? No, thank you, even if the instructions tell you to use fusible webbing between facing and bodice to prevent rollout. Hemming sleeves before sewing the sideseam? It's really just as easy and a much nicer finish to press the hem first, but leave it unsewn until after the underarm seam is sewn, and then hem in the round. Using the lightning stitch for knits? Hahaha ... experienced sewists know that's an evil trick the manufacturers played on us, especially if you've ever tried to rip it out. In black. At night. A link to an invisible zipper video tute that results in a zipper with visible extra stitches you're told to just rip rip out? Hmmm. This would lay flat if the facing was trimmed back to the coverstitchingBut for now, it has a mind of its ownThere are also pattern drafting errors. While minor, I do want to mention them so newbies don't wonder if it's them or the pattern. I think there's something off with the midriff pieces - first, in the size range I used (40s) they are off from each other where you'd join them at the sideseam, by 1/4\". You will never get perfect sideseam alignment if you don't correct that before you cut fabric. Also, I think the \"connect a dot and triangle\" method of \"custom\" sizing the midriff can easily result in a badly shaped pattern piece that won't fit onto the skirt properly, and the piece I created by straight size 40 numbers (IOW, no real customization) didn't match up to the skirt piece by 1/2\", which times 2 for the fold cut means it's off by an inch. I didn't need that inch and ended up trimming the join to a normal shape, but maybe you will need it. Who knows. Midriff (bottom) 1/2\" shorter than same size bodice seam Fabric Used: ITY knit for the bodice, faux knit-back leather for the midriff, Sophia knit for the skirt. The skirt is much too bulky even though doubleknit is a recommended fabric.What did you particularly like or dislike about the pattern? The scissor-pleated skirt is what attracted me. I thought the diagonal lines would be flattering, but I also thought the skirt wouldn't be so voluminous so I've now got mixed feelings about the final result and since my faux leather reached its expiration date and started leaving marks on the white of the bodice, I'm probably going to just cut off the skirt and use the fabric for something else. And, really, now that I've seen it ... who needs a scissor pleat on their backside?Pattern alterations or any design/construction changes you made: Cake's unique sizing is good in theory. But in practice, I found it really hard to get my head around. In the end, I guessed my best from experience, and created a bodice front that was size 35 in the shoulders/neck, 40 in the width with the C cup (or 45 A, because it's the same width), and 45 for length with an additional 3/8\" added. I didn't hem the skirt or sleeves because I'm not keeping this dress, but I would hem the sleeves in the round and not interface the hem. The pics above show the skirt unhemmed, but I did an a just-in-case inch when cutting, which I did need for a nice hem width.How a dart/tuck should be truedThe incredible morphing front bodice pieceETA: This morphing means I had to print and tape together 3 separate bodices for the 3 different sizes. So much for the economical, only print your size, printing mentioned in the instructions. I wish the sizes were nested ... or similar to what I think I see on Cake's blog for the Hummingbird top. Can't tell on that one for sure since I don't have the pattern.Would you sew it again? Would you recommend it to others? I really don't know if I'll sew this again, but I have invested $15 in the pattern so I hate to just throw that out the window. Plus I'm doggedly determined not to let any pattern get the best of me so chances are I will try it again, in a much thinner knit for the skirt with no back pleating. When/if I do, I will post on the blog and update my review on PR. I do think the dress on me has possibilities ...Conclusion: I applaud Cake for getting out there, but I think there is still refinement needed. I don't mind paying more for good quality independent patterns, but these aren't there yet and I think the premium price point is misleading.While I'm not 20-something, I have NOT been sewing for decades. I have been sewing for just over 10 years.I grew up with a mom who sewed her whole life but she didn't teach me specifically or give me lessons. I didn't want to learn back then. A few things naturally rubbed off by sheer virtue of being around it and probably from my one 7th grade Home Ec class but by and large, I am self-taught, through books, videos, and interacting with others on the internet ... and by just jumping in and doing it. I bought a cheap Sears machine to sew the straight seams for living room curtains I didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for. And then the spark was lit. (My mother was shocked as she had long given up.)I'm not out to discourage anyone from sewing, from buying a specific pattern line, or from creating a pattern line. I've been giving my opinions about one pattern. You know what they say about opinions, and you are free to take mine ... or leave them. But when reviewing a product, I don't believe in saying only nice or popular things. I prefer to be thorough and truthful. In the end, though, it's still only my opinion.I've sewn a number of indie patterns, such as Hot Patterns, Pamela's Patterns, and Colette's freebie Sorbetto, and my own created with Pattern Master Boutique. I've been honest about those experiences too, and two of my favorite patterns are HP's Sunshine and Pamela's Magic Pencil. I've also sewn Ottobres, Jalies, and probably a few others I'm forgetting at the moment. I'd love to try them all. Alas, I'm not rich. But when I do get my next one, whatever it may be, you can count on another honest opinion. I don't mind PDF patterns and taping together 65 sheets one little bit. I can tape those sheets together in roughly the same time as it takes me to unfold and press tissue and then find the pieces I need.I'm not really sure where I stand on feeling a responsibility, obligation, or opportunity (or whatever word you want to use) to contact an owner of a company whose product I'm talking about but part of me thinks that if you put something out there for sale at a high price point, it should pass muster. I'm fairly sure I don't want to pay the pattern price to be part of a \"community\" to give feedback that IMO should have been part of a testing process before release. On the flip side, they could always contact me to test prior to release. ;-)"},
{"title": "First Slice of Cake", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2013", "text": "So here's the \"muslin.\" And some more observations.I used the neck facings, just to see and report back. Hate 'em. They do not stay flat. (Not that I really expected them to.) In fact, the \"fix\" for this in the instructions is to use fusible webbing between the facing and bodice. Hahaha. My fix would be to ditch them completely and either just turn the edge under and stitch/coverstitch or bind it one way or another (depending on desired final look). In other words, there are far better ways to finish a knit neckline. And I still remain firm in my stance on not staystitching a knit neckline. I don't care what a Tilton sister says. (Said with a smile!)  It's much more likely that you will overwork the knit with the extra  stitching than you would stretch it out by omitting it. But if you're  really worried, fuse some lightweight stay tape to it instead.  For this trial, I coverstitched about 1/2\" in from the edge and if I were going to keep this dress, I'd trim away the rest of the facing from behind because it's still flopping. But ... this is not a keeper. It looks horrible on me. This is not the fault of the pattern. It's just not my kind of dress. It's mumsy on me, and those pleats add 20 lbs. What is the fault of the pattern, though, is the deceptive line drawing, which makes the skirt look more pegged than it really is. But seeing the muses' makes out in blogland and now the pattern pieces, I knew better. Hopefully, now you do too.The front and back use the same piece so there are pleats in the back. Yeah, I need pleats on my backside.The midriff band is entirely too wide/deep for me. Again, not the fault of the pattern. This is a personal preference thing. If I were keeping this dress, I'd rip off the skirt and cut off about half the depth of the midriff band. (In case you're wondering, I used a faux leather, knit backed fabric. It's past its expiration date, though, because it left black marks all over the white of the bodice. I think they will wash out, but not sure I should bother trying) Although I used the same size number for midriff and skirt, the midriff was wider where it attached to the skirt, because you're sewing a rectangle to a hip curve. Easy enough to trim, but should I have to? And should I have to create my own alignment notches? Lucky for me, I know when they're missing and can just make snips as I cut fabric to make it easier on myself when I'm matching up pieces later to actually sew them.Whatever your answer to those questions, I think most of all I just wish there had been better testing by more experienced seamsters because many of the issues I've found would have been eliminated in the first round of tests.The good news is that technically, this dress does actually fit. Even though I never really could agree with the weird sizing. It's a fine idea, in theory. But it's just not there yet in application and simple styles hide the flaws even when you do just throw your hands up and guess your best. After reading many Tiramisu reviews on PR, I'm sure I'm not alone in Flummoxville. I'm just a lot more blunt. :-) There are a lot of nice Tira finishes, but the paths to fit were bumpy for most. * * * * *I'm still deciding whether I want to save the dress or just cut off the skirt fabric and move on. It depends on my motivation and whether those black marks from the midriff piece do wash out. Before I do anything, I will take some pics of me in the dress and add an actual review to PR. I want to start off by saying that I wish it wasn't me finding errors with the pattern. I really want indies to be successful. It's to everyone's benefit if they are. And I admit I wanted to feel the bliss I've seen around the interwebs. But on the other hand, I'm not inclined toward that bliss when plunking down $15 and then needing to fix the pattern. And it bugs me a little that beginning stitchers won't know what they don't know and will probably remain blissfully ignorant. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. Here goes ...I was originally going to blend between upper chest/neck and waist. Bad enough that the sizes aren't nested to make it easier on me, but the sleeve angles vary between the sizes. If I line up the sleeve angles as below, look what happens to the center fronts ... they are wonky donkey. Likewise, if I align the CFs, the sleeve angles go in different directions. Which means you may need a shoulder angle adjustment in one size range, but not in another. BTW, per the instructions on using high bust measurement for the base bodice size, I should be using the smaller size on top. But if I did that, I'd need to add 4\" to go over the girls, which is why I decided to blend in the first place. The bust depth alteration on Cake's blog isn't (IMO) a good alteration ... it leaves you with a terrible pattern piece. So, instead, I'm meeting it all in the middle and using the smallest lines on the bigger pattern piece, with the neckline/shoulder lengths of the smaller piece. This is the front midriff piece, sized using the pattern instructions. Uh ... my body (and I'm guessing yours too) doesn't get *smaller* as we near the hips. Something just ain't right here. Nor here ... I was right when I said earlier that the midriff pieces don't match at the sideseams. They are off nearly a 1/4\". Yes, there is a possibility that the printer was off, but I didn't print this in separate runs so I'm kind of doubting that. And everything else on these sheets lined up fine.And then we have this ... the wonky midriff piece is over an inch longer than the bodice piece it's supposed to match up to. Even if I undo the tuck, which is supposed to be untucked anyway on the smaller size of each range (WHY?), it still doesn't match up. Note to self: Find the next size out so I can use the tuck for shaping, and then correct that midriff.And my last entry for the night ... the tuck is drafted without a proper extension. Folded in this direction, it won't fully catch in the seam. Folded the other way, the extension hangs down below the seam line (better for getting caught, but still bad drafting).And I haven't even looked at the skirt yet.(If you missed my first post on this pattern, go back one.)"},
{"title": "A Take on Cake", "date": "Friday, October 11, 2013", "text": "So, I'm actually and FINALLY mostly caught up at work and I made my hours this week, which means I could leave at 2:30. I was home today by 3. Can I get a woohooo?!But before I left, I bought and downloaded the PDF version of Cake Patterns new Red Velvet dress. I won't say where I printed it. Ahem. Yes, I drank the Kool-Aid. Or ate the cake. Or whatever. ;-)What follows are my first impressions before even cutting the pattern or fabric. I still have hopes for a nice dress in the end, and I don't want to bring down the wrath of the Cake \"muses\" and other devotees for what I'm about to say ... but so far ... I. Am. Not. Impressed.In no particular order:1. Why do I have to turn page after page of instructions to find my frickin' starting size?2. Why are the adjustments (Proportions in Cakespeak) after the sewing instructions?3. Lightning stitch? Really? Yeah, uh, no.4. Staystitching a KNIT neckline? 5. Instructed to finish the \"raw\" and interfaced edges of a knit neckline facing?6. Wide, floppy, neckline facings in a knit to begin with? Probably not even cutting THOSE pieces. :-)7. This pattern is NOT for the full-busted no matter what someone says. Not without alteration for extra front length ... which starts out pretty darn short IMO. Edited to add: Yes, I know about the depth alteration, and I've also been playing some more with the different sizes for the bodice. But the sizing is weird to me without some deeper studying. Not sure yet if this is good or bad. Old dog, new tricks, etc. 8. Fast, but not professional, methods ... such as hemming the sleeves before the sideseams are sewn. Eww.9. Why no hip measurements for me to take into account when picking cutting lines? It's got a skirt section ... I want to know its finished measurement. I'm not a sheep who will just cut and believe. ;-)10. Pattern lines and markings in bad spots for printing tiled pages, and I have a LOT of experience with printing and then lining up tiled pages.11. Weird markings in general. Why not use standard marks? The marks don't have to be unique just because you can. Inexperienced sewists won't know the difference, but those who've been sewing more than a minute will just get frustrated. 12. I don't think the midriff band meet-up seams are the same size. Will know better when I'm cutting.I apologize to anyone that loves this pattern. In fact, in was probably because of YOUR blog post/trial that I bought it myself. :-) I've seen some great looking dresses! I hope the above is taken as constructive criticism and I will definitely come back and eat my words on anything I've got wrong in my initial gripe list, so stay tuned."},
{"title": "Butterick 5849 - Almost There ", "date": "Sunday, October 6, 2013", "text": "The dress is pretty much done. I just need to stitch the sleeve hems and decide on the overall length, probably chopping at least 6 inches off the bottom. But I'm going slow with this because I'm not highly motivated at the moment. It's still 90+ degrees outside and this dress is (1) moleskin and (2) high- and closed-necked, which is kind of suffocating in these temps. It will make a nice autumn/winter dress ... when we finally have those seasons in about 2 months. :-)The fit is almost perfect. The only thing I'd tweak if there was a next time (not sure yet if there will be) would be an erect back tuck since the back neck does hit me a little high. But my hair covers it so I'm not going to sweat it. As long as I wait for the temps to drop. ;-) I thought about that alteration as I was cutting the tissue because it's fairly standard for me with wovens but then I forgot so I really only have myself to blame. I didn't do aany other alterations to this except to morph between cutting lines and make my usual square shoulder fix before cutting the tissue. I started with a straight 16 at the shoulders/neck, blended to a 20 at the waist and then 22 for hips/butt. I figured with all the panel seams (they are not really true princess seams in the front), I'd have room to adjust. I basted it together and, of course, I needed NOT ONE seam adjusted. Of course we all know that iIf I had skipped the basting, I'd be cursing that. Murphy's Law. No FBA was done or needed in case you're wondering.The back also has panel/princess seams which are invisible in this print, and calls for a center-insert zipper. Part of my basting was also to see if the zipper was really needed, since the moleskin does have some stretch and the wrap front allows some wiggle room. After trying it on basted but without sleeves, I decided the sleeves would mean a zipper would be needed if I didn't want to work myself into a lather wiggling into the dress in the morning. It's not a fancy zipper application and I debated a lapped zip instead, but laziness won out and it came out perfectly, which is what I was after.The pattern calls for a 22\" zip. I didn't have one and didn't feel like hitting Joann's on the weekend. The one I had was just fine. I think it is about 16\". I toptstiched the panel seams front and back. It doesn't stand out too much in the print but it does keep the seams nice and flat.A somewhat better shot of the tucks at the side.Inside shot where you can see the underlayer of the wrap is not double-layer all the way down. This is per the pattern and works just fine.For the collar pieces, instead of turning under a narrow hem and then slipstitching per the pattern (a/k/a icky handsewing), I stitched in the ditch from the right side to catch the facing edge underneath.The ditch sewing would show a whole lot less on the underside if I bothered to change my bobbin thread to match the collar. This should really be in the instructions instead of the slipstitching method.And now a little confession and a rant ...The thing I like the absolute LEAST about sewing woven garments? Setting in sleeves with cap ease. I can do it. I can even do it well. It just bugs the crap out of me that I have to ease in a sleeve when it's something the pattern drafters can, and should, eliminate. These sleeves went in fairly well. But there were 3 puckers total that I had to pick and restitch because there was 1\" of cap ease. Stupid. I know I've sewn a pattern or two with a woven sleeve and armhole that  fit together perfectly. I need to rack my brain and remember which and use those for every future woven sleeve/armhole. The sewing community seems to have spoken loudly enough for the pattern companies to offer more and more vari-cup sized bodices. I'd like for us to be heard about the unnecessary cap ease drafting."},
{"title": "Sunday Wrap Up", "date": "Monday, September 30, 2013", "text": "So I made these shorts (S3768) a few weeks ago and have been living in them every weekend. Love. Them. Still can't believe they needed no alterations. The last you saw, I was contemplating back pockets. I tried to get a modeled shot, but no flash, and aiming into the mirror while facing backwards results in much blur. Here's one of the better ones. I use that term loosely.So I just stepped out of them and laid them on the floor for a photo, weekend wrinkles, dog hair, and all.The first \"tester\" pair was from a much-loved repurposed linen but I totally spaced when sewing the waistband on by not stabilizing it and I could only wear them for about an hour before the linen stretched, which meant I was constantly tugging my shorts up like a teenaged boy. I fixed that yesterday. It ain't pretty, but it works. I added some twill tape to the inside of the waistband (right after they were pulled from the dryer) by stitching in the ditch from the top and praying I hit the twill tape underneath. I did, but it's not straight by any means. Lazy sewing at it's laziest. :-) The important thing is, it works. But ... the TOP of the waistband still gets a little loose even if the shorts now stay in place so if I get really motivated to fix this properly, I'll need to also rip out the stitching holding the slapdash twill tape in place. But for now, I'll also be living in these shorts on the weekends and chances are good that I won't fix them properly, because who's gonna know anyway? My next project is this dress. It took me a while to settle on it because I'm having a real hate with my fabric stash and matching patterns to fabric I want to use is becoming harder and harder.The main problem is I don't really want most of my fabrics anymore. Many are solid non-Lycra knits, bought when I was sewing more for my sons and other family. But I can't just toss or donate because ... what if I NEED something there? Right? The bottom line is it really means that out of a very full closet, only a few stacks are anything I will actually sew and even some of those are yawners to me. So now I'm contemplating sticking most of it in bins and storing it in the garage. Basically starting over, but with a lot more thought, less quantity, and a lot more sewing fabric before it becomes unloved. Here's where the dress progress has stopped for now. The fabric is drapey sueded moleskin, both the print and the contrast solid. I do like *this* fabric but I wasn't really wanting to sew such a fall/winter look yet. Still, if it works out, it will be a nice addition. My office is freezing most days anyway. I haven't done a muslin for this. Just a quick tissue evaluation (not even really a tissue fit) and a few usual minor alterations as I cut the tissue so this may end up being a pretty wadder. Hah. But I don't think so ... there are many princess seams for adjusting as I go, but that means I have to baste instead of really sew. The back is together too, although I'm also trying to find out if the back zip is really necessary so I haven't done that seam as final yet either. Hopefully, I'll have some energy and mojo for sewing after work this week. Because if I don't, my sewing table is going to look like this all week."},

{"title": "The Full Monty (KS 3790 copy)", "date": "Saturday, September 21, 2013", "text": "Dillander (edited to add: and Dawn!) guessed correctly. The pattern I shamelessly copied is Kwik Sew 3790, although that Burda is very similar. I think I like the KS better though. But that's just my 2 cents.The fabric I was willing to \"sacrifice\" for my tester/muslin is a brown/ivory ivy-ish print that's been in my stash for years and years. While the pattern I created did actually work fine, I wasn't totally thrilled with the print crawling up me on this top once it was done. Until ...... I whipped up a quick Magic Pencil skirt with the leftovers. Now I LOVE them together as a two-piece dress and will be wearing my new outfit to work this week for sure. I'm really liking the movement created in the different print directions meeting up, which itself is created by the odd-shaped front piece needed to create the top. Pattern morphing details/pics are below.Here's a close-up of the gathered sleeve join on the left. The right is just a cut-on/dolman cap sleeve.Here are the gathers going down the left front sideseam. (Which provides nice tummy cammo!)From reading the reviews, the real pattern calls for a neckline facing of some sort, and nearly every reviewer had gaping/flipping trouble with it. If I hadn't read Lynn Rowe's excellent tips and photos from her review, here, I probably would've used a coverstitch binding around the neckline but I gave Lynn's method a try and it worked just great. (It's like a bias binding facing, except single-layer and cut with the stretch, not bias, going the length of the strip.)So, I promised pics and tips on how I created my pattern ...I started with my TNT Ottobre tee (of course!), which is just a basic scoop neck tee. Because I just had two successes in a row with the cut-on/dolman cap sleeve of Butterick xxxx (I'll fill this in later), I used it to create the shoulder/armhole changes to my TNT tee by just pinning the two together and then tracing. If you don't have a similar sleeve to trace, just look at the shape here ... I'm positive it would be extremely easy to create on the fly. It's a forgiving sleeve so you don't really need perfection. To emphasize, I ONLY used the parts outlined in red below to \"fill in\" the armhole of my tee, so disregard the weird shape of that Butterick piece. It only needs to be weird like that for the Butterick top, not this Kwik Sew copy.I laid a folded piece of pattern tracing paper over my pinned-together TNT and Butterick pieces and traced. I used the tracing paper on the fold so I could open it up into a full front piece after tracing/trimming. The full front is a must, as you'll see next.Next, I used a combination of my curve ruler and eyeballing the photos on the reviews to create the asymmetrical neckline shape. If you look closely, you'll see a couple of \"extra\" lines where I drew a shape and then changed my mind. :-) The KS line drawing looks like it's just a straight diagonal line, but the pattern photos made me worry about bra strap peekage so I made my neckline more curved and did NOT make it wider than my trusted TNT neckline. (I'm happy with how it turned out. The bra does not show, or even try to show, at all.) After I committed to my neckline shape, I marked a couple of notches, and then sliced off the left upper, set it aside for the time being, and then added a seam allowance to the remaining neckline. I also used this moment to create a grain line parallel to the CF fold (you can't see it, but it's there) of the full pattern piece. Make another little grain line on the shoulder piece too. And if you're smarter than me, you'll do that before you cut it off. Not that I would know about that ...Next comes the wacky part. :-) Draw a bunch of diagonal lines (6 for me) radiating from the right-side waist and going across the full front. Slice 'em apart, leaving a \"hinge\" at the radiation (?) point. Radiation? No, we're not nuking our pattern here. Hahaha. Ahem. Then spread each slice 2-3 inches each. Not rocket science ...just eyeball it so they all look fairly evenly spread apart.Fill in the space with all that tissue you cut off from other patterns and save in a pile. Oh, you don't do that? Now's the time to start. You'll never have to use paid-for tracing paper to fill in alterations again. :-) If you're OCD, this next part will make you nutty ... to create a new sideseam, just eyeball tru-ing all those slash/spreads so you end up with a smooth curve. Again, not rocket science. Not a fitted top. It's a knit tee. It should be smooth but it doesn't have to be perfect. If you look closely at the left side of the photo below, you should see a little piece of tissue I used to smooth out the sharp angle creating during the spread of the other side. I recommend you smooth out that waist area too if your pattern's waist curve gets too angular like mine did.This is my back piece, which is really just my TNT back piece pinned to the Butterick back piece, since I knew the shoulder/armholes would match my front morph. I didn't even bother making a proper pattern piece yet since I was still testing. Now that I know it works, I will create a dedicated back piece before I unpin these.One thing to note ... before you cut fabric, and really, before you do the crazy slash/spread to the front piece ... WALK YOUR SIDESEAMS. My TNT is intentionally ~1\" longer in the front because the bust area is eased to the back piece. But this pic below shows an additional 1\" discrepancy above that... which I didn't catch until I was actually SEWING the sideseams. Oops. Luckily, cutting off that extra inch didn't make my finished top too short. This is what can happen when pinning together two different patterns and thinking you're smarter than them. Yeah. Humble Pie time. In other words: measure twice, cut once.Moving on to the shoulder piece. Basically the same radiating slashes as the front, but radiate from the center shoulder this time. Your goal is to keep the same length across the top/shoulder seam while adding 2\" or so to the original slice/seam line. Doing this creates a *very* wonky pattern piece. I simply laid it out, before slashing, on another piece of pattern paper and traced it so I could return to the original shoulder line and neckline area (I also added a neckline SA to the tracing), and then I trued up everywhere else to create a smooth piece, curved at the bottom where it will be gathered to the full bodice piece. I hope this is clear. I know it's not a precise method, but the eyeballing thing is actually what I do. Remember, it's only a tee. And you're allowed to make mistakes. It's one of the best ways to learn.Here are my final shoulder and front pieces, a little closer. Not sure this helps. :-)To connect the shoulder and front and finish the neckline, go to Lynn Rowe's excellent tips and photos from her review, here. Then just evenly gather the left sideseam until it is the same length as the back (using your favorite gathering method) and sew together like any other tee. I simply turned under the sleeve hems and sewed with a slight ZZ. On my Buttericks with the same sleeves, I coverstitched them. Either method is fine.I have no idea if my pattern looks anything like the actual Kwik Sew pattern, but my finished top does so I think it's a win. If you have any questions, please ask and I will answer in the comments so it all stays together."},

I started another pair of shorts this past weekend and continued on them for about an hour tonight. I have about one more hour left and they'll be done in time for the coming weekend when I'm meeting up with my friend from that job which shall only be mentioned slightly. We're going to go out to a sports bar somewhere and watch football games. And drink. (By the way, she's no longer at that place either! Interesting, right?)Here's the front. The button/buttonhole and hems will be done tomorrow. I haven't been sewing during the week at all lately so I didn't want to push it. Inside shot. The last of some red/blue paisley cotton for the waist facing, fly shield, and ...... inside the pockets.Speaking of pockets ... I think the back needs some.

{"title": "Take 2", "date": "Sunday, September 8, 2013", "text": "While the patterns (Butterick 5429 and Simp 2185) were still out, I went ahead and made another 2-piece \"dress.\" This time I added the flounces to the skirt. I figured they would be mostly lost in the print in case I hated them but would still add swish and movement. I do like them. Per the pattern, they are single-layer and raw-edged but hang in such a way that the wrong side of the fabric barely shows. In other words, a quick/easy addition to the skirt. Can't beat that.This skirt has definitely moved into my top 3 knit skirt patterns so I should probably leave the pattern out a little while longer. I like how it fits closely at the hips even though it has an elastic waist (I changed it from a casing to a serge/turn) and then flows into a swishy bottom. Treena had commented on the first skirt that (paraphrasing) she wouldn't want to sew all those curved seams in the panels. Don't be afraid ... in a knit, it's a breeze. You barely know you're sewing a curve. And the pattern notches are spot on if you want a little more guidance. I was stupid when cutting out the top, though. I have the pattern marked to add an inch to the bottom when cutting but for some reason I completely spaced. I decided to add a hem band to make up the needed length and to create a blouson effect so this top wouldn't be *exactly* like the last one. It's hard to see on Zillie through the print, but it hangs differently on my body/hips. Once I get pics of me in the new outfit, you'll see.In my last post, I mentioned the pattern keeper ziplock bags I use for my patterns. I used to buy them from Nancy's Notions, about 50 at time. But they've discontinued them. Boo. I knew Clotilde used to sell the same bags but with their logo instead of NNs. I had received one or two as a sample on a past order, so I wasn't imagining it. Well, the Clotilde company has been bought out by Annie's and the Clotilde website redirects to Annie's. I found this out when needing to order more bags. Since NN didn't have them, I decided to give the Annie's bags a try thinking they'd be the same. They are functional but they are definitely not the same and are of much lesser quality. I found other possibilities after a Google search and might try something else when I'm ready for more. In the meantime, here's the link to Annie's. http://www.anniescatalog.com/detail.html?prod_id=93028&cat_id=1520 I'm not affiliated and theirs are definitely NOT the same as the Clotilde pic you'll see at the Annie's link. Kind of misleading.  Can you see the pocket outside the bag?Finally, for Meredith ... here's the link to the PR discussion that inspired my last post:http://sewing.patternreview.com/SewingDiscussions/topic/80323ETA: I've been checking out new blog posts and it's amusing (in a good way!) to see that my questions post inspired your own posts."},
{"title": "Questions", "date": "Saturday, September 7, 2013", "text": "Mine, not yours. Hah. :-)There's a message board thread on PR at the moment which is discussing the \"right\" way to place a pattern and cut fabric. So I thought I'd ask ...1. Do you cut with your fabric RS out or WS out? Me, RS out ... always. I want to see motif placement most of all. I do use me a lot of prints after all. It's just The Way I Do It. Always have. But I think what's most important is consistency. Since I also have the tissue next to the RS, it's easy for me to know what the RS is (or what I've chosen as the RS) after everything is cut and the tissue may have slipped.2. How do you make your pattern markings?Me, water soluble pen the most for interior marks, chalkoliner next. Notches and fold/center markings by snipping into the seam allowance. Sometimes I'll use a sticker if a mark isn't going to show with a pen/chalk.3. Do you follow the cutting layout in patterns?Me, never. I don't even look at them. Even as a newbie sewer, I didn't bother with them. But I think that's because I have really good spatial skills and can just look at something to know how/where it fits best. I was always the one who packed the luggage in the car for family trips too. :-)4. Are you obsessed with re-folding your pattern tissue on or very close to the original fold lines?Hahaha, I am. Call it OCD. And I don't even store patterns inside their original envelopes so it's not like they have to fit back inside. Everything goes into a bigger ziplock with a pocket on the outside where I put the envelope and instructions.5. I thought of one more ... Do you make all the markings? Me, no. I don't mark notches that indicate general match-ups, like sideseams, shoulder seams, etc. ... unless it's an usually shaped pattern piece.That's all. Heading into the sewing room now ..."},

The skirt is swishy, the top flatters, the fabric is my colors, and I received many unsolicitations in the office. What more could a girl ask for?I made my billable time goal again for last week so I'll be getting an early start on the weekend at 2:30 tomorrow. Love that perk! We have a big trial coming up next month so I'm guessing I'll be putting in some extra hours throughout the rest of the next few weeks, but I think it will actually be fun ... in a work sort of way. There's lots of camaraderie and team effort in this place and it feels good. No BS, no drama. It's great not to have to worry about that stuff and just do my job. I'm thinking about making another pair of shorts this weekend in some denim this time since the trial pair went so well. I'd also like to make another top like the one in the pic above, but from a different fabric of course. It's a great little shell with a literal twist, which will fit into an office wardrobe quite nicely.

{"title": "No Labor Day", "date": "Monday, September 2, 2013", "text": "Happy Labor Day from here at Chez Debbie ... where absolutely NO labor is happening at all. We're hanging out on the back porch (lanai), dipping toes into the pool, surfing the 'net, and waiting for when it's time to fire up the grill. Linen Bermudas ... it doesn't get much more comfortable than this. And a rayon knit top only helps. (Speaking of which, the front of this top is double-layer, so be warned if you have your own personal heater moments! ) I will probably be living in these shorts for the rest of the summer, on weekends and after work. Or at least until they're too big, because I was serious yesterday about the gym. I know my weight gain is due to the emotional rollercoaster of the last few months and hopefully I'm now off that ride, but I am more than ready to drop those lbs.that creeped back onto my butt. And, arrghh the reappearance of back fat makes me mad. Thankfully, this is one thing that IS in my power to control. So, a few fabric and construction details. First, hopefully this shot below helps you understand how the border print was used. I really like how the border forms the cowl and looks almost separate from the rest of the tee but still matching the other print area. Kind of a necklace without wearing jewelry.Here's the tuck in the shoulder that I mentioned as my solution to fix the too-wide front shoulder. I've revisited the pattern tissue and conclude that I just didnt' fold the cowl facing far enough inward. It helps to look at pattern markings from time to time. Oops.Hard to see in this low-contrast pic, but here are the pockets on the front of the shorts. I love me some pockets so I'm happy with these and they don't gape at all. But instead of using a bias binding facing on the open edge and turning under the outside edge, I just cut two pocket pieces for each, sewed them RS together, flipped them RS out, and pressed before topstitching/attaching. SO MUCH easier to get a smooth curve that way and the linen isn't too bulky that the extra layer is even noticeable. If anything, since linen \"gives,\" it's probably better to have a bit more stability.This is the back of the shorts. No pockets here, but you can (hopefully?) see where I used the sideseams from the old Marrakesh pants as a design feature seam for these shorts. I wish I could say this was the plan from the beginning, but I soon learned that I didn't have much choice about where my shorts pattern pieces would fit on the old pants. More Labor Day Weekend Miscellaneous ... here's Alex mixing up his custom marinade for the steaks we'll be grilling in a couple of hours. I don't know what it is about men and steaks and grills, but I'm all for anything that gets me out of the dinner chore. Go Alex!I haven't been the only one \"creating\" this weekend. These are Alex's shorts. Shorts that I JUST BOUGHT a week ago. He wore them once and then managed to dribble liquid pool chlorine on them (the really white spots). We were both a little more than irritated. Me, since I just spent the money. Him, since he really liked the shorts. Yesterday, while at the grocery store, I bought some gel bleach with a pointy tip. I handed it over to Alex and told him to have at it. The pic here doesn't do the shorts/bleach design justice. They look really cool and he'll definitely be wearing them. I would too if they fit me. ;-) I know the fabric will be weakened now but at least the shorts won't go directly into the trash bin yet.Alex had so much fun with the bleach on his shorts that he went looking for more clothing to transform. He came up with this plain red tee. It looks like he tie-dyed it, but it's really just the gel bleach squirted randomly all over. Good job!It's looking like this will be one of those patterns that sat untouched in the drawer for too long. Two cut-and-sew successes.Here's the top, nearly finished. I still have to hem it and will do that tomorrow after I try it on again to mark the length.And the shorts, also nearly finished. They still need to be hemmed, which will also happen tomorrow. It's late and as much as I want to get these done so I can wear them tomorrow, I know I'm tired enough that stupid mistakes are likely. I haven't sewn anything in the pants category in YEARS. Yes, me, who used to sew pants and pants and more pants. I've been making do with some RTW jeans and capris because I really wasn't looking forward to re-fitting pants. But another one of my wild hairs struck and I decided to just go for these without stressing.No muslin. No pattern alterations. No fitting as I sewed. No good fabric. Well, actually, this used to be good fabric but it was already made into a pair of pants ... HP Marrakesh to be exact (review here if you want to see them from then). Yep, I unstitched them while watching TV last night and today cut the shorts from the pieces. I loved this fabric (oatmeal colored linen) and held on to the too-big pants with the thought I could reuse the fabric somehow. I sewed everything together today, adding the sewn-on pockets, and even topstitching quite bit. All the while kind of dreading finishing because that would mean trying them on and likely tossing them into a wadder pile. I mean, who did I think I was NOT doing any fitting on PANTS??Well, a pig is flying around somewhere because these shorts fit pretty close to perfectly. How often does THAT happen? Answer: NEVER! ;-)Hopefully, I'll get some better pics tomorrow when everything is hemmed, pressed, etc. I want to be wearing both of these while we hang out around the BBQ.And now that my sciatica troubles are finally receding after TWO MONTHS (OMG getting old sucks!), I will be signing up for the gym in my office building. That butt view above is definitely not pleasing me even if the pants do fit."},
{"title": "Dusting off the Pattern Stash", "date": "Saturday, August 31, 2013", "text": "I'm pretty sure I've had this pattern (Simp 3768) for at least 5 years. I even bought it in both size ranges, which is why you see \"1 of 2\" across the top because back then I needed the largest sizes for the bottom half pieces. There's a number of new (and not-so-new) patterns out that I want, but since I'm still catching up on four months of unemployment/smaller temp paychecks, it will be a while longer before I feel comfortable spending that money. And, really, I have PLENTY of patterns that are still brand new, if not new releases.I was eyeing this one last weekend, and today it finally made it onto the cutting table. I'm starting with the draped-front top (View C) and am also thinking about trying the shorts. I'm severely lacking in weekend wear and these appeal to me. I'm more than halfway done with the top ... maybe an hour left of sewing, but I thought I'd take a break to share my pattern \"alterations.\"First up is the front underlay. If you've been reading my blog for more than a week, :-) ... you probably know that my TNT tee is from the 02/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman. It love the way it fits and even if I don't sew it directly, I nearly always use it as the \"block\" for my knit tops. I really don't enjoy reinventing the wheel and since I haven't been making too many muslins lately, I like the better odds for a good fit when I start with a known commodity.So, the front underlay ... which is just a simple knit tank. You can see that the bottom half of the pattern pretty nearly matches my TNT. But the upper half ... no wonder I keep going back to my TNT ... it's quite a bit narrower at the shoulders and upper chest than a straight 18 (which is where this pattern starts), or even a 16 or 14. And the armhole is a good 1/2\" higher. I like high armholes in knits. They feel better to me. And a high armhole also reduces the visual bulk across the girls, which is much more flattering on me. I measured the pattern's shoulder length for the smallest size and duplicated that on my morph.And the back ... again, pretty close at the bottom, but a narrower neck and a higher and more inset armhole. Again, I duplicated the shoulder length per the pattern so my pieces would fit together.The cowl piece did have me scratching my head a bit but I finally decided matching the armhole *seam length* to my TNT armhole so my TNT sleeve would fit, and tracing the sideseam shape from the front underlay, would probably be all the adjustment I needed, at least for a first try. After sewing the shoulders, I found out that the unadjusted front shoulder length was a little bit longer than the new back shoulder I drew. (The front underlay has a much shorter length on purpose, per the design.) I think I messed up the length when working with the front armhole, but a little tuck on the shoulder seam near the cowl/drape and no one will be the wiser unless they're reading this. If this is clear as mud, wait for the final pics and I\"ll point it out then.Sneak peak. This fabric is also from deep stash and I'm sure some of you are still hoarding it. I've seen other bloggers' makes from it and I made a top years and pounds ago. I think that top went home with my sister when it became too big for me. This new top is using up the scraps. I'm enjoying the long holiday weekend. No real plans except to relax and sew as the mood strikes. I made my billable time goal at work this week so I was able to leave at 2:30 yesterday. Nice perk! I'm really enjoying the people at the new place. Still miss my old duties a little but I'm getting up to speed with my new ones and into the groove of actual legal work again. I'll \"see\" you next time with a finished top. And maybe even some shorts."},
{"title": "Unintentional Fall Sewing", "date": "Saturday, August 24, 2013", "text": "It's still quite summer here and will be for a long while yet so I don't really know why I was drawn to this fall-colored fabric today. But I was, and this 2-piece \"dress\" is the result. I think maybe I just wanted to finally get it out of the stash. And even though the colors are autumnal, I will probably ignore that and still wear it to work this coming week. A good thing about a new job is that all your clothes are new again, but, really, they aren't to me and something new and colorful will be fun.The patterns are Butterick 5429 for the top and Simplicity 2185 for the skirt. I've made the top before, but with the sleeves. This time, I left them off per the red version on the envelope. I like it a lot and am already planning another. I wonder if I can get away with a few in solid colors for layering in \"winter.\" I haven't hemmed the bottom and am still deciding if I will leave it raw, use a hem facing, or add a band. I'm leaning toward leaving it raw since it lays nice and flat which adds to the dress illusion. The fabric is a border print slinky. The real slinky ... ribbed, acetate blend, liquid and cool to the touch. It's been aging in the stash a few years. I think it came from Fabric.com.The skirt has separate pattern pieces for both knit and woven versions. Of course, I chose knit. I live in knits. The knit version has a sewn-on casing for an elastic waist. I omitted that and just serged elastic to the top edge, turned it down to the inside, and then coverstitched it in place. I also added about 3 inches to the length at the bottom. The long and short version both use the same pattern pieces, so I just drew a line (it's a curved hem so I had to actually measure) and cut 3 inches below the printed cut line for the shorter version and tossed the extra tissue. I figured if I ever actually want the long version, I'll just use the pieces for the woven view and sew with smaller seam allowances.This is the skirt pattern I had cut the tissue for last weekend and then set aside. I'll be making this one again too. It's a very easy sew and I really like the version with the ruffles, although I would probably only use one at the side. I don't need a flounce starting at my belly. I tried to line up the border \"stripes\" at the sideseam as best as I could, but the front pieces are shaped such that it's impossible to get a perfect match. Still, I managed to do fairly well and visually from a distance they will read as matching and I'm happy with that.Here's a closer view of the twist. This top goes together very quickly. It's only 3 pieces if you leave off the longer sleeves. Four if you add them. No facings or bindings - just fold over a narrow hem where needed and stitch. The twist adds visual interest and with the top yoke, is high and modest. Many twist tops do their thing at the center bust, which can result in work INappropriate boobaliciousness. * * * * *Parting shot: Puppy love."},

The one where as soon as you cut the fabric, you knew it was going to be a fight to the end? This was that.

It's a fairly boxy top, which the belt is hiding.But it will be comfortable in our Florida heat, which will be sticking with us for a few more months. And I do mean sticking.I used an embroidery thread and a rolled edge with my serger to finish the neckline flounce. There was no way in the world I was going to narrow-hem this poly. It was hard enough getting a sewing machine needle through it for a seam. It's very floaty, pretty fabric but it was like sewing through a tin can.It's supposed to close with buttons, which would be hidden under the flounce anyway. I decided I didn't want to tempt fate even further by attempting buttonholes so I just overlapped the two front sides and sewed them together from the top side, in the ditch under the flounce. I did test that it would fit as a pull-over before making the decision to sew the front shut. And let's not even speak of the facings, except to say understitching AND overstitching AND Steam-a-Seam all were involved. It was a Tim Gunn moment (make it work).At some point soon, I'll drag out the tripod a get a couple of selfies with me wearing the Beast and the skirt. But right now I need a cocktail.

{"title": "Burda 8623: Finished", "date": "Wednesday, August 7, 2013", "text": "This skirt is done. Zillie has a crooked stance so the pockets look uneven, but I measured (after my first set of pics the other day) and they are truly evenly placed down from the waistband. One reason I like this skirt pattern is the partial elastic waistband. The front and back are flat; the elastic is inserted at the sides. It's nice to have a woven skirt which fits comfortably throughout the day without giving in to a fully elasticated waistband and additional bulk.  I lined the skirt with some cocoa colored rayon lining fabric, cut cross-grain so I could lazily incorporate the selvedge as the hem, which ends right above the back kick pleat. You know me and handsewing (blech), so the lining is fully machine-sewn around the invisible zip. This is easy to do if you (a) leave attaching the waistband for last and (b) sew the lower CB seam of the lining *after* attaching the upper sections to the seam allowances around the zipper.You can see that I (cough:cough) carefully matched my serger thread to the lining. ;-)Up next is this fabric, for a top to wear with the skirt. It's a crinkled poly from Gorgeous Fabrics bought in March. I fell in love with the colors and the print. So me.The pattern is much older than the fabric. I don't know exactly how long it's been in my stash, but there are reviews of it dating back to 2002 if that's any indication. I've picked the circled view, with the flounce.I have a little concern that the fabric *may* not be drapey enough so  even though I've already altered the pattern to incorporate an FBA/bust  dart, I'm still deciding whether to actually cut. You can see in the line drawing below that the sleeve is cut on. I just winged the upper slash for the FBA, keeping the shape and size of the sleeve with some creative \"smushing.\" I think I may go ahead and make a quick and ugly muslin and see how a decidedly non-drapey muslin fabric works.I have an interview tomorrow morning. Keep your fingers crossed for me. While the previous interview place narrowed their choice to between me and another candidate, they ultimately went with not-me. Which is probably for the best in the long run, because while I did really like the place and the people, it was the longer commute of the location which was the minus I referred to earlier. It probably wouldn't have been a deal-breaker, but now I don't have to make the decision. Everything happens for a reason, right?"},

Next a TNT skirt, Burda 8623, which I've made numerous times. So nice to just cut and sew.But, no, I couldn't just cut and sew.

{"title": "Butterick 5748 - Revisited", "date": "Sunday, July 28, 2013", "text": "This dress may be a keeper now. I say *may* because some stress eating coupled with much less movement due to the ongoing sciatica pain has added a few pounds and the dress is now more form-fitting on my butt than I like. ;-) But the sciatica is gradually improving and I'm hopeful less stress is around the corner.I removed the gathers in the skirt (which is another reason it is now more snug on my rear) and used that fabric to add a 2-1/2\" band at the hem. I interfaced the strip with a fusible and left it raw-edged. The interfacing adds body so the unfinished edge won't curl  and also weight to get every possible bit of length from the skirt. It now hits right at my knee, which is my preferred skirt/dress length.This is the bodice underlayer. You can see that the facing is turned to the outside to create a blended modesty panel, although you could also change things up a bit by using a contrast. The last thing for me to finish this dress today was to sew the darts I had pinned out a few weeks ago. Without them, the underlayer neckline flops and gapes badly. Something to be aware of should you make this dress as I've read a couple of reviews that also mention the problem.If the Spanx is magic tomorrow, I may go ahead and wear this.

Some comments on my vent post reminded us all that what can come across as scolding or negative probably started out as good intentions. I agree. I still don't like undeserved scolding, but I do recognize the intention. Always have.But I will say again, keep in mind this is my blog. I'm not stupid, and I've been public on the internet for close to 20 years. In other words, I know what I'm doing as it relates to ME. You don't have to like it or agree with me.

It's after work, which has been busy all week and it rained on me as I was leaving so I'm looking a little wilted. But you get the idea.I'm also overdue for a haircut, which I'll be taking care of this weekend. Because I have an interview for a real job on Monday or Tuesday (still working out those details). There may also be a possibility to stay where I'm currently temping but I don't know for sure. We're not yet at the point to talk about it, but I hear things. ;-) Right now, I'm just not picky. I need a  permanent job. I need my old income. I'll take just about anything that gives me that. Being a legal assistant again after 25 years probably isn't my dream job, but I'm good at it. And there's a lot to be said for the lack of stress, even in this very busy litigation firm, compared to my last job. I loved that job, yes, but I've come to realize it came with a lot of manufactured stress over which I had no control. I work well under stress/drama but if I don't have to, then why not. I'm not 24 anymore and I never have liked female drama.On a side note, there's a woman where I'm currently working who sews almost all her own clothes. That gives us something to talk about and she asks me almost every day if I've made what I'm wearing. LOL. I think I could teach her a lot about internet fabric shopping, since she talks about Joann's all the time. Poor woman. And maybe one day soon I'll be able to fabric shop again."},
{"title": "Question for the day", "date": "Monday, July 8, 2013", "text": "Why is it that the no-thought projects become favs?Sorry no pics of the remake outfit on me after wearing it today. I came home and quickly changed into my dog-walking clothes to hit the sidewalk with the pooches before the evening t-storms.So, back to the topic ... I think the skirt and top took me 3 hours tops to make. Granted, I didn't have to do much for the skirt but even if from scratch that would've added maybe another hour. And after wearing them today, I know I'll be arguing with myself NOT to wear this combo every week. It's comfortable. It's pretty. It's flattering. I want to dig it out of the laundry basket and wear it again tomorrow. And I might even be tempted if a bright purple and yellow outfit wasn't just a little bit memorable. ;-) A 3-hour outfit, comprised of pretty much scraps and basics. I think there's a lesson here."},
{"title": "Remake Sunday = New Outfit Monday", "date": "Sunday, July 7, 2013", "text": "This dress/fabric sat on the sewing room floor in a wadder pile for about a year (click here to see the too-tight dress again, and scroll down), and today it became a simple pull-on skirt with back darts to reduce waist bulk. Since it was pretty much already a skirt, all I had to do with the dress was cut it off above the waist, unstitch the unserged sideseams about 4 inches to remove the overbodice, then add the back darts, serge the sideseams, add a serge-n-turn coverstitched elastic waist, and hem it. Changing threads in the machines took longer than anything. ;-)And since the skirt only took about a minute to make, I next made Jalie 2806 from a stashed purple poly knit to go with it. The purple in the skirt actually matches exactly but the camera is playing tricks. (If you look closely, you can see the scraps from yesterday's dress on the floor under Zillie.)I was glad to save the print and also to find a matching knit in the stash. I still have more of the solid and might make a short-sleeve cardi for a twinset.I have a couple more dresses still waiting to become re-make skirts. Maybe the mojo will stick around long enough to see them come to life."},
{"title": "Butterick 5749 - Percolating", "date": "Saturday, July 6, 2013", "text": "I'm just about done with the dress, but as I suspected, it's too short. At least for office wear. I only have scraps of the fabric left which means I'll either have to keep the bottom raw-edged or piece some sort of hem facing. The style is too busy to add a solid hem band. So that, and a couple other things that bug me, are why it's going to be percolating for a bit. But that's what happens when you use the good stuff for a first-go. Sometimes the gamble doesn't pay off. Still, it will make a good weekend dress when it's finished.I was so short on fabric that I had to piece the \"facing\" of the underlayer of the bodice (it's a facing, but turned outward so the fashion fabric shows). This is OK in a print since it doesn't look unplanned if you spot the seam. I also raised the scoop of the underlayer two inches. Good thing, or else it would serve no modesty purpose at all.The underlayer unit itself wants to flop at the neckline so I'll need to add a dart on each side under the cowl to contain it. Again, it's OK because it won't show. But it really shouldn't be happening.As I also suspected, cutting the pattern pieces with the stretch instead of on the bias is fine. In fact, it's better than fine. It eliminates the need for a side zipper as there's plenty of stretch to pull this on over my head, over the girls, and over the hips. This is a much better solution anyway since there are far too many layers and gathers where an invisible zip is supposed to be inserted and I can only imagine the swearing that would've ensued if I had to put one there and then try to actually zip it.Overall, I like the style and fit of the dress but the layout and instructions are pretty much horrible. The pattern pieces fit together well enough but it's obvious now that this was not truly drafted for knits with that bias layout and bulky sideseam zipper. The construction for the lined bodice is stupid and you end up with seam allowances showing inside at the shoulders and a need to tack in some areas at the neckline, which should not be happening with a regular lining construction method. I wasn't really up for completely re-thinking construction without having made it at least once but now that I have, I know I'd do the lining as one usually would (by sewing both outer and inner separately and then joining them together) instead of the hodgepodge going on here. It's hard to really explain without showing in person just how stupid it is per the pattern, so just trust me on that. At least the stupid is on the wrong side and won't show to the world.To make things even more interesting, the instructions and illustrations do not match each other and I gave up trying to figure it out after the first few steps for the bodice/lining because, really, there's just no figuring out something that is plain wrong. So, after deciding the zipper was not a part of this equation, I sewed both bodice/lining sideseams closed instead of leaving one side open for the zipper. I then sewed the waist unit pieces (which were first gathered onto lining pieces) into a circle and attached \"in the round\" to the bodice, and then did the same for the skirt section. Much easier and NO HAND SEWING NECESSARY. I repeat, NO HAND SEWING NECESSARY. I haven't overlocked those joining seams yet because I'm contemplating de-taching the skirt, removing the gathers in it and using the extra fabric for a hem facing. I don't really need gathers on my hips anyway. We'll see if I stay motivated to do that.I may try it again, now that I know what to change since I like the finished dress and would probably LOVE it if it were longer but I can't recommend this pattern if you're sqeamish about construction by the seat of your pants. ;-)"},
{"title": "Some sewing", "date": "Thursday, July 4, 2013", "text": "I started this dress (HP 1138 Metropolitan Verano) before that day which shall not be named and finally got around to finishing it up two weekends ago. I wore it to where I'm working temporarily and received compliments, which was nice. (It *is* a nice group of people in this office, and I have no complaints about personnel.)It's an easy-to-sew dress but before I'd make it again, it needs some tweaks. Specifically, around the neckline and facings. HP necklines and facings are always hit or miss with me, and usually miss. I blame it on the drafting software they use since the home sewer version (PMB) always gave me the same problems without manual finessing. I used a lazy fix here and just took two darts in the back. Even if you could see them through the print, no one else would ever know they are a kludge fix and not a feature so I'm not going to worry about it. The front facing wants to roll outward on the hanger but seems to be OK when I'm actually wearing the dress but I did force it by stitching it down in the ditch of the CF seam.It is a super-comfy dress to wear, and I'm sure it will get a lot of rotation during the summer months. In fact, I'll probably wear it tomorrow with flats for \"casual Friday.\" I still don't like doing jeans in an office, especially in Florida summer so it's dresses and skirts for me.I'm off today and not liking it because as a temp, it's not a paid holiday but instead of vegging all day, I started Butterick 5749.I'm using this ITY knit, purchased from Gorgeous Fabrics while I still had money for fabric shopping.I hope it works out because I love the print, but I didn't do any muslin-ing so it will be a crap shoot. I did add two inches to the skirt length after reading reviews but I'm worried it may still be too short. I also didn't follow the cutting layout and instead cut the pattern pieces as they would fit so I would  have enough fabric for them. I may be proved wrong when it's sewn up, but I couldn't see much point in cutting knit pieces on the bias even with more fabric, especially when those pieces seemed to need to be cut with stretch. Cutting this pattern was a pain, I won't lie. Single layer and pieces that were wider than my cutting table. But I pressed on and it's all cut out now and actually started some stitching. I'm not sure how much more will be done tonight since dinner is almost ready (Go Alex for grilling for all of us!), the dogs still need their walk before fireworks take over, and I've been hitting the bed earlier than my usual night owl self. I blame my increased need for sleep on a combination of depressed mood and a wicked sciatic nerve that's been KILLING me for a couple of weeks now and a diet of Advil makes me drowsy early.Please no preaching about my depression comment. I appreciate concern, but it's perfectly normal to feel depressed in my current situation. It's not ruling my life and I know things could always be worse, but until things are better, I'm just not going to feel as happy as I usually do. Life has ups and downs. I'm in a down. I'm dealing with it. I have no choice. ;-)Happy Fourth!"},

(Don't answer that!)I'm too tired (after a day a work, a stop at the store for some dinner items, cooking dinner, cleaning up, and then walking the dogs) to make it into the sewing room tonight to continue working on my dress tonight. Maybe tomorrow. Or maybe the weekend. I'll have to see how it goes.But in the meantime, here's my new top and skirt as worn to the office today. You can see that one of the things I did NOT do while on vacation was get that long LONG overdue haircut. I'm a shaggy windblown mess. Partly because the weather is so nice right now that the car windows need to be down, but mostly because it's just too grown out. I thought I wanted to try longer hair again but every time I get to this point, I give up. I really think the shorter styles flatter me more, so I'll likely be calling for a hair appointment soon. Plus, who wants all this hair in Florida summer?"},
{"title": "A Wild Hair", "date": "Monday, April 1, 2013", "text": "Yeah, of course the mojo came back on the LAST DAY of my vacation, in the form of the Metropolitan Verano dress from Hot Patterns. It's a quick sew, made quicker by the shortcuts I used (more on that later), and although it's nearly done, it's not quite all the way finished. I still have sideseams and hems to stitch, but I'm not in a hurry because this fabric screams summer and I'm not yet ready to don the bright prints. Although with the weather we're having now, that feeling may only last another week ... and a tube of self-tanner for the fish underbelly legs. ;-)  I'm not happy with the neckline. I really need to remember this with Hot Patterns and do some slight redrafting before I cut fabric as I seem to usually have problems with their neckline widths and facings. The depth of the vee is OK here, but the facing wants to roll out. I'll probably end up topstitching it into submission and make a note to eliminate the facing altogether next time. (Hopefully topstitching will work and I won't have to eliminate the facing ... i.e., frog stitch ... this time.) I'll also draw the shoulder edges closer to the neck and have them meet in a more round shape rather than forming a \"corner.\" I'm using a straight size 12 here, which really should not be too wide for me. And technically, it's not. It's just not shaped the way I prefer. But really, if that's the only thing I have to adjust, I'm not going to complain.As for my shortcuts ...the line drawing below shows CF and CB seams. Totally not necessary as the seams are 100% straight up and down, so I eliminated them and saved myself some layout width and sewing time. Speaking of the cutting layout, the envelope calls for 2-3/4 yds of 60\" wide knit. I had 2 yds of this print and ended up with enough scraps for a cami or a couple pairs of undies, which means I used far less than 2 yds for my size 12 pieces. I never believe cutting layouts and fabric recommendations for any pattern line so this doesn't bother me and I'm only noting it here for posterity.Other \"shortcuts\" involve changing the construction order to make twisting the front come later so I could keep everything flat and easier to handle for the earlier steps.There's only one review of this pattern on PR and both the reviewer and a commenter mention that the pattern runs big and the waist seam hits lower than expected. I think I've solved this by (1) cutting the straight 12 instead of morphing to 14 or 16 below the chest and (2) using a 1\" seam allowance to join top and bottom pieces. I'll also be using that 1\" seam allowance for an easier and faster elastic casing instead of following the instructions. I haven't actually tried it on yet so all of this may be wishful thinking, but I didn't want to end my sewing time today on a bad note so I'll save that step for the next sewing session. Maybe tomorrow night if I'm not too exhausted after catching up at work.Today is the last day of my vacation. I know I needed the time off because I haven't really done much of anything. All the best laid plans, etc., but what I did the most of was nothing. A signal to my body/soul that I needed time to just vegetate. I'd been going pretty much non-stop for a year and a half. Alex started a new job today I helped him get with a printer we use regularly for my job. It's weird to be home while HE is at work. LOL I've been thinking about him all morning and can't wait to hear how it all went when he gets home.On the sewing front, the mojo just hasn't been there. Oh well. That's just how it goes sometimes. I did manage to eek out a couple of things and rework some others, and there's still the rest of today and, who knows, I just might get a wild hair. ;-)I made this top, shown last post, and then made this skirt morph between my beloved Magic Pencil and the Neue Mode.Instead of being pegged inward, using the NM shape flares out the hem a little. I again incorporated slits into the flare and topstitched the side seams with a triple straight stitch. It's still a boring brown skirt, but it has a little more visual interest now. And I wear brown at the office like NYers wear black so it's nice to have YABS in a lighter shade of brown.Here's the one pattern piece, after morphing the two patterns together. If you have the MP, you can see how easy it is to change up the shape a bit.Next, I \"fixed\" this HP Butterfly top that I made to wear on my last birthday. I wore it that day and then never wore it again because it was just too low and I felt like the middle of my bra was on display. It wasn't really, but every time *I* looked down, I could almost see my navel. Originally, the tie was only attached at the back neck. I slid it under the neckline stitching and stitched on top of the coverstitching to hold the tie bands in place, effectively raising the neckline two inches. I think this will get worn now because I do still really like the shape of the top on me.Next, while straightening up my closet, I found this wrap top that I made a few years ago. I always liked the fabric, which is 3D/textural - the \"print\" is a print but it's also separate little pieces fused to a black background. But I was never really fond of the top on me. And since I made it when I weighed a lot more, it certainly wasn't doing me any favors now. I tried it on and completely by accident noticed that when untied, that half looked a lot like a waterfall cardi. So, I snipped it apart where the inside wrap was sewn to the sideseam and then snipped off the ties. And, voila! A waterfall cardi that I like a lot better. Since the fabric is 3D, the raw edges where I snipped don't even show. I think this will actually get worn now, even through summer as my office is always on the chilly side. A/C does that to us Floridians. We freeze when it's not 80 degrees. I also resewed a CB seam on a skirt that needed reinforcement above the walking vent and I want to hem a pair of black pants that have been waiting in my closet for a year. Yeah, I'm bad with repairs/mending. I have good intentions but never motivation to do these tasks that take 15 minutes. Pitiful."},
{"title": "Frankenpattern: KS2694-Otto0207-Walmart", "date": "Thursday, March 28, 2013", "text": "So, first things first. Here is the result of too many weekends spent car shopping. And the worst part? We both ended up buying from the first dealer we went to. lol Alex's is on the left - a blue/gray 2011 Mercury Milan. Mine is the other, a metallic gray 2013 Ford Focus hatchback. This is the official Ford photo. It looks better than mine. (One would hope.) I like it. I don't love it yet. It wasn't my first choice but I needed to go with the Focus with the bigger rebate so I could pay off my previous car and not be upside down in it. I miss my old car. But it was time to let her go, since it was pushing 100K miles and I could \"feel\" things were starting to go. Don't misunderstand, it's definitely nice to have a new car and I do love the techno-geeky stuff inside. And I'm sure I will love the much-improved gas mileage. So, on to sewing. Yes, there HAS been some sewing going on here. Not much, so this isn't really gonna be a true sewcation, but any sewing is more than I've done lately.No, I did not make this top. I bought this one at Walmart a few weeks ago for $5. And I would wear it every stinkin' day if I could. I love it that much. So, all previous sewing plans went by the wayside (yes, I still have that humungous stack of Hot Patterns gathering dust now) as I decided I *had* to recreate it so I could have another one since Walmart only had this one print.It's a crossover with an all-around empire seam. The front has fold-over facings. There is gathering on the crossovers below the bust and slight gathering center front on both top and bottom. Not so much that it screams maternity. Just enough that it flows over the middle-aged lumps nicely.The back neckline has a self-fabric turned-down binding as a facing. So I started digging through the pattern stash for an exact replica. Yeah, I didn't find one. Why is it with hundreds of patterns, we NEVER have the exact thing we want?Kwik Sew 2694 was the closest.I last made this almost TEN YEARS AGO. OMG time flies.(Speaking of which, Tuesday was the 1st anniversary of The Day Which Shall Not Be Mentioned. How can I be a year even older now? But it was a good day, spent in St. Augustine with my 3 sons. Yes, 3. My stepson is the one who lives in St. A. Tyler drove down for a long weekend with him. Alex went over Saturday and I joined them all on Tuesday.)This is the photo from my 2004 review, in which I noted that the armholes were too low/wide. But the underbust seam was hitting at the right place so I thought this would be a good start for a morph. And guess what? I still have the tee so I could actually try it on again. I really don't know why I still have it since I don't think I've worn it since 2004. But sometimes the universe works these things out for you.So I took out the KS pieces and laid them on my Ottobre TNT pieces and came up with new pieces. Mainly, it was using the Otto armholes/sleeves on the general shape of the KS front. Which I then slash/spread to create the underbust gathers like the Walmart top. I added a fold-on facing to the top section and some additional CF width to the bottom piece. None of this was scientific. I just eyeballed it all. I also decided the empire seam on the back did nothing and wouldn't show in a print anyway, so I just used the Otto back piece as-is, except for widening the shoulders inward toward the neck to match the front of the KS/Otto morph, which meant I re-traced that piece too.And the finished result? Perfect! It fits JUST LIKE the Walmart top, which in this case, is a really good thing. Here's a close-up of the gathering.And the insides. Where, if you're paying attention, you can see that I \"fixed\" the wrap to be right over left, as it should be. The Walmart top actually crosses left over right. But I never even noticed that until today. Proving that we're a lot less picky about RTW than our own makes. Remember that!Here's the back, sans empire seam. Which will never be missed, and saved a few steps in pattern morphing and construction.I still need to coverstitch the hems. The bottom \"hem\" you see here is merely glued up and waiting for me to change threads on the CS machine, which I'll do after I post this so I can finish the top.Next up, another morph. A skirt from a mix of the Magic Pencil and Neue Mode. I wear the black Neue Mode skirt ALL the time and it's time for YABS (yet another brown skirt). I won't count them if you won't. ;-)"},

{"title": "SIHPC Make #1 (HP1142)", "date": "Sunday, February 10, 2013", "text": "The first make of my Self-Imposed Hot Patterns Challenge is done! Granted, it was the easiest out of the bunch, but I was just happy to get back into the sewing room. Work has been very busy, and I've gone into the office the last two Saturdays. And since last Sunday was the Superbowl, today was my first real opportunity for undivided stitching time. I'This top is VERY batwing and VERY '80s, but I think I like it. I used to wear similar tops IN the '80s which means I'm OLD, but it will be fun to be on trend even if for a second time. I'm planning to wear it with a solid brown skirt tomorrow, but it will go with a black skirt (or pants) too. Actually, it will go with many solid colors.  As for the pattern -- it's pretty straightforward but it runs HUGE, so be forewarned. I was, since I read the reviews on Pattern Review, and I'll be sure to add my own review when I have a minute and a photo of me in it since those reviews definitely saved this trial version for me. I'm not sure what my current HP size is but I think I would've started with a 14 at neck and sized out to a 16 for hip. For this top, I traced and cut a straight 12. And it fits fine, including the hip/waist band, although it's still too wide in the neck so next time I will add to the shoulder at the neck edge to keep the bra straps covered. For this one, I'll be sewing in lingerie guards tonight while keeping an eye on Downton Abbey.For this \"muslin,\" I made a couple of small changes from the pattern instructions mostly as personal preference. First, I eliminated the center back seam and cut on the fold. There was absolutely no reason for a seam here, except to use the neckband method per the pattern -- which I also eliminated because I'd rather have a neckband sewn in the round than try to match/finish a CB neckband seam sewn as the back bodice seam. I coverstitched the binding seam allowance flat as you can mostly see in this blurry photo below.I also eliminated the sleevebands since (1) the sleeves were going to be too long and (2) the size 12 sleevebands were going to have to be stretched beyond belief to fit the size 12 sleeve opening. If you DO decide to use bands to finish the sleeves, cut them a size or two up and/or pre-gather the sleeve opening before attaching to the band. Or, take the lazy way out like I did and just turn the edge under and coverstitch/stitch to create a casing for narrow elastic. Since the full sleeves blouse over the edge finish when worn, no one will see what method you choose anyway. ;-)Here's the top lifted from falling over the hip/waist band to give an idea of how wide it is. I coverstitched here too. I like this top, especially since I was fearing another sack could've easily resulted. I don't know if I could've stood another wadder. LOL It's a fast sew, which is also a plus for me right now.I think it would make half of a fantastic 2-piece dress, with the Magic Pencil being the bottom half. I used to rock me some dropped waist dresses in the '80s (with the requisite linebacker shoulder pads!) and maybe I can again (sans the pads)."},

I hope the can't-live-without-you feeling plays into that. (Read: raise!!) My unofficial anniverary is September 12 (when I started as a temp) so I will have been there almost 18 months by the time of my review. Time flies!Update since I first wrote this: My review was today! It was glowing, and I received the highest raise percentage being given. It's not a huge number because of the current economy, but it's not terrible either so I'm good with it. The best part is my \"hourly rate\" goes up and with all the OT coming at me, that will make a significant difference.Anyway, on the heels of my two/three wadders, I started going through my existing and soon-to-arrive Hot Patterns with the thought of actually using them, or re-using them in a new size. I pullIed out a lot that I want to make and will start before the actual sewcation. Who knows - I might actually be sick of this challenge by then, but I hope not because I really want to have these as finished garments in my closet.Here's what's on the list, in no particular order except the first 4 are the new ones which I don't actually have possession of yet.Depending on its arrival date, this will be the first or one of the first. I want this to work (waistband placement especially) so I will need to make an ugly muslin, especially since I don't really know what size I am with HP anymore. I think I want to make the dress to look like a blouse/skirt, so I need to assess the coordinating solids and prints available from the stash.This may go toward the end of the list only because I see this as more summery. Of course, being Florida, summer will be here in just a minute.This one will definitely need a muslin and the right fabric so I don't end up with a sack since I see it with a higher waist and more fitted than shown. I'm thinking laundered linen or rayon challis. We'll see.This one is available for download but I didn't feel like printing and taping and thought the $3 additional was a good tradeoff for NOT doing that. I'm thinking this will be a quick project so it may take a place near the top of the list. Plus it will be new-to-me and I'm a magpie with shiny, new things. ;-)I made this before in a knit but it's HUGE now and only being kept so I can better gauge a current sizing. I also want to make this in a drapey woven this time. I don't think I have anything suitable in the stash, so I'll be on the lookout.I also made this one before and again it's too big. But it fit great before so I'm hopeful it will be successful in a smaller size. I'm thinking white or another solid linen. I'll have to check the stash.This may or may not get made since it's the old sizing (Glamour Girl) and the reviews are mixed. I need to pull out the pattern pieces and evaluate before deciding.Can you believe I do not have one Sunshine Top in my current wardrobe? All of my previous makes of my favorite HP are too big. Since my weekend wardrobe is severely lacking, I think it's time to size it down.I made this once before and a fabric disaster kept it from being wearable. Plus it was made in a bigger size back then so even if it was wearable then, it wouldn't be now. It was a popular pattern back when it was first released and, really, who doesn't need another wrap/faux wrap dress?Thinking of this for weekends and casual Fridays in a summery knit. Another weekend contender. I made this one before too, but never wore it because it was too big. My sister loves it though. I think it deserves another attempt.I tried the red version way back when and it was a disaster. I don't think I'm going to revisit that one but the tie front version intrigues me. A shorter top than shown in the drawing, or longer as a dress. I will muslin this one for sure since it has sack potential.Ambitious, no? Let's see how this goes, and no promises that new patterns won't distract me in the middle. But if I can make my way through even half of this list, I'll feel like I've accomplished my goal."},
{"title": "Strike Two", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2013", "text": "Yeah. Two weekends of sewing. Two wadders.To be honest, I didn't have high hopes for this shapeless shift style (V8805) working for me. I was just lured in by the colorblocking and thought I'd try something outside the wheelhouse. I really should've known better. I know me. I KNOW what works on my body, and shapeless shifts are not it. To make matters worse, I also got a wild hair this morning and decided to line the thing. Or rather, partially line it. Because if by some chance it did work, it was going to be Velcro butt to the max and n aturally I wanted to avoid that. I also substituted a better green for the green that came in the mail the other day. I do like the color combo, but that doesn't help the shapelessness even a little bit.I shouldn't have bothered.I'm thinking I *may* go ahead and hem it and then shorten the sleeves and call it a summer house dress. But I've got to cut out the lining for that because this dress is WARM and HEAVY, neither of which are things you want for a Florida summer dress. But before I do that, I'm going to try a chain belt around my waist and see if that helps at all. Probably not, but I've got nothing more to lose at this point.I think (hope?) the wadders done now, since bad things come in threes and even though I've called this one Strike Two, it's really Strike Three. Oh, what's the third you ask? Remember that skirt I made a couple of weeks ago from the leftover poly print from Joann's. That's the third. I can't go to the bathroom in the thing. It needs a back vent because the hem width is fine to step into getting dressed in the morning, but if you have to hike it up in the loo to do your business (which you do), expect to spend a good 5 minutes wrestling the thing back down. Sheesh. On the plus side, this pattern is nicely drafted and *might* make a good tee but I'd want to rotate the bust dart out. And, frankly, at the moment that's the last thing on my list."},

I have to say I'm NOT happy with the color of the green since I was expecting a more lime than I received. It'll do and is probably a better winter color, but it's not one of my favorite greens.

I got to the point of trying it on and I wasn't loving it. It's a lot of dress. And the sash weighs a TON and doesn't want to stay in place at my waist so I'm going to have to come up with some sort of security/belt carriers.Technically, it fits perfectly except the sleeves could be a smidgen shorter. When \"researching,\" I noticed all the sleeves in the PR reviews were on the too-long side so I already shortened the pattern 1/2\" before cutting out. I think another 1/2\" would've been perfect. But I'm not sure if I'm even going to keep the sleeves. I love the *idea* of the bishop sleeves but in the print and on me and with the high-in-the-back neckline, I feel kind of swallowed up. (Plus it's that puffy time o'the month, which is NOT the time to be trying on new clothes. Argh. I thought turning 50 last year was supposed to put an end to that stuff. I mean, it's not like I'm contemplating any more babies. Oh the things we share on the blogs. LOL)Now don't misunderstand, I think the dress *looks* great in the photo here and in person, and I do love me a print. But I think we've just spent too much time together today and we need a break from each other for the love to re-kindle. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that. :-) On the bright side, except for the previously-mentioned sleeve shortening, I made absolutely no alterations to the pattern. I cut the 16 for the upper half and morphed to the 18 at the hip, and that's it. Back to work tomorrow. I'm not wearing anything new, but OMG ... LOVE!!. ... LOVE!! Mrs. Obama's \"new clothes\" today, didn't you?"},

After last week, I needed to recharge the batteries. Thankfully, I still have 2 days of weekend left (and a nice paycheck coming soon). Although most of the rest of today will be spent watching football,  I do plan to get into the sewing room in spurts to cut out the next pattern. More on that later.Meanwhile, I did finally finish the dress. It had been collecting dust on Zillie for two weeks waiting for the sleeve bindings and hem, but it's now done. I will probably wear it as styled below, with this RTW blouse.When I do, I'll snap a pic of me in it.The zipper everyone commented on is just a basic brass zipper with a \"leftover\" earring put through the pull. Without a jewelry ring to hold it place, it doesn't really work to actually pull the zipper without opening and coming out of the pull but it does stay in place and hang straight if it's not pulling the zipper. These used to be some of my favorite earrings until I lost one so I'm happy to be able to use the straggler for something more than making me growl when I see it in my jewelry dish. Last post I was flip-flopping about a Style Arc pattern order when I didn't like the freebie o'the month. Well, the $34 shipping charge made me close the shopping cart immediately. Sorry Style Arc. I'm just not ready to plop down nearly $100 for 4 patterns. I know others love them but only a few of the styles interest me and even then, they are just not all that and a $34 shipping charge so I will continue to watch from the sidelines.I noticed Vogue was on sale at the BMV website and I quenched my pattern lust with these. I ordered them Wednesday and they were here yesterday. Unbelievable speedy! If I had made it out to the mailbox before the day was nearly over, I might have even sewed yesterday but who wudda thunk they'd be here already?Up next is the dress version of 8825 (lower left). After that, 8805 (bottom middle), with the fabrics below which will be arriving soon. I turned the screenshot upside down since this is how I plan to use them in the colorblocking.

{"title": "Rolling Along", "date": "Sunday, January 6, 2013", "text": "Is this a lovely sight ... seams all lined up as they should be. I made a lot of progress on the dress today. None on the Christmas decorations though. You all are a BAD influence. ;-) All that's left is binding the armholes and the hem. I did try it on and I'm happy to report that it fits like it was made for me.  While working on the dress I was reminded again of something I keep meaning to talk about since it's a topic I don't see mentioned a whole lot on sewing blogs. Glass head pins. One of my favorite notions. A little expensive for pins but worth their price. I also have regular sewing pins (quilting pins, actually, because I like the extra long length) that I use when actually sewing but when I'm near the iron and have a need to keep something in place without burning my fingertips, I reach for these special pins I keep within reach of the iron.In case you don't know why they're so great at the ironing board, it's because you can iron right over them. The glass heads resist the heat, unlike plastic-headed pins. Which means I can fold up a hem, stab pins into the board, and then press. On extra-fiddley fabric or curves or wiggly bits, I might pin proper so I can carry the fabric to the machine with the pins in place, but either way, it's great to let the pins do the holding while I press and literally save my skin.Now it's time for season 3 of Downton Abbey. Is anyone else as happy as me that it's FINALLY back on?"},
{"title": "Sewing Won", "date": "Saturday, January 5, 2013", "text": "But I'm betting you knew it would. ;-)The invisible (magenta!) zip is in, the hem is complete, and the skirt is finished. I cut out a black lining and then decided not to use it. First, I wanted this done already so impatience won out, and second, I was thinking with the poly, it was just gonna be hot and static-y and my impatience didn't want to find out if that would be true. Since the lining is pretty much ready to go, I can always go back and add it if I change my mind. Or, I have a lining waiting for another skirt. The scrap around Zillie's neck is all that my friends Polly and Esther left me (BTW, P&E is not original, I think I stole that from Rachelle). I think I might serge a rolled edge and have a cowl/scarf, which I probably *won't* wear with the skirt.Next up is another make of McCall's 6397.I wore the first make all summer but it's definitely a summer dress and I've been missing it now that \"winter\" is here. If you were following along back then, you probably remember my disappointment at finding out too late that there's a drafting error in the pattern so that the pocket seam/waist dart on the skirt doesn't match up with the bust dart on the bodice in real life like shown on the envelope drawings. (I also notice that the human version on the envelope is the other view, the one without that seam. Hmm.) Other than that, I really liked this pattern and knew I'd make it again, after fixing that error.It was actually a pretty quick fix. (So why, McCall's, didn't YOU do it?) I lined up the bust dart with the pocket seam and saw that all I had to do was re-cut it on the size 14 line. That's step 1.Step 2 was to add onto the side piece (10) what was removed by recutting the seam above. Step 3, the last step, was to add onto the pocket bag (9) so it matched piece 10. I knew I wanted to make this in a double-knit. The first make is a stretch woven and since it has about the same amount of stretch as a firm double-knit, I was fairly confident the fit would be similar. (Hope that confidence doesn't come back to bite me in the butt.)I'm using this printed double-knit recently acquired from Fabric.com. I had ordered two colorways but only received this one because the other had sold out, darn it. I auditioned some different thread colors for the topstitching and settled on the one at the bottom of this pic. It actually matches the light color in the fabric, but the lighting played tricks with the camera.Here's where I am as of now. I'll get back into the sewing room tomorrow, but I also do want to tackle the Christmas crap ... er ... decorations ... too, so I'm not counting on a finished dress at the end of the day.If this one works out like I think it will, I'm going to make another double-knit dress from McCall's 6394, probably similar to the bottom left view. You know I'll be checking those seams before I cut good fabric.Now it's time for a chocolate martini ... which is chocolate-flavored vodka + creme de cacao + Godiva liquor, chilled in a shaker with ice and then drained. Yum! They were passing these out (in cute little martini shooter glasses) at my cousin's wedding last April and I've been hooked ever since. It took me a few experiments to come up with a mix that tasted like those, but even the trials tasted pretty darn good. Hic!"},

What I ate for dinner immediately started arguing with the stomach and made a reappearance shortly thereafter. Then it was nap time, up again at 10-ish, but still not ready for anything to replace dinner, including said martinis. Sigh. At least it wasn't a lasting bug and I'm perfectly fine today. The cocktails will keep until the weekend. But day-um, a special trip to the liquor store and the bottles remain sealed.Today was lounge and sewing day, interrupted only by the unexpected need to have a new tire installed on my car after Alex hit a curb to avoid being t-boned by a reckless oncoming car. Did I mention that 2 weeks ago he backed up into a Mercedes? Also in my car. Fun times. I've been wanting a new car but now I'm not so sure. Dents in a new car are a lot harder to swallow. ;-)So, back to the sewing ... it's a lot less expensive.The purple Magic Pencil is finished. No new pics since it looks pretty much like the last shot. If I wear the outfit tomorrow, which is the current plan, I'll try to remember to snap a pic of me in it. With the new shoes. ;-)After finishing that one, I pulled out Butterick 5566 simply because I'd already made a version of it once and wouldn't need to cut and alter tissue. But I didn't cut any of the official envelope views. Not enough fabric for anything more than a very basic pencil skirt. Instead I cut the plain front which is hidden under the draped gray and beige skirts, bottom left and right.It's not done yet. I still need to install the invisible zip in the back, add the waist facings, and then hem it. I think I'm also going to line it so that will delay completion a little more. But none of that is difficult . Once I get back in the sewing room, it should go quickly. I just hope me getting back in there is quick too.Happy New Year!"},
{"title": "Simplicity 2474 in purple mosaic", "date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "text": "I sewed! I sewed! OK, you can get up off the floor now. :-)This top is probably the last make of 2012 for me. Tomorrow is a half-day at work but it's also going to be Tyler's last day with us as he's taking off for St. Augustine to ring in the New Year with his big brother Michael, and then back to North Carolina and being a Marine the day after. We'll have dinner together before he leaves and then I think I'll be doing some toasting of my own and it's probably not a good idea to mix that with the sewing machines. The skirt is not actually sewn yet ... just the front pinned onto Zillie for photo loveliness purposes. The pattern is Simplicity 2474, and the last thing I bought it for was this simple top. But a simple top is what I was after since the Joann's fabric bought yesterday is from their lovely (cough:cough) polyester collection and I did not want to fight slippery poly with fussy details. It will be a nice layering piece in the winter and then move into spring and summer nicely.I bought 2 yds since I didn't have a pattern in mind until last night. This pattern calls for just under 2 yds. Even after adding 3 inches to the length at the hem, I only used 28 inches of those 2 yards. Which means there will be a matching skirt for a 2-piece \"dress\" sometime in the near future. Part of the fabric savings was that I used pre-made bias binding for the neck and sleeve facings, and part was pattern layout stupidity. I made a quick muslin and decided a real FBA was in order and so made a 1/2\" adjustment. I started with the 14 at the neckline, graded out to the 16  at upper bust, 18 at hips, and ended up adding an additional 3/8\" at the hip sideseam. Thank you holiday treats at the office I didn't resist this year. Back on the wagon this week, that's for sure.These two pieces are all there is if, like me, you don't use the 2 facing pieces. The pattern calls for a CF seam, for no discernible reason I could see. So I eliminated it, which also helped in the fabric stinginess. I kept the CB seam since it does have some shaping.Here's a shot of the inside and the black bias used for the neckline facing. I think it would've been nigh on impossible to make self-fabric bias with the slippery poly. I'm glad I didn't even try.The sleeves have a pleat at the hem, which you can sorta see here. You can also see the same bias used to finish the sleeve hems. The top is simple but I like it. And since it is poly, it will be easy through the laundry. I think it will get a lot of wear since it goes with the purple and with black. And if I make that matching skirt, I'll even have a mini wardrobe capsule. I'm hoping to spend New Year's Day in the sewing room to finish up the purple skirt for a new outfit to wear to work on Wednesday and maybe I can hustle and get the print skirt done too before the fabric gets buried in the stash closet."},

It's hard enough to type without hitting the stupid touchpad every other sentence. But I digress.I know I sewed some things during the year cuz I've been wearing most of them to death.

Yeah, I'd say those were some major rollercoasters, but I'm on the other side and only see a cloud of dust in the rear view mirror. I'm having a ball.

We spent all day Christmas Eve car shopping and he did manage to come home with exactly what he wanted. Let's hope that this time he doesn't total it within a month. ;-)Alex's gift to us was tickets to Blue Man Group at Universal for Christmas night, which was a blast and also means that I actually was at Universal Studios for two Christmases in a row since Alex and I spent all day there Christmas Day 2011. Who wudda thunk? Yes, Life Is Good.Also from the Life Is Good Department, shopping today. For moi. I'm not gonna lie ... love those me-shopping days.

And there's at least 30 pairs you can't see at the ends of those shelves and the floor to the right. Shoes and fabric. What can I say?Also for me today ... another wild hair but this time at the nail salon. Aren't they cool? I've been inspired by nails on Pinterest lately and decided to just go for it today. Love them! (Hate the old lady hands.)And speaking of fabric.

This time for my sister for Christmas, on request after trying mine on last winter. I cut it out today and will sew it either tomorrow or during the week. It's a fast sew, if I remember correctly. Here's mine from 2 years ago. Hers will be purple Sophia knit. I still wear mine since sizing isn't really an issue in this drapey style. I'm sure I could make it smaller and it would still fit about the same.For me, I did manage to eek out one Magic Pencil from the leftover purple Sophia, so that's ready to be sewn.The other Not-for-Me is this infinity scarf for the \"white elephant\" gift exchange at work on Tuesday. The rules for our exchange are to spend no money, find something, anything you already own that you want to part with, and re-gift it. We did this last year too and it was pretty funny since you start by unwrapping one gift but it can be \"stolen\" along the way by the later unwrappers. I've had this fabric in my stash for years and these infinity scarves seem to be trendy right now so maybe it will be a winner. If not, less than an hour was spent making it (thanks to Dawn's tutorial here) and these 2 yards are now out of the stash and can stop mocking me.Since I'm basically a Scrooge, this will probably be the extent of any holiday sewing or crafting.In other news, both the shoes and the fabric I recently ordered arrived. The shoes went back since they weren't immediately comfortable. Sob. Half the fabric is also going back since I'm not thrilled with it. I have too large a stash to just keep what I don't love and I'd rather have the money back to buy what I do.

I'm staying away from the dreaded scale but I'm sure I've added a couple lbs since last weekend. Here's the whole outfit as I wore it all day long. Side note: No Nonsense tights - best ever! Finally a pair of hose that doesn't creep downward during the day and doesn't reach to my armpits when I put them on. Lots of colors on their website too ... some of which I'll be buying soon.

{"title": "Orphaned No More", "date": "Sunday, November 25, 2012", "text": "I'm done, and I finally have something to go with the nearly-orphaned skirt I made last winter and have yet to wear. It was nice to sew with a woven. I haven't done any edgestitching for a while. Or buttonholes. Ug. ;-) But I took my time (boy, did I ever!) and the blouse is beautifully sewn ... if I do say so myself. There was absolutely no frog-stitching on this, which I think may be a first. Too bad the fit isn't perfect too. lol But as I said yesterday, it's passable and I will wear the new blouse. Even if I will have to iron it with each laundering. In fact, I have it lined up for tomorrow when it's back to work I go. I'll layer a black vee neck cardi with it and the not-orphan skirt, and my fun shiny (patent) wine shoes.I'll try to get a pic of me in the outfit tomorrow when I get home.Before taking pics tonight, I did a little \"surgery\" on Zillie. I took off her old 44DD bra and sacrificed one of my current 36s, removing lots of stuffing in the process. I also dialed her width settings waaaay down. As Bunny commented, that felt good! She still needs some work and I'll have to sew her cover smaller at some point, but at least now I could get the blouse onto her easily.A couple of you have asked for details on my erect back alteration. Well, there really isn't much to it. It's basically the opposite of a dowager's hump alteration, or just like a swayback alteration which is usually done at the waist. Erect posture means less fabric is needed to go from the base of the neck to the waist ... being a straighter line, shorter distance, and all.To remove what is excess length for me without affecting the sideseams, I slash the back below the neck and above the waist, like this below, leaving a hinge at the side (armhole in this case).The I overlap the slash at CB about 1/2\" (your overlap may vary depending on your body) and tape the overlap in place.This will make a CB cut-on-fold line \"crooked\" (see the tissue to the left of the yellow line above). Ignore it and align the top and bottom of the cut-on-fold line of the pattern piece with the fold of the fabric and cut as usual. It works out fine this way. Technically, it gives a little more ease across the back but hardly noticeable. But more important, collar/neckband pieces still fit the neckline without further adjustment. You *could* add a CB seam if there isn't one, but I don't unless I actually want that seam.Hope this was all clear."},

I think I'm still in a turkey coma. ;-) Zillie needs a body makeover because this blouse barely fits around her but is more than OK on me. All that's left is to sew the cuffs onto the sleeves, hem the peplum, and then buttonholes and buttons.I'im not madly in love with it because there's something funky with the armholes, but it's not bad enough to  stop me from wearing it - especially under a cardi. I should've made another muslin once I adjusted the sleeves and narrowed the shoulders but I thought those adjustments would be enough. They weren't. The armholes are too low and not scooped inward enough for a good fit on me. What I have now is basically a RTW fit. Oh well. At least my erect back adjustment worked and I won't be tugging it down from my neck so that's one improvement over most RTW blouses for me.I ended up NOT lengthening the bodice above the peplum because I realized that by making the same adjustment to the back, I'd move the back peplum seam down and it lands in the perfect spot as it is. And, really, the front tie is where it's supposed to be but I thought it would *look* better lower, i.e., it would visually lengthen my torso. I did lengthen the peplum itself by 2\". I'm not sure I'll keep all of that addition yet but it's easier to cut off than add on later.The fabric doesn't photograph very well, as it looks like a very puckered sheet. In real life, it's much drapier than it appears here and has a slight vertical rib texture. And the puckers are because it's straining on Zillie. And needs a good pressing.One thing I *will* like about this blouse once it's done is that it will pair with my wine plaid Magic Pencil and finally that skirt won't be an orphan. (The knit I bought to make a top to wear with the skirt matched fine, but the fabric was yucky so I returned it and once again the skirt was orphaned.)"},

I got up around 8:30 a.m. and peeled about 20 huge sweet potatoes and then set about to make my annual Sweet Potato Soufle, Alex's favorite part of the meal. We were over at Alex's friend's house at 12:30 p.m. and almost immediately were sitting down eating Thanksgiving \"dinner.\" That's the earliest I've ever eaten on Thanksgiving! It's now 11:15 p.m. and I'm still full. Alex and his friend are camping with the friend's grandparents at a state park about an hour away. The grandparents are RV'ing it, while the \"boys\" will be in a tent. Which means I've been home alone since about 4 p.m. and I've been a turnip. But I'm really enjoying being a turnip, camped out in my own style - on my bed, with football on the TV, and the dogs snoozing next to me. As you can see, Chili has made himself a nest. He probably won't move much for the rest of the night. Neither will I. I needed a turnip afternoon/evening since last night was a doozy, out bar hopping in Ybor City with a friend from work. We had a great time, but I was feeling it this morning. I' m obviously waaaaay out of practice. lolSince Alex really wanted his own \"leftovers,\" tomorrow I will put our turkey in the oven and at some point make mashed potatoes and the proverbial green bean casserole. I made a second dish of the sweet potatoes this morning so those will only have to be reheated. There will be no Black Friday shopping here (I detest shopping crowds) so there may even be some sewing while the turkey cooks.I'm thankful for a happy and healthy life, my wonderful sons, my great job (which, yes, I still love!), my snuggly pups, a nice home, new friends and old, a full stash closet, and much, much  more.

I really NEED a white blouse.But first, a muslin. This will not be a fast sew, but I have a short work week coming up followed by a long weekend so I'll have some time to devote to a slower project. I want this to turn out well which means I will have to keep reminding myself that it's not a race since I do tend to be an impatient soul in the sewing room.The muslin is not bad, but a muslin was definitely needed since there will be some tweaks required. I started with the 16 at neck/armholes, grading outward to the 20 by the hips. The only other adjustment so far was to square the shoulders before cutting out the pattern. I read the PR reviews for this pattern and no one (not neven Belinda!) mentioned an FBA. There's no sewn bust dart in the pattern but obviously bust room is built into the waist/tie/gather area because I definitely do not need an FBA with this pattern. Nice.What I DO need to adjust are (1) widen the sleeve bicep - not a surprise since I cut a smaller sleeve than I should've per the size I used in an attempt to eliminate bogus sleeve cap ease. That no cap ease part worked, but now I need a little more bicep ease instead. (2) erect back adjustment, which is a usual adjustment for me in a woven blouse and why most RTW blouses drive me crazy. You can sort of see the back neck folding at my shoulders, which is the indication I need this adjustment in a pattern. And (3) to lengthen the upper bodice above the peplum so the tie hits me lower, and to lengthen the top overall since I think it's a bit too short (it's unhemmed here). The best adjustment will be for me to add about 3/4\" above the peplum and also add another 1/2\" TO the peplum. This will be one of those times I will be reminding myself it's not a race and to not take the faster way of just adding above the the peplum.None of these adjustments are difficult but they will take some time and I'm not up for them tonight. I might not be tomorrow either since I have to enter the grocery store with the hoards to get our Turkey Day fixn's. Alex and I are invited to his friend's family gathering but Alex still wants his own turkey, etc. at home for later.On a slightly sad note, this will be Tyler's first Thanksgiving away from family.

{"title": "Neue Mode 23150: Finished", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2012", "text": "Hot off the machines, here's the finished skirt.And the pattern again, so you don't have to flip back a post.I like it, and it's an easy sew. You can see in the pic above that there is a slight bell curve at the hem. But it still hugs at the hips, which is better for me than a regular A-line shape. Like a pencil skirt with flare.There are two reviews for this skirt on PR (and if I ever get motivated to post there again, I might add this as a third). One mentions that the waist yoke isn't shaped like the drawing and the other mentions that the yoke is narrower than the drawing. I didn't find either to be the case. The yoke definitely curves upward in the front, although it's hard to see on Zillie because of the elastic. And all I can think of for the other comment was that the reviewer didn't add the seam allowances. I found the pattern true to size, although it's European sizing. I made a 46 with no alterations. (Correction - I just re-read the reviews and the one comment about the shaped yoke agrees it's shaped, but the skirt top is not.)What IS off on the waist yoke is finishing it. If you follow the boilerplated instructions, you'd get a stitching line in the middle of it where the elastic is stitched down. I thought that would look weird (not that it's gonna show anyway) so instead of stitching it down at the bottom of the folded-over elastic, I triple straight-stitched at the top edge. That keeps it from flopping upward, matches the triple straight-stitch topstitching at the seams, and looks better than a line through the middle of the yoke.I left slits at the bottom of the sideseams. The pattern instructs to leave a slit at the center back. I'm a rebel. lolSo, now that I've made it I think I'll morph this with the beloved Magic Pencil. There's no real reason for me to have a yoke since I'm not going to tuck in, and it will eliminate two pattern pieces."},

{"title": "Two-Piece Dress Finished", "date": "Saturday, November 3, 2012", "text": "It's nice to start the weekend with a new outfit to wear when the weekend is over and it's back to work. There was no sewing last night. My sister called and that wiped out my sewing time, since we gabbed for about 2 hours. So I got up this morning and finished the Simplicity 1849 top and then spent 2 minutes sewing the matching Magic Pencil skirt. OK, a little longer than 2 minutes, but not much. ;-) Here's the finished top, now fully hemmed.And with the skirt, to make a 2-piece \"dress.\" I have the feeling that these 2 pieces will get a lot of mileage, worn both together and separately. They are so *my* colors. And I do love me a print or two. Totally unplanned, but I like the way the print does NOT match across the bust but does further down where the 2 pieces meet up. Adds to the dress illusion while also breaking up the horizontal striping a little bit. The only thing better would be if the dark area hit the waist but one can't have everything in a quickie project and 2 yds of fabric.Here's a closer view of the twist/knot area. You can see that there is a fair amount of pull/gathering going on here so why the smaller overlay was drafted to end up with virtually no stretch is beyond me. I'm glad I caught that and changed it. Nancy K asked about the clear elastic applied to the neckline. I'll do a full photo tutorial on that soon-ish, but for now ... go back about 3 or so posts and you'll see more detail from the post on my brown dotty drape neck top. And yes, after stitching on the elastic I turn and coverstitch, as you can see below. For those without a CS machine, you can twin needle it instead. You want some stretch but also recovery, which is why I wouldn't recommend just a straight stitch to finish. On this top, I applied the clear elastic in 3 separate passes - once for each side of the vee (leaving a little tail hanging center front) and then the back neckline separately. I then attached at the shoulder seams and coverstitched in one pass, starting at the point of the vee (where those little tails come in handy to grab on to). It didn't have to be perfect at the point since the overlay covers it, but mine turned out pretty well anyway. Probably precisely because it IS covered up. Hah.Now I'm off to run some errands, including a stop a Joann's for another black invisible zip for that black skirt above which mocks me. I'll get some me-modeled pics of the recent new makes soon. I also almost forgot that this top is actually a \"muslin,\" so I'll be cutting the originally planned solid knit top when I get back. Maybe I'll have TWO new outfits for next week.Don't forget to change your clocks tonight! I think I'll be sewing for that extra hour. :-)"},

My grandparents and/or great-grandparents all came through Ellis Island and stayed. All of my family are New Yorkers. I've personally been to every place being shown hit by Sandy at one time or another in my life. My maternal grandparents moved to the Jersey Shore when I was a very young girl and we used to go to Seaside Heights regularly. It now almost doesn't exist, although it always will live in my memories. The pictures on TV pang my heart and I sincerely pray for everyone affected by the storm.It feels kind of silly to be posting my sewing progress now but since that's what I started out to do, I'll go ahead and finish. I finished the neck edges with clear elastic and a turn under and then basted the sideseams for a try-on. Although it would have been passable, I decided the left (your right) side piece really did need to be cut with more stretch so I removed the first one, cut a new piece, and then continued on. This pic below is with the original piece. You can't really see a difference between this pic and the next with the replacement piece, but I can feel it. Less unnatural pull on that side.Pardon the non-matching dress underneath, but that's what I wore to work and I didn't change to sew.

Tonight I cut out the Simplicity 1849 \"muslin\" which, as you can see, isn't really a muslin at all. This is actually a fairly new ITY knit, bought from Fabric.com a couple of weeks ago. It barely made it out of the washer/dryer before it hit the cutting table.So far, so good. At least as far as pieces fitting together. I need to baste the back piece on before I know whether it really fits. I do have a concern about the left overlay piece (on your right), since the way it's supposed to be cut (and was) ends up with no side-to-side stretch. It's basted in place until the try-on and will be easy enough to recut in the opposite direction if I find the stretch is needed. I'm also following Sheila's lead and leaving off the cumbersome facings. I'll just turn the neck edges under and coverstitch, probably over some clear elastic for stability and recovery.I had a few questions about my Ottobre TNT tee. The issue is 02/2007 and is still available here. Here's all the patterns in this issue and now that I've revisited it, I see a couple of skirts I forgot I wanted to make. Looks like the Carnival of Skirts will continue into November here.Speaking of skirts, I also cut out another Magic Pencil from the \"muslin\" leftovers and it's laying on my pattern cabinet waiting its turn. If all goes well, I'll have a 2-piece \"dress\" and 2 separates that will fit into my wardrobe nicely.

This is one of the items I made a special trip to Joann's for last weekend, joining the throngs of Halloween shoppers to do so. Of course it went in PERFECTLY first time, including the waistband joining seams lining up exactly next to each other across the zip. Of course. I will probably have to glare at it a week or two before I'm ready to rip out the current zip and replace it. So, I guess technically I finished the Carnival of Skirts challenge even if only one of my two skirts is currently wearable.There's not much else to say about the skirt. It's black. It has a number of seams. It has pockets. Exciting stuff, eh? But it's the boring makes that usually get the most mileage so I'm OK with a plain black skirt. It also has a decent twirl factor, which I'm also OK with. Here's a close-up of the boring pocket. ;-)Next up is Simplicty 1849. I seem to be on a Simplicity roll. I finally found a knit to match the burgundy-ish/magenta-ish & white plaid Magic Pencil skirt I made last winter but never wore because it was an orphan. Since I don't have extra of the fabric, I'll be making this one twice. Once to test, and then again in that matching fabric. (And if I like it a lot, maybe even once more as a dress.)Tonight was pattern cutting night. I seem to have found a second and third wind the last few days. Saturday I dusted/vacuumed/mopped my entire house, including Alex's bathroom. Without going into detail, let's just say Ewwwww! After that, I went to the parts store for a new tail light and to the grocery store. Came home, put food away, and then replaced the tail light. Hung up some pictures. Brushed down the pool. Then yesterday, I detailed my car's interior. I spent THREE HOURS just cleaning and vacuuming. (It was almost as bad as Alex's bathroom. lol) I never did get the exterior washed, but plan to this coming weekend. It's too cold right now to even think about water outside. Although I fear by tomorrow night I will just collapse into a puddle of jelly. ;-)Anyway, back to tonight's cutting session. I got out my trusty Ottobre TNT Tee. Carolyn has her beloved TNT dress. I have this tee. I've used this pattern as a \"sloper\" so many times I should be paying Ottobre royalties. Here's the Ottobre front overlaid onto the Simplicity. I cut around the Ottobre armhole, sideseams, and length and stuck to the Simplicity for the neckline. It was a similar set process for the front overlay piece, but there's a bit more \"educated guessing\" since the overlay has some gathering spread built into the pattern piece. But as many times as I've used this TNT now, it really isn't too hard to just wing it.This, below, is why my Ottobre fits me so well, and why I use it for 99.99% of the knit tops/dresses I sew. The armhole and shoulder width/ angle are just perfect for me and the Ottobre sleeve goes in like a dream each and every time.Here's the Ottobre back overlaid onto the Simplicity. I pretty much just cut out the Ottobre, saving nothing from the Simplicity except the shoulder width. No need to reinvent wheels.Another close-up, this time of the back armhole. That's a big difference.The Simplicity front is a full piece. I decided I didn't need that and just cut half and will lay it on the fold to cut.Now I need to go find my tights. It is going to the FORTIES here tonight. Who ordered THAT??"},

But they're good enough to clip my office pass card onto and that's really all I want from them in a work skirt. The fabric is a synethetic something bought from Fabricmart last year and it's nice and drapey, which is great for the twirl factor in this trumpet silhouette.

{"title": "Repurposed", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2012", "text": "I now have a new top to wear with my new skirt. Yay me. ;-)This morning, the \"fabric\" looked like this, a too-big dress that I didn't think would be flattering anymore even if I took it in. The problem was, I couldn't just toss it either because I really like the fabric. It's just one of those perfect knits — it feels good, drapes wonderfully, and the print works well with my wardrobe.So after I altered my pattern pieces for skirt #2 — and then chased down Dani who I thought had escaped the yard but apparently had turned invisible instead and was in the way back behind big full plant-y things stalking something in a hole for over an hour (was I ever mad and happy) — I put the skirt aside in favor of a no-brainer palate cleanser, which was repurposing the dress into a top. Enter McCall's 6078, which I have made before, although my pattern is now a morph between the original McCall's (front) and my ever trusty TNT Ottobre tee (back, armholes, and sleeves). Many knit tops use a narrow self-fabric facing strip to finish the back neckline, which is usually a royal PITA to sew nicely with an ornery, slippery knit. Instead of fighting and swearing, I'll opt to bind with my coverstitch machine and or use clear elastic as the \"facing.\" I couldn't bind today even if I wanted to because I didn't have any fabric to cut for a continuous binding strip. So it was the clear elastic method. I took a couple of pics so you could follow along. :-)First, if the neckline has 5/8\" seam allowances, you need to trim it back to a 3/8\" seam allowance (to match the width of the elastic). Then, using a Teflon foot so it glides over the clear elastic, align one edge of the elastic to the cut edge of the neckline and attach to the wrong side with a small ZZ stitch. (f you don't have a Teflon foot, GET ONE. It's great for sewing those ornery knits and lots of other things too.) Leave elastic \"tails\" at the start and finish so you have something to grab onto when starting and finishing. Trust me, don't skip the tails or there will be swearing involved after all. Also, don't stretch the elastic (but pre-stretch it before you attach it). Just keep it taut against the fabric.Next, turn the elastic to the inside of the neckline just the width of the elastic and use your coverstitcher to topstitch. If you don't have a coverstitcher, you can use a twin needle or a ZZ stitch. And that's it. See how nice and flat? No ripples, no stretching out. No swearing.This (below) is what happens when you decide on a pattern and cut out the back piece before determining if you actually have enough length in the rest of the original dress for the cowl front piece. Uh, yes, I did and then I didn't. I ended up piecing the rest of the cowl onto the top edge. In this print and with the drape, it doesn't show at all. But since the shoulders have stitched pleats, close up the piecing seam looks like another stitched pleat anyway. It all worked out in the end. Whew!Here's skirt #2 altered and laid out to cut. The alterations were minimal but since I do not have a flat tummy, I needed more room for it. I added 1/4\" to the sideseams and front princess seams at tummy level, which you can below. Because the waistband fit in the muslin, I had to taper back IN to the waist after adding for tummy, which makes for a weird pattern piece, but hey … if it works …I may cut tonight or I may just veg in front of the TV. Anyone want to place a bet? ;-)"},

Before I knew it, one jumped out at me and I had a muslin cut and sewn together.Simplicity 2451 will be skirt #2 in the Carnival of Skirts.It won't go quite as fast as the MP, since I do need to make a few adjustments to this pattern before I cut the real fabric tomorrow.But, as you can see up above, I did actually finish the Magic Pencil once I was back from my haircutting-elastic-buying-quick-grocery-run trip. The fabric is dark brown stretch bengaline, the good stuff, bought from Joann's of all places. But last year — sorry, and not labeled as such. I used my modified skirt pattern to include a back slit. I think the slit adds about 15 minutes to the cutting/construction time and oh-so-much to the finished skirt. The top shown with it is not really a top, but it will be soon. It's a dress I made that's now way too big, but I love the dotty brown knit and I want to remake it into a shell or draped neck tee.My hair salon always has a wonderful display of pretty costume jewelry, and at quite reasonable prices. Not Walmart prices but not boutique either, and they *are* boutique quality. I always drool over them but hadn't ever caved. Until today.I bought this bracelet. It's got different colored metals and jewels and will go with everything. And this necklace, which is a lot sparklier in real life because the large stones are surrounded by smaller sparkly stones, which aren't showing up well in this pic. This goes great with my hair and general coloring and I'm sure I'll find (or make) something to wear with it.This set I bought for my work friend, the one who was my drinking buddy last night. She was buying the drinks over my protests and she's also gifted me with a couple other small things. I saw this and knew it was very her, and so it will be come Monday.And speaking of the haircut ... here's a goofy shot. Nothing different, just a trim. I went curly today.Parting Shots of the deployed Marine at sea. Since it's been a while since I've updated on him too. He called me from the Philippines the other night. He's probably on his way to Hong Kong now. Most of his squadron went back to Japan but he volunteered to stay on for the Hong Kong leg, just so he could go there on Uncle Sam's dime. Smart Marine. :-) He'll meet back up with them afterward in Japan before coming back to the States sometime in late December.Yes, that IS a Darth Vader mask. And yes, that's Tyler wearing it.Aboard Tyler's \"home\" in the Pacific somewhere.Awesome photo!Just hanging out.Last night my co-worker friend was an artist participant in the Tampa Museum of Art's First Annual Five By Five exhibition. You can read more about the event here. It was a great night! A few others from the office and HUNDREDS of others from all over were there. There were lots of art pieces to look at and buy (I didn't), pop-up perforrmace artists, and full bars (I did). The \"big boss\" is on a buying spree in the center of this pic:\"Pop up\" dancers in the lobby:We stayed at the museum for about 3 hours and then four of us (sans big boss) moved on to a downtown Tampa bar for a couple more hours for a couple more drinks and lots of goofy and funny conversation. Did I say it was a GREAT night? :-)Needless to say, I was a little slow getting up this morning, but now I am and I'm heading into the sewing room to decide on my first skirt for Faye's Carnival of Skirts. I'm pretty sure it will be another Magic Pencil Skirt since they're fast and easy and I love every one I've made. Stay tuned ..."},

I made the belt but I never actually wear it. I just wear a chain belt with it, or no belt at all. But since the dress has been in the wardrobe rotation a lot in the last couple of months, I knew I wanted another one. Bonus that it's such a fast project to cut and sew. I'll probably make another with 3/4 sleeves for \"winter.\"But my next projects will be skirts, since I joined Faye's Carnival of Skirts. Hope to see y'all join in too!"},

Oh well, it's not going to be a wardrobe showstopper, but it will be perfectly fine in the office rotation. And it will move into winter with a cardi layered over it. So, the end result is a win overall, even if a boring win. The reason it was a two-month dress is this pattern piece right here. I KNEW when I saw it that it looked too skinny for my body but I foolishly plowed on ahead anyway. (Why do I do that?)I got this far at the end of July. From the front, not so bad.From the back, sausage casing to the max.This is where it, and my sewing mojo, sat for the last two months:To be fair, I haven't been missing because this dress beat me. I've just been involved in some other things, and with a pretty full closet, hadn't felt an overwhelming need to sew and the desire to sew went with that.But the desire is back and not only did I cut out and sew a new version of NL6802 this weekend, I also cut and sewed another NL6097. So now I have TWO new dresses to wear this week.And I've also been eyeing the fall fabrics in the stash and inspiration is setting in. I think the mojo may be back for a while.* * * * *The fix for the sausage casing was to move the back skirt piece away from the fold 1\" and then add a matching 1\" to each side of the back bodice:For completeness, these are the patterns for this weekend's makes:"},

Thankfully it's only for a week and a half.9. And they ARE nice offices with lots of new-to-me faces to put to the names.10. I was hoping we'd have today off due to Hurricane Isaac, especially since all area schools are closed.11. No such luck. 12. But traffic was very light this morning, so that's a plus.13. The Marine is in the middle of a Typhoon going over Okinawa right now.14. So we're \"sharing\" hurricanes/typhoons thousands of miles apart.15. He was supposed to get on a ship last week and be \"at sea\" for a couple of months but the impending storm delayed their departure.16. Which he doesn't mind a bit. 17.

Instead of being inspired to sew, the swimmers have motivated me to do almost nothing more than lay poolside reading. I accomplished nothing in the sewing room yesterday. Instead, I donned my swimsuit and went outside around 8:30 AM, gave the dogs a bath, brushed the pool, cleaned off some Rubbermaid bins that had been waiting outside for me to do so since I moved, poured myself an iced Diet Dr. Pepper, grabbed my Kindle, and lounged next to the pool until about 2 PM. When I got too hot, I jumped in the pool and swam for a bit, and then got back out and continued reading. Bliss. And slightly pink shoulders. ;-)This morning, I went into the sewing room and finished the New Look dress (pics coming later - it's about to rain at the moment) and then dug out this nearly finished Vogue 8724 dress I started over a year ago and finished it off too. All it needed was the sideseams serged (smaller now - yay!) and a hem. Then I spent more time poolside. It's addicting, now that the pool water is FINALLY near 90 (what my wussy Florida self prefers) and I may end up with some real tan on my legs this summer after all.Now I'm off to do some errands in my on-trend, if not eye-searingly bright, maxi dress and I'm hoping to get back into the sewing room upon my return to at least plan what's next and maybe get something cut out."},
{"title": "How could I forget?", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2012", "text": "Sometimes the brain does such weird stuff. THIS dress is the whole reason I was thinking about the Wearability post, and did I even mention it? Uh, nope. Sheesh.It's been finished less than 3 weeks and I've already worn the crap out of it. In fact, I had to restitch part of the hem because I was wearing it when a sudden urge came on to move Tyler's boxes of stuff into the garage and I (how does one say this gracefully?) spread my legs too far apart while balancing on a ladder hoisting a box to a top shelf and, well, riiiiiiip. :-)I've worn it to the movies/dinner with the girls, to work, shopping, and to the Dali museum with my sister (pictures of the museum to come soon). That's a lot of wash/wear for 2-1/2 weeks! I'm definitely making this one again and soon, but I *will* fix the pattern mistake before I do (even though it doesn't bother me at all now in the finished dress). But even before that, I need to finish my in-progress New Look dress and then decide what I'm going to do with those lovely knit prints that arrived last week since I promised myself they wouldn't become stash. I think tonight I'll watch the opening ceremony for the Olympics in the sewing room so I can do some dress hems and make a decision or two. Multi-tasking is my middle name. :-) Maybe I can get into the spirit and have my own sewing Olympics for the next couple of weeks."},
{"title": "Wearability", "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2012", "text": "My sister is gone now but we had a great visit, after she finally arrived. Her plane was 5 freakin' hours late. I ended up going home to wait Friday night, and finally picked her up after midnight. We stayed up until about 4 AM gabbing and catching up. She did get a free round-trip ticket out of the ordeal so she'll be back soon. Since there hasn't been any new sewing, I thought I would go through some past makes and report on the wearability factor. I always enjoy when other bloggers do this, so now it's my turn. This recent make is definitely a regular in the rotation. In fact, I wore it Friday to work and to pick up my sister cuz I thought we were going out. It's pretty, comfortable, and flattering and I nearly always get a compliment when I wear it. The bra keepers I added saved it from hoochie status. Grade A+.Since I altered this one smaller, it's also a regular both for the office with heels and dressed down with flats/flip-flops on the weekend. Another A+, especially since it now has a second life.I wear this one regularly, just not as often as the previous two. I want to make it again but this time I will add a smidge more length above the waist because it feels like it rides a little too high front and back. Grade B+, which should turn into an A+ with a re-do.Skirt remake and RTW top. I've worn this once and received a compliment. I do like it, but I hadn't liked my shoe choices for the outfit. But I've got some neutrals now so I should pull it out more. Maybe tomorrow? Grade B+.I've worn this top exactly once, on my birthday in March - the day for which I made it. I probably will end up tossing the top as it's just too low and weird in the front. I like the idea of the style a lot though, so it might get a re-do in different fabric and with some pattern alterations. Grade D-. The skirt is OK. I haven't worn it only because it doesn't say summer to me. I'll see how it goes in the fall. Grade C for now.I thought this was a D- or F when I made it because of the wonky pattern, but I wear the darn thing now almost every weekend because it's so easy to throw on, look decent, and be comfortable. It's bigger on me  since this was made last summer so I have to tie the ties tighter. I should make this again in a smaller size. New grade B+.I have never worn this. In fact, I never even hemmed it. It's much too big for me now, but I gave it to my sister while she was here and she'll wear it, raw hems and all. It looks good on her. I wish I had snapped a pic. Grade F for me. But A+ for being gone from the WTF pile."},

The dress is almost done. All it needs is hems and a belt of some sort. I don't think I have enough fabric left for a tie/belt. I've just got some scraps loosely tied around me. Maybe I can do some creative piecing. Or I can look through the stash for a suitable solid brown.Or I will buy one. This brown belt has seen better days and is too big anyway. I only put it on for an idea of a contrast belt.Here's no belt and hands in the pockets. I still have a trail of elastic hanging down since I haven't trimmed it off yet. Attractive, no?I probably won't finish this until next week. Tomorrow night I need to do some housecleaning in anticipation of my sister's Friday arrival.

{"title": "New Look 6097: Wearable Muslin", "date": "Monday, July 16, 2012", "text": "My Simplicity/New Look patterns arrived in Saturday's mail. You should've seen the HUGE box that 6 patterns arrived in. Sheesh. But I digress. I don't usually make wearable muslins. But since this pattern is straightforward enough, and I used my TNT Ottobre tee and Magic Pencil skirt as comparisons for sizing, AND I have brown/white and/or brown/ivory prints up the wazoo, I'm plunging ahead with real fabric. So this will either be wearable or it will be a wadder. And one piece of the brown prints will be out of the stash.Even though the envelope has sizes 6-22 in the same envelope, the pattern pieces are not grouped all together so you can easily blend between neighboring sizes. What that means is I had to rough-cut the 3 groupings for each bodice piece (left and right are separate) and lay them over each other so I could have all the size lines visible through the tissue to blend between sizes. The waist edge at the front overlay was a little fiddly since it's pleated. I had to fold the pleats in place and then blend outward, make my blended-size cut, and unfold the pleats so the cut would include the extensions into the seam allowance. So, thumbs down to New Look for the non-consecutive groupings. I had hoped to be further along but I had to re-do the neckline. Twice. Grrr. First I didn't stretch the clear elastic enough. Then too much. Then I was out of clear elastic so I just used regular 3/8\" elastic and called it done.Hopefully more progress will happen during the week after work since there won't be any sewing next weekend with my sister her visiting."},
{"title": "A Little Shopping", "date": "Saturday, July 14, 2012", "text": "Today was Walmart day. You know how I love me some cheap crap from that place. Remember these shoes I recently bought? Well, I just love them. So today, I bought them in brown too. AND another duplicate pair in black because, well, they're WALMART shoes and they won't last and I've been wearing the heck out of the first pair. Now I can delay the inevitable a little longer.I also bought this dress. Seventeen bucks. I'm loving dresses for work, especially now that I've let the pantyhose go bye-bye. It takes me 4 minutes to get dressed in the morning. Not counting the shower, hair, and make-up, of course. ;-)The last interesting bits from the Walmart run this morning are a new bracelet and ring. Excuse the wrinkled old lady hand. Good god, when did THAT happen? Tonight is the first of what will be at least monthly girls' nights out with a few single friends from work. We're going to go see Magic Mike (because who cares about plot when you have half-nekkid men on the screen, and one of them is Matthew Mc - hi Belinda!!). Did you know it's set in Tampa? That will be an extra fun bonus, although I've heard they've taken liberties with location accuracy. Then we're going for dinner and drinks. I'm wearing the new jumper/dress and the new \"jewels.\" But probably flat shoes to keep things more casual, although I may cave for the brown shoes above. And next weekend my sister will be here sans hubby and there will be more going out on the town. Yay, I *have* a life after all. After Walmart, I fell off the fabric wagon and got these ITY lovelies from Fabric.com. I'm in a brights mood and most of what's in my stash is earth tones. These WILL get sewn up before they become part of the stash. We still have MONTHS of summer to go, so once they're made into dresses, they will get plenty of wear. Parting Shot: These goodies arrived from Japan from the Marine.The chocolates were melty, but still tasted fine. Oops. Did I just admit to eating them? All at once? ;-) Alex has taken over the beverages. I wish I could send him (Tyler, not Alex) on a Japanese sewing book/notions trip but I wouldn't know where/what."},
{"title": "McCall's 6397: Modeled and Nitpicked", "date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2012", "text": "So here it is. I just finished hemming it, but I'm not done with it yet. The seams where the pocket panels join the skirt need more reinforcement. There's too much bias going on there (read below) and they'll want to bag out, especially since there's no way I'll be able to keep my hands OUT of them. Overall, the dress is OK. But it kind of feels like I'm wearing a full-body girdle. But that's due to the fabric. I think I would like this better with a NON-stretch woven. I also think I used the wrong cup size. I automatically went for the D and it's actually a little bit baggy. Not so much that it looks bad, but I think I could do with less room. That's a first. Hah. Or maybe a 14 with the D Cup for the upper bodice instead of a 16. Speaking of bias, I thought I would be \"creative\" and cut the side panels on the bias so the motifs would change direction. A nice thought, but it hardly shows. Except the nap (what there is) does lay a little differently so it does provide some slimming shadowing. I'll take it. There should be more of the effect, but I'm getting ahead of myself.This is the same rear view from the other night because I forgot to turn around when I had the tripod out. Just keeping all the views together.I wussed out on making my own bias strips and used what I had on hand, which was black. But it doesn't show and got me done a lot faster. The zipper is one of my purse zippers but it actually works with this very well, both for color and length. Fancy zipper application, eh? That's what you get when you omit the lining. Now on to the nitpicking. You can see the pocket/panel seam above, and the underbust dart. And here they are from the right side.Do they line up as in the line drawing above? Here, let me answer that. NO, THEY DO NOT.It's not due to any dart manipulation on my part or combining sizes. I got the pattern pieces out and checked them. I even checked the untouched smaller bust pieces and the problem is there too. It's simply a drafting error on the two pieces that make up the front of the skirt section. When sewn together, the seam doesn't align with the underbust dart. Which sucks, because that's one of the features of the pattern that I really liked. Plus, if the pieces were drafted correctly, there would be more of a slimming effect (which is WHY I liked it). Losing that illusion really ticks me off. It's not the end of the world for this dress. It stopped me from topstitching up through the dart as I had intended, but no one who doesn't know better will know better. And I suppose I *can* fix it if I make it again. But I shouldn't have to.I was very good at keeping my debit card in my wallet when Shannon posted pics of her New Look 6802 dress, even though I've had that posting open on my lappie in a separate window for a week and keep sneaking peeks at it every day. I think I even have that fabric.But then today, Cennetta posted pics of her make of Simplicity 2181 (aka It's So Easy 1849) and I just couldn't help myself. I ran to the Simplicity website. At work. Not only did those two patterns FLY into my cart, but four other friends of theirs followed along. So, these six patterns will soon be landing on my doorstep.I got the cheaper It's Sew Easy version, cuz I really just want this one style.With and without sleeves, it's definitely getting made this summer.I really like both views a lot.LOVE this. It will probably be first up.I know I already have essentially this pattern at least two times over, but I still can't resist a twist.For the drape neck top.So, yeah. The internet is a very dangerous place. For my wallet."},

{"title": "McCall's 6397: The Pattern Alterations", "date": "Sunday, July 8, 2012", "text": "The pattern alterations went quickly and I'm now ready to cut bait and fish. Er, I mean, cut fabric and sew. The cutting will take somewhat longer since I will need to cut single layer for motif matching purposes.Here's what I did, on the upper front piece: Raised neckline and extended its and the armhole edge 5/8\"; split the underbust dart to a side dart and lowered the apex of the underbust dart a smidge; moved the shoulder seam back 1/2\" (if you have forward shoulders, and I don't, this is a pattern for you). For the upper back, subtracted 1/2\" from where the shoulder seam lays (to match front adjustment); extended armhole edge 5/8\"; a tuck in the upper back for my erect posture.To address some comments from my last post:Anon: \"When you make the bust dart, what will determine the angle of the line  from the side seam to the bust apex?  Should the line be perpendicular  to the grainline, or should the angle of the line begin much lower on  the side seam\"Two things determined the angle I chose. First, I wanted the dart to point upward, and second, there ain't much space between where a dart would be and the empire seam. I just eyeballed it.M-C: \"All that's wrong with these darts is that they need to be a tad wider  apart, ie truly below your bust, and also shorter.  The pucker just  means you're trying for a Gaultier effect on a non-conical breast :-)\"  The photo must have been deceiving because the actual dart placement is fine. It's centered under the girls. But you're spot on with the Gaultier reference. And Madonna I ain't. ;-)Now I'm off to the sewing room again. If I put my nose to the grindstone, I could end up with a finished dress today. But I'm not counting on it since I'm so not a nose/grindstone kind of stitcher. Stay tuned."},
{"title": "McCall's 6397: The muslin", "date": "Sunday, July 8, 2012", "text": "I went with this one, mostly because I thought the fabric I'm planning to use is better suited for a more closely fitted style. I still like the Vogue 8764 dress and will keep it on my short list, especially after reading Carolyn's review and revisiting her make. I forgot that was the pattern she used for her ponte knit colorblocked dress and I may just have to steal her idea use hers as inspiration.I'm making the view with the front pockets and scoop neckline but I used the plain front piece for my muslin because it's easier. You know I'm all about the easy. ;-)Overall, the muslin is pretty good. I need a few tweaks but nothing major. I cut the 16 for the bodice and blended to the 20 for the hips/skirt section. The hips are snug, but my fabric will be a stretch woven and not the sheet I'm using for my muslin and I think it will stretch out with wear so I'm going to keep the fit on the snug side of things. The neckline and armholes will need to be raised. They are good here, but that's with the seam allowances still in place. I don't think I will add the lining (too hot) so I will just finish the edges with stitched-down bias facings. This will also allow me to snug things in a bit too, which will eliminate the hint of gaposis I'm seeing.This is a multi-cup size pattern and I have to say I'm not particularly thrilled with it in D cup size. White it technically fits, the darts are way too wide to end smoothly in the distance given. Can you see the puckers at the dart apexes (apexi?) in the pic below? (And how 'bout that jazz hand??) I think I really should take the time and rotate some of the underbust dart to an added side dart. I'm also going to need to take out a tuck at the upper back for my erect posture and I did make a square shoulder adjustment as I was cutting the tissue. Really, though, not too many fit issues for a woven pattern. I know I've been sliding my way through fitting lately with all the knits and I was a little worried I'd have to get all slash and spread on this one. That's it for now. I'm know I won't finish the real dress tomorrow, but I'm hoping to get an early start and at least make some good progress. If this turns out like I'm thinking it will, I will wear it a lot this summer."},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 3915 Finished, and What's Next", "date": "Saturday, July 7, 2012", "text": "Well, I pooped out Thursday and Friday nights and didn't finish my top until this morning, but it's done and that's all that matters. Here's how I plan to wear it. I'll get  a pic of me in the outfit after I've hit the shower. I think it makes a nice Florida summer outfit and I know I'll be glad to get this skirt back in the rotation. The neckband gathers were only a little fiddly and that's mostly because (a) I needed to lessen the gathering distance vs. the pattern notches because I wanted a little more fullness where the gathers gather, and (b) gathers always mean a LOT of pins. I didn't follow the construction instructions for the neckband, even though Kwik Sew instructions are always pretty good. KS instructed to first make the gathers and then join the inner and outer neckbands at the neck seam, which I did. Then you are supposed to tie off the gathering stitches at the bodice edge of the outer band and then stitch it single-layer onto the bodice. Then press the seam allowance toward the neckband. Then sew the inner band by stitching in the ditch of the first joining seam. That's really an OK method, but I didn't want to mess with my gathers that much and I didn't want the lump of the seam allowances *inside* the neckband, because in this solid cotton/Lycra knit it would definitely show.So instead, I did my gathers, joined the bands at the neck seam RS together, flipped them RS out (pressed and understitched also per KS), and then pinned both outer and inner bands together and joined them as one. I then stitched the unfinished edges together so they wouldn't shift, giving me more control over the gathers, and attached the whole neckband unit to the bodice in one pass. I pressed the seam allowances outward and coverstitched. If I didn't have a coverstitch machine, I would've just topstitched once. Above, you can see the inside of the neckband. Sure, you can see the seam allowances but who cares. It's still not an awful finish and it's a tee shirt, not a couture gown. And if I didn't use glaring white looper thread, it would blend.As a final lazy step instead of trimming, I made a deep hem. It's lazy, yes, but it will also lay better in the long run.So, next up is a dress. One of my coworkers has a couple of very plain (design-wise, not fabric-wise) sleeveless shift dresses. I really like them. They look so effortless to wear in our heat and  humidity and yet she still looks so pulled together. I couldn't copy them exactly because with my boobage, that kind of dress will hang like a tent off the girls and people will wonder when the baby is due.I went through my on-deck pattern pile to look for a candidate for the dress in my mind's eye. Of course, I couldn't find EXACTLY what I wanted but a few have some potential. The first pull yielded these. Which I then whittled down for various reasons. The two finalists are ...M6397, below, and ...V8764, here. Both are multi-cup sized, a definite plus. Both have minimal seaming, another plus for my lazy self, but enough seams to provide some shaping opportunities. The McCall's has pockets (yay!) and a cool vertical (slimming) zip down the front. The minuses are (a) the McCall's may need some neckline altering to make it a true sleeveless dress instead of a jumper (pinnie to non-Americans!) and do I already have a suitable zip??, and (b) the Vogue isn't sleeveless and that neckline may be too wide. I think these obstacles would be easy enough to overcome, if needed, and so now I just have to decide which one will be The One. Maybe I should go read up on them over at PR.Parting Shot: My laundry room, as I wait for the parts to come to fix my dryer. Apparently Tropical Storm Debby fried its power supply when she took down our power and it needs some fixin'. These are Alex's clothes. I don't believe I've ever hung his undies on hangers before. ;-) My clothes are up next, but since I wear so many knits, they'll do just fine hanging dry. Truthfully, I should probably dry most of my clothes this way all the time. I am glad, though, that I have such a big laundry room here and that it came with these shelves pre-installed. Makes for easy hang-drying. (Outside, with our humidity, is out of the question. Clothes would NEVER dry out there.)"},
{"title": "A Day Off for Sewing", "date": "Thursday, July 5, 2012", "text": "Just a quickie post before I start my work day.The holiday yesterday was semi-productive but I got a later start than I wanted to so I didn't get to finish my top. I did, however, finish two purses. I did most of the sewing over the past weekend and only put the finishing touches on the bag on the left. I've decided I'm going to stop making/selling the purses once I'm out of supplies (which is maybe 8-10 more purses). No sense in throwing the supply money away or keeping the stuff in the stash. I can deal with that plan.After packing up the purses for shipping, I turned my attention to Kwik Sew 3915, View B (the pink top). I bought the pattern mainly for the other view, but you all know how fickle inspiration can be. I used my TNT resized-smaller Ottobre tee for comparison and ended up tracing the Ottobre base with the KS neckline and neckband. I'll do the same thing when I make View A.I really wanted to have this finished to possibly wear today and had enough \"steam\" to keep going, but not enough time. It was already after midnight before I knew it and I do need my beauty sleep. ;-) So tonight, I'll insert the sleeves, sew up the sideseams, change threads on the CS machine, and do the hems. I'm leaving work early today for a dental check-up, which should put me home earlier too.I'm a little wary of the solid color. I don't do many solid color tops and I'm hoping this cotton/lycra fabric doesn't show the bumps I don't want on display. But it perfectly matches the skirt I want to wear it with, so I'm forging ahead.Parting Shot: Hands up — how many of you have done this too?"},

Yep, still do. This door leads into my bathroom from the pool. Hopefully, the pool will warm up soon and I can actually use it (the door and the pool). And the new Walmart shoes? Completely comfortable all day long. Love 'em!I did actually make some bra keepers last night while watching Drop Dead Diva. I kinda love that show, even though it's kinda dorky. But then, so am I. It's good mindless Sunday night entertainment. Anyway, the bra keepers not only kept my bra straps in check but eliminated the need to tape down the neckline. As you can see, I went with the sash. It's just a length of the border looped around the waistband and through the gathering loop (you'd have to be familiar with the pattern to know what that means), and then tied in a double knot. I had a nice compliment on my dress early in the day and I said, \"Thank you, I made it.\" And she said, \"WHAT?\" lol And then at our weekly department meeting, my coworker announced that I had made my dress and we all had a little conversation about that, ending with me saying, \"Nope, no wedding dresses,\" to my coworker who just recently became engaged. She didn't ask, but I wasn't leaving anything to chance. With age comes wisdom. ;-)Here's the back view. The neck is still a vee and it looks floppy only because of my posture for this pose. What the heck was I looking at?Here's the trippy pup staring intently into the plant, willing a lizard to appear. I think he's addicted now. It's easy to joke now that I know he's OK.And Dani, who would spend every minute of every day and night out here if we let her. She prefers to hunt the squirrels but has been known to nab a lizard. Or 50.I had this idea to take pics of all the flowers currently in bloom in my yard but it was going to take me an hour to resize and upload all of them so you get just one. Hibiscus. You can see my bathroom door above the back bloom in the center of the pic, to give you some idea of where I was standing in the first pic. It's a really nice yard. I hope I get to stay here for a long, long time. It's even nicer because it comes with a yard service."},
{"title": "McCalls 6032 First Look", "date": "Sunday, June 17, 2012", "text": "This dress took me far longer to sew up than I anticipated so I'm not entirely feeling the love right now, although I am planning to wear it to work tomorrow. Mostly because I spent more time sewing than doing laundry. ;-) Apologies for the blurry pic, but it's probably just as well since I spent most of the day in loungewear (OK, it was my PJs!!) and my hair is sticking out in all directions. I'm hoping to get a full complement of outside pics after work tomorrow.I resized the pattern down to a 16 and cut/sewed that with the only other alteration being to move the underbust seam/gather hole thingie down 1\". I didn't do an FBA and there's plenty of room for the girls. The shoulders keep wanting to slide outward so while I'm watching TV tonight, I'm going to \"whip up\" some bra keepers to hold things in place. I think I really need no bigger than a 14 in upper bust these days so some more resizing will be in my future if I stick to my pattern stash.I'm going to need to stick on some Hollywood tape at cleavage level because even though I raised the front neckline about 2\", it's still hovering in \"look down to see my belly button\" range. Nothing shows, so it's technically not too low, but I want to keep it that way and the tape will do that. I also raised the back neckline mega inches and it's OK now. The pattern notes as drafted it's something like 9\" below the back neckline. Uh, no thank you. Not for work, anyway.The front waistband is supposed to be twisted, but when I tried it, it collapsed onto itself and looked wimpy so I left it straight (still gathered into the sideseams). The \"belt\" is just a length of the border sewn into a tube and tied around the waistband. I'm still deciding on it, but it does cover the CF seam running down the skirt, which even though it pretty much matches across the seam, still looks weird to me.I also added a back waistband, which I like, and I cut the back pieces on the fold so there's no weird seam. In a knit, I didn't need a zipper so I didn't need a seam. If I ever make this dress again, and I probably won't, I will cut the front piece on the fold too. There's really no reason not to.This dress is supposed to be lined at the bodice. I didn't bother. I just turned the neckline under 5/8\" and coverstitched it in two passes (due to the vees front and back). Lastly, I cut the armhole seam allowances to 3/8\" and subbed in my TNT Ottober tee sleeves (after walking the stitching line to be sure it would work). Thanks to Eljean for suggesting I look at Walmart for toe hose thingies. I found some and I think they will work fine. Some of you seemed to be confused - I'm not going to wear them with open shoes where they would show. They are for my closed shoes that will feel funny with bare feet and they won't show with those, I tried 'em out already.Speaking of shoes ... these cheapies fell into my cart while I was Walmart. They will probably only last a season, but they are priced to be pretty much disposable anyway. At least now I have a pair of black heeled sandals to wear with the new dress."},
{"title": "A scare and a reward", "date": "Thursday, June 14, 2012", "text": "Before I get to the scare, here's the status of my dress (M6032). I've inched my way through spending about an hour a night after work. The pattern downsizing and adjustments are done and it's nearly all the way cut out.I decided NOT to cut on the cross grain to take advantage of the border because there's not much stretch that way. Instead, I'm cutting the border off and will sew it back on at the hem. A little more work, but this way I get the stretch where I want/need it and I can decide on final length at the end. A good trade-off for extra steps.The scare was last night around midnight, right as I was getting ready for bed. I went to round up the dogs for a pee outside before bed (the dogs, people, not me!) and found Chili laid out flat on the area rug in the family room and not really moving. Now, if you knew Chili, you'd know that him laying on the floor instead of a sofa or a bed is strange enough, and that was an immediate flashing red light to me. And upon further inspection he was lethargic, not using his back legs at all, and was very twitchy and jittery. Gulp!After a rush to the emergency vet (thankfully only 2 miles away), we still don't know exactly what was wrong but the vet's best guess was that he ingested some sort of animal or chemical neuro toxin, and to quote her, \"was tripping his brains out.\" Poor baby. I elected to let them inject fluids under his skin (think Jack Russell Camel hump)  in an effort to dilute whatever it was and for me to take him back home instead of leaving him for observation.We got back home around 1:30 a.m. and I stayed up with him for a couple more hours. I had emailed work and let them know the story and that I'd be in late. I woke up around 6 a.m. and he had moved spots on the bed, which was a good sign. When I woke up for good around 9 a.m. he was back to normal. Whew! I made into work around 10:45 a.m., so not too late.That little guy sure knows how to give me a heart attack! No more psychedelic mushrooms for him.;-) Now for the \"reward.\" Well, at least that's my justification after a hard month of moving and unpacking and then the trippy dog adventure last night. You KNOW what this box means, right??? It's the first one to me at this address, and I fear not even close to the last. I'm sure Zappos is relieved that I'm back in business. :-) I may be on a fabric semi-diet, but shoes? Never!Here's what I got. I'm giving the no-hose and self-tanner a go and I need some shoes that feel OK without hose. (Which reminds me, where can I get those \"toe hose\" thingies and do they really stay put in closed shoes?)I thought I'd only be keeping one pair, but I love them both. And these below were on sale for $47, so how could I even think about sending them back? That's right, I can't. Plus, with that cushy platform, they are as comfortable as wearing flats. Of course, I really need some new black heeled sandals too ..."},
{"title": "Where Did the Weekend Go?", "date": "Sunday, June 10, 2012", "text": "So here it is Sunday evening already and I have NOTHING to show from the sewing room. Well, nothing finished or new. I kept meaning to get into the sewing room but then I'd be distracted by reading on my Fire (still L.O.V.E. that little bugger) or unpacking some boxes (on the homestretch now) or hanging some pictures or changing area rugs or vacuuming 10 lbs of dog hair off said area rugs (only a slight exaggeration) or shopping online for a new vacuum (not decided yet) in lieu of buying some replacement parts for my Kenmore canister the hose of which somehow STBex flattened to nearly pancake status or blog reading or ... a million and one other distracting tasks.But I did just press out the tissue for McCall's 6032 and decided on the fabric for it. I'd like to use the border both at the hem and for the twisty waistband. This is another pattern from my stash that is now too big so I will have to size it down. It's not a complicated pattern so that won't take too long, and my goal before the night is over is to finish the resizing, raise the neckline front and back, and get the pattern laid out on the fabric. If I'm lucky, I'll even get it cut out tonight and then I can sew in spurts during the week after work. One of my piddling-around tasks this weekend was to cram those two \"found' boxes of fabric into the stash closet. Good god, I have too much fabric. Not too much as in hoarder status because, really, is there ever such a thing as too much fabric? ;-) But too much to need any more options for a good long while. I have lots and lots of nice garments waiting in there and it's time they started seeing the light of day. So, I'm putting myself on a loose fabric diet, which means I will still look and may even buy, but I want to be darn sure I don't have a good stand-in already waiting before I do. I LIKE my fabrics and I want to use them.Same thing for patterns. These two baskets are crammed full and that's just my \"on deck\" selections - those that I want to make in the near future. The pattern cabinet the baskets are sitting on are also crammed full of patterns I still want to make too. Parting Shot: The Marine made it to Japan safe and sound. He's been relieved of all of his hair, as is the custom for first deployments, and is complaining about a sunburnt head after a day of sightseeing but other than that, he's doing great. And I actually got to talk to and see him in real time thanks to Skype and the laptop he gave me. I'm SO GLAD since I was definitely sad contemplating the reduced communication, and now it seems like we're actually going to be having MORE. He and his roommate are splitting the cost of internet access in their barracks room and Tyler has actually called ME twice now. He's 13 hours ahead of me, which will work out good. I'll be home from work just as he's starting his day and we can have a quick chat then. Technology ROCKS!"},
{"title": "Back In The Rotation = New Dress", "date": "Sunday, June 3, 2012", "text": "I stopped wearing this dress months ago because it became a tent, but I loved the fabric so I didn't toss it. Today, I put it on, pinched the sides to see how much it needed to be taken in (5\" per side), and went for it. (Great early morning no make-up look, eh?) And now I have another \"new\" dress.I was extremely lazy and didn't rip out the hems, just took it in straight down. No one is ever going to see the seam at my armpit, or inspect it (but it does actually line up very nicely), and since I shortened the length 1-1/2\", the original bottom hem didn't matter either. I just turned it up and coverstitched on top of it. The hardest part of this project was changing thread color. Hah. Here's the result. I'm very happy with it and will definitely be wearing it to work sometime this week. I'll also be putting this pattern back in rotation, but will have to recut it smaller before I make it again (Butterick/See & Sew 5593). I'm still experimenting with indoor tripod locations. This is in my bedroom, with yet another mirror that needs to see some Windex action. The dress actually hits right at the knee now but the camera was pointing downward.For reference, here's the original version on a pudgier me. The difference in my face alone shocks me. :-)"},

That's my dining room, where NOTHING has been unpacked yet, hence the empty china hutch behind me. Hey, it's not like I'm having a dinner party anytime soon. It's also not like I have any china anymore. In a weird turn of events, STBex decided he wanted it, and since I ended up with nearly everything, I didn't object. I'll find some someday at a yard sale or something. Or not. Realistically, I'm probably over it.So anyway, the dress. I like it. I'll probably wear this to work on Monday. And, I'll probably make it again since it goes together really fast and there were no fit issues. I sewed a straight \"16\" (see my tracing post from yesterday) and did not do an FBA or make any other adjustment. Gotta love knits. ;-)  Because I had slightly less fabric than the pattern calls for, I did add a seam down the middle of the back skirt piece. I forgot to take a pic, but you can't see the seam anyway because of the randomness of the print. The other slight deviations from the pattern include serging clear elastic to the neckline and then turning it under twice, which resulted in a 6/8\" foldover instead of 5/8\".  I also took a 2-1/2\" hem along the bottom. I will probably remove 1\" at the shorten lines for next time just to keep a little more of the swish. I also added a 3\" wide (6\", folded over) interfaced self-fabric tie belt. Which is completely hidden by the print in the photo but IRL adds that certain something.Or at least I think so. Parting Shot: Tyler is deploying on Tuesday and will be mostly out of modern communication for 6 or so months. Sob! I was actually supposed tobe  up there visiting him one last time before he leaves during this time off I've been enjoying but it just didn't work out. He did get to see his dad in Virginia last weekend so at least he had some family time before deployment. He bought himself a new Macbook last week for his trip, loaded it up with movies and whatnot, and this arrived in the mail for me today. (His \"old\" Dell.) Nice kid, eh? I'm typing this blog entry from my back porch ... er ... lanai. I feel so Floridan. Hah.In more Tyler news, he received a meritorious (and early) promotion to Corporal a couple of weeks ago, which goes into effect tomorrow morning during his \"pinning.\" And he is currently Marine of the Quarter for his squadron, and as part of that honor also received a set of official photos which he sent to me (below). I'm quite proud of him, and will miss him so much. Keep him in your thoughts for a safe trip. While he's not going to The Bad Place, he's still going to be half a world away for a long time."},
{"title": "Grading Down Butterick 5001", "date": "Friday, June 1, 2012", "text": "I've been wanting to sew this dress for years. Today, when I finally got around to it, I discovered that I had shrunk out of it. The smallest size in the envelope is 18W, and I need a 16 at most on top. And by the way, since the smallest size for this pattern in any envelope is 18W, there's no freakin' way that either of the drawings below are representative of that size. Just sayin'. But it is nice to see an actual plus sized model rockin' the dress in the photo. So I mentioned that I had to go smaller on the Vogue 1224 dress I just made but that's all I did — mention it. Today, I thought to snap some pics to show how. I know for some of you this will be old news, but for those who have never graded a pattern up or down, pictures help. Here you can see the uncut pattern piece with the different cutting lines. I just used the offset between the existing cutting lines to create lines where the 16 would fall. As you can see, the spacing between sizes differs depending on the particular section of the pattern. Just be sure to duplicate the existing spacing/offset all around.It's pretty easy. I freehand it around the curves and use a ruler for the straight lines because it's faster. So far, so good. Sorry for the shadow. I didn't notice Zillie was half in the closet. I'm still testing spots for her while I sew. Back tomorrow with a finished dress. I would've finished tonight, but it seems my puttering around wasted more time than I realized and it's time for bed already."},

I obviously need to practice on the mirror shots again, at least until I dig out the tripod and find a good spot for self-timer photos. Did you forget what I look like? ;-)Here's the dress on Zillie, where you can see the print better. This is a thoroughly aged buttermilk from Emma One Sock.It felt good to have a sewing day, even if it was interrupted by a visit to the dentist and then 5 hours of numb face. And I didn't unpack even one box today which felt great too! But holy cow on the numb this time. Not only was my mouth numb, but I couldn't feel my nose or my eyeballs. My appointment was at 1:30 PM and I could feel my face again around 6:00 PM.So, back to the sewing stuff …Overall, this was a good pattern to jumpstart me back to garment sewing but I'm not head over heels in love with it yet. It's OK, though, and it will probably get a good amount of weekend wear since it's comfortable and easy to throw on. And it will likely grow on me after some time in the new magic wardrobe. It's not completely finished either. Still need to hem it and it's going to lose the ties hanging down from the neckline (too twee) and gain a belt/sash. I'll take more pics when it's completely done.I read many of the reviews for this pattern (Vogue 1224) on PR and most of them advised to add length to the bodice as well as noting that the skirt was very short out of the envelope. So, like a lemming — a lemming too lazy to make a muslin — I went ahead and added an inch to the bodice length. I wish I hadn't. I think I'd actually prefer this waistline to be more empire-ish.I didn't add length to the skirt because I didn't use the actual skirt pattern pieces. Since my Magic Pencil skirt pattern was handy, I got it out to lay over the Vogue skirt pieces for comparison. When I saw that my MP was an exact match for the size 16 skirt pieces, I decided to use the MP instead since I already knew it was the length I wanted. I cut a mostly 16 for the bodice but morphed to a 14 at the shoulders. Or what I think a 14 would be since this pattern didn't include an actual 14 in the envelope. It was pretty easy to just wing it based on the outward grading for the bigger sizes.I do like that the skirt is snug since peasant-all-over is not the way to look slimmer. If you're familiar with this dress, you know about the weird sew-in interior elastic casing at the waist. Uh, no thank you. I just used the bodice/skirt joining seam allowances for the casing, folded upward and stitched down. I also did not line it, as the pattern calls for. No need for that either. Finally, I initially used the neckline elastic length per the pattern but ended up cutting about 6-8\" off of that after seeing it was not nearly snug enough. I'm glad I went with the 14 shoulders cuz anything wider and my bra straps would be on display.Parting Shot: The view out of my new sewing room window. It's very green and tropical out there, with a cute concrete table and benches. Kind of like the old McDonald's style. Plus, I can keep an eye on the dogs and their lizard hunting."},

And then tomorrow I'll get up early and hit the cutting table. It won't be all-sewing-all-the-time for the next 5 days, especially since I have to go to the dentist tomorrow for an unscheduled appointment due to part of my filling breaking off during lunch today and while I'm there I'm going to have the other two small fillings done that I've put off too long.

Sheesh, I have a LOT of stuff. ;-)I brought my really big mirror from my former bedroom, which I know I will enjoy having in my sewing room, once I take some Windex to that sucker. You can actually sorta see me in the mirror but the flash is obscuring most of me. One thing I did, which I'd been wanting to do for years, was to spray paint my pattern cabinet white. While it was empty and in the garage, I took advantage. So glad to be rid of that ugly commericial beige.And, as you can see, we were able to wrestle my cutting table inside after all. Didn't even need to take it apart, but I do have to replace the casters since they bit the dust in the move. As you can also see, my fabric closet is door-less. Oops. Don't tell my landlord. There's a few possible solutions, but none of them are high on my list at the moment.

Here's a tip – if you're going to be moving your fabric closet, take a pic or two before you pack it up. That way you know approximately where the piles should go back to and, more importantly, what's still missing. All I had to do was look back in my blog and I had a road map to start from.Unfortunately, what you can't see from these few pics is that there is still plenty of sewing room stuff still outside of the sewing room. Oops. My cup overfloweth. ;-) My biggest concern is my cutting table. It's still on the front porch (yes, really), where it was parked on moving day because it's too big to fit through the door easily. We already had to take one shelf out of it to get it out of the old sewing room. It wouldn't be a huge deal to take it apart outside and put it back together inside, but I'm not sure yet if that will actually work. Since STBExH made it, who knows how it's really put together, and I already know for sure he painted over the screws. I don't know how much time/effort I'm willing to spend on it vs. just replacing it. I'll let you know.My long weekend will be spent unpacking.

I may still have some pictures to hang, but I'm so tired of the boxes that I'm willing to spend \"vacation\" dealing with them once and for all."},

Right now all of my boxes are my new children and we will be getting a lot of one-on-one time today. I think later, I'll force ask Alex to walk the neighborhood with me and the dogs, to check things out on a lazy Sunday. Not a whole lot of unpacking has been happening yet. All of last weekend (it seems anyway) — and then some — was taken up by kitchen remodel, pool set-up, changing locks, and other miscellaneous get-ready tasks. I wasn't doing any of that, but having people here working did take away from my unpacking time. And then I had to go back to work on Tuesday. I've made some progress and I'm plodding along, but it's definitely going to be mid-June before I feel done. That's OK. I'm not in a race. I just walked around the house and snapped some BEFORE pics. Everything is a disaster right now, except my bedroom which is OK. I've got a ton of Tyler's boxes in there but only because there's no designated spot yet for them either in the garage or in the attic. So, here we go … This is my bedroom. Or the dogs'. Depends on who you're asking. I still have books somewhere to unpack and pics to hang, but this room is 85% done.My bathroom and closet, both of which are really double the size they look in this pic. There's double sinks (like I really need them!) and behind where I was standing is the potty and shower, and a door out to the pool. The cabinets and granite are new. Handles/knobs going on the cabinets soon.My really big laundry room, which is a very important sewing feature. :-) At some point, I'm going to add a counter but for now, Tyler's old welding table does the trick. Yes, welding table. Don't ask. One half of the kitchen. The eat-in part, with a big window which overlooks the pool.We haven't actually eaten anything in there yet. I just (mostly) cleared the table for the first time last night.The other half. It's not my dream kitchen anymore, but it'll do. Especially now with new cabinets and granite. Like the baths, knobs/handles to come soon, plus finishing the backsplash, hanging the microwave, and switching fridges. One half of the family/great room. This is a HUGE room, and I haven't quite decided on furniture placement yet, except my computer/desk will likely stay …… right here in the corner since it fits perfectly next to the doors.Here's another angle. I'm just unpacking knick-knacks and sticking them anywhere so the bookcases look like a thrift store at the moment. From the other side of the family room, the hallway to the front door. The formal living room is on the left, between here and the front door. Alex's room is the half-open door to the right, where he's still sound asleep. ;-)The living room, which is 100% disaster. The dining room is at the other side, and circles back to the kitchen from your left as you're looking at this pic.Anyone recognize anything sew-y in here?Looking back toward the family room from the front door/living room area. My Ikea shelves from my sewing room are dissembled and on the floor at the right.  Still in the same spot but looking more to the left. The first door is a bathroom, the second is a linen closet, and you can see a small sliver of my sewing room. I showed you that room the other day and nothing has changed yet. The dogs' favorite feature — a doggie door from the lanai to the yard. It needs to be re-attached in one corner, but it's doing the job right now and fixing it is a lot lower on my list than other things. The wonderful back yard. I have no idea what that box on the tree is. I just noticed it today myself. It's something electric because there are wires running from it up both trees.The grassy area is only half of the yard. Beyond the grass, there are still separate plant beds but the path is dirt. There's a little bridge over a \"dry creek\" as you go deeper back, and beyond that it's more wild. The dogs love it. I love it. Very private, very serene. Yes, I'm in a neighborhood now and there are other houses around, but there's plenty of space between them so you don't feel crowded at all. I think we need to plan for a sewing/pool party soon. Who's coming?? :-)"},

I'm still plugging away at unpacking, and will be for weeks to come. The shot of my sewing room the other day, with a sewing machine front and center, was completely impromptu — that's where the machine was just dumped by someone (not me!). I found my Featherweight in the garage yesterday. At least I found it.I think I'm over the pain enough to share that my moving day was a complete disaster. First, they showed up more t han an hour late. Next, they \"somehow\" tripled the price. Needless to say, my bank account did not spontaneously triple in response. I was between a rock and hard place and frustrated beyond belief. The short version of a very long story that also involves the stupid company actually calling the POLICE on me (who, BTW, just laughed with me and stayed for a grand total of 45 seconds), is that I hired two of the moving company's way underpaid workers to work for me privately, along with Alex and his friend, and a 26' truck I rented at U-Haul. It took all freakin' day/night (because by the time we actually started, it was already 2 PM), but we got it done. And without me having to give that crap company a dime.That's Alex and Chili, my two red-headed boys, in the pool Saturday. I'm hoping to dive in tonight after work.

Unless there are some scattered about in the sewing room that didn't make it into this group. Which is highly likely. And I'm not really GIVING them to you.

At HD, the prices range from 69¢ to $1.12 each. Boxes are $2/ea and up at U-Haul. So glad I found that out before I made a costly decision. I bought 60 boxes yesterday to start. Ten small, 40 medium, and 10 large. I will need at least double that. Isn't moving fun?Speaking of \"fun,\" the guy who helped me yesterday at Home Depot tried to pick me up. Really. It was flattering but also kind of weird. Especially because I now have his phone number. (At his insistence and it was just easier that way, trust me.) But hey, at least I'm not dead yet. lolBack to move talk … I've decided to let Alex and Co. off the hook and hire an actual moving company. They will get the job done quicker, will come with multiple hand carts and pads I won't have to rent, and none of us will have to maneuver a big ass truck. Plus, the pricing is pretty darn reasonable since I'm only moving about 2 miles away.And now the rest of the decent wedding pics … And have I mentioned lately how much I LOVE my job? Yep. Still do. Even though the person who was hired as another me backed out and it's still just me doing the work of ten.

That's my sister sitting next to me (she's 6 ft tall and all torso so she always dwarfs me), and my mom sitting next to Tyler.

I'll share some more wedding pics when I catch my breath.In short, the wedding was beautiful, the reception was a blast, and I probably gained a few lbs this weekend because the food was INCREDIBLE. It was a great weekend. Only to be blasted back to reality Monday morning when we lost power overnight and I had to put on my make-up in the car and then drag my blow dryer, brushes, and hair spray to work to try to tame the bedhead. I arrived before 7 AM because it was either sit at home in the dark or get to work and sneak into the bathroom.I dropped Tyler at the airport yesterday, after leaving work early and taking my boys to lunch in the \"big city.\" I'll miss him, but I know he's happy so that's really all that matters. I've got to start packing this weekend, because May is going to be here before I know it. Because I don't have enough to pack, I stopped at Beall's tonight and came home with 4 new tops and a pair of shoes. Am I insane?? Will I ever sew again??

{"title": "Potpourri", "date": "Monday, April 2, 2012", "text": "Like a good Jeopardy! category, this post will be a little bit of everything.First up, I present my much less piled upon ironing board:All that remains is (1) a skirt that's too big but I'm keeping because I want to make it again and I'll use this one to judge the size I'll cut next, (2) a green slinky skirt that needs shortening, but I haven't decided if I'm willing to tackle the slinky again so I'm giving it more time, (3) a dress that I'm going to cut off to a skirt, (4) a too-big top, the print on top, which I want to remake into a smaller tee because I'm not ready to give up the print, and (5) the houndstooth skirt hanging off the side, but it's wool so it can wait a few months to see what size I am then.Everything else was either put in the donate pile or I altered or finished or whatever it needed. Yay me, and less to pack.This is the scrap pile from the alterations. And oh, that pretty print jacket I never wore should be in the ironing board pile too. I want to save the fabric and make a gored skirt from it. First remake is this green skirt, after I decided it matched my new RTW top perfectly. I never did wear the skirt/top outfit I made last summer and it was huge now. I spent an hour picking out the coverstitched hem, the many, MANY coverstitched/topstitched panels, and the coverstitched elastic waist. I finally found a foolproof \"reverse\" coverstitching method that I'll share at a later time, for when you KNOW you're ripping out in the right direction but it still ain't working. I ended up sewing 14\" out of the panel seams in total. Amazing, but now I have much skinnier panels. lol And now that my knees aren't so fat, I also shortened it about 6\" cuz I'm thinking the shorter hems are more youthful for my ancient self. Oh, and more summery.I hemmed this white drape-neck top I made a few weeks ago and shortened the RTW skirt 3\" so I wouldn't have to keep wearing it up at my bra. ;-)I took in the sideseams of this top about 12\" total from the armpits downward. Unfortunately, the sleeves are still too big so I may cut them to short sleeves or I may still put it in the donate pile. But I didn't want to toss it without giving it a go. No, I won't wear it with the green skirt. Another Walmart $15 dress. I did nothing but cut off the tags and wear it today. And received 2 compliments. Here, I look like I have no waist because the waistband doesn't photograph well. In person, it's totally flattering (hence the 2 compliments!), and the skirt is very swingy. I've lost more lbs. and this one is size 12. Woot! Another Walmart purchase. It's a top and skirt, so I'll definitely get wear out of both pieces since I can wear the top on weekends with denim and white capris. Size 12 again. The same top as above, same size, but a different print. There was no matching skirt available. This will most likely be weekend wear.I'm wearing two earrings but only one is showing. Goofy face. Bright orange top, because I love me some orange. Definitely weekend, maybe office, especially if I do turn that print jacket above into a skirt.First choice for necklace for the wedding. There are matching dangle earrings. The bluish tint to the beads will look good with the teal dress and the whole thing sparkles more than appears here, but not so much as to be too much. The cascade keeps the open feel/look of the sweetheart neckline of the dress.Second choice if I decide to go for more sparkle, but I'm leaning toward this being a bit over the top. My sister will weigh in when we're together on Friday. And now I'm actually contemplating trying on some of my bathing suits because my sister wants to lay by the pool at the hotel on Saturday.

And, I had a great day. It's just a number, right? But damn, it's a BIG number. lolMy mom called me, Tyler called me, Alex texted me (lazy slug), the big boss sent me a gorgeous birthday card via interoffice mail from the office where she was today and also profusely showered praise via email about the projects I'm working on and thanked me again for being part of our team, my Marketing coworkers gave me a card with funny little things written on it (one of which was a drawing of a \"carb-free\" birthday cake, lol) and they all gathered around my desk and sang Happy Birhday, and I got another card from the firm (HR, I'm guessing). We're in the middle of another big project and I did go in early and stay late, but at 6:00 we threw in the towel and went out for dinner at a great restaurant in Ybor City. I had Chicken Marsala and it was DEE-lish. I just got home, remembered to snap a couple of pics for YOU, and now I'm sitting here in my jammies typing away. All in all, one of the best birthdays I've had a while. Even if I can't freakin' believe I'm this old already.Then, when I got home, there were more cards in the mailbox, including one from Tyler and one from my sister, and they both compete for funniest card ever. Alex gave me these earrings, which are Marine Corps Eagle, Globe and Anchors. LOVE them!And, finally, this is the outfit:The top is kind of a fail because the bow weighs it down so it still wanted to show more than I wanted which meant I had to adjust all day. The skirt is on the big side around my waist, but wearable for now. That's what I get for cutting tissue and sewing without fitting. Still, the outfit looks pretty good and at some point I'll probably re-make this top so it fits better and retire this one. I do like the style.And that was my day. The end. ;-)"},
{"title": "Oh, the Irony KILLS Me", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2012", "text": "Yes, that's a neckband and tie on the top. Yes, I said I wasn't going to do it. No, it's not the exact pattern piece — it's actually wider. Yes, I said it would probably choke me and it might, but at least the cleavage will be covered. And it's really not that bad since the fabric is very soft and cool to the touch.Just sticking a bow at the vee point wasn't going to work without a lot of futzing, and a flower was going to be too TOO, IYKWIM. So, maybe Trudy knew what she was doing. But I actually prefer the way I semi-attached the band/tie better than the instructions, which is a good thing since I didn't exactly have a choice of methods by this time.  It's attached under the finished neckline with stitches that follow one line of the coverstitching, completely at the back and ending about 3\" forward of the shoulder seam. Even I can't tell it's an afterthought and I know where to look. And, oh yeah, I finished the skirt too. ;-) Easy-peasy sewing but I would still change some things. One, I should've cut the 14 and not the 16. Two, I would narrow the front wrap flap so it ends further away from the sideseam. As is, it's not really very noticeable that this is a wrap (albeit faux) skirt. Three, I would (and did) toss out the bias binding for elastic casing instructions and instead just serge elastic to the top edge, turn under, and top/coverstitch.With a 1-inch waist turndown and a 1-inch hem, the length turned out perfect for me as drafted and hits right at my knee.I'm still going to curve in the sideseams of the top some more before I call this outfit done, but other than that I made absolutely no alterations of any kind to either piece. Nice. I'll finish the top as soon as I finish typing and will wear the new outfit tomorrow. I like it. It's different than my usual, and it's feminine and pretty darn comfortable too. But, do you think my co-workers notice that I'm really wearing a bunch of different brown skirts or do you think they think I just wear one a lot? It may be time to get off the brown skirts for a while.I'll try to get a pic of me wearing the outfit tomorrow, but I can't promise I'll keep the camera in focus after Girls Night Out. Maybe I can sneak one in the Ladies room during the day but I already know it's going to be CRAZY tomorrow and remembering to take my cell phone into the restroom may not be top of mind.  * * * * *To answer two recent comments — No, I don't think he who shan't be named reads this blog, but even if he does, there's nothing untrue here. And no, he doesn't pay for much of the kids' expenses. It will be even less once he takes off for Virginia. He IS contributing toward household expenses until we go our separate ways, so that's something at least. But with it comes complaint and guilt trips, so I'm looking forward to that phase of my life being done. A couple others have asked about my \"diet.\" It's not a diet, it's just the way I eat now and forever. I eat hardly any carbs and that's it, the whole plan (although I did indulge in the birthday cakes at work on Friday since it IS my birthday month even though we're not mentioning that either. Less than 24 hours people! And yes, cakes plural.)."},
{"title": "One Down", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2012", "text": "The top is done. Well, sorta. As you can see, it's way low-cut so I'm going to have to fashion a flower or bow or some other cleavage camouflage before I can wear it. But that's OK because I think, even with the big \"cape,\" it still needs *something* to visually anchor all that fabric. I knew the neckline was going to be close, but I foolishly forged on anyway. I left off the neck tie as I mentioned I was going to do and I'm glad I did because the back neck is already pretty high on me and the additional width of the tie band would've choked me. The length also feels a smidge short, but I think that's really how it's styled and not a fitting issue. Besides, I usually end up scrunching tops up to where this hits on me anyway. That's probably why it feels short — the scrunch factor is missing. ;-)My coverstitcher got a workout for this project. I used my 5/8\" feller to hem the cape edge, coverstitched the joining seam between cape and underlayer, used it to hem the underlayer sleeves you can't see, and used it to topstitch the band seam allowances into the up position. Everything else was done on the serger, which amounts to the sideseams and the shoulder seams of the underlayer.The pattern is very generously sized. I cut a 14 but could've gone to a 12 or even possibly a 10. Part of this is the pattern sizing, part is the moving target that is my sizing. I can't judge by all the RTW I've bought lately because those sizes have been all over the map too, a familiar lament with RTW that we all whine about. Overall, though, I like the top. It's quite unique so I probably won't make it again anytime soon, but it's a fast project with pretty results. And the general shape is on trend right now, without being *too* batwing to hide my shape underneath. A good compromise between style and flattery, I think.Now I'm off to stitch up the skirt.And since it has flaps/panels that need to be hemmed separately, my coverstitcher/feller ain't done yet."},

I'll be signing the lease on Saturday.I'll be back to a more typical Florida house, with one story. I'm actually looking forward to that. The yard is beautiful - lots of shade, pretty manicured bushes, and many flowering plants in the back. There's even a little \"bridge\" over a dry stream in the far corner of the back yard. Once I move in, I'll have lots more pics. These are the best I could find on the interwebs. (If you think you have even a little privacy, think again!) The garage looks wonky in this pic. I guess it's really two images spliced together. Nice long driveway. Plenty of room between houses. And look at this … … my new neighbor-to-be has a tennis court. lol No. I don't play. You can see a small glimpse of the screened in pool (blue, not like my current black lagoon!), and you can see how deep the back yard is. I can't wait to take the dogs there — they will LOVE it!I took Alex and his friend to see it this past Tuesday and found lots of good features that hadn't stuck in my brain, like French doors, a jacuzzi, a skylight, a huge bay window in the master bedroom, built-in bookcases in the family room, and more. I'm usually pretty good with details, but when I first looked at this house, I had miscalculated my monthly take-home pay and was thinking it was out of my range so I didn't commit it to memory. But then I realized my math mistake and I kept driving past it, and always had a good feeling. I'm glad I trusted my instincts because it really will be perfect for us. Even the kitchen isn't as horrible as I remembered, but I won't have to live with it long anyway. Alex loved it too. The current tenant was there and she had nothing but good things to say about the house and the owner. I'm DEFINITELY going to sew something — anything — this weekend because it will probably be my last before I move. Next weekend Tyler will be here and I'll also need to at least start packing. The weekend after that is the wedding. And after that, I'll only have 3 weeks left to get my act in gear. I'm not sure if I'll actually make my target date of May 1, but I'm going to try my best."},
{"title": "The Best Laid Plans (or 10,000 words on how I spent my week)", "date": "Saturday, March 17, 2012", "text": "So have I even been IN the sewing room since my last post? Uh, no.Most of my spare time this week has been spent looking at houses. I think I've decided on the very first one I saw a few weeks ago. More on that in a minute.I saw a different house last night after work and really liked it. The kitchen was updated and really nice, but there was no screened-in area outside. I don't have to have a screened-in pool but I do want a screened-in something. It's Florida. Bugs. Need I say more? I also decided that pretty much none of my living area furniture was going to fit. I liked the layout of the place, but it doesn't have long expanses of walls for my big wall units. That's not the end of the world because I'd really love to just leave most of my stuff behind and start new, but realistically, that's not going to happen so I do have to make a lot of it work for a while and it would be difficult to do there. I saw another house earlier in the week and it had a beautiful screened-in pool, a great self-contained upstairs area for Alex, but no fenced-in yard. The fence is a MUST. I want to be able to let the dogs out in the morning by themselves while I get ready for work. I also counted 5 bedrooms when 4 were advertised, which is way too many, and each room had different laminate which was just too weird for me. I know I can't get perfection in a rental, but some things would just bug me forever. That's one of them. I saw a couple others but nothing really worth detailing. Some people are just hallucinating is all I can say. lolSo, back to the first house. I loved the location when I first found it. I've lived within a 5-mile radius for 22 years. More importantly, so has Alex, and he's not ready to leave his home turf, so it's been a priority for me to find something very close to where we are now. Haha — I just re-read that and since Alex is still 19, he hasn't lived around here for 22 years, but it has been his entire life.At this house, the pool is screened and self-cleaning, and the front yard is big and gorgeous, set back from the street. The back yard is even bigger, private, fenced, and great for the dogs. It's about an acre total. (Yard service is included in the rent.) It's got 3 good-sized bedrooms, a nice laundry room, wood flooring in the family room, and a fireplace. But it has a butt-ugly kitchen. No, I don't cook all too much anymore and it's only going to be the two of us, and Alex isn't into sit-down dinners much anymore, but still — it's going to be harder to leave my current custom dream kitchen than my current husband (hee hee) so I really, really didn't want to go so far backwards even though I loved the location and the privacy. And, how could I go for the first house I ever looked at without seeing any others? I was so close to putting a deposit on the house from last night after weighing pros and cons, but decided to call house #1's owner (not really the owner, the my-age nephew of the out-of-town owner who's acting as his go-between, but it's easier to just say owner) before I did. I was honest with him and told him it was between his house and the one from last night. His would win, except for those horrific green Formica counters. I asked if his uncle might be willing to split the cost of new counters with me. He told me to forget about splitting the cost of new counters because his uncle was already planning to completely update the kitchen - counters, cabinets, appliances, etc. Well, as you can imagine, that sealed the deal. Let that also be a lesson — it never hurts to ask. And lesson #2, most men are not detail creatures. You have to force it out. So now we're going over the fine points and I will meet the nephew tomorrow to give him my formal application and deposit. Tentative move-in date, May 1. Good god, I have to start packing like yesterday.So, did I start packing? No. I had important shopping to do. Industrial underwear, remember? Holy cow - trying on shapewear which requires contortions to even get on is so NOT fun. Having to do it multiple times because you have no idea what size you are anymore is even less fun. I gave up in the middle and bought 3 that I was pretty sure would fit based on the too-big ones. Plus by that time I really had to pee. They do fit, but I've decided I'm keeping none of them and not wearing anything under my dress other than pantyhose and a bra. Control top PH is all the \"shaping\" I want. The industrial shapewear just squishes me in ways that make the dresses (yes both teal and red) not fit as well. And let's not even mention the ordeal a visit to the Ladies would bring on. Or the comfort level of a hook and eye crotch. If I wanted a bra in my crotch … I should just stop there. ;-)I did find a Vanity Fair balconette bra for $12. It's perfect for under the teal dress - no straps peeking. I'll probably never wear it again because it's got those stand-up at attention formed cups and I hate those, and do not need them, although, I'm losing more in the boob department than I thought I would. I've gone from a 42DDD to a 36D now. I thought I was still a 38DD this morning so before I found the keeper bra I had to try on a bunch of 38Ds that were hilarious on me. Pretty soon it's going to be GOODBYE FBA. Hahaha!If only my thighs would disappear at the same rate as my boobs. As you'll see in a minute.Since I was already in Macy's, I decided to have a look around for casual clothes. I wasn't expecting much since my last trip to Macy's was a huge bust. No pun intended. But I learned that UPSTAIRS is where I need to shop, not main floor. Again, I hit the mother lode. I may never sew again. Everything fits and the stores are filled with MY colors. Have I mentioned how much I love orange and other bright hues? And it's instant gratification, baby. Does anyone want to buy a fabric stash? JUST KIDDING! My sewing desire will return. Probably at the exact time I start packing up the sewing room.So, here's what I bought. All of the capris are snug, on purpose. They are a size smaller and I plan to be wearing them for the next 4 months at least. They will fit better in a month. I even bought a second pair of white in TWO sizes down, because they were only $27 each and I know I will kick myself if I shrink out of the whites and don't have a back-up plan. White capris, $27, which do nothing for my thighs but this is Florida and white capris are The Law. But this is also after 5 minutes of wearing. They are denim and I know they will stretch out some. Jeweled turquoise print top, which I was willing to pay $49 for but I was surprised by a sale price of $36. I love casual clothes with built-in jewelry. Same $27 capris but in denim. Darker is definitely more slimming, but also more hot. And not in a good way. Print tee, $20, which is textured but you can't see that. It also goes GREAT with the orange skirt I bought a few weeks ago. Different brand of capris, $36, although I did also buy khakis from the same line as the white and denim above. These are snugger in the thighs but will also stretch out after 20 minutes. The top, $18, is smocked around the neckline but that wide smocking - what's it called? Bonnie?? Are you out there?You can't really see much more detail here, but I tried. So, as you can see, my thighs are still holding on to their girth, even though the scale continues to move downward. I could live with my much flatter but still not flat tummy just the way it is now, but damn, I wish those thighs would go away. It's just not gonna happen. I've always had them and always will. All I can do is work to tone them up, and the pool in my soon new house will do just that. I'm looking forward to jumping in it every night after work. I don't need to be presentable after I get out and there will be no one around to see me in a bathing suit since Alex works most nights and the dogs don't care. In fact, they'll probably jump in with me. lolI'm hoping to finally get into the sewing room tomorrow, but I can't promise. My life is about to take off again and it's exhausting.But have I mentioned lately that I love my job! ?? :-)"},
{"title": "Very Quick Sunday Update", "date": "Sunday, March 11, 2012", "text": "I managed to do only a few things on my ambitious list, but the cammi purse was one of them and it's now done and boxed up ready to ship. Whew!I also went to see Act of Valor with Alex and one of his friends last night. It was a good movie, but not quite as good as I was hoping for. Hard to explain, but there *was* a lot of hype to live up to. Still, mega kudos to the actual SEALs both in the movie (uncredited to protect their identities) and not. Special Forces do so many things that we never know about, but we would surely know and feel it if they weren't there.Semi-related, someone (Meredith?) asked where Tyler will be deploying. Sometime around June after pre-D leave and then pre-D training, he'll be on a ship, not boots on the ground, so that's safer and makes me happy. But I won't say on the blog exactly where they're headed because military families are not supposed to give out troop movement details and I will, of course, honor that. But his final destination besides floating around on the ocean should be an interesting and fun adventure for him and I will certainly share more details when he gets back. I didn't do any of the alterations I have lined up, but they'll keep a while longer. Why do we stitchers HATE doing alterations so much? lol Instead, I went through my pattern pile and picked out some I want on the short list. Unfortunately, it was still about 20 patterns and there's no way I will make them all anytime soon. But a girl can dream.I did decide what's next and tomorrow night I will press the pattern pieces (hi Carolyn!) and do some preliminary tissue fitting to decide on a size to cut. All the reviews say the pattern runs really big so some sort of muslin/tissue will definitely be in order.The pattern, you ask?Photo \"borrowed\" from http://allisoncsewinggallery.blogspot.com/2009/01/hot-patterns-no-sweat-easy-sew.htmlI want to make the cape version on the left, but without the neck tie, and I also want to make the skirt. I haven't picked out fabrics yet, but I'm hopeful the stash will cough up something suitable. And not a hairball. ;-)"},
{"title": "Pictureless Planning Post", "date": "Saturday, March 10, 2012", "text": "Today, I MUST finish sewing a cammi bag and key fob. They have been hanging over my head, gobbling up my sewing mojo. What's sad is that the bag is already cut out and it's one of my easier patterns so it really won't take that long. It's just procrastination rearing its ugly head. After that, I think I'm going to suspend the cammi bag sales because I will soon have too much to do to take on additional projects.If I clear that off the sewing table table … no … WHEN I clear that, I'm going to tackle some alterations on a couple of me-made dresses that I'm not ready to give up on and which I'll want to wear soon because our temps are definitely getting into the 80s now. The alterations will not be hard — just sewing straight up the sideseams into the sleeves. They just need to be done. If those go well, and fast, maybe I'll be inspired to fix up some of the projects on my ironing board, none of which is too difficult, just not exciting.After that, I need to put some casual tops on my radar. I'm running seriously low on things to wear AFTER work and I have lots of nice knit prints so I do want to make them, not buy them. Plus, there's shopping for wedding undergarments, house hunting, laundry, going to a movie, grocery shopping, thinking about packing, and more to do. Last weekend was a bust, but I really needed to do a lot of nothing after working so hard and so long, so it's OK. But this weekend, I need to get stuff done.What's on your weekend schedule?"},

{"title": "In for a Return and Out With Shoes", "date": "Monday, March 5, 2012", "text": "I stopped by Dillard's on the way home tonight to return the three dresses I'm not keeping. My bank account sighed in relief. On the way out, I tried on 6 pairs of party shoes and left with one pair. I've pretty much decided that strappy ain't for me, both in comfort and in flattery. The end of a work day in heels is a good time to try on new shoes. If they feel good then, they will feel good all night at the wedding.And, yes, I've heard the anguished cries against my sheer black hose thoughts. Truthfully, black wouldn't look good with these shoes anyway. But sheer black hose are 1980s? Really? I'm not convinced. So now I've got to find some sparkly NUDE hose that both fit my thighs and stay up all night. I'll probably go undergarment shopping over the weekend and pick up some then to try.These shoes are a lot more sparkly than they look in the pics - the \"body\" of the shoe is silver metallic texture and the front thingie is covered in rhinestones. The heel and platform are silver. I will probably look at more shoes because I was really hoping for something more decorated but these are pretty and comfortable and if I don't find anything else I like better, they will be just fine.The big boss is taking us out to lunch tomorrow, for some relaxation and laughing now that the big weekend event is over. We're going back to the Hyatt. It was nice last time and we had a great big private table. Word is they have a fajita bar on Tuesdays. Yum! And good for me since I can eat everything except the tortillas with no guilt. I'm down another 2 lbs since last week and I don't want to stop the momentum. Now that I'm THE graphic designer, it's up to me to come up with the \"awards\" in the morning. I started them Friday, actually, since I knew they were coming. Good thinking, 99. (If you get that, you're old like me. Yes, I'm looking at you Belinda!)And hey — look what was delivered to me today!! I'm SOMEBODY! lol Now I need to make myself a business card holder. And, finally, I'm curious — did anyone else receive what was essentially spam from McCall's? An ad for skin care crap? How exactly does that relate to sewing? I would unsubscribe but then I'd miss the pattern sale notices. Which might be a good idea after all. ;-)That's it for me tonight. Time for some DVR vegging and planning tomorrow's outfit, with shoes I can walk 5 blocks in."},
{"title": "Still Thinking", "date": "Saturday, March 3, 2012", "text": "I think this one might be it. I tried on the finalists again this morning and this one definitely fits the best front and back, except for all that bra hanging out the top. Plus, it has a little shoulder coverage which is good for someone of my ADVANCED AGE. OMG, 23 days people. The only thing I don't like is that it kinda smushes the boobage. But I have enough that I can spare some smushing and still have boobs. ;-)I really like the black ruffle tier dress too, except the neckline isn't as good on me as this one or the red one. And I didn't realize it, but this teal dress is also on sale and I only paid $55 for it. (I was in a shopping stupor and not really looking at price tags.) I can keep the red one and this one and still be under $100. Amazing. I just hope I find somewhere to wear the red one because it has no sideseams so it can't be taken in later. I just hate to return it because at just $35 it's almost free, you know? ;-) At that price, I can just wear it around the house a few times and be happy.Here's what I'm thinking — First, sheer black hose. I don't want to go barelegged because (1) my legs are incredibly pasty, (2) pantyhose sucks in the gut, and (3) I think sheer black hose are sexy. Really, more for #2 because I can always go buy a tan. Then again, maybe I can find an industrial Spanx-like full body shaper torture device. Then, black or silver shoes with lots of sparkle and height. Something very sparklie at the neck but costume, not real. Sparklie earrings but demure, because too big will be over the top with a blinged out necklace. My sister has a collection of lipstick purses (evening bags/clutches) and she'll bring me one to use so I don't have to worry about that. I also bought a ruffled black shrug last night for $30 that I could easily make for $10, but whatever. Now I won't have to and I'll have something to throw on for the A/C if needed.So, up next is the hunt for shoes, underwear, jewelry. Not necessarily in that order. Finding the right undergarments is going to be more work than finding a dress. Don't you hate that?"},
{"title": "Dress Pics", "date": "Friday, March 2, 2012", "text": "I'll keep adding to this post as my pics get delivered to my email. Keep in mind that I will NOT be wearing brown tights and I will have on better undergarments and great shoes.Nice color, too blah for this black-tie wedding. Weird shoulder pads. Gold buckle at the side waist that you can't see here. I did try on the print dress in the background but I forgot to take a pic of it. It was OK, but not a favorite. Pretty print, though.Gray lace with sparklies, #1. This one has boob spillage, but I like the cap sleeves. Not a keeper.Gray lace with sparklies #2. Better boob coverage. I finally decided against this one because many of the beads/sparklies were already literally hanging by a thread and it seemed like this dress caught on everything near it. I decided I didn't want to worry about unraveling the whole night. And now that I see both, the other one actually looks better, but I think that's just a difference in shadows/light.Black dress (pic lightened) with ruffle tiers edged in sparklies. This one is too wide at the shoulders. A size smaller is better. LOVE this dress. It has great movement and is more waist-defining in person than it looks here or on the hanger. This one surprised me. It's a finalist so I bought it and will decide whether it's The One or if it's being returned. Teal, what my sister and I have termed \"Venetian Blind\" dresses. Good fit. It's another finalist, so I bought this one for the interim.Black surplice sequined bodice. Too hoochie. Way too scratchy. Did not buy this one.Black lace surplice bodice.Venetian Blinds waist/skirt. A finalist, I bought this one.Cute dress. Too casual for black tie. Too red for me. I'm making faces at my sister. ;-)Second sparklie bodice black dress. Cute, but OMG those sequins HURT. No freakin way on this one. I bet they don't sell any to anyone who tries it on.This makes me look like I'm actually going to be that age I'm going to be this month. Uh, no.What a dump.Pretty dress. But prettier on someone else. There's a lot going on there and I don't want to try to pull off all that.Carmen Miranda called. She wants her dress back.I did like this in the store and bought it as a finalist but the more I look at it, the less I'm liking it, although the one I bought is a size smaller and fits better in the boobage. It's not a halter back, but it would definitely require a specialized bra.Love this dress. A smidge too tight and I'll have to sew bra straps into place or something. But get this — it was only THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS on sale. Regularly $150. I'm keeping this one no matter what I wear to the wedding. And I may end up wearing it. I'm pretty sure I'll lose another 5 lbs. before the wedding. I've lost 6+ the last couple of weeks, since I've been back on the wagon 100% instead of 95%.  And that's it. Whew! Can you tell the Venetian Blinds are a Thing this year? They're kind of weird, kind of cool. Some flatter, some are hideous, and you can't tell until you put the dress on."},

I asked them where I should shop for a dress that wasn't too young or too old and they both almost shouted Dillard's, and at the same time. I used to love Dillard's but the last time I went, it felt very stuffy. I'm glad they suggested it and made me go again. My wallet? Not so glad. lolI spent HOURS trying on a ton of dresses. Many I needed a smaller size — yay! I took cell phone pics and sent them to my sister in Virginia and we texted and pic'd back and forth, which was almost as good as her being with me.

In the meantime, I snapped some cell pics this morning while I was alone in the office. Not that anyone would care if they saw me, just that I would feel weird with an audience. This is PART of the hallway I used to have to walk down each time I needed to go back to Marketing. To get to Finance, I walked down this entire length, THEN turned left at the end and walked down that direction just as long. Pretty much the equivalent of two city blocks, one way. I'm very glad THAT is over with, but I also realize that I'm going to be losing some exercise time so I'll need a Plan B for that. Cool colors, right? They are part of our new brand colors.II *will* have a reason to return to the Finance department from time to time, though. Last week I found out that the woman who sat next to me SEWS. She's about my age and complimented me on a blouse I was wearing. Taking the opportunity (because how else do you suss out sister stitchers?), I said, \"I made it. And, I made everything I'm wearing today.\" The conversation took off. AND … she's a Viking girl too. Can this job GET any better? ;-) I feel some enabling coming on. This is the view from my window. That's the Tampa River below, and just across it is The Tampa Tribune building. It's the white one you can sorta see on the right.This is my old/new home. When I got to the office yesterday morning, I loaded up a cart with my stuff from my previous spot and wheeled it to my permanent (ahhh, permanent) home. My CPU had been moved already, but I also traded out mouse and monitor. I kept the \"new\" keyboard since I like it better and was really missing it. I am nowhere near organized, but I had actual work to do, so I just quickly put stuff in some sort of order and I'll tackle the rest at the end of the week after the crazy times have somewhat subsided. On my screen is a brochure I designed a couple of months ago that we're printing to bring to the upcoming event. When you think about law firms, you don't usually think about bold colors, shapes, and patterns. It's such a fun concept to work with. The blue/orange piece at the right is my Graphic Genuis \"award\" from the big boss. Here's the distance view. It's obviously not a private office, but it's not a cubicle either. Where I was in the Finance department was much more cubicle-ish. I like the openness and there's only three of us here in the middle so there's plenty of space. We all get along great and we're quiet and respectful of each other when we have work to do. I know I've said it before, but it really is a great group. We each have very specific jobs to do and we do them well — alone and together. The big boss' office is at the back middle-right of this pic, where you can see a picture on the wall.In other news, this morning on my way in to the office, I stopped for an appointment to look at a rental house that is about 2 miles from my current house. It was nice, but it's not the house for me and Alex. It's too big. I don't want to clean that much house anymore. But at least I've started the hunt. I'm hoping to find a stand-alone house, but am open to an apartment too if I can't find what I want at the price I can afford. Everything else has been working out, so I will just continue to have faith that my new home will work itself out too."},

Imagine my shock when I read the letter and saw that my salary offer is 10% more than what I'm making now through the agency, which was already pretty darn good (not bragging, just so happy I lucked into this whole thing). I couldn't sign that sucka fast enough. lolMy official start date on the firm's payroll is Monday. I have an appointment with HR that morning, which I'll have to squeeze into the middle of our big event preparation chaos, during which I'll sign the gazillion policy and benefit papers presented in this neat binder (ironically parts of which I actually helped design. lol). The benefits are more than very generous, and they begin immediately — no waiting period at all. Health, dental, vision, life, disability, 401k with matching funds, Flexible Spending Account, 18 days PTO for the first 2 years (then more) plus 10 holidays plus 1 floater, a year-end bonus, free financial planner advice, free mental health and other counseling if wanted, and probably other stuff I'm not remembering due to the haze of legalese on a gazillion papers. Woot!! Ya gotta love the big law firms!! So, not only did my actual expected salary go up 10% but if you add in the value of the benefits … well, let's just say I'm never quitting this job. Ever. (And if some years down the road I grumble about going to work, refer me to this post, please.)A nice touch to all the paperwork was this little card, which says it all, plus inside, \"We're so glad to have you here.\"Today was another party day, even though we have SO MUCH work to get done by next Thursday. We had a catered lunch/meeting/goodbye-predecessor/welcome-me from 12:00-1:00 PM and at 4:00 PM, we pretty much shut down for a cocktail & goodies party to send off my predecessor, who looked like she was having second thoughts — I know I would be. lol As I was leaving for the evening, my computer was being transferred to my new/old spot back in Marketing. I'll be working tomorrow and Sunday, and the first thing I'll do is move all my piles of projects to my new/old desk and get myself re-situated. I can't wait! And, it will be good practice for when I'm moving out of my current house and into a new place. ;-)"},

We're really kicking it into high gear this week, as our big event starts March 2 and there's a LOT to do to get ready for it. I would probably collapse from exhaustion if it was like this all the time, but our events are spaced out throughout the year so we do get some re-grouping time in between. And like I've said before, I much prefer the work hours fly by than drag on.On my drive home, I called Alex to see if he wanted to grab some dinner out with me. We agreed on Outback (grilled ahi tuna and steamed veggies for me). I pulled into the driveway, texted him to come down, switched to the passenger seat (because Alex can park in tight spaces better than me!) and we were off — me still in my work outfit.Alex dropped me off at the front door because it was raining and so I could get our names on the list as quickly as possible. As I was waiting for him to come inside, I looked around and settled on a lobby bench seat next to a young couple. She smiled at me and said, \"I was *just* telling my husband how pretty you looked.\" Wow, right?? I knew I loved this cardi, but now it will make me feel even prettier every time I wear it. You're getting a different background tonight because my usual door still has my new purchases hanging off of it, as you can see from this shot of the inside of the cardi.And here's the pattern envelope, as a refresher. I'm planning to write a proper review at some point, but not this week. I love the shape of this. It really accents (and I'm guessing even creates) an hourglass shape, with the nipped-in waist and peplum. I want to make at least two more — another long-sleeved version and one with short sleeves for summer A/C in the office.But I've also got a HUGE stack of to-do, especially since my latest BMV sale order finally arrived yesterday. Did anyone else order Kwik Sew patterns and notice that delivery took  almost twice as long as usual? I like being able to buy KS at a discount  and via mail, but I do hope BMV improves shipping time because I'm not  known for planning in advance. At least not away from the office.Now I'm off to make tomorrow's lunch and jump into bed to watch a little TV before I turn out the lights."},

{"title": "Can You Stand Another Shopping Post?", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "text": "I promise this will be a sewing blog again one of these days, just not for a couple of weeks at least. Carolyn's post the other day really resonated with me, because even before she wrote it I was thinking the same thing about my blog. I like sharing details and usually do when I have them, but lately, my sewing has been down and dirty, with pretty easy projects, and my time for details has been limited so I've been putting out more \"look at what I did\" posts instead of sharing the process. But I tend to go in cycles with most aspects of my life, so if you're hoping for construction details on more complicated projects, hang in there — they'll be back eventually.I worked yesterday from 9:30-4:00 and again today from 9:00-3:00, and I got a lot done. Yesterday morning, our network went down. Thankfully, everything I had planned to do is not on the network so it didn't affect me too badly. But our email is down, which means Outlook is down, which means I can't access the emails and lists of stuff I need to do other things on my long list. It was still down when I left the office today, so I'm sure there will be grumbling in the morning, but, really, what can you do? It will be fixed when it's fixed. I'm sure the IT peeps had better things to do on their weekend too.I planned to stop at the mall today on the way home to return some things from my recent JCPenney  and Coldwater Creek orders. Well, I didn't make it out of JCP so CWC will have to wait until another day. But I hit the mother lode, and had to talk myself OUT of many things because my closet is close to bursting at the seams as it is and I do plan to sew soon, AND I still had the things waiting at home that I kept. But what's working overtime good for if you don't spend some of the bonus money on fun stuff, right? ;-)So, here we go …I love this outfit. The blouse has a flounce around the vee neck and cute cap sleeves. It's lined front and back (sans sleeves), and I'm digging the 1940s vibe. Now I *need* some spectator pumps. The skirt is black, with gray dots …… which you can see a little better here if you click the pic to enlarge it.This skirt below is a little tight at the moment, but how could I resist an ORANGE skirt? You *know* my love affair with that color! Plus, look at it with my recent blouse purchase from CWC. I'm pretty sure by summer, the skirt will fit great. It really only needs about 5 more lbs gone. I think I may get the turquoise one too. At $20, fully lined with back welt pockets, I can't even THINK about making it for less.I'm not sure about this top. It's really more for the weekend, but it blouses in a way that makes me look like I have jelly rolls around my waist. I think if I hem it shorter, that will fix it, but I'm still thinking about it. It's brown/beige, not black. The skirt is a jeans skirt (fly front, scoop front pockets, back jeans-style pockets). Also for the weekend, and jeans Fridays. (I not especially fond of jeans Fridays, BTW. I just don't like dressing DOWN for work. I feel schlumpy.) New shoes also, which I just ADORE!! They are 4.5\" platform espadrilles, with bone patent leather cris-cross peep toe uppers, and they are extremely comfortable. I'm going to wear the heck out of these this summer and I'm already regretting not buying a back-up pair, since they're now sold out.This blouse looks better without a flash photo, since all the contrast is washed out and it (and me) looks like a big blob. It's ivory, with a matching separate cami underneath and a bias tube belt with rings on either side. It's has seamed, gathered shoulders and is very floaty and pretty. And it's ONLY NINE BUCKS. Run to JCP and buy yourself one.It's also got lingerie guards already in place. I nearly fainted when I saw that, FOR ONLY NINE BUCKS!Green jacket. This is badly in need of a pressing and the back vent is still stitched closed so it's sitting a little snug at the hips until I snip that. Only $35. And more new shoes. Black loafer platform pumps. I'm still deciding on these. I like them and they're comfortable, but will I kill myself walking around in such high heels? Trust me, they are MUCH taller than they look in this pic.I'm almost 5'10\" in these suckers since I could look Alex in the eye, and look at where my head hits on the door compared to the pic below. I also bought the white tee today too. You can't see any details, but it's a ruffle knit and will be a good basic underlayer. It's too long at the moment, though, so it needs a trip through the coverstitcher. There! I mentioned sewing. ;-)This blouse is gauze-like, but a little more substantial. It has flounces on the 3/4 sleeves and the matching tank came with it. The blouse definitely needs to be belted and the armholes are low/wide, but it will be so comfortable when the humidity is at 3000% in August that I'm willing to overlook those deficiencies. And are you diggin' my Carolyn shoes?? I love them! Unfortunately, they are a little too wide (in the regular width) which you can sorta see at the back of the foot on your left, but I'm going to buy some foam insoles and I'm keeping them. I loved them when I saw them on Carolyn and I love them in person. Better a little too wide than too tight. ;-)A new necklace.And, finally, another new tote bag. I like this one better because it's bigger and costs less, so I'm sending the other one back to Zappos. If you're like me and don't need someone else's name or logo on your bag, then JCP is the place to shop. They always have a ton of nice bags at great prices. I can buy shoes all day (and night!), but I'm really cheap when it comes to purses. So what did YOU do this weekend? I think NEXT weekend, I need to be dumping all the things in my closet I've been holding on to that are really just too darn big. I now desperately need the space."},
{"title": "Permanent Working Girl", "date": "Thursday, February 16, 2012", "text": "This is what a working girl with a real job with real PAID benefits looks like after a long day at the office. Woooo!That's the new tote bag I mentioned a couple of posts ago. It's still not exactly what I want, but it will do for the time being. I have a job now, I can buy another one later. ;-)This is the Ottober 02/2007 re-TNT'd tee on its own. Too bad I didn't straighten my necklace before the camera clicked, but that's me - always a little skewed. lol And this is REALLY what a working girl looks like after a long day at the office, changed into comfy lounging clothes. Both of these are huge on me, but I'm not going anywhere tonight so who cares.This is the photo of the top (Burda plus mag from Feb 08) when I first made it. It's considerably shorter in this pic since there's considerably less me holding it up. It's also laying snug across the belly instead of loose and baggy as in the photo above. Plus, if I'm not paying attention, I end up flashing the bra now since there's less bazooms too. Well, not less — I still have two, just less of each. So, about the job …Do you know how they say, \"Be careful what you wish for?\" Hah. Yes, I have the job and I am absolutely thrilled, BUT … the woman who I first was filling in for while she was on maternity leave until she came back mid-December, well … she resigned this past Monday to be a SAHM. What that means is that I am going to be SUPER BUSY. Adding my job in addition to hers was approved so I would've been hired either way but until the new position is filled, I will be doing it all. Which I did from September to December, when I knew a lot less about the firm and its procedures, so I know I can handle it. But I also know from that time and to present that I'm going to be so busy the hours will just fly by. But that's OK. I really do love this job and being busy. I'm a dork, but on the drive in every morning this week, I said out loud, “I LOVE MY JOB” over and over. If cars next to me had been looking, they would've thought I had lost it.What this also means is that a week from Monday, I get to leave my spot in the Finance department and return to the bigger, better spot in the Marketing department. I love that too! (No offense Finance types, but you were kind of driving me nuts. lol) I'm already re-decorating the area in my mind, and I can't wait to have that view back again.Tomorrow is birthday cake day and I may even treat myself as a little celebration. We're also having a firm-wide video presentation by a Tuskeegee Airman in honor of Black History Month, with lunch catered. I'm really looking forward to the webinar because I think it's going to be fascinating. This firm is involved in a lot of diversity projects year-round, not just during February (and has won numerous national awards), and one of my upcoming projects is the annual diversity report. Another project I'm looking forward to, and it will be even more meaningful to me because I'll get to share my thoughts on tomorrow's presentation. But the big thing on my plate right now is getting all the zillions of projects done for our annual invitation-only In-House Counsel Forum. Everything from a glossy 8-page program to foam core signs to name cards to gift bags to 100+ page \"lookbooks\" with bios for each attendee (about 80) and much, much more. My predecessor's last day is one week before this event, so it's pretty much all falling on my shoulders. I already know I'm working this weekend and next (putting sewing on hold), and I may even be going to the event, which is in Orlando. Exciting times ahead. Have I said how much I LOVE MY JOB!!!I still can't believe how lucky I've been to land in the perfect job at the perfect time. Yes, it took some patience hanging in there, but it was so worth the wait.THANK YOU SO MUCH for all of the congrats, good wishes, and nice comments. Your support has been so wonderful these last months."},

{"title": "Production Sewing", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2012", "text": "Yesterday was a bust sewing-wise, but I made up for it today with FOUR completed garments. I set out with new basics on my list and then maybe altering some too-big items. I did well in the basics department, but didn't even blow the dust off the to-do pile on the ironing board.First up, my new TNT Ottobre tee. Since I still have too-big former TNTs from this pattern hanging in my closet, it was easy enough to try one on and pinch the sides to judge how much smaller it needed to be. I didn't feel right about just chopping up the original tracing since so many of my knit top patterns were based on it and I want to keep it as a reference. So I pulled out the pattern sheets, traced a new copy, sewed it up, and hoped for the best. And it worked.It's a boring ivory Powerdry knit but I will wear the heck out of this, like with these pieces which have been waiting for it.Next, McCall's 6078. This pattern comes in 2 size ranges XS-S-M and L-XL. When I first bought it, I spaced out and bought the smaller range. And then I used my bigger TNT Ottobre tee pattern to try to morph it. The result was OK but never great. Now, it's just plain too big and that one is in the donate pile. Today, I cut the M and sewed it as-is except that I morphed my \"new\" TNT sleeves onto the sleeveless version so I could have sleeves that I knew fit and sewed in without easing.I made one in brown, to complete this outfit which I'm wearing tomorrow. And I made one in white. This is unhemmed because the fabric has been in my stash so long it needed to be laundered again, and instead of pressing in the dust permanently, I will hem it after it's washed. It looks horrible here on Zillie, but it fits me perfectly and drapes much nicer.I was making the white shell to wear with the wine plaid Magic Pencil. That's still a go, but then I got a wild hair and tried to force perfectly-matching french terry to become office wear. Yeah, not happening.To be fair, it actually looks OK on me and will be good with jeans, but it's too warm and somewhat too bulky to wear in the office. So I'm back on the hunt for SOMETHING to go with this skirt so I can wear the darn thing. I have a few more stash possibilities so I haven't given up yet. And if I procrastinate long enough, it will be warm enough that just a short-sleeve top and a nice belt will be fine. I made a big dent in the basics, but the ironing board pile — well, you can see for yourself. Plus the items hanging on the door, which are just too darn big now but it kills me to get rid of them. Especially the green outfit which hasn't even been worn. * * * * *I went to see The Grey last night. It was OK, but totally unrealistic in many respects so that disappointed me. But it's never a bad night if you can watch Liam Neeson for 2 hours. ;-) On the drive back, I was saddened to hear about Whitney Houston's passing. RIP Whitney. Your great talent will be remembered always, but your candle burned out much too early."},
{"title": "Wadderville", "date": "Saturday, February 11, 2012", "text": "This is Butterick 4132, meant for woven fabrics cut on the bias. I tried it with a knit and while it's sorta OK, it's not OK enough for what I want to wear it with. The neckline isn't drapey enough and is kind of sticking out. I'll hem it and maybe even sew lingerie guards into the too-wide neckline and then move on. It technically fits and maybe it will be useful for another combination. So now I'm going to use my TNT gathered front Ottobre tee (except it's not really TNT anymore so I need to adjust the pattern smaller first) and try again from the same fabric. But today's sewing will soon come to an end because I'm going out for dinner and a movie. And since it's almost 3 and I haven't been through the shower yet, I need to get a move on!"},
{"title": "TGIF", "date": "Friday, February 10, 2012", "text": "Whew! Another busy week under my belt. But since I love being busy at work, it's all good.I did NOT go on the interview on Tuesday. All of the circumstances just weren't working out and I really just needed to cancel. Maybe it will be rescheduled. Maybe I won't need it to be. ;-) But at the moment, I'm not regretting it and I'm OK with the decision. The \"big boss\" actually jumped up and down with joy when I told her, so I'm taking that as a good sign. This weekend will be filled with sewing for ME! All of my sewing last weekend was to finish up a cammie purse, which I did, and now I don't have that to make me feel guilty. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be doing anything too exciting as I really need to spend some time altering some items I'm not yet ready to part with and I also need a couple of basics, like a brown shell and an ivory shell. I miss those non-existent shells almost every morning. And I haven't been able to find anything suitable in RTW, even though I've been looking online almost every day. I guess that's a sign I need to just buckle down and make them. I know I have brown knits to use, but I'm not sure about the ivory. Maybe the stash will produce a welcome surprise.This landed in my inbox this morning before I left for work. I'm not sure exactly what's up with Kwik Sew joining the McCall's family and how it bodes for the future of KS, but right now I'm THRILLED that I can order them at a discount with my BMV orders and even happier that the first Pattern of the Day was the exact one I was wanting. I just wish it was here NOW.I just finished ordering it, and a few more KS and Buttericks fell into the cart too. Ahem. I really need to stop with the pattern orders because I'm certainly not sewing as fast as I'm buying. But on the other hand, it's relatively cheap entertainment and \"research.\"I also need to stop with the online ordering in general as I've now got things coming to me from Zappos (shoes and bags), Jessica London (shoes that are 100% Carolyn's fault!), and JCPenney (wardrobe basics that were too cheap to turn down). I ordered two \"nice\" totes from Zappos, only one of which I'll keep, but I wanted to see them both. I've been holding off buying a nice tote because I didn't want to jinx my job (I'm silly sometimes), but I finally reached the breaking point with my floppy black canvas tote and I wanted something more in keeping with being a working woman and not a football mom so I just went for it — jinx be damned.Parting Shot: LCpl Cook is back from his training exercises at sea. There's been a lot of coverage of Operation Bold Alligator from the local papers (my mom is local so she's also been reporting). This was the biggest amphibious cross-service training exercise in more than 10 years. On board with Tyler, besides the U.S. Navy running the ship, were Canadian and Royal Marines. That's all good but I'm just glad to be able to talk to my son again, and it makes me dread when he's deployed on the ship for 6 months. Communication is going to suck. This picture is now the background for my work computer so I get to see him every day. I love the sunset and the silhouette."},
{"title": "Weekend Plans", "date": "Saturday, February 4, 2012", "text": "Sorry, this will be a picture-less and quite wordy post. Today, I'll be sewing — but not for me. I have to finish another cammie bag that is due to mail on Monday, plus I have one more waiting beyond that. I have mixed feelings about the bags. The extra money is great and I do like making them. I just don't like having orders hanging over my head, especially on those days when I'd rather be sewing for ME. lol But I'm OK with not sewing for me this weekend since I was so productive last weekend and, besides, my closet is kind of bulging with work clothes right now, even though I have a BIG stack of patterns I want to try. (What I really need to sew is some weekend wear.)It was another good (and busy!) week at work and I still love my job! I can't believe how much I look forward to getting up early and going to work each day. And it's not just because life at home is pretty much crap, although I do admit that's probably part of it. But I just really like what I'm doing, who I work with, and this work environment and I can't wait to get back to it each morning. The days just fly by.I was honest with my immediate boss and the \"big boss\" and told them I needed to come in late on Tuesday because of an interview. I just felt honesty was the best policy, especially since there's always the possibility that the agency would tell them anyway. But I assured them that I'm still quite willing to be patient for things to work out where I am, and that it's my definite preference and desire to stay put, but with the current economy and my present position up in the air, I couldn't afford to turn down an interview. And I told them that I definitely wasn't trying to push things, only being honest about where I was going to be since I didn't want them to find out another way. I know they understood and were not just giving me lip service. ;-) That's one of the things I like about where I am - no one plays games, which is rare in a corporate environment. And my philosophy in general is \"what will be will be,\" so however things work out is how they're meant to. The big boss took our Marketing department out to lunch at the Hyatt yesterday to thank us for the job well done with the new website launch and for us all to have some \"down time\" with each other. She handed out \"Super Certificates\" to each person and mine was for being a Graphics Genius. Which I am, of course. lol It was a fun lunch. But yesterday was horrible for my eating. The lunch, and then a Happy Hour at 5 PM. Oh well, one day off the wagon won't kill me, and I *needed* a little Happy Hour. ;-)Sort of related, my work area is currently in the Finance department away from Marketing (where I'm really assigned) due to space constraints. At first, I missed being actually IN my department like I was before the woman on maternity leave returned but now I'm used to it and actually like it. I still interact quite frequently with my Marketing coworkers but when I'm busy (like always!), no one is looking over my shoulder or interrupting me and I can be really productive. So I'm independent and connected at the same time. Kind of the best of both worlds. And, really, I would sit in the closet if I had to to keep this job. ;-)Anyway, what this is leading up to is that the Finance people, who are an entirely different breed than the Marketing people, lol, have now decided they actually like having a Marketing person with graphics skills nearby and they've been asking me for little projects here and there to brighten up their financial reports with the new logo and colors. It's been so cute … \"Debbie, do you think you could …\" and of course I can. I am a Graphics Genius. :snort:I relayed this to the \"big boss\" and she lit up with a smile and I could see the gears turning. She told me to send her an email about it on Monday along with any other \"side projects\" so she could add it to her \"ammunition\" for creating a permanent position for me. So, making that list is another one of my projects this weekend. I've already thought of a few things for the ammunition list that were probably overlooked because of how busy and \"nose-down\" we've been with the launch. We walked out to the parking garage together after Happy Hour and she told me again to remember to email her on Monday. The annual shareholders meeting is next week and we're really busy getting materials together for that. But once that's over and things have calmed down a little, it's the big boss' plan to then go to bat for me. So it shouldn't be too much longer now. And tomorrow, I'll distract myself with one last weekend of football. Yay Super Bowl, but boo to no more football for a long time."},
{"title": "It Can't Be February", "date": "Wednesday, February 1, 2012", "text": "Wow, February already. I was so busy in January that I hardly noticed it was here. It was 80 degrees today, so summer is on the way. I'm not ready for warm weather yet. But at least it will give me something new to sew for since I'm getting a bit overloaded on winter(ish) clothes. I also need to make or buy some weekend tops because I have extremely slim (hah!) pickin's in that area. I don't have much new today so here's another What I Wore photo. I made this cardigan a couple of months ago and Alex \"modeled\" it for the blog, but I don't think I ever got a decent shot of me in it, but that's probably because I've not worn it until today. The dress is one of my Walmart $18.98 bargains and have I ever gotten my money's worth and then some from it. Dani was waiting for a treat. As I was dressing this morning, I thought about belting the cardi but didn't pursue it any further because I was lazy. I'm glad I didn't. It looks so-so, but it feels horrible. Too bulky. I know belted cardigans are the look, but not for me, thank you. Lest you think it's All Glamour All The Time around here (cough:cough), here's what I'm wearing right now. Old Spongebob PJ pants and an even older football tee shirt. Chili's turn to stare me down.The pants are just a little too big, don't you think?I have an interview for another job scheduled for Tuesday morning, so now I've got to decide what to wear to that. I want the job I have and I'm reasonably certain I'm going to get it, but it doesn't hurt to increase my options. I don't have any suits or even any jackets that fit for mix/match but  I'm sure I can put together something appropriate even sans jacket. No sooner than I found out about the interview day/time then I was handed a ton of stuff for a new project for next week, so I'm already thinking I need to see if I can reschedule that interview for later next week when I have more of the project behind me. I'll think on it. Parting Shot: Tyler's home for the next few weeks. It's a LOT bigger than it looks in this pic."},
{"title": "What I Wore, What I Bought", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2012", "text": "Yay, I left work tonight on time, read some email when I got home, snapped some pics before I changed into my lounging clothes, ate some dinner, loaded up the pics, and sat down to my blog *before* 7PM. Overtime is nice, but so are days that end when they're supposed to. It was also nice to need my sunglasses for the whole drive home.The morning started great, when my boss said good morning and then told me (unsolicited) that there is NO WAY they are letting me leave and that she and her boss are going to do everything they can to get me hired on permanently. It will mean making a case to the CFO for creating a new position, but they feel confident they have plenty of ammunition. Fingers crossed that it won't be too much longer. And the agency called today too, with the possibility of an interview somewhere else, which I said \"Set up!\" so as to hopefully invoke Murphy's Law. You know, the one where I'm offered TWO jobs. ;-) My boss also mentioned that all of my extra pitching in has not gone unnoticed, to which I replied, \"Thank you! And, really, I would feel bad if I didn't do what was needed to be done.\" (And I would.)So, yes, good day all around. :-)Here's the windowpane plaid Magic Pencil skirt in action, instead of in a hanger shot. Well, if you can call standing still in front of a door \"action.\" I love this skirt. It's comfortable, stylish, flattering, and doesn't wrinkle too badly after a whole day of wearing. I can't believe such a big plaid on my lower half is flattering, but it is. Rear view, which looks poochy after all day, but I sit on my butt at a desk and then in the car so pooch happens. At least you can see the vent on this one. Now onto the Coldwater Creek purchases. This skirt is a definite keeper and the thing I was saying was SO ME. You can't see much detail, but it's a lined mesh knit that is pleated on one side to give the look of a faux wrap. Very comfy, very flow-y, and I want a pattern for more! And I definitely have to get those arms one color before the heat arrives. Yikes.This is a wrap top, but the underlayer doesn't go all the way down, which I like because it cuts down on bulk and cups under the boob to make the neckline stay in place. It has turquoise in the print, so with the brown, it is also very ME.A very sheer organza blouse. I will wear a cami under this one. But I love those colors and for summer (which will probably be here in about 5 weeks), I'm imagining a coral or cream skirt instead of brown. I'm also thinking of chopping the sleeves to 3/4 or shorter, since they're too long for me anyway. I know I don't have short arms, so what's with all the gorilla sleeves?This blouse already has 3/4 sleeves. Much better. It's a little snug, but I'm not popping buttons and I will shrink into it soon enough. For summer, I'm thinking a linen skirt to go with this one. And my leopard-y pumps. A sleeveless, lined shell with cross-over tie thing at the vee neck, which you can't see at all in this pic. This one is actually a little big but I'm going to take it in at the sideseams and/or waist darts. I love the colors on me, so a little fixing up will be worth it. It will look good with that coral or cream skirt I'm already planning for the organza blouse. The one heartbreaker of the bunch. This blouse is SO pretty. Off of me. It's got a flounce on one side and a banded vee neckline on the non-flounce side. I love the color, and the fabric feels like silk (but is washable poly). Unfortunately, it just doesn't fit and never will. It's too tight at the bust, too long in the sleeves, too \"something\" at the armholes, and it looks very boxy on me, which I didn't realize until I saw this pic. I'm sure I could copy it, but I probably won't. Oh well. They can't all be home runs and now I have an excuse to visit the brick and mortar CWC at the mall when I return it."},
{"title": "Sewing Weekend, Part 3", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2012", "text": "The plaid skirt I set out to make is done except for the hem, which will only take a few minutes — especially since my coverstitcher is already threaded and ready. I didn't add a kick pleat to this one, but I lined it since the plaid knit is very soft and I was afraid of Velcro-butt when wearing with pantyhose. I found a pair of PJs pants from which to nick some elastic, thereby avoiding an impulse trip to Joann's.The main reason I omitted the kick pleat was this fabric was a PITA to lay straight on my cutting table. It's very drapey, even laying flat. I ended up cutting single layer, which was tedious enough with only half a pattern. I didn't want to risk a center back seam that was off just a smidge. Luckily, my OCD (and a gazillion pins) paid off and my side seams match exactly. I like the skirt a lot. The only problem is that it's going to be an orphan unless/until I find/make something to wear with it. Instead of starting on the top from the coordinating solid fabric, I decided I'm sending the fabric back. The color is perfect, but the knit is just not a nice knit. This (and the other colors I bought at the same time, which are also going back) are Fabric.com's single knit jerseys. Don't buy any. Luckily my 30-day return window still has 2 more days so I'm within the time limit. I don't even want any of this for crappy muslins.So now I'm going to go veg for a while in front of the tube while shopping online fabric and apparel retailers to see what I can come up with. It's going to be hard to match the wine color so I'm thinking a drapey white blouse would work, with a scarf or a vest or something. I like to dress \"in three's.\" I was hoping my off-white twinset would do, but the contrast in the plaid is white, not off-white, and the two (three?) don't look good together.And now I see why the Muse was telling me to make those other items first. She was right.I'm obviously suffering from Sewing ADD this weekend as this is clearly not the plaid Magic Pencil skirt I went upstairs to sew per last post. Although it IS plaid and it IS a Magic Pencil skirt. Again, \"old\" fabric was yelling louder than the new piece, and since my machines were already set up with the appropriate color threads …I bought this fabric back in July or August from Joann's (of all places), when I was getting ready to sew interview clothes. I'm not usually a windowpane plaid kind of girl but this one spoke to me then, and it made itself heard again tonight. To match the plaids across the sideseams, I had to really eek it out, cutting the hem of the front piece on the same cut as the waist of the back pieces and I still came out a little short on the front hem. But I serged it all even (mostly) and no one will ever be the wiser. I really have no idea how I was ever going to get a skirt from this piece back in August when (1) I was wider and (2) I didn't yet have this great pattern. It's a good thing I let it age.This fabric is a stretch woven and I wasn't sure if there was enough stretch to enable the skirt to still fit without alteration, since my previous makes of it were from knits. I sewed 1/4\" side seam allowances instead of the 1/2\" per the pattern and the skirt fits perfectly. Whew! I really should've played it safer and cut bigger seam allowances but for some reason, it just didn't occur to me until it was too late. I also added a back kick pleat to this one but lowered the start of the opening 3/4\" since the first one I made with a kick pleat was nearly too high. The wine plaid skirt is actually cut out but … I'm now out of elastic. Figures! I'm going to run through Joann's tomorrow before I hit the grocery store and hope I find something suitable, or I'll have to wait for an internet order to arrive. Although the thought is now crossing my mind that maybe I can steal some from too-big pants or a skirt Hmmm, not sure if all that ripping out will be worth it and I don't think I have any waistbands that are free casings instead of serged on and turned/topstitched.Well, I suppose I could always work on the top instead … or whatever else that distracts me."},
{"title": "Sewing Weekend, Part 1", "date": "Saturday, January 28, 2012", "text": "(No, this is not a plaid Magic Pencil skirt, but that's coming.) I've had this sweater knit for a couple of months and it caught my eye one evening this past week and told me it needed to be sewn NOW. I didn't argue. I even picked out a pattern during the week and managed to get the tissue pressed and cut on Thursday, the one night in the last couple of weeks that I actually left work on time. Yesterday was another late one, with more coming next week. But I don't mind, and I love those overtime infused paychecks. Perfect for more SHOES. ;-)I started cutting the fabric about 11 AM and then constructed until about 5 PM, with a LOT of breaks like dog outings, lunch, laundry. So it wasn't a solid 6 hours. Probably more like 4 and a good chunk of that time was spent making a perfect narrow hem on the bottom peplum/flounce. I decided to do a good job on this one and slow it down. Plus, I had my eyes half on catching up on the first 5 episodes of the new American Idol auditions, which is my favorite part of the show next to Steven Tyler doing anything. (My first-born son isn't named Tyler for naught!)There was a little bit of potential trickiness around the neck/shoulders sewing the continuous neckband on with a pivot, but I paid attention to what I was doing and it went well. It's a nice design feature, giving the cardi princess seams on the front and a more shaped collar band in the back, with forward-sitting shoulder seams. The sleeves are sewn in the round by necessity due to the order of construction and they are actually decent sleeves that don't wrinkle/fold when my arms are hanging down. I left off the flounces at the wrists because they'd just get in my way and I really don't need any extra flounce at the hip on top of the peplum/flounce.I cut a straight 16 and made no alterations and I'm happy with the fit. If I make it again, though, I will shorten the upper bodice a little so the \"waist\" seam hits me higher and the cardi ends up shorter. But that's a personal preference thing, not a fit thing, because the lengths on me are pretty much just like the envelope. I'll model it as soon as I figure out what the heck to wear under it. So right now, it's a semi-orphan but it won't be for long because I really want to wear it. Here's the pattern envelope and line drawings, since I always want to see those when someone else blogs about weird pattern pieces. Piece 4,5,6,7,8,9 are what's relevant here.As soon as I post this, I'm heading back to the sewing room to cut out and sew that plaid Magic Pencil. Tomorrow, I'll be sewing the top from the solid, around fitting in a trip to the grocery store.I had thought I had this pattern in my stash …… but it turns out I have this one instead, the Plus version. Sigh. It's too big now. So I think I'm going to try morphing the neck treatment onto my Ottobre tee, which itself is too big but I can just sew bigger sideseams to fix that. I'm going for the red-misses/blue-plus top, not the dress.Speaking of shoes, my Zappos order arrived Thursday and is already on its way back. I struck out. One pair was too big and I was stepping right out of them and the other pair was iffy, even though I loved how they looked. I just don't do iffy anymore, and definitely not with 3-4\" heels.My Coldwater Creek order arrived Friday and I have some keepers. I'm sure I'll stage a modeling session soon. Wait 'til you see the skirt I forgot I ordered. It's SO ME. One blouse will have to go back, even though I love it. It's too tight in the bust and the sleeves are gorilla length. I wish there was a pattern somewhere for it, because I'd love to have one that actually fits (although I don't know how much I'd love to be sewing charmeuse!). In fact, I wish there were patterns for everything I bought. None of it is complex, but I just don't have time to try to draft each of the unique style elements. This is why I've been known to buy doubles and take one apart for a pattern. I'm almost tempted, but not at Coldwater Creek prices, even sale prices."},
{"title": "Ready for Launch", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "text": "The launch went well today and the day was relatively low-key, but tomorrow will be the test since the new website wasn't switched over until late this afternoon and even then was running v-e-r-y s-l-o-w due to DNS replicating. Don't you love it when I talk all geekie? ;-)In my department, we all decided we'd wear the new brand colors (blue, red, green, yellow) to \"celebrate\" and this was my outfit. Our new look also incorporates lots of patterns (repetitive, not sewing!), so I did doubly well with my skirt as part of my look.This will be the last time wearing this skirt until I take it in because it's now about 2\" too big around the waist. I should've tried it on last week, but truthfully I probably still wouldn't have done anything about it due to lack of time/energy in the evenings, although I actually left the office on time tonight, for the first time in about two weeks. Yay! The twinset is also on the big side, especially in the shoulders, but it will just be removed from the wardrobe once I can't stand it anymore. The skirt should be easy to take in since I did make it with taking-in in mind. Famous last words, and I won't count on that until it's actually done. For now, it's being added to the ironing board pile, and the next time I make this skirt pattern, I'm definitely adding a kick pleat in the back because it really needs one. Now I'm going to go catch up on some reading while waiting for Project Runway to come on."},

It puts his land-based barracks into a whole new light, as in you don't fully appreciate what you've got until it's gone. He'll be living like this come June for about 6 months, when his unit is in full deployment. My poor little sardine. ;-) But, speaking as his mom, I'd rather this for him than the Middle East sandbox, even if he probably doesn't agree.Our big launch at work is tomorrow. I've been putting in some long hours, but there's a little light at the end of that tunnel now and we won't be quite as stressed and hurried. I've had some very nice compliments this week for going above and beyond, and reassurance that the higher-ups in my department will be doing everything they can to assure that I *will* be staying permanently. Yay! So hopefully that means it's just a matter of working out the formalities at this point, once we can all take a breath. I'll continue to be patient because it will be worth it in the long run.Meredith – you asked about a pair of shoes. They are Easy Spirit brand and I saw them still available on Zappos last night, when I might have ordered another pair. Or two. Ahem. I kept the spotty pumps from the last order and am still deciding on the mustard colored pumps. The brown platforms are going back, though. I decided they were just a little too-too.My name is Debbie and I'm a shoe-aholic. I also might have ordered some sale items from Coldwater Creek, which I'm really hoping fit because I just haven't had time to sew. But after really trying to shop online last night from bed on my Kindle (have I mentioned how much I love that Kindle!!), I was reassured that I *have* to sew. I couldn't find very many things I even wanted to buy. Wrong color, wrong style, wrong price, etc., etc. You all know the drill. I'm definitely making that plaid Magic Pencil skirt this weekend or I'm going to go CRAZY! I want a whole wardrobe of those skirts—they are just perfect for me.Off to make my lunch for tomorrow and hop into my jammies.

{"title": "M5523: Good Things Come To Those Who … Procrastinate", "date": "Saturday, January 21, 2012", "text": "Of course as soon I post that I'm not going to be sewing for a while, I sewed. I just had to, for the sake of my mental well-being. You know how it is. I went into the office and worked from 9:30-4:00 today and I kept daydreaming about my machines nearly the whole time. I'll be working probably as long tomorrow but I may decide to do it from home since I don't want to miss any football, and maybe I can take a few sewing breaks in between. It's nice to have the choice, right?As soon as I got home this afternoon, I finished two cammie purses that had been waiting (and making me feel guilty), and then I turned my attention to my ironing board, where I have things piled up on one end that I want to do *something* to, to make the items in the stack wearable again.I may never catch up with that pile but I can't bear to just toss some things yet.Today, I finished up McCall's 5523, three months later. I sewed most of this skirt back in October and since I wasn't really happy with the fit, I let it sit. In that time, I got smaller and the skirt got bigger. Now the problem wasn't that it was too tight but too loose. Over the last month or so, I'd been trying it on and thinking about partially ripping out the princess seams and sewing them smaller but that thought made my eyes glaze over and the skirt continued to live in the pile.  Back in October, I had faced the waist with grosgrain ribbon but I hadn't tacked it down yet. Today, I stitched it down from the right side 5/8\" down from the waist edge and then I threaded 1/2\" elastic through my slapdash casing. It's a quick and easy solution but, hey, it works (and it doesn't even look bad on the inside). It will also give me more time to wear the skirt as I continue to shrink. I love losing the weight, but I'm starting to get a little pissed that some of my favorite things are too big (see comment above about ironing board pile). ;-) Yeah, I could have bigger problems, I know. My waist is now 36\" and seeing that skirt with elastic scrunching it up even more was amazing to me. I can't believe how SMALL that skirt looks on a hanger. Like, how in the world can that be MY skirt? Until recently, my skirts have overhung the width of a hanger, and then some. Now they don't. If you've always been thin, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but my plus-size sisters will understand. It's a victory nearly as satisfying as watching the numbers on the scale head south.One good thing about my skirt being bigger (and me smaller) is that I gained length due to less terrain for the skirt to cover. Plus my knee fat is finally starting to subside so I'm OK with a shorter hem now. Hence no need to face the hem as I was contemplating back in October. Hence. Who says hence in real life (besides me)?So, here's the finished skirt from the front: And the back. I really should've checked those seams before the photo since they're sitting a little off-center. Oh well. You get the idea.Here's me back in October. I can't believe how much thinner my face is now. The butt is still hanging on, though. ;-)"},

Our new brand/logo materials and website launch is in just a few short days and we're SO BEHIND due to a shall-remain-nameless web coding/hosting company that leaves a lot to be desired. Needless to say, everyone in my department is putting in lots and lots of hours. I just got home (8PM) tonight, worked all last weekend and every evening, and will be working this weekend too. I'm racking up lots of overtime $$, and hopefully even more HIRE-ME!!! points which is good, but the bottom line is I'm pooped. There's so much to do that won't get done by launch day, which makes me pretty confident I'll be around for quite a while even if I'm not hired on permanently. But really, they do need another body permanently so I remain optimistic. I think they're waiting for the dust to settle a bit, which I understand. There's been so much going on. I'm just impatient and wish I knew for sure so I can start making life plans.Thank you all for the kind comments about Pepper. While we'll definitely miss her, she was 16 and so it wasn't really an unexpected shock. She went pretty quickly at the end and seemed to be pain-free. Alex took it the hardest, as Pepper was around almost as long as he's been. The other two pups have been extremely snuggly ever since. Do you think they're afraid we'll scoot them out next? ;-) Not a chance! I have to say that it's very nice to have them around to help fill the void.I'll be absent from the blog for a while longer, but know that everything is OK. There's just not enough hours in the day to do it all. And, geez ... I WANT TO SEW!!

{"title": "V1257: Finished", "date": "Saturday, January 7, 2012", "text": "The dress is done, or will be after I hem the gorilla sleeves, and I strongly DO NOT recommend this pattern, at least not as is. What a PITA, especially when there are other great wrap and faux wrap patterns available. The sleeves are the main deal breakers and if I make this again using this bodice, I will definitely cut out the sleeve portion and morph sleeves and armhole from another knit pattern as I showed last post. After adding 2\" to the width and sewing the bicep area with 1/4\" seam allowances, they are technically not too tight. But they are close to being snug and worse, they feel weird, with the stretch running lengthwise. Like Spanx for your arms. But there were other problems too. I probably can't explain it well without photos, but the part on the skirt where the faux knot goes requires that you slit it at the waist in two areas. That's OK. But then the directions tell you to use double-fold bias binding to finish the slits. Um, no. First, it's a knit. Second, what a PITA. I just turned the edge under and topstitched it down. No one is ever going to see it anyway because it's hidden by the knot. And speaking of the knot, you make a tube and then gather each end, with the end result to be a gathered knot. Which just doesn't happen. If you DO make this dress, skip that step. The pattern is higher waisted than the line drawings lead you (me) to believe. It's not empire but the waist seam is definitely not at my waist. This is actually OK on me, because it's hitting me at a good spot. Just a warning to look out for this if you're looking for a dress waist that actually sits at the waist. I also left off the clear elastic I was supposed to sew onto the waist seam allowances for stability. It's a good idea for some fabrics, but this one is fine without it. Finally, and not really the fault of the pattern, is that there are a good number of pleats to mark and sew and marking was nearly impossible on this fabric, unless I were to use tailor tacks. Which I'm not, because you know how I love handsewing. And making pleats in an ITY knit is headache-inducing, but I muddled through with an I-don't-really-care-if-it's-not-perfect attitude. The inside of this dress is NOT pretty. But knits are forgiving and I'm not going to be flashing anyone the inside of my dress. (Unless that guy from the elevator asks!) I added tie ends under the knot, which do not show in photos at all. But they do show in real life and I like how they look. The give the faux wrap a little more realism. ;-)See what I mean about the gorilla sleeves? OMG. Now all that said, except for the sleeves and adding another 1-1/2\" to the bottom, I made no other alterations, always a plus. And, I think the dress looks pretty good on me so I'll definitely wear it. As soon as I forget those horrendous drafting and construction errors. And once I do forget, I may even have a moment of crazy and make it again.1.  This stuff is great. If you color your hair, buy it.2. See. While my undyed hair is/used to be pretty much this red color and my roots are not glaring, I do have grays and they show up in the growth, especially at temples/forehead. Ug. All gone for another month. At $1.99 per box on sale, I bought 3 the other day.  It was beauty day today. I got my nails done this morning and gave myself a semi-pedicure (trim, repolish).  3. These are snakeskin with a faint leopard print, black shiny heels, and big gold buckles. Sitting down pics because I can keep the camera steadier this way, not because I'm lazy. ;-)4. Mustard with a croc texture, 1/2\" platforms, pointy toes.5. Brown, with a bigger croc texture, 3/4\" platforms. Awesome, no? Actually, they are all awesome. How will I ever decide? But another good thing about Zappos is that I have 365 days to decide, as long as they stay unworn, so I will see where my sewing (and buying) leads me before I make a final decision.6. These are the shoes I last bought but didn't get a good pic of. Brown \"penny loafer\" pumps. Saucy secretary vibe, right?7. Burda knit wrap/tie top from a few years ago. Remember how popular it was? I had outgrown it for a few years but I pulled it out this morning. It's now loose in the hips so it has a peplum thing going on. I kinda like that. 8. The dirty secret? I have to pin the underlayer to my bra so it stays up. 9. Both bodice pieces complete and attached to the back, sleeves sewn. STUPIDEST bodice design ever, and really up there for poor drafting (those sleeves). There is absolutely no reason for dolman in the front and set-in in the back. It's the mullet of sleeve design, and it's a total royal pain in the ASS to sew. 10. If I make this again, I would just cut off that horrible sleeve and morph a good sleeve and armhole onto the pattern. It would be very easy to do (see the pic), and I'm still considering it for this version. It will mean ripping out those painful sleeves and sideseams which is fiddly in a poly knit. I'm going to go try on the sleeves one more time and then decide one way or the other. I really like the rest of the design of the dress so I don't want to give up completely. But the mullet sleeves? Reeee-dic!11. Part of the fabric delivery from Friday. The plaid is a rayon knit which will become a Magic Pencil skirt. The knit solid will be a top to match. It will be very cute, and NOT brown. ;-)12. I took 43 pics just to get these 11.Crazy."},

I did pin a sleeve last night and it seems like it's still going to be snug but not as bad as a sausage casing, so 1/4\" seam allowances will be in order. But I did pin haphazardly at 5/8\" so there should be some leeway. I won't really be able to tell for sure until the back bodice is attached since it's such a weird piece.I've had two requests for info on the clear elastic hanging off the one bodice piece I worked on last night. I'll put together a post/tute on that soon, but it won't be this weekend and I'll have to convince Alex to be the photographer since I can't spare a hand when sewing on clear elastic.  In the meantime, gotta love me a Zappos fix. I ordered these * well after* I got home from work last night and they were here today. How DO they do that? Now the hard part will be deciding which pair (or two) to keep since they all fit.

I decided to use \"good\" fabric and not do a true crappy-fabric muslin because those sleeves need a reliable test. I'll sew the upper sections and evaluate. If it fits, I'll continue.

It's funny how sometimes you don't really *see* the fabric until it's stretched out on the cutting table. I thought this was a giraffe-ish print and instead I see it's actual a floral that reads giraffe. Personally, I wouldn't want brown flowers in real life but in this print, they're OK.So far tonight, I've cut out and marked the pieces, attached clear  elastic to the neckline pieces, and sewn the waist pleats on one side of  the bodice. And that's where I'm calling it quits for the evening as  it's getting to be bedtime and I need my beauty sleep. Although now that I'm thinking about it, I'm going to go pin that sleeve and try it on before I hit the sack so I don't lay awake wondering.

When I got home and changed out of them, I could pull a good 12\" past my foot without affecting the rest of the leg at all. I wonder if I can serge off about 20\" from the toes and if this will fix things. Or if I should just add them to the trash too.On the plus side, my velour mock turtleneck was very snuggly and warm all day and I got to wear a new scarf.There's been no more progress on the Vogue dress. It's been so cold, I just want to snuggle under the covers and read so that's what I've done the last two nights.Oh and speaking of reading, here's a complaint. After being on the wait list for 2 months, I got a notice from the Library that it was finally my turn for the Kindle edition of The Help. I immediately did everything I needed to do to get it downloaded to my Kindle, went to open it up and start reading, and there's nothing there but the cover picture. I've deleted and re-tried about 5 times with no success. So I'm stuck. If I think about it, I'll try calling the library tomorrow but I doubt there's anything they can do. I'll probably end up just buying this one. I haven't heard/read a bad thing about the book, so it should be money well spent."},
{"title": "V1257: Pattern Tissue Evaluation", "date": "Monday, January 2, 2012", "text": "I was going to write this tonight and post it tomorrow morning, but I really suck at remembering that it's a scheduled post and writing in future tense so here it is now instead of later. This is Vogue 1257, to refresh your memory.All of the reviews on PR complained about the tight sleeve, and with good reason. Holy cow- the size 20 sleeve is 13\" wide, *before* subtracting seam allowances. I was thinking I'd have to add at least 4\" inches, but then I actually measured my bicep and … well … Holy cow again. My bicep, *with a shirt on* is 13\". When did THAT happen? So that's why the scale is still going down but my pants size isn't. Oh well, I'll just have to be patient. Thinner biceps are great for eliminating a pattern alteration. Well, except here. I decided to add 2\" as a starting point. This is not my idea for the alteration, although it's pretty easy to see the sleeve \"piece\" melded with the front bodice. Now. ;-) I saw this in a PR review and thought, \"Brilliant!\" It's your usual full bicep alteration if you're not familiar with it.The is the pattern piece altered, and turned back so CF is vertical, so you can get an idea of the whole weird shape of it.I cut the bodice at the size 16, but the sleeve at the largest size, 20, because of the drafting goof. And then I also blended to more width at hip, figuring I can always take it in if needed. Better safe than sorry. And that's where I'm stopping for tonight because tomorrow it's Hi Ho, Hi Ho, Back to Work I Go and I need to go chill for a bit and then tuck myself into bed. But I've had a great weekend and I feel very productive. Got lots of errands done, the panties finally finished, some work this afternoon, some Sons of Anarchy watching, lots of football viewing, a couple of grown-up beverages, blog reading, and a new pattern pressed, cut and altered. I love these long weekends. And there's another one coming up in a couple of weeks. Yay!Speaking of chill — it's going to be FREEZING here tomorrow (literally freezing tomorrow night), so I'm already thinking about what to wear, and tights will figure in to it. Too bad I don't have any full-length boots. But as a consolation, it will definitely be nice to pull a nice new pair of undies out of the drawer tomorrow morning. There's just something about new underwear that makes the whole day better, am I right? Even without boots. Hahaha!… and purse-making interfacings. 13 spools of thread2 yds fusible fleece2 yds fusible heavy Craftfuse And the rest just fell into my cart. Yet another pattern, Threads, 5 yds of pattern tracing paper (very much like Swedish tracing paper), 2 yds of brown/white dots poly stretch charmeuse (for an as-yet undetermined blouse), 3-1/2 yds of paisley stretch moleskin (for the 1980-ish Vogue dress), and an accent button for that dress which matched so perfectly I couldn't leave it.I *did* have a 15% off entire purchase coupon good for sale and non-sale items alike which coincidentally expired today and I did return two dresses to Walmart this morning, so that absolves me a little. Um, very little."},
{"title": "Oh Thank Heaven", "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2012", "text": "Yes!! I am FINALLY done with the Panty Project (KS2908, modified, before you ask). They still need a trip through the laundry so the elastic shrinks back up. I love wearing my self-made panties and I will definitely avoid buying any RTW for as long as I'm able to sew, but truth be told, I hate sewing them. Well, what I really hate is sewing them assembly-line style. Maybe I ought to just knock out one or two pairs at a time every six months instead of attempting EIGHT. Urg. The mojo ought to deal with two with more enthusiasm. OK, not enthusiasm exactly, but tolerance. But, really, I probably don't need to sew panties again for another five years. For kicks, I revisited my first real post on this blog, which was panty sewing. And I saw that every single pair from that 2006 post was still in circulation. Not from desperation, though, but because they were still in pretty good condition (with one exception) and still fit fine (through up and down weights too, go figure — although they DO fit better now).This is the photo from back then:This is the photo from 15 minutes ago:One pair from the top photo is currently in the wash. Another (lower left corner) I tossed tonight because I noticed tiny fabric fatigue holes forming in a weird place and, well, I have a gazillion pairs now, because not only do I have these old ones and the new ones, I also have others I made in between.But some are favorites and some are worn with certain outfits. Do you do that? Have panties you prefer with jeans and others you prefer with officewear, and then those that have seen better days for \"those\" days of the month? I hope so, or else I'm just weird.This is the white tee I sacrificed for crotch linings. (Lord help me on the spam I'm going to get on this post with both panties and crotches. lol) After cutting what I needed, I stuffed it into my lingerie (oops, another spamtastic word) elastic bin so that maybe I can find it next time I am delusional and decide to make panties from scraps.So, enough about my underwear. Under where? Under there! Sorry, that just popped into my head.These are the patterns I'm contemplating for my next project. Unfortunately, the Vogue on the left has had mostly bad reviews, but at least I'll be forewarned. Maybe I'll consider it a personal challenge. ;-) The HP on the right I can see as a 2-piece dress (otherwise known as a skirt and top). The only problem I see with it is that I can't wear another layer over top (especially the top on the left which is my first choice), so will it be warm enough in my office? I'll ruminate over these and suitable stash fabrics while watching the rest of the football game tonight. (Looks like Tony Romo still ain't making it to the playoffs.)Tomorrow will include some work I need to do (yay overtime, and from home), and a trip to Joann's for thread and purse interfacings. If I've decided on a pattern, I may even get to start on a muslin. And with that, I'm off to toast the completion of the Panty Project. I'm very sure I deserve it. ;-) It's not Bailey's (my preference), but it's close, and a LOT cheaper."},
{"title": "Happy New Pattern (and Year)!", "date": "Saturday, December 31, 2011", "text": "When I'm not sewing, I'm buying. These all fell into my shopping cart today after discovering that BMV was having a good sale on all three brands. I also went ahead and signed up again for Club BMV after bowing out for the last couple of years. Since I'm earning back a lot of the $9.99 sale cost in just this order and I know there will be other orders in the coming year, I figure I'm not wasting money.The two patterns from this order that have my attention and the greatest chance of getting sewn sooner rather than later are:1. Vogue 1268. I love the 1980s/Working Girl vibe going on with this. I definitely would've worn (and rocked!) this in 1985 and I'm hoping I can wear it in 2012, but not quite as short as shown on the model. Truth be told, I would be perfectly content for 1980s styles (big hair and shoulder pads and everything) to come back into style. I loved that look. Or maybe it was just a good decade for me overall.2. McCall's 6519. I like the draped side action going on, but this one will need sleeves stolen from another pattern. The skirt is kind of cute too and may make it into the queue. It seems I'm drawn to dresses lately (Hi Carolyn!). I guess that's since I now have a crap-ton of skirts and the mojo needs to be fed.Plus, what's not to love about throwing on one garment in the early morning hours and heading out the door?* * * * * Thanks for sharing in my happiness at the unsolicitation on my newest outfit. No, I did not ask his name or say that I had made the outfit, but I did look right back at him and say, \"Thank you\" with a big smile. Frankly, I was too surprised to do much more. As some of you commented, how often do you hear a *man* complimenting in more than a general type of way about an outfit? I know that I will think of this compliment every time I wear the outfit. * * * * *I've been enjoying all the recaps in blogland the last few days and wish I could be a similarly introspective blogger on New Year's Eve, but alas, I am not. A lot has happened and a lot more is still to come, but I think overall, it's actually been a positive year. I'm pretty sure I'm getting this job (more details were shared by coworkers and my agency this week), I'm happier now about the way I look than I've been in years which does great things to self-esteem and confidence, and I've got a lot of good changes to come. I'm grateful for all of your support and I'm looking forward to 2012. It's going to be the best year ever!!Happy New Year everyone!"},
{"title": "Drive By", "date": "Thursday, December 29, 2011", "text": "As you may have guessed — with assembly-line sewing on the table waiting on the sewing table, not a stitch has been sewn since Monday. I did make good progress on the panty project but since then, nada. I've been going into the office early this week as we're under a big deadline so work has been wiping me out. Plus I seem to have stumbled onto a new, temporary addiction.Tyler mentioned he'd been catching up on previous seasons of Sons of Anarchy on Netflix and I discovered that I can stream all the episodes for free on my Kindle with Amazon Prime. And that's just what I've been doing in the evenings instead of sewing. I may have also watched an episode or two during my lunch breaks. Ahem. ;-)The good news for the day is that a very attractive man about my age (who knows? the older I get, the worse I am at guessing ages) got onto the parking garage elevator with me today. He stepped in after me and then quickly turned toward front as we all tend to do on elevators. But then, he turned back around, looked me square in the eyes, and said, \"That's a gorgeous outfit you're wearing today.\" I nearly died. Of happiness. ;-) Today's the day I wore my new twisty top, Magic Pencil Skirt, and goldy-greenish cardigan. I guess it's a hit. Oh, and I also wore a smile all day long. Thank you Mr. Stranger."},
{"title": "Universal, and Magic Pencil Customization", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2011", "text": "Whew! What a day we had yesterday at Universal, and oh! my poor aching legs. Sad, really, that a full day of walking does me in. I was wearing the brown ankle boots I bought for my Thanksgiving trip. Since they have man-made cushioned heels and soles, they were actually quite comfortable all day long as I knew they would be, and wearing them let me also wear a pair of my newer jeans without hemming or walking on the bottoms. It isn't the boots that I'm feeling today — just the constant use of out-of-shape leg muscles and creeping up on a certain age. The crowds were ENORMOUS, so I ended up splurging on Express Passes that let us bypass the long lines. Expensive, yes, but probably worth it just in eliminating the irritation factor. The crowds were also enormously international and we felt our Americanism was quite the minority. But since it was Christmas Day, it was to be expected that the park would be filled with folks who don't celebrate it. Of course, there were a few rude peeps here and there as there always are, but by and large and especially with a swarm this huge, everyone else was pretty nice, friendly, and polite — even if we didn't understand a word they were saying to each other. I'm always impressed by international visitors' English skills when speaking to their hosts, even those Brits with the funny accents. ;-)I haven't really been into the Harry Potter phenom (although I'm thinking I should really read the series via my library and Kindle) but Alex has and he was impressed with that new area of the park, and commented many times on how great the details were. The new Harry Potter ride was very well done too and impressed me, a theme park cynic and non-HP fan. The roller coaster in that section is still the \"old\" Dueling Dragons now renamed Dragon something-or-other, and it is still a screamer. I did all the coasters and other rides with Alex, except for the one where you end up dripping wet. It was quite warm yesterday (around 80), but I still wasn't up for walking around the park soaked to the skin. I have to say that every time I was strapped into a seat, I felt a little smug that I actually now fit into it comfortably. Or as comfortable as one can really feel when strapped into a seat right before plunging 400 feet. ;-)My cell battery died way early in the day due to me leaving the screen on by mistake, so I didn't get many photos. Alex has some on his phone that he'll forward to me when he wakes up. Hopefully, they turned out OK and I'll be able to share a few.* * * * *  For the sewing part of today's entry, I wanted to document the changes I made to the Magic Pencil Skirt for you and for the review I'll write up later.The pattern piece on the right, below, is what you get in the pattern. It's the only piece, which is part of what makes the Magic. It's cut on the fold once for the front and again for the back. In order to add a kick pleat, I needed to add a CB seam. Since it's only one piece to trace, I decided I would do that instead of hobbling on to the original envelope piece. So, I traced the pattern and added a 5/8\" seam allowance at the CB. Onto that, I added a 2\" wide kick pleat extension. I didn't use any magic formula to decide how high to place it. Just keep in mind that if you place it too high, you run the risk of showing your undies. Thankfully, my guess as to placement turned out just this side of safe in the undies department. I should probably lower it an inch for the future. After cutting, you'll now have three pieces instead of two. Sew the darts. Next, since there is no zipper here, sew the CB seam from the waist edge down into 5/8\" of the kick pleat extension and lock stitches. Then continue your sewing but now using basting stitches to sew the remainder of the kick pleat. Press the seam allowances open. Then clip the corner at the kick pleat on the *right* extension, flip it over onto the left and from the right side, sew the extensions in place with an angled line of stitching, as shown below. Remove your basting stitches and press the under flap to remove the basting crease. (Since I used a stable knit, I didn't finish the raw edges of the seam allowances or pleat. No one will see. But if this bugs you or you're using a ravel-y fabric, finish your raw edges as your first step, before you sew the CB seam). Continue with the pattern instructions, and obviously, start your hem at one side of the kick pleat and end it at the other, so you don't sew it closed at the bottom. Speaking of undies, I think that's what's on the sewing room agenda today. While I really want to sew about 20 more skirts, I do realize that my closet is getting pretty full of them so I'm forcing a mini break. I don't know how many undies I'll get through because assembly-line sewing kills the mojo for me, but I'm going to make a stab because in the end, I really do prefer my self-made undies. I have a few pairs cut out from before the weight loss that I'll need to recut smaller and I also have some knit scraps from recent projects to add to the production.I also realized when getting dressed casually yesterday for warm temps, that I'm really, really lacking in the short-sleeved tee department. Which is ironic, since I used to have so many. Well, I still do, but they just don't fit anymore. So I need to alter some smaller/shorter, toss some, and add a few new ones to the wardrobe. Anything good on YOUR sewing agenda today?"},
{"title": "Merry Christmas, and Some Sewing", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2011", "text": "Chances are by the time you're reading this, Alex and I will be in line at Universal, waiting to ride a rollercoaster. I'm hoping this will be as cool a Christmas as I'm thinking, as I type this on Christmas Eve. At the very least, it will be different.Today was a ME day. I had nothing to do but sew and watch football all day. You couldn't pay me to go near a store on December 24. And the day was a great present to myself! It's been busy at work this week (although the non-traffic driving in/out of the city has been a dream!), so I haven't felt much like sewing or computering in the evenings. I thought about it and that's just as far as I went. Instead, I curled up with my Kindle and read or played some word games. Sometimes you just have to decompress.But this morning I slept in, then took the dogs out (and for those who asked, yes, we still have 3), and then planted myself in my sewing room and was productive. I cut and finished both the Butterick top and another Magic Pencil Skirt, and here they are:And with a cardi that also is in this same color family of weird greenish gold: Pretty great match, right? I love it when fabrics spontaneously match themselves from different orders and different times. This one took a while, though. The print is a buttermilk knit (remember those?) from Emma One Sock and has been waiting in the stash for years. The skirt is a Silhouette doubleknit very recently purchased from Fabric.com. It's perfect for a skirt or pants, but Silhouette is not interchangeable with Sophia. It's more synthetic feeling/looking, but I can tell it will wear like iron. With the polyester content of these pieces, this outfit ought to outlive me by 300 or 400 years. ;-) I still have a couple buttermilk tops which look as vivid as when the fabric first arrived, even after many, many wearings/washings. Here's a shot of the top from the inside, since the seaming and twist are lost in the photos of the print. I did add to the neckline at the shoulder seams and just turned under the hem and didn't bind it as I thought I might. I used Wonder Tape to hold it down while stitching, and once that is washed out, the neckline will have its stretch/recovery back. As you can see, I didn't finish every seam, mostly to reduce bulk and partly because these seams lay best when open flat. I also changed the construction order a bit so I could turn under the neckline edge and loop/hole (where the twist happens) while they were still relatively flat. Like Barbara of Sewing on the Edge, I'm in line to be hired by a pattern company to write better instructions. Also like Barbara, I'm not holding my breath.I added a CB seam and kick pleat to the Magic Pencil Skirt, which is just barely discernible in any of these photos, including this one below which was taken specifically to show the detail. Oh well. I also made the higher-waisted version of this skirt this time, because I wanted to use the elastic at full-width. I'm not wearing my gut-sucking-in pantyhose in these pics, or else I might have tucked in my top to show you. You'll just have to take my word that the waist is indeed higher on this one than the last. I'm also modeling my new shoes. It's been a month or so, so it was time for another pair, right? Plus, I don't want to wear out my current favorites so I needed to expand the repertoire. You can't really see them in my pic, so here's the Zappos shot.I also ordered these for kicks. I wanted to see how they looked and felt, not really intending to keep them. They are actually surprisingly comfortable, but alas a little too tight on my pinky toe. Since I've vowed to not keep shoes that aren't comfortable from the instant I first put them on, these will indeed be going back. But I'm definitely open to try a similar style now. Or am I too old for another round of platforms? * * * * *Rebecca Grace asked, \"since knits are all different in the stretch, how can you test fit a pattern using one knit from the Sorry Sale Bin and know whether the Good Knit that you really like is going to make up with the same fit as your \"muslin?\"\"I wish I had a scientific, proven method for you but I don't. The honest truth is I just wing it. But I've been sewing knits for a long time now and wearing them even longer, so I'm reasonably experienced and, yes, good, at knowing how different knits will behave and what adjustments I'll have to make between Sorry Sale Tester and Good Don't Want To Ruin It fabrics. So I guess my best advice is to just try, knowing you will fail sometimes but from that failure will come experience and knowledge. It's only fabric. ;-)* * * * *Merry Christmas to all who celebrate! I hope Santa brings you everything you've wished for. Happy Holidays to those otherwise celebrating, and Have a Great Sunday to those who aren't. (Did I cover everything/everyone?)"},
{"title": "B5429: The Muslin", "date": "Tuesday, December 20, 2011", "text": "This is NOT a wearable muslin, because I wouldn't be caught dead in this fabric. You can't see it in the pics, but it's got multi-colored metallic threads woven throughout and it's way glittery and tacky looking. Funny how none of that shows in the photos. And what was I thinking? At least it's out of the stash now.Other than needing a bit more length, since this is the raw, unhemmed length, I think it's a go. There are only four pattern pieces and cutting out and sewing went very quickly. It will be even quicker when I'm using my serger.I cut a straight 16 and made no alterations. I'm still wearing a DD bra cup, so there is obviously some bust room in this pattern. While the fabric I used for the muslin is a knit, the stretch runs vertically and that's how I cut it, figuring that if it fit this way, it will fit with the stretch going around too, although I may need to sew deeper seams under my arms. I was actually expecting it to be tighter than it is, with very little width-wise stretch. Maybe I should've cut the 14. We'll see.Speaking of arms, I didn't have enough fabric to cut full-length sleeves so I ended up cutting about 6\" shorter than the sleeve pattern. And they are plenty long enough for me at what turned out to be bracelet length. With six more inches, the sleeves would be covering my hands. Not a look I'm after.I think I'm going to bind the neck with my coverstitch machine instead of turning the raw edge under per the pattern. The main reason is because the neckline is just on this side of being a bit too wide and my bra straps are starting to peek out. If I remember when I'm cutting the real top tomorrow, I'll add a little to the pattern pieces at the top of the shoulder at the neckline edge. Otherwise, I'll be getting out the Hollywood stay tape. I'm still not sure about the dropped shoulders, and, unfortunately, you can't see them at all in these pics. I can definitely feel the seam and it feels kind of weird, like my sleeve is falling down. Which, I suppose, it is. ;-) But this muslin knit is also fairly rough so that seam shouldn't be as thick in the real fabric. I've decided to use the paisley because it's thinner. The twist is already kind of bulky in this muslin knit and I don't want to push it with the sweater-y knit. Plus, the cardigan I wore today (and which you haven't seen) matches the skirt fabric very well, and if I use the thinner knit, I can do layers."},
{"title": "Hodgepodge", "date": "Monday, December 19, 2011", "text": "A bunch of mostly disconnected stuff, except they are all sewing-related.First up, the next in the OOO RAH wallets for a customer. I worked on this yesterday around football and Kindle reading. I almost forgot how much I missed reading. I believe I can now sew these wallets blindfolded. Tonight's sewing consisted of a 1-1/2\" straight line, but it was an important inch and a half. This is the dress I bought from Walmart a couple of months ago. Aren't you digging the pants sticking out underneath? Before I would wear this dress I needed to lose a few more pounds so it didn't hug my butt quite as closely, and tack the neckline higher to keep my belly button from being on display. Both have now been accomplished and I will be wearing this tomorrow, with a cardi I've had on hold for the occasion. The temp is always cool in the office so a second layer is almost always mandatory.Last night I started digging through some of my newer stash. Stash that hasn't even made it into the closet yet, but instead lives in a pile on the floor because of course I'm going to sew it all up in the next week. Yeah, sure. But I'm glad I did that because it stopped me from clicking the Purchase button on another cart full of irresistibles. The fabric on the left is a knit which will become another Magic Pencil Skirt. I've been DYING to make another since the first one turned out so well and was so quick. However, I'm going to add a CB seam and kick pleat to this one just to change it up a bit. So much for quick. Hah.The fabric on the right above or below, I haven't decided yet, will probably be the twist top from Butterick 5429.It's circled in yellow here. I will need to make a quick muslin first for fit and to decide if I really like it.Because I'm concerned about these drop shoulders. If not this pattern, I'll pick something else. Now I'm just waiting for the lights to come back on at Candlestick park so the football game can continue. Looks like it's time to fire up the Kindle while I wait."},
{"title": "Let Them (me) Eat Cake", "date": "Saturday, December 17, 2011", "text": "After months and months (and months and months and months) of not eating cake or anything in the sinful dessert category, I gave myself permission to indulge in the extremely rich and chocolately cake that was put before me at the office party. I decided I earned it, and as you can see, I left no crumb unturned. ;-) The uneaten beauty next to my empty plate is the raspberry edition. Imagine the same pretty little cake but all in chocolate. It was worth it. DeeLISH. And much better than the rubber chicken for the entreé. OK, it wasn't really rubber and was quite good, but it certainly wasn't chocolate cake.The party was fun. There were silly videos shown lampooning bosses and coworkers. I didn't know most of the victims subjects since they work in a different location, but they were still funny and my tablemates were kind enough to explain the really obscure references. It was also nice to meet some people face to face that I've only dealt with via telephone or email. And hey, I was NOT introduced as \"This is our TEMP Debbie,\" but instead as \"This is Debbie, a new addition to the Marketing Department.\" Gives a girl hope. Most of the office cleared out shortly after our return from the party, but with a huge deadline looming, I not only stayed late last night but I went in today for 6 hours and continued some graphics work from my home computer upon my return. That's OK. A check full of overtime the week before Christmas will be quite welcome. And, of course, the Good Worker points are priceless in my quest to turn this gig permanent.As I hinted, I ended up wearing the skirt with the red jeweled shell, the red drapey cardi, and the black belt. There was lots of red & black, and just black, so I fit right in. The only semi-issue I had with the skirt was climbing into the back seat of a car. Without a kick pleat, I had to maneuver trickily while still maintaining a ladylike posture. In the future, I think I will add a kick pleat, not that I can't do ladylike postures …"},
{"title": "Comments on the comments", "date": "Thursday, December 15, 2011", "text": "First, thank you all so much for all the comments and the nice compliments — very much appreciated!As of right now (checks watch: 10:35 PM), I believe I'm wearing the jeweled red shell and red drapey neck cardigan tomorrow. I always had it in my mind to pair the skirt with red for the party and while I didn't count \"votes,\" I think this was the winner in the comments too. But then I started thinking that this will be a One Hit Wonder, because I don't particularly like to wear bright red at other times of the year. This inner discussion went on all day long and at different points in the day, I had decided on different outfits. But then I realized I actually don't care if I never wear the red again and that made all the difference. I don't have a fortune invested in the pieces, and I'll probably at least wear the cardigan with jeans and I do have that nice ivory cardigan I bought a couple of weeks ago which will look good with the skirt and tone down the red of the shell for later wearing. So that's where I am right now. Not sure about which belt, or any belt. I'll see how I feel in the morning. I'm leaning toward the wide black belt, though.As to the long dress not being office appropriate … it's just that it's a long VELVET (velour) dress, which I think is just overkill for the environment. And funked up with the leather jacket and boots (which I don't own yet), it's then too … well … funky for work. If it were a different fabric, it would be fine for the office. That's all I meant when I call it \"not office appropriate.\" But I *will* wear it at some point, even if it's far enough down the road that I have to take it in at the sideseams. I've always loved the dress and only wore it a couple of times before I outgrew it.I did get to Beall's tonight and bought two pairs of earrings. What can I say, I like options. ;-) I even looked at purses but nothing jumped out at me so no new purse purchase but not for lack of trying.After Beall's, it was to Walmart for grocery shopping. And I remembered to pick up another black and grey skirt in a smaller size while they were still available because I know I will miss them terribly when they're too big. For someone who never used to wear black, I'm becoming rather attached to my black skirt. An email circulated today about the party tomorrow, telling us that cocktails would start being served at 11:30 AM. OMG. ELEVEN-THIRTY IN THE MORNING??? Good thing I'll be passing them up or I'd never make it through. Also good thing that I'm catching a ride with some co-workers in case I change my mind. Oh, I also bought two dresses while at Beall's. But I didn't try them on yet. So I'm going upstairs to do that and then hopefully to bed before midnight. I have a lot of partying to do tomorrow.Parting Shot: Have Yourself a Marine Little Christmas!It may take a few minutes for this post to fully download cuz there's a TON of pics.The skirt is done, and all layers now fit. Whew. I compared pattern pieces and they were fine, so I can only conclude that the lining fabric shrunk during pressing. This was sorta confirmed when I saw it puckering when I started to press the new seams. I quickly abandoned THAT idea. I'm no fool. Well, except for the no-prewash bit. ;-)The fix was relatively easy. Unpicking black stitches on black fabric after dark was the hardest part. I just re-sewed with the most minimal of seam allowances and it worked.My zipper is a thing of beauty and I did NOT want to disturb it at all. The matching looks a little wonky in these hanger pics, but it really came out pretty good. Not perfect, since I totally forgot about matching that CB seam when cutting, but more than good enough. And my hem is one thousand percent better (and straighter) than the RTW inspiration skirt. Here's that dastardly lining. It's really straight, not crooked like it looks here. Once again, I cheated, cut crosswise, and used the selvege for the hem. It's a lining — who cares. Here you can see those puckers I mentioned. The good thing is that I will keep getting smaller, so they shouldn't be a problem going forward. Fingers crossed.Now it's time to start the What Will I Wear To The Christmas Party Parade of Possibilities. First up, a ruffle knit tee with gold flecks throughout. It's more sparkly than it appears here. Pros — it's comfortable, it's a size Medium (that shouldn't count but it does), and it won't be too hot. Cons — maybe just a little too casual. I'll probably keep this no matter what because I do like it and sparkly this season seems to be more silver than gold and I prefer gold. Maybe with jeans at Universal on Christmas Day with Alex??Red shell with jeweled neckline, drapey-neck red cardi, sparkly belt. Pros — more Christmas-y but still office appropriate, looks good with the houndstooth. Cons —Not sure about the red on me, the belt is probably too much, will need to get back to Beall's tomorrow night to get the earrings I saw to go with this and somehow ended up not buying cuz I think they fell through my cart.  With a wide black belt (and a Chili dog). Better I think.Faux twinset that I found buried in a drawer. The underlayer is very sparkly but you can't see it very well here. Pros — Extremely comfortable, lightweight, and maybe better than red on me. Cons — it's too big so I'm going to have to do some serging of the sideams tomorrow night if I go with this, and will still need to get some earrings, and maybe a purse. Hey, if I'm going to wear something I already had, I deserve a new purse, right?Extremely, incredibly sparkly velour faux twinset. I love this jacket, but it's not office appropriate at all. This one is definitely out, but I still love it. And this shade of red is better on me. I wish I had someplace to wear it, but since I don't, it will be returned. Oh, that uneven hem? Yes, it really is. So I'd have to fix this too, if I were keeping it.Outfit from the closet of years past. It's a long black velour sheath dress with a gold/black cardi/jacket over top, another Walmart find if I remember correctly. It's too long to be office appropriate IMO, but I'm not ready to cut it off yet. So this one is pretty much a no-go. Dress alone, with belt, and half-pale arms. I can see this being part of a cool go-out outfit, if I ever go out again. Haha. But I'm definitely not going sleeveless in the office. NOT for the party, but this is my $29 faux leather jacket. With nuthin' underneath. Ooooo. lol Or THIS could be a going out outfit. I'm also wearing the scarf I picked up with the party tops, but not to wear to the party. Now I need some black boots to complete the look, right? I'm sure you will all weigh in with opinions. I'm looking forward to it. I'm leaning toward one pairing in particular — which one do you think I'll pick?BTW —another agency, which hasn't contacted me in MONTHS, called me today about a job doing pretty much exactly what I'm doing now but for a global commercial real estate brokerage not a law firm. I told them I'm up for an interview if they can sell me. Can't have too many irons in the fire, right? And nice to know I'm not dead to them. ;-)"},

I thought all I had left to do was to hem it, but nooooooooooooooooooooooooo.I tried it on and the lining is too tight. Like REALLY too tight. I can get it on OK, but Lord help me if I have to go to the bathroom and pull the bottom up. The skirt part fits great, though. So tomorrow after work and after my haircut, I'll be ripping and restitching the lining with smaller seam allowances. It shouldn't be this tight, so it's either fabric shrinkage from pressing or the one-piece front is a LOT smaller than the pieced-yoke front. I'll compare them tomorrow in between ripping. If the lining fabric did shrink, then stupid me for not prewashing it, right? At this point, I'm willing to just rip the lining out altogether if I have to, so it's best to wait until tomorrow to deal with it. I do have lining fabric left over if I need to get really desperate and piece in some gussets. This photo just looks like a blob, but it's supposed to show you how I sewed the lining and skirt sideseams as one (after attaching facings/lining to each section), so that it's easier to take in down the road. Hah, joke's on me. This whole unit would lay flat but I had already attached the lining to the zipper so it's caught up on that when pulled apart like this. I think I'm going to sew ALL of my lined skirts this way from now on. It just seems easier and it turns out so neat and finished. Well, it will once the lining is fixed. Hopefully I can get this all taken care of tomorrow night and still have time for outfit possibility pics. And I wish it was going to be about 10 degrees cooler on Friday. A wool skirt at 77 degrees may induce heatstroke. But I'll look good while I'm fainting."},

I decided who was I kidding that I needed to make a special trip into the mobs of shoppers for a zipper for a skirt I hadn't even cut out yet. So I went on my way home from work tonight instead since it *is* on the way and no special trip was needed. And I didn't buy any fabric, so hah! to all of you doubters. ;-) OK, so I looked, but it was a fabric wasteland there tonight so it was easy to come home with no further stash additions. I got my black zipper and a few others in my usual colors, plus the latest issue of Vogue Patterns magazine, mostly because Peter is in it. And I swear I had to do a doubletake on the cover model because with just a quick glance, I first thought it was Peter's identical cousin Cathy on the cover. No lie. Must the bone structure and eyebrows. (Nice article, Peter!)After dinner, I spent some time in the sewing room. I cut out the skirt, single layer even (but not the lining yet), interfaced the facings and front yoke pieces, and serged all the raw edges since (1) this fabric ravels and (2) I'm going to be pressing seams open to allow for easier alterations later on. (Elaine, I haven't read that Threads article, but I'm pretty sure what I'm doing is probably what it shows.) Then I sewed the front yoke pieces together and topstitched them. The next step will be the invisible zipper in the back pieces, so I quit for the night. I figure I'll have better results if I do that at the start of my sewing evening instead of at the end. Or that's the theory anyway.I really like the yoke pieces on the bias. I think they are flattering and add nice visual interest, especially now that I'm  not averse to tucking in tops again. Ann of Gorgeous Fabrics sent a very generous \"1 yard\" cut so I had no trouble fitting all the pieces with fabric to spare. So far, this skirt is looking much better than the RTW houndstooth skirt I tried on at Beall's.Parting Shot: Goodbye my beloved Sunshines. I only wear this one at home these days because it's too big and I end up flashing most of my bra before I realize I need to adjust it. You can see it sticking out here. I'm going to miss this one. But I do have more of this fabric so I think I may make a replacement in a smaller size. But first I have to figure out what that size is. And I think I cut the pattern. Oops. Hopefully, it won't be too hard to figure out the lines for a smaller one. But if it is, I'll just buy it again."},
{"title": "Starting B5566", "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2011", "text": "So here's how my thought process went last night, through this morning. 1. I want to make a different pattern for the houndstooth skirt. Maybe princess seams with a contoured waistband.2. I'm pretty sure I know what I have on hand from the Big 3/4 and I don't think there's anything there.3. I haven't looked at my Burda WOFs in a while, so I'll pull them out.4. Hmm. I'm guessing I'm a 48 in Burda WOF. 5. Thumb, thumb, thumb through the patterns.6. Oh, I like that one. Drat. It only goes up to a 42. At this point tracing is enough. I don't want to grade it too.7. Thumb, thumb, thumb.8. Another possibility.9. Another 42. 10. And so on.11. An hour later, it's 3 AM and I need to go to sleep.12. Wake up this morning and realize that I really do NOT want to do princess seams on a houndstooth check, esp since I only have 1 yard of it and can't do a bias panel cheat. What was I thinking??13. I don't feel like going through all the Burdas again.14. So I'll start thumbing through my Big 3/4s, this time looking for a very plain darted pencil skirt.15. Nothing. Really, nothing? 16. How can I NOT have a plain pencil skirt pattern?17. Changing gears again and narrowing it down to 2 or 3 not-quite-plain possibilities.18. Butterick 5566 it is.19. This one in brown with the pattern weight next to it, View B.20. I figure I can do the pieced waist without too much fabric, and worst case, maybe use some faux leather from the stash.21. Look at the pattern envelope to decide on a size. 22. Measure myself.24. Realize I had TOTALLY guessed too big for my Burda WOF sizing. Slap forehead. Oh well, don't feel like backtracking.25. Press and cut out pattern pieces for View  B.Only then do I really look at the pattern instructions and realize that View A (lower left and right corners) is actually just a plain darted pencil skirt with AN OVERLAY. But I'm already mentally committed to View B, so I cut a muslin and sewed it. And here I am, channeling my inner Peter Lappin with a sheet skirt. It fits perfectly with no alterations in the sheet (except I need to add more length to turn a hem), but my real fabric is thicker and I want to line it, so I'm going to add 3/8\" to each sideseam to account for the extra bulk. I'm also going to sew it so that I can easily take apart the sideseams when I need to take it in. I don't want this to be a short-term disposable. And since it fits so well, the other views are sparking my interest again too. (My mojo always sparks in December, when I have a zillion other things to do.)I don't think I'll be using a contrast at the waist but instead will cut those pieces on the bias and interface them for stability. Of course, I haven't even measured the actual fabric cut yet so that plan (like all my others) could change.But first I have to get publicly presentable and head off to Joann's for a zipper (or 20). I will not buy fabric. I will not buy fabric. I. WILL. NOT. BUY. FABRIC."},
{"title": "FNSI Complete, aka Let Me At My Sewing Room for ME", "date": "Saturday, December 10, 2011", "text": "I almost finished this wallet last night for the Friday Night Sew In (FNSI) but I ran out of steam. I did finish it up this morning and it's all packed up for shipping, along with the purse I finished a couple of weeks ago. I've got 5 more purse and/or wallet orders (and maybe another 1 or 2 on the way from a woman who was admiring my purse at the nail salon this morning and took down all my info), which is great. But whew, it takes away from sewing for ME ME ME. ;-) So while I have the next customer project cut out and ready to sew, I'm not going to start on it tomorrow. Instead, I will be starting my houndstooth skirt. I haven't yet decided on a pattern. I should be smart and stick to my TNT Burda but I'm getting a wee bit tired of it. I've got lots of back issues of Burda WOF (when it still was WOF), and I think I'll drag my binders of the line drawing inserts out tonight and see if anything strikes my fancy. Yes, that will mean tracing and a muslin and I may go running back to my TNT, but right now I feel that I need some variety and challenge around the production sewing.Speaking of Burda WOF, now BS (hah!), I'm thinking of subscribing again. I'm SO tired of the boring patterns offered by the Big 3/4. I was shopping again today and saw lots of cute things that there should be patterns for and aren't. None of them are too complicated and I could probably come up with patterns but I just don't want to spend the time on it.It's so much more instantly gratifying to just buy the finished item. ;-)Speaking of shopping, there will be a \"poll\" in a day or so, to get your opinions on my Christmas party selections. I was all over the board today between semi-casual and very glittery. Everything is red, though (I think), which is what I wanted to match up with the houndstooth skirt and my black patent heels. I also picked up a fake leather jacket for $29, marked down from 4x the price. I need to see some pics of me in it before I decide if it's staying, but it will probably have to be absolutely horrid to overcome the great price. I swear, I'm never shopping anywhere other than Beall's. I always find 20 things I want. And it's only a mile down the road, much closer than the mall and NOT in a mall. What's not to love?Alex and I will be here by ourselves for Christmas and we've decided we're going to get up early and head to Universal Studios Islands of Adventure for the day (which is less than an hour away). I've promised him I will go on whatever rides he chooses. I had to have a moment of raw honesty and tell him that I actually like the rides, but wasn't enthusiastic (read embarrassed) when my butt didn't fit into the seats (how sad). Now that it will, I'll be a screaming idiot and loving every minute. I think it will be a fun mom/son day. He thinks I'm a rollercoaster wimp when it was just a fat rear end so I've got some convincing to do. I do love a challenge. ;-)Parting Shot: Tyler thinks there's a job for Chili on his base.

It's a good busy, but still …Speaking of work — look at the torture I've had to avert the last 4 months. These are the \"birthday cakes.\" Every month on the middle Friday, they order in a bunch of cakes, pies, and cookies to celebrate that month's birthdays. I've been good and haven't had even a bite of any of these FOR FOUR MONTHS. But I do stop by and look at them. Today, I brought my cell camera to share the torture with you. Actually, it's not really too much torture. I'm so used to not eating sweets and carbs that these are easy to pass up, and I have the greater goal in mind. If I'm still around in March, maybe I'll request a veggie tray?? ;-)Waiting for me when I got home was my houndstooth order from Gorgeous Fabrics. I'm hoping I get a chance to at least start my skirt this weekend. It would be nice to even finish it and pair it with a yet-to-be-bought sparkly red top for the Christmas lunch on the 16th. Beall's had a few, so maybe I'll stop by there tomorrow while I'm out. For now, it's off to the sewing room to work on an OOO RAH wallet for my FNSI project. If I get that done, the skirt is next."},
{"title": "Not Much", "date": "Thursday, December 8, 2011", "text": "Just a few pics of what I've worn the last couple of days. This was Tuesday's outfit. It's my Vogue 1250 dress with the Vogue cardi I just made and am too lazy to look back a few days to get the pattern number. The belt is getting big now, so it likes to slide off-center. I'll need to find a replacement because I like having a wide brown belt. Here's a sideways shot (and my head looks weirdly small). The tum still has some disappearing to do but it's definitely going in the right direction. Chili was a love pig during this shoot and had to be in every pic. He's so cute he can (and does) get away with anything.Today's outfit is all RTW. The dress you've seen before, from Walmart. One of my best buys ever. I love this thing and it was less than $20. The cardi is from Burlington on my shopping trip before Thanksgiving. Today was the first day I wore it. It has covered shank buttons up the front and on the sleeves. Nice touch. Also under $20. It's cold here tonight so I'm snuggling up by the Fire ;-) and reading under the covers. I just finished this one:… which was pretty good, very John Grisham-like, and only 99¢ on Amazon. But now I'm reading the real thing, The King of Torts. I usually keep up with all of his books, but I've missed a few and didn't have to wait long to borrow them from the library. If you're interested, I'll be posting what I'm currently reading in the upper-left corner of the blog. The new Lucky magazine was also delivered to my Fire sometime in the last 24 hours. I'm still undecided about whether I like reading magazines on the Fire, since I have to do my fair share of zooming in or give in to the cheaters. But you can't beat the convenience factor.Work went very well today. I can't really elaborate, but I made a few good impressions and actually had people \"clamoring\" (my boss' term!) for me to design a couple of projects. It's nice to be needed and wanted. It does the soul good. :-) Our pot-luck party yesterday was fun. I ended up with a good gift and mine was well-received too. I'll try to remember to take a pic for the next posting.Back to the covers and more snuggling with the Fire and Dani."},

I wore the gray skirt, tee, and ivory cardigan today and loved the outfit!There will be two FNSI's this month, with the first this Friday. Click on the link to hurry on over to Heidi's blog and sign up for this Friday, and you might also win a copy of my OOO RAH Wallet pattern and fabric to make it.I'm plugging away on two wallets myself. I need to finish one of them tomorrow night and get it the heck in the mail. The other needs to be done too but it's not as urgent yet. I also received THREE purse orders today. Yikes. I immediately emailed these peeps to let them know that Christmas delivery was not an option. ;-) Looks like it's a good thing I bought some clothes cuz my personal sewing time just got chopped. It's OK. Extra money at Christmas is a Good Thing. I think I have an xbox or 2 to buy.Tomorrow is a casual Christmas pot-luck lunch at the office for my department. We're also doing a silly Yankee Swap, with the main rule being that the gift you bring has to be something found around your house that you don't want. (Can I wrap up STBex?) So now I have to go hunt down something. I have an idea and it's not even a bad thing. Then I have to get up early to put together the salad I'm bringing. Or at least the parts of it. You can't really make a green salad too far in advance, so I'll bag up the toss-in's separately and then mix it all together just before lunchtime. I'm not the only one who mainly eats salads at lunch, but since I do, I wanted to be sure I had something I could actually eat. Tricky, eh? ;-)I did another self-timer modeling session tonight to see my recent makes and purchases through the camera's eyes. Note to self: Don't take pics of snug skirts right after dinner and make sure you're not also hiking it up with your hands on your hips, cuz … OMG. So, with that said, forgive the tummy wrinkles and fat knees. I still have about 30-40 lbs to lose and I swear 95% of it is between crotch and kneecap. IOW, those damn thighs. ;-)Here's the Vogue/Marci Tilton cardigan I whipped up today. Haha. Seriously though, it was a pretty quick project. The skirt should've been whipped up yesterday but I kept distracting myself and it took all day. The shell is covered with tiny clear sequins on the front. A Walmart purchase for about $10. I had to return the first one because it was too big. I love that. I'm usually pretty good at judging size by just holding up things, but it's a moving target these days. NOT complaining. I was also trying out two necklaces. I like the longer one with this. I may still return this shell because I'm not sure about the sequins for the office. They are not in your face, but there is some shine/sparkle. Then again, they do perk up an otherwise bland outfit. (Yes, I argue with myself like this all the time.) Here's the back cut-out ruffle thing. I kind of like my top peeking out. It distracts from the knee fat. Well, except now you're looking at it, aren't you? ;-) That's it for sewing. The rest of the pics are RTW. Gray skirt below from Walmart a few weeks ago. I really need to just go ahead and buy the smaller size of this and the black one while they're still available. They are cheap and I think I'll miss them. The cardigan and tee are from Beall's Friday night. I *love* this cardi. It's textural and has a very subtle gold metallic woven into it. It's also got an interesting raw-edged trim which doesn't really show up in these pics.Tee alone. The grays aren't a 100% perfect match, but I think they're close enough. I never wear gray (even less than black), so this is a new color for me. I really like this top, though. The floral is lace over a solid ivory inner layer (bodice only). It was on clearance for about $12 and there were lots of them so I guess I'm the only one who liked it.The cardi again with a plain sweater knit shell underneath, also from Beall's. They aren't the same brand but they match perfectly. Kismet. The purple sweater (from Beall's) that I'm not sure about. I like the color. I love the black rosette humungo snaps. I'm not thrilled with the puffy, gathered sleevecaps. And again with the tummy wrinkles. Sheesh. Cheap cotton tee from Walmart tonight. Like $7. The overall length and sleeves are too long, but I think I'm going to make it short-sleeved and see how much it shrinks in the wash before I hem it. It will be a good underlayer piece. It's also got subtle gold metallic threads knitted in, which you can see better in the pic one more down.Another cheap Walmart tee, but this one fits better. Same brand, same size as the one above. Yeah, it's Walmart. What can you expect? Don't you love the boob tag still stuck on? The print is brown and beige and will work with my brown Magic Pencil skirt and the cardi above, as well as jeans. Not so much with the gray skirt, but I was being lazy at this point. And last, a brown \"tweed\" turtleneck I couldn't resist even though we'll only have about 10 days I can wear it and not melt. It's velour rib knit and it is SO soft and comfy. And it was only $15. I don't think I'll wear this to the office, but then again, I might. It's nice to wear a turtleneck without 3 chins resting on it. I don't expect the Walmart purchases to last beyond this season, but since I don't really want them to fit next winter, I'm OK with that. At some point, I'll get down to a size where I can do more \"investment\" shopping and sewing, but until then, I'll just keep faking it with disposables.And one more — I made this Vogue cardi last year to wear at Parris Island for Tyler's graduation. I never modeled it then. Now, it's one of the few \"old\" things that still fits OK. It's tied kind of wonky in this pic, but you get the idea.I wore the HECK out of last weekend at my Uncle's. And my sister put in an order. I told her I'd make it for her for Christmas but not to expect it BY Christmas.So now I need to find a color of Sophia knit that she'll like. And serger thread to match, since a wide serger overedge stitch is how I finished the edges."},

I'm just so witty. ;-)These are the pattern photos for Vogue 8559.The only useable photos are the ones of ivory top. Uh, hello Vogue (and Marci)? Photos of black garments are freakin' useless!! What were they thinking?The cardigan is quite short, which you can see in one photo and also when you see the pattern pieces.I added 5\" to the length, which seems to be about right for me. Even though all of the views look to be pretty much the same, there are actually two very distinct ways to make these, along with very different pattern pieces to go with. The view I didn't make has no sideseams and is basically one big square with holes for sleeves and the neckline. It's a little more finessed than that, but I'm speaking generally.Must shrink Zillie soon as she's all boob now and I'm notBecause I was eeking this out of leftover fabric, I chose the other view which is a more traditional looking cardigan pattern. In retrospect, I would probably still choose this view no matter how much fabric I have, because when there are no sideseams, there is also no sideseam shaping at the waist. I want all the help I can get. ;-)I really liked the ethereal effect of the trim on the ivory cardigan on the pattern envelope. I didn't have anything even close the mesh-y trim used for that but I did use a thin and much drapier rayon knit for my trim, which is sewn lapped with all edges left raw. The main bodice pieces are ponte knit. I like how it turned out, and I think it will look even better after going through the wash and curling up. How lucky that I had two browns that matched perfectly. Another reason for a big fabric stash (like I need an excuse?). The pattern is divided into 2 size ranges, XS-S-M and L-XL, one range per envelope. I cut a straight L, which is a 16-18 pattern size. The only alterations I made were the length adjustment mentioned above and a square shoulder adjustment. For the length, I just added to the bottom. I did incorporate the little cut-out on the back bottom edge, but I forgot to take a pic of the back on Zillie. I'll take a pic of that when I'm wearing it. I'm not sure when that will be since I don't have anything to wear under it yet. Here it is with the Burda skirt I finished last night. It's just quickly pinned on Zillie since it doesn't fit her. Yay!. For this one, I sewed the panel and sideseams about 1/8\" deeper since my first makes a few months ago are really too loose now. It's snug, but not for long. I also cut the side panels on the bias, but pics of plaid get so wonky it's hard to see. Click the pic to enlarge it and it will be clearer.This is a little better. Now I need to get busy on two wallets I need to send out this week. I'm hoping to get one done tonight while half-watching football."},

Er … ;-)Another Magic Pencil Skirt is still on the short list, but there's a few items ahead of it only because of fabric choice (non-stretch) and sewing for money (I have 2 wallets on order). Backing up a bit, I went to Beall's last night to return the $$ jeans I didn't keep. And, of course, I browsed. And tried on. I really wanted the b/w houndstooth skirt I found, but it was not to be. The 16 fit great in the waist (even a little loose) and length, but was a little too snug across the hips. The 18 fell off me. I could've bought the 16 and waited (or heaven forbid — exercised!), but where's the fun in that? I'm all for instant gratification in my wardrobe choices. It was also not the most wonderfully made, but that's to be expected and only a stitcher would notice these things — even though it was off-grain enough that the checks were going uphill at the bottom edge hem. I pouted a little but I put it back and consoled myself with a pretty ivory/metallic cardigan, a coordinating ivory sweaterknit tank, a purple sweater I'm still on the fence about, and a gray/ivory floral lacy knit tee which I hope matches a gray RTW skirt I've been holding waiting to either sew or buy a coordinate. These purchases were free, of course, since I had just returned the jeans, returned the ruffly cardi to Walmart, and also sent boots back to Zappos. In fact, I think I may even come out ahead. Does anyone else do shopping math like this? ;-)So, while the houndstooth I really wanted was big and contrast-y (and if anyone knows of some fabric somewhere, let me know!), I knew I had a small houndstooth in my recently-acquired pile of fabrics.But since it's not stretchy at all, I opted for the TNT Burda pencil skirt instead of the Magic pattern. I'm also going to make the Vogue/Marci Tilton cascade cardi in the brown ponte knit. This will coordinate with the houndstooth and also exactly match the Magic Pencil skirt made from this fabric before my trip. I haven't actually checked to see that I actually have enough knit left so this plan may be modified. I hope not, because I've been wanting to make this MT cardi since I \"found\" it in an old Threads. I'm in the middle of cutting out the skirt, single layer, and will return to that after I finish this post.Here's another pic from our trip. Tyler and Alex braved Walmart at midnight on Black Friday to buy a BA (Big @$$) TV, which Tyler already has set up in his barracks room and connected to cable and internet and the new PS3 he bought during the week.Speaking (sorta) of technology, I'm happy to report that my Kindle Fire was everything I wanted on our trip. I downloaded some movies onto it for Alex to watch while I drove and it performed flawlessly and the downloads were very quick. I think I can fit 5-6 full-length movies on it at one time. You can switch between on-device and Cloud storage if you're going to be watching more than 6 movies in a sitting. I can guarantee that I will never do that. My butt and brain would fall asleep.I also enabled my Droid phone to be a mobile wi-fi hotspot which was extremely easy and the Fire found it just fine. I was going to blog while away, but it was just too much of a pain to deal with photos. I need to investigate better methods before any future trips. For those who are wondering, with Verizon, the wi-fi option for the phone costs $20 extra per month, but you can enable/disable it per month so you don't have to pay for it when you're not going to be using it.Tyler was also using the wi-fi to Facebook from his laptop.So far, the only \"cons\" with the Fire are (1) e-books are expensive and (2) my library only lets you keep borrowed e-books for 2 weeks and there's a waiting list for most of them. I'm complaining about the 2-week limit only because hard copies can be borrowed for 3 weeks at a time and I think it should match. Otherwise, it's really pretty adequate. I've got about 8 free books and some magazines loaded on it right now and it's not like I'm hurting for reading material. Does anyone know if you've purchased e-books, can you lend them among friends like hard copies?Another option I've found on the Fire is that not only is brightness adjustable, but you can set the \"page\" to be off-white with less-contrast-y text. I think this would work fine for those who don't want to read a screen and maybe it's similar to eInk?? I don't know as I still haven't seen what that looks like, but this setting seems to be very book-like to me. There's also an option for a black page with white text if that's your thing. It isn't mine. ;-)Parting Shot: The Marine sporting his favorite things: (1) white dress cover; (2) Spiderman anything; and (3) his new Cap'n Crunch tat (his nickname is Cap'n from years ago). He thought he was going to surprise/shock me with his new (and first) tattoo when he saw me, but my mother's intuition told me he had already done the deed and I guessed it before he had a chance to unveil. Seeing his face when I guessed out of the blue was priceless. Hahaha. I know that \"kid\" so well. Now that's he gotten the first, I expect a Marine moto or Spidey tat to be added soon. But the Corps mandates that any new tattoo not show while wearing the issued PT (physical training) uniform (short shorts and a tee), so whatever he gets will still be covered unless he's shirtless or shortless."},

Well, not really, but remember how I said things were civil around here? Scratch that. It's been anything but. I think we each got very quickly accustomed to not seeing the other over the long weekend. Well, at least I have my own bedroom now. But the rollercoaster has just plum worn me out this week and I'm going crazy with impatience waiting to find out if this job is permanent so I can move the heck out. (I don't expect to hear anything until January at the earliest.)So, on to happier thoughts …I had a great trip! It was, of course, fun to have my boys together for Turkey Day. But it was also fun to see my uncle (who's just a few years older than me) and his wife and family without STBex (soon-to-be-ex for those who asked, and not soon enough really) who always tries to dominate any conversation (ahem, reel it in Debbie), and also without my mother. She and her better half were on a cruise. It's been a long time (too long) since I got to visit extended family without her. Not that I don't like my mother, but it was just a different visit without her. My sister's husband stayed behind too, so we had lots of good sister time.My uncle lives on about 20 acres outside of Virginia Beach. There's always \"chores\" to be done, like chainsawing fallen trees and then splitting the logs cut from it. We had some productive and enjoyable outside family time while the turkey was in the oven. He has lots of fun \"vehicles\" to make work seem more like play. My sons always enjoy their time here.Alex chainsawingTyler chainsawingAlex and Tyler and tractor #2Alex on tractor #1Making progressMe and my Uncle Jonathan, and, yes, I actually drove that thing a LOT, hauling logs back to the houseMy uncle's houseTyler still chainsawingWhat a brute!The power logsplitter and a fresh stackThat, and eating, was pretty much all we did in Virginia. And drink wine and play cards. I think we were up 'til 3AM each night. No wonder I needed a week to recover.On our ride through NC to bring Tyler back to base, we saw this guy. Santa traded the reindeer for a hog (OK, not a Harley but it sounded good).Me and the Marine. Goofy, squinty pic of me, but I like it because I actually don't look as big as a house anymore when I stand next to Tyler. Thirty more pounds and I might even fit into his jeans. ;-) It was a great trip for my ego since EVERYONE complimented me on the weight loss. I wore ALL of my new jeans and only my brown boots all weekend. I didn't even need other shoes. Those suckers are so comfortable! Too bad Alex cut off our feet in this pic. Both of my boys. Alex isn't really mad; they were facing the morning sun.And that's the trip. I'll be getting back into the sewing room this weekend. I'm not sure what's on the agenda yet, but I'm pretty sure another Magic Pencil Skirt is near the top of the list."},

Alex says the muffins are good, which is saying something for him since they are loaded with carrots, apples, and raisin bran cereal. I won't be having any since they are a carb nightmare, but I'm sure they'll be a hit for breakfast either Turkey Day or the morning after, or both. My sister is making and bringing quiche - more my speed. Since I did actually bake and prepare stuff from scratch, I will own up to buying the pumpkin pies. I mean, it's not like it's that different than buying a can of pumpkin pie mix and pouring it into premade crusts, right? The car is mostly packed, and I'm off to bed. I'm hoping to leave no later than 6 AM, especially since we're due to hit bad weather most of the way. But at least the rest of the forecast is good.Happy Thanksgiving one and all, or, Happy November 24th. Take your pick. :-)I'll \"see\" you next week. Oh, and no \"Turkey Pants\" for me this year. Yay!! (If you're not sure what I\"m referencing, do a search on my blog and you'll see. I'm out of time to create the link.)"},
{"title": "This and That", "date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "text": "Just a bunch of random stuff. Here we go.The shoes/boots arrived today.Both boots fit great, are cute, and very comfortable. The shoe/booties (shoeties?) at the top are so-so, which means they are going back, even though they are cute too. Life is too short for uncomfortable shoes. I'm taking the brown boots at the bottom with me. I'll decide on the others when I get back. Those \"suede\" boots aren't really good for stomping around fields anyway. I really shouldn't keep both, but …I'm taking my new coat but it's probably not going to be cold enough for it. But Murphy's Law means if I leave it, I'll freeze my butt off. I'll look good sweating. ;-) I washed/dried all my new jeans, plus my old ones. I have no idea how this can possibly be true but all of the new jeans have the same exact inseam measurement (I measured twice), even though some are definitely longer on my legs than others. I even wore each pair for about 1/2 hour each to loosen them up. Then I threw my hands up in disgust and decided NOT to hem any of them. I'll wash them again and decide. The longest pair is just barely off the ground with the boots so it's not too bad, and those are the \"nice\" ones which I'll only wear inside on Turkey Day anyway. And if I drag the bottoms ragged on the others, I can always hem them later. Good thinking, 99. Thanks Max.The heat wand is heating up and I'm going to bling the back pockets of one pair of the new jeans. They're rather plain now because the topstitching is navy blue. WTF. But I'm not putting on sparklies, just some metallic nailheads. They need something.I should be baking pies and muffins and making my sweet potato casserole (no marshmallows) but (1) I'm putting that off until tomorrow night and (2) don't tell anyone, but I bought pre-made pumpkin pies at the grocery store tonight. So now all I have to make is two pecan pies and the muffins. And figure out how to get the label off the covers of the pumpkin pies. lolI am mostly packed, though, so at least that's something I won't have to do from scratch tomorrow night. But we'll still need to load up the car.I have training tomorrow at the other office. I'd better refresh myself with how to get there. But I get to arrive one hour later than my usual, so I'll probably hit Mapquest in the morning. Note to self: Leave time to get gas.I finished reading Water for Elephants at lunch today. It was a good story but also a little disappointing at the climax when all hell broke loose much too quickly. But I still don't know the significance of \"water for elephants.\" Elephant, yes. Water, no. Anyone? What did I miss? I didn't see the movie either.I started reading Velocity, e-booked from the library. It's so nice to finish one book and have the other right there in the same contraption ready to go.I'm looking forward to a big family visit without STBex. It will be SO NICE to get a word in edgewise with my own family. Ahem. He can talk to the dogs and his rental car. Ooo, so mean tonight. ;-) It will probably be weird for my sons, though, as this will be their first Thanksgiving without him around. We'll keep them busy with the tractors, chainsaws, firepit, and beer. (Not all at once.)I'll post one more time before I go, but probably not while I'm gone. Hmmm. Can I blog from the Fire? While driving? JUST KIDDING!  Off to decorate some pockets.I need a vacation. ;-) I've been very busy this weekend but in a selfish good way. I cut and sewed the brown ponte knit skirt tonight, using Pamela's Patterns Magic Pencil Skirt. The magic is that there's just one pattern piece, no zipper, no waistband, and you end up with a flattering and comfortable skirt. It's pegged just the right amount and while it has an elastic waist, you can't tell by looking when you're wearing it.$10 is maybe a lot to pay for one pattern piece, but the bottom line is that it works. I can see making many of these, which brings the pattern cost per skirt a lot lower, plus it uses less than a yard of 54-60\" fabric so it's economic that way. I plan to make the higher waist version too. For this one, the lower waist view, I cut the Medium per my measurements. The only adjustment I made was adding 3/4\" to the length. You can definitely make this skirt start to finish in an hour, especially if you don't have to change thread in all 3 machines like I did. I'm going to write up a proper review on PR (probably after returning from my trip) because this is a sleeper pattern and it needs some enabling. ;-) Before starting the skirt, I (re)made my Jalie top from last year smaller. And by smaller, I mean I took out 8\" of width, 4\" at each sideseam, tapering up through the armhole and down most of the sleeve. I took a good 2-3\" out of the bicep area, tapering to nothing by the wrist. I also removed 5\" of length. I can't believe the old stomach and boobs took up all that space — wow! Well, I can, but seeing it that way was eye-opening. This is the before shot from the earlier post:And this is the remake:Lastly, I finally cleared off my pile of costume jewelry off the top of my dresser and hid it all in the top drawer, except for my little dish of earrings still on top. I still have the big pile of too-big clothes (which keeps getting bigger) and I'll deal with that when I get back too. And I should probably dust my dresser now. That's my Fire in its new brown leather case in the bottom right of the pic. I also stuck on a screen protector, so it's officially good to go for tossing into my purse. Teri - you asked about battery time with the wi-fi. I don't have a good answer because so far I've never been too far from a charging source so I've not let it get low. I'll try to pay attention on our drive, when we'll be mobile hot-spotting it with Alex's phone.Another good use for the Fire? Killing time in the Walmart customer service line while waiting to return the purchases I didn't show you."},
{"title": "Sewing and Shopping Pics (Lots of pics!)", "date": "Sunday, November 20, 2011", "text": "I'm making up for the dearth of photos in my last few posts, so grab a cuppa and sit back. ;-)Here's my finished Ottobre morphed drape top, with morphed elastic-cuff sleeves from last winter. I added an interfaced waist tie for some waist definition in that sea of print. Also, the new jeans. I'm wearing 3-1/2 heels and they are STILL way too long, so hemming is definitely needed. But other than that, I love them. I still can't believe I picked them up on a whim without trying on, and that they cost only $19.99. Can you believe how perfectly this necklace matches? I bought it long before I bought the fabric. I won't wear it when the top is styled casually, but to the office with my black skirt, it will be perfect. My new coat. I look like I'm in the boxing ring. Modeling and ending up with usable photos is harder than it looks. Erica B makes it look so easy, but I know better. Yes, I'm still in Florida where it's 85 degrees today. If not for the A/C, I would be sweating buckets.Can you imagine how soft this coat is? The faux suede on the outside is just as soft as the \"fur\" inside. It looks to be a well-made coat with some nice subtle details, such as these bound buttonholes.One of its best features, though, is this. (In case you can't read my overexposed photo, that tag says \"WASHABLE\".)Jeans #2 with a zip-up turquoise cardi and cheap tee. Turquoise cardi #2. I'm undecided whether to keep either or both. Do those ruffles overwhelm? The sweater is very soft and was only about $16 so I may keep it based on price alone. The turquoise zip one above can double as a \"Florida coat\" since it's heavier, and it has pockets (love!). It was only $20 so still not a big expense to worry about.Jeans #3. These have some pre-fab fading, but it's not too obnoxious. The tee is a $5 clearance item. How could I not buy a $5 brown tee? It will be good for layering or even just sleeping in.I'm not as thrilled with the rear view of these jeans, but I've decided it's because the pockets are spaced too far apart. RTW manufacturers need to key in to the fact that we booty-endowed enjoy a better illusion when the pockets are closer toward the center back seam. I'm going to investigate the possibility of moving these pockets, but I need to check if I have matching thread first. This is a Jalie waterfall top from last year, one of the tops I made for the trip to Tyler's boot camp graduation. It's now way too big and too long. I'm going to cut off the hem and then take in the sideseams. I like the print and colors and it's practically new so I will spend some time on the remake. Most of my too-big clothes aren't worth a remake.And with that, I think I'm actually set for my trip, after the jeans are washed and hemmed. So, my next project (after making the Jalie top smaller) will be something office-related. I've got a knit skirt pattern from Pamela's Pattern and some dark brown ponte that I'd like to match up.* * * * * Finally, a little comment about some of your comments re my marriage situation. First, if I didn't expect you comment, I wouldn't share so don't think you can't express an opinion. Just know that I haven't shared all the details leading up to my decision to divorce, and it wasn't an easy decision. And, keep in mind that if you comment, I might comment back ;-) and it's likely I won't take your advice — I'm stubborn that way. I'm not interested in counseling because I don't really care for who he has become. No amount of counseling will change his basic personality (nor mine). It's cliché to say we've grown apart, but that's pretty much what it is. I see things a lot differently at 49 than I did at 21. If we had met today, I wouldn't like him very much. There's no sense staying with someone you just don't like. Life is much too short. Yes, we had some good times in the beginning and if nothing else, I will be eternally thankful for the gift that are my two sons from this marriage. But that chapter of my life (young wife, young mother) is over and I know it's time for us both to move on. In fact, it's way past time. We're mostly still quite civil, which is why we can still live together until we finally go our separate ways. In this economy, I know that's actually a blessing. And before you ask, my sons are OK with it and they like the happier me. STBex's \"relationship\" with them now that they are adults is a major part of what led to this decision. Read between the lines. As I said, I didn't come to this decision easily.1. I think we have better fabric choices than what's available in mid-priced RTW, judging by my shopping trip yesterday. The only thing I can't make is knitted sweaters and that's only because I can't knit.2. Every day is a good day when you see the weinermobile driving next to you.I'll be back later with pics. I've completed one top and am now deciding what's next."},
{"title": "More Later, But …", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "… I just had to say I FOUND JEANS.OK, twist my arm and I'll expand a little.Today I did exactly what I had told myself (and you too, I think) I was not going to do. I shopped. And shopped.But I had a good excuse. Honest! Alex really needed a coat. I did too, but I at least had a Plan B (my old, old 1980s coat which is now back in style LOL). So, off to Burlington Coat Factory we went. He tried on about 40 coats and finally settled on one that I'll need to hem the sleeves shorter for. I can deal with that — it's just going to be a simple turn and stitch on the free arm, no biggie. I tried on about 10 and settled on a faux suede (outside) and faux fur (inside) 3/4 length brown coat. I love it! It's so soft. I'll probably only get to wear it about 2 times a year here in Florida, but I think it will age well. At least as good as my 1980s coat which still hangs in the front hall closet. While Alex was shopping and trying on, I wandered around and picked up a couple of sweaters and a pair of jeans. Looking at them, I was guessing they would technically fit. I didn't try them on in the store but once I got home, I was in LOVE. And they were only $19.99! Can you believe it? They are much, much too long, though, so I'm going to send them through the wash and then hem them after these arrive on Monday:Yep, more Zappos love. I won't keep all 3 pairs but I'm hoping at least one pair is a keeper. Maybe two, because the pair at the top was only $36 on sale.And if THAT wasn't enough, I just got back from grocery shopping at Walmart and I tried on jeans there too. I came home with 3 maybes. And a few tops too. Oops. They are my backup in case my sewing tonight and tomorrow isn't as prolific as I'm hoping.I've lost about 6 more lbs in the last couple of weeks and it's really amazing to me how much of a difference that makes. Six pounds 75 lbs ago wouldn't have even been noticeable. Now it is. I'm starting to go through my second round of clothes getting too big. Yes, it's a nice problem to have but it's hard to keep up. lol I'll update tomorrow with some photos of my loot. And hopefully at least one made-by-me top."},

I've cut out a long-sleeved draped neck top from the pattern morph of my TNT Ottobre tee from the print I showed you the other day.The Fire makes a good pattern weight. ;-)I'll sew this up tomorrow night for FSNI and maybe I'll get something else done too. I'm full of ME mojo!But I'm actually not too worried about quantity right now. It will be a very casual Thanksgiving and if I have to wear the same 2 pairs of jeans the entire time, I'll survive.The hard part for sewing output will be keeping myself off my new Kindle Fire. I just adore this little gizmo. Between it and my phone, they do everything computer-wise I want to do while I'm away from my desktop — which, let's face it, is mostly just playing. ;-) I'm not going to do a full review of the Fire because there are lots of them around. This one (Yes, it's that good) covers all the main points and I think it's very accurate. But I'll share my thoughts over the next few days/weeks as they come to me and I'll try to answer questions left in the comments.I connected to my county library last night and downloaded 4 books, for FREE. Love the library. Love NOT GOING to the library to get books. It was so easy, as Amazon and my library talk to each other and all I have to do is check out the books and then go to my Amazon account and send them to my Fire. The whole process took about 5 minutes, after I had decided on the books I wanted.But have I even cracked any of them yet? Nope. I'm currently reading Water for Elephants, downloaded for free from Amazon's Lending Library (well, \"free\" if you sub to Amazon Prime, which I did because it's well worth it). I see a little label on it with 32%, so it looks like I'm just about one-third done with it already. This is my actual Fire, complete with smudgy fingerprints. These are all Droid X cellphone pics, BTW. Not bad. I emailed them to my desktop from my phone. Hah. I'm such a dork.If I have any complaint at all, it's that my cover/case has still not shipped. Apparently, the green is on backorder. So I ordered a brown one tonight. I can live without green but I WANT a cover for this thing before my trip. As you can see, it's set up like a bookshelf. You scroll through side to side and up/down and the media flips like on a carousel. It's a pretty intuitive interface, although there is a good manual pre-loaded too. I'm a geek. I like to read manuals and always do that when I get a new anything. I don't know if I'd buy one as a gift for the technology-challenged for just reading. A lesser Kindle should be fine for that and lots cheaper. I can't compare e-ink to the Fire's display because I've never seen or used e-ink. I'm so used to reading on a screen that that aspect doesn't bother me a bit.I love being able to eat my lunch at work and read at the same time without needing to prop up a book or rearrange when I need to turn pages. I look like quite the dweeb reading on my Fire with earbuds to my phone in my ears. Very convenient that my office PC has 2 front USB ports so I'm always charging. I love that the screen is big enough to not feel puny to my old eyes, like my phone. Video is gorgeous on it, and streaming is very smooth. Almost better than cable. The color/resolution is beautiful. Better than my phone, I think, a Droid X, and equal to Alex's Droid Razr. I've downloaded some magazines onto it, but I haven't really explored what's available yet. It definitely would be great if Threads would go the e-book route. How do we start a write-in campaign. I've looked at Lucky, Self, and Glamour because those were free. Lucky isn't very interactive but it's just as good as reading the paper version to me, without the hassle of deciding what to do with old issues. The other two have interactive extras, which is both cool and annoying because I feel like I'm losing my place. But that's just the newness talking. I'll figure out my own process. I also wonder if it's my imagination but the advertisement pages seem to need an extra swipe to turn the page, like they are programmed to be looked at longer. It wouldn't surprise me if this is true, but I honestly like ads in magazines so it doesn't bug me. Susan asked if there's a spreadsheet app. There is, an actual spreadsheet, but I haven't used it yet. I don't see me loading up either my phone or my Fire with a pattern or fabric catalog. Too much work to do that. ;-) But maybe I can export my pattern catalog from ListPro (Palm days) to something to work on one of them. But I'm not in a rush to do that yet. There are also other cataloging apps that I haven't explored yet.Speaking of Palm, I *love* that there's a Graffiti app for my phone so I can \"write\" with my finger in Palm-ese. I'm much faster with that than texting on a tiny keyboard. I can type 90+ wpm on the real keyboard and about 8 on the phone. Hah. I hope Kindle gets that app too, although its keyboard is big enough that I don't feel clumsy on it.And with that, I'm going to go watch the end of the football game and browse through an e-magazine, but I couldn't let this comment from Bev pass:\"Are you sure you're getting a divorce?  Any time there are issues, you guys are there for each other.\"Yes, I am definitely getting a divorce. And, no, we are not there for each other. Only one of us is there for anyone and she's tired of living on this one-way street. ;-)I was able to squeeze about an hour of sewing in last night and the cammie purses are done. I didn't have as much time as I had planned because STBex had a slight traffic mishap on his way home last night. His truck is totalled. Completely not his fault and the other driver was cited for failing to yield to oncoming traffic (she tried to turn across 4 lanes of rush-hour traffic causing STBex to T-bone her vehicle). She had her 3 small children in her minivan, and thankfully no one was injured. But WHAT was she thinking?Meeting him at the site, standing around waiting for the police to finish the reports and then for the tow truck to remove the demolished truck and van ate into my free time last night. So that's 2 of our vehicles wrecked in 2 months. I sure hope mine isn't next. Hopefully, tonight I can start something for ME because I really, really do not want to go shopping this weekend."},

It's everything I expected and more. I love it! It is SO WORTH the $199 price tag (plus $79/year for Amazon Prime to get full benefits), esp. compared to a iPad. It's not an iPad, but I'm not really convinced I want a full tablet. I mean I have a computer (or three) and any real computing I'd do on real keyboard. But for fun, entertainment/reading, this thing is going to rock. It was super easy to set up, found my home wi-fi immediately, and there's a good manual on-board if you want it or your fingertips to play around if you don't. On Saturday, I finally entered the smartphone game for my own phone when I bought Alex a new Razr and took his Droid X. I had thought I was going to get the new phone for once, but the differences between the Razr and the Droid X were just not enough to sway me, plus knowing my Fire was on its way, so I caved and let him take the Razr. Yes, 4G is noticeably faster than 3G, but I'm not going to be streaming anything on the phone and, frankly, the screen is just too dang small for these no-more-birthdays eyes. The Fire streams beautifully from the Cloud with no blips at all. The screen and overall size are perfect. Phone for calls, texts, mobile pics, and quickie apps on the go. Fire for real reading and the fun stuff during lunch or while watching TV. Ask questions in the comments if you're thinking of getting one and there's something you're curious about and I'll answer them in the next day or so. But if you're mostly over the fence, just do it. You'll love it. :-)"},

I've decided I either need to discontinue this purse or double the price. ;-) While I love my pattern and the final product, it's just too fiddly construction-wise to be enjoyable as a sewing-for-others project. Plus, I don't have real instructions written down so I have to reacquaint myself with the order of things each time I make it, which inevitably involves frog-stitching more than one time. That's why I made my purse first, so the screw-ups would be on it. The second purse has gone a lot faster.Once the purse is done, I also have to make one OOO RAH wallet for this same customer. That won't take but an evening or two, which I am DETERMINED to knock out tomorrow night and Tuesday, so that I can sew for ME, ME, ME with every spare moment between then and my trip. I need long-sleeved tops and I want to make one cascade sweater from an Ottobre tee morph, plus the jeans. I may put the jeans last in the queue because I can survive on what I have. We're not going to be doing anything fancy, and I need warmer tops more. For now, it's off to bed. Tomorrow, the \"real\" worker is back and Friday I moved to another desk. I'm feeling kind of sad and nervous. I'll be glad when tomorrow is over and I'm into my new routine at the office. I'm sure things will be fine, but the unknown is … well, unknown.Just a few more days until my Fire gets here. In the meantime, I've moved to a smart phone and wasted an entire Saturday afternoon playing with that. Oops. ;-)"},

Really puts a crimp in dinner. Above is what I wore to work today. Outfit from Walmart, you've seen it before. One day, I will buy better clothes but right now they are mostly disposable so Walmart it is. These shoes passed the comfort test today too, but one has an annoying squeak. As long as it's not completely quiet, you don't hear it. But if it is, you hear me coming from a distance. Oh well, they look cute. This pic is for Belinda. Remember this top? (Please ignore the numb-mouth crooked smile. It's hard to smile when you can't feel your face.)And finally, the other fabrics calling my name that were just pre-washed so they're waiting for me. Top to bottom: dark brown ponte knit, taupe pinstripe blouse fabric, black skirt fabric I bought before I saw the Walmart skirt above so it might be a muslin since it was cheap, swirly sweater knit that's on my short list, olive green (it really is green) double-knit, poly silky jacquard print for a blouse, tan moleskin also on the short list. Now I have to work on the cammie purses so I can actually sew those fabrics above into something to wear."},

It's going to be made into something very soon. Maybe even before I make jeans. That's it for tonight. I blew off grocery shopping over the weekend and so had to sacrifice a weekday night (tonight) instead. After dinner out and then groceries, there's not any time left for the sewing room. I'm on the homestretch with the purses so I should be able to gear up for garment sewing soon. My garment-sewing mojo is in full swing, of course, because I'm working on purses.

She was 54 — maybe 55? —  and COD is still unknown right now. We weren't close at all, but since this is my STBex's brother's wife, STBex will be flying up to Virginia soon for an extended stay to support his brother, and I'll be on my own here. It will be good practice, right? (Was that too unsensitive?) Her daughter (my niece and her only child) is flying home from Germany, where she and her Army husband are stationed. My heart goes out to my niece because the last words she had with her mom were a big argument, which in hindsight was probably really about nothing.

But NEXT week, I'm sewing jeans for me. I really wanted to buy some jeans for my Thanksgiving trip, but I've tried on about 20 pairs now in the last week and none are it. I'm losing hope. And time. Most of the RTWs fit everywhere except at the back waist, where they gape. I don't have a small waist in relation to my butt/hips, so who on earth DO these jeans fit?I decided that if I had to rip out a waistband and topstitching down the center back and then re-do it to take in RTW jeans, I might as well make my own from the start and be reasonably assured they will fit when I'm done.  It's also hard to find jeans without the un-strategic (in my case) fading and whiskers and I've got solid blue denim waiting in the stash closet.I'm using the pattern I traced off from RTW and tweaked 7 years ago to make these:I'm going to go with the bootcut leg like the burgundy pair, which was a change I made to the original \"pattern\" after making the green jeans. Those green jeans, if you remember, are the jeans I tried on at the start of my weight loss journey, which I couldn't even zip up. Now they are getting too big. Yay! Both of these jeans are straight out of the dryer so they haven't seen a full day of stretching yet. I can really only get one day of wear from either (but I'll probably still take them both on the trip).I already dug through my pattern drawer to see if I could find the pattern and was relieved to know that I kept it. There's lots of notes on the pieces and in my reviews so I think I'm ready to just cut and sew. But for now, it's back to the purses and just dreaming of new jeans.On a little bit of a sad note, I called to make a dentist appointment and found out that my wonderful dentist (and the person who really inspired me to change my eating habits) moved out of the area. Selfishly, I'm sad because I really wanted him to see how far I've come. Hopefully his former partners will be as good as he is. If not, I may be driving to Ocala (an hour north) for my next dental needs.  Parting Shot:  Tyler's new medals. On the left, National Defense. On the right, War on Terrorism Service. They will make nice additions to his dress blues, which he'll be donning next Friday night for the Marine Corps Ball.Right now, he's on a plane flying back to Cherry Point NC from Yuma AZ. After 6+ weeks away from \"home,\" he's ready to be back in his own barracks."},

(Answer: Yes!)My bow, if you could see it better, looks perfect only because it's not actually tied. I used a hair elastic to cinch the ties together in a faux-bow. Hah! FoBo, cute. You have to get REALLY close to me to see the hair elastic, so I'm going with it. Far easier than wrestling with tying a stupid bow a million times to get the ends even. Rear view. Note to self: Don't stand like this in real life cuz you're pulling the skirt up. Waist, it's nice to see you again. ;-)These are my latest new shoes. I suck at shoe-in-the-mirror shots. I need more light in the bedroom.Here's the Zappos pic, so you can actually see the shoes.I really, REALLY wanted these first. Until I remembered I don't actually wear silver. Of course, last week I didn't wear black either. ;-)I need to be sewing the cammie purses, but instead tonight I'm going to be re-sewing a couple of pleats on some skirts so I can wear one tomorrow. They haven't ripped, but I can tell I need to secure the stress area better before the stitches do work loose. Tomorrow when I get home from the office, I'll work on the purses for a couple of hours.I want to have them done by the end of the weekend so I can cross that project off my list and shop for a coat.In work related news, I was invited to a sit-down meeting this afternoon with my boss and my boss' boss, where they proceeded to tell me that the person I'm filling in for will be returning from her maternity leave in 2 weeks (which is about 6 weeks earlier than expected), because she's out of paid time off and needs her paychecks. Don't panic. Without missing a beat, they also told me that they will definitely be keeping me on in my current status until at least mid-January while working hard to get me in the budget for a permanent position because THEY LOVE ME. Yay, they like me — they really, really like me. ;-) (The feeling is mutual.) So while I have a bit of time before I know anything for sure, all signs are pointing in the right direction and I'm thrilled! 2012 is looking to be a goodie, even if I don't recognize THAT birthday."},
{"title": "Jalie 2921: Happy Halloween", "date": "Monday, October 31, 2011", "text": "Amazingly, I got *everything* on my To Do list for this weekend done, and I had time to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner and catch the end of the Steelers game. Boy, I sure would like to have their TV set-up in my house every Sunday during football season.Crappy cell phone picHere's my finished Jalie 2921 and a try-on preview of my outfit for tomorrow. I read some of the 50+ reviews for this top after I had it cut out. A few of them mentioned it running tight. One review mentioned 4 inches of negative ease. Uh oh. I had gone by my measurements and cut a straight CC (16). As it turned out, I'm glad I read the reviews after cutting or I would've been tempted to cut a bigger size. There definitely is NOT 4 inches of negative ease. I measured waist and hips of the finished top and at the most I came up with 1 inch of negative ease. The top fits great.I said I cut a straight CC, but that's sort of a fib. I did scoop out the back neck 2 sizes down because Jalie always runs high in the back neck on me. I'm glad I did this, because this pattern was no exception. The back neck as modified fits me perfectly, and the tie/collar doesn't gape in the back at all like some of the reviewers mentioned. I also scooped out the front armhole down a size because I could just tell by looking at the pattern that I would need to. I was right. After all these years making tons of knit tops, I'm pretty familiar with my preferred armhole shape, no matter what size I am. Other than those two adjustments which I made while tracing, I made no other adjustments. No FBA, no bicep increase, no blending to a bigger size at hip level, nada. Yippee! I love cut and sew patterns. However, when I make this again, and I will, the only other change I will make will be to narrow the shoulders 3/8\". They are OK on this first make, but they will be perfect when I narrow them. This was one of the funnest tops I've made in a long time. It's so FAST to put together and it's so cool how the neckline/tie is done. It's the burrito method and it's brilliant for a tie neck. Plus, once you have it all sewn into the burrito, it's like opening a Christmas present turning it right-side out. I loved that!While I was in the \"black mood\" buying tights at Walmart, I picked up this top too.Very out of my usual color palette, but I like it. I might have to rethink my self-imposed ban on black. I put a chain belt on and I liked it even better (the top has some metallic threads), but my camera batteries died at that exact moment so I don't have a pic. The top has a cowl neck, which you can't really see here (and it's a 12/14 - woot!). This top will also work for my upcoming trip to Virginia where it's currently Brrrrrrr.After recharging the batteries, I tried on the Bealls jeans I mentioned a couple of posts ago so I could see them from the camera's eye. I'm still on the fence with them. The fading/distressing down the thighs isn't the best look for someone with my thighs even though EVERYONE wears jeans like this. But the overall shape is pretty good. They give me hope for the Jalie jeans one day.This is what my bed looked like 20 minutes ago, during the mad closet shuffle. I cleared out SO MUCH stuff that I actually have lots of empty space on the closet rods and a ton of leftover empty hangers. The donate piles are growing. I also have a full big box that's not in the pic. One of next weekend's tasks will be getting this stuff out of the house and to a good new \"home.\" While I'm not sad to be shrinking out my clothes, I'm a little sad over some of the fabric \"lost.\" I wish I had some of it back to start over. I know, I know, it's not like I don't have a TON of fabric waiting, so I'm not too broken up.Next weekend, I will sort through my dresser drawers and make space for all the crap on top of my dresser."},

Bet that's not the model you were expecting. lol  Alex came up to the sewing room to say hi after work and then started acting goofy and tried on the sweater I had just finished. So of course I \"borrowed\" his cell phone and quickly snapped a pic for evidence. I don't realize how much bigger he is than me until I see things like where my sweater hits on him. In my mind, he's still my \"little boy,\" when in reality he's anything but little. I grabbed the now-french-fry-smelling sweater back and he took a pic of me, but I didn't do a mirror check first and it's hanging horribly, plus it's a little stretched out from the previous model. I'll get a better pic over the weekend. With the batwing sleeves, it's not a favorite design in terms of flattering, but it's so soft and snuggly that I'm sure it will get a LOT of wear when the temps are low.Now that it's off the sewing table, I can spread out for my sister's embroidery project, which is up next while the baseball game is on.And the jeans I'm wearing? I wore them to work today. Yep. Jeans for me on Jeans Friday for the first time. It felt weird and comfortable at the same time, although my office wardrobe is not uncomfortable at all and I've rather been enjoying being dressed up every day.

{"title": "Happy Hour", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2011", "text": "The job keeps getting better. Or, I should say the perks. Today at 4:30 PM started the Halloween Happy Hour (really 2 hours if you wanted to stay until the 6:30 PM end time), complete with adult beverages, smoking cauldrons, homemade goodies to look like eyeballs, skeleton goblets, spooky music, mood lighting, spiders and bones decorations, and more. The spread was quite impressive! I so badly wanted to take pics but that would've been too weird, I think. Yes, even weirder than the decorations. I stopped by for a few minutes but passed up everything except a deviled eyeball, I mean, egg. I didn't think drinking and driving home in rush hour mixed too well. I could imagine me flying off the Crosstown (elevated highway) without much help. ;-) I wore 100% RTW today. I am really getting my $18's worth out of this dress.The colors are just so me. I have at least 3 top layers that match it, so I hope I'm appearing to be wearing different outfits when I mix it up every week. Probably not fooling anyone, but it's nice to pretend.I'm also getting really good at sucking in my stomach. Heh. I'm about to explode here. ;-) But at least it actually IS sucking in now. The actual weight loss isn't as dramatic lately (probably around 7 lbs. in the last few weeks), but things are definitely shifting because I'm fitting into smaller things in the stores, in patterns, and in my closet, and my measurements are smaller. I've had a few comments asking what I'm doing to lose the weight. Well, one thing I'm NOT doing which I should be is to exercise. I need to move my eliptical (and probably myself, my TV and DVDs too) into the empty bedroom instead of waiting to move house, since at this point, who knows when that's happening and my preferred time to excercise would be early morning and alone, which I am NOT at the moment. We're still sharing the bedroom but with two dogs between us, it's hardly a marital bed. And *someone* is a late sleeper. Pffft. ;-)But what I am doing is actively avoiding carbs, eating around 40-60g per day with nearly all of those coming from produce. I do not eat any processed foods, except 3-4 times a week, a whole-grain, high-fiber bread \"round\" with one meal. I don't eat potatoes, pasta, rice, sweets/sugars, or many fruits. I do eat lots of protein (fish, chicken, eggs, nuts, seeds, and some meats but they're harder for me to chew), reasonable amounts  of fat and whole dairy, and lots of veggies and some berries. I don't count calories or measure anything. It's basically Atkins (not the induction phase), but I'm not following Atkins per se. I started eating this way out of necessity after my dental work, and the \"side effects\" were obvious so I researched low-carb eating both on the internet and in books from the library and came up with a routine and foods within that plan that work for me.I bring a salad to work for lunch nearly every day but sometimes I bring a low-carb wrap filled with tuna or chicken salad, with guacamole on the side, and a sugar-free Jello or Atkins bar (OK, those are processed but not quite in the same group as what I call crap). I'm never hungry. The protein, fat, and fiber take care of that. I have hardly any interest in food except to fuel myself. It's not a comfort anymore. Looking in the mirror and wearing smaller clothes is my comfort. I've actually caught myself forgetting to eat. Which is a miracle compared to what I was doing a year ago, drowning my sorrows in sweets.I don't miss anything about my former eating habits so I really don't think I'll be going back to it. I just feel too good with what I'm doing to change it. I only wish I had found this 15 years ago. When I was at my sister's (an RN)  back in July, she took my blood pressure at my request. It was only slightly more elevated than super-fit-and-healthy Tyler's, and well within the normal/healthy range. I'm guessing it's even better now. High blood pressure runs in my family so to be \"normal\" is doubly great. At some point, I plan to have a complete blood panel done as well as a physical. It would've been nice to know my starting point, but I'll be happy with healthy numbers now and no comparison. And maybe I will actually acknowledge my next birthday. ;-)"},

I was out Monday night and stopped into Beall's, where I found a zillion things I liked. I tried on a bunch but narrowed down my purchases to one print and beaded shell in brown/purple tones, one pumpkin-ish cardigan, and one pair of jeans. The jeans will probably go back because I think they're just a little too low-rise for me to like. But I wanted to look at the finishing touches for more than 15 minutes, for when I do eventually sew my own jeans again. Plus, they are a regular size 16 so I wanted to bask in that for a few days too. Heh heh. I've already worn the shell (no pics, sorry) and have plans to sew a Jalie top to wear with the cardi — I forget the pattern number, but it's the tie-front top.  Last night was a total wash. I laid down to watch TV at 8 PM and woke up at 2 AM, still wearing my (old) jeans. Oops. I changed into a nightgown, brushed my teeth, and then went back to sleep until 6 AM this morning. I'm very well-rested. ;-) But not much in the mood to sew tonight so there won't be anything to show tomorrow either. This is just a boring, photo-less post tonight and it may be tomorrow too. This weekend is when I have to kick it into high gear. This morning, I had a cammie purse and wallet order come through my email. And yesterday a box arrived from my sister (with a check — yay sis!) with a bunch of shirts for more embroidery for the towing business design. I can do that and watch TV at the same time, so maybe I'll set up for embroidery tomorrow night. I hope I'm motivated because it would be nice to knock all of those out before the weekend. I will need to find something for a coat, though. I've decided I'm going to Virginia for Thanksgiving, leaving the Wednesday before, with stop in NC to pick up Tyler. Nothing fancy, since it will be jeans all weekend long. But something that fits, and flatters. I haven't bought a real coat in over 20 years. My old coat is so old it's in, so that will be my Plan B. But we do have a Burlington Coat Factory in town and that's my Plan A. Hopefully, I can squeeze in a trip there in the next week. Geez, I 'm so busy lately. This working stuff really cuts into my free time. :-)"},

By the end of the day, the skirt had stretched and bagged out somewhat and is full of sitting wrinkles. Oh well, I still like it. The \"ruby slippers\" passed the test and were pleasant to wear all day. I loved looking down and seeing them. Funny how they kind of look like flats in this pic, even though they have 3-1/2\" heels.There won't be any sewing tonight, as I'm out the door in a few minutes to run some errands and then I plan on vegging and hitting the pillows earlier than 1 AM. I wish I had something more profound to share, but this is all I've got. Oh, I did find out today that I'm included in an all-day training session at the \"mother ship\" (the firm's main location on the other side of Tampa) on November 22nd. That's a good sign. Right??

{"title": "Moving Along", "date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "text": "The McCall's skirt is still in limbo. I don't love it today. I might love it next week. I'll revisit it then. I spent far too much time this morning fiddling with it, thinking I could just quickly fix it and move on. I ripped out the waist facing and lining and sewed on a petersham waist facing. The petersham works fine. I still need to handstitch it down next to the zipper and tack it in a few strategic spots. But, I'm just not highly motivated since the skirt doesn't fit as well as I want. It's not exactly too tight. It's more like its curves are not in the same place as mine. Until I figure out what to do about THAT skirt, I've decided I can wear the HP blouse with this cocoa brown skirt. One of bonuses of dressing in pretty much the same colors all the time is that everything usually mixes/matches to some degree. After deciding to just stop messing with that skirt, I cut out another of my TNT Burda skirts. This pattern fits me so well that I think I will morph the McCall's back style/pieces onto it and try that. At some point. But in the meantime, I have a new purple twill skirt. You can't see it, but I topstitched the front seams in a brownish/taupe color. I also topstitched the back darts, which you can see below, and I handsewed in a hook and eye at the top of the zipper. OMG, I think I saw pigs flying by the sewing room window. ;-)The twinset is from Target a few weeks ago. I will be quite colorful when I wear this outfit with my new red shoes, probably tomorrow.I lined it, and did not change my serger thread from the skirt which shall not be mentioned again for at least a week. I don't have purple anyway, so it was just a matter of how much whatever thread I used wouldn't match. I went for the whole enchilada, which turned out to be handy for the next project below. After finishing the Burda skirt, I started on this Simplicity 1945 cascade cardigan. It's not finished yet, but almost, and there are serger tails hanging off everywhere. It has batwing sleeves, which I think look better on me than on Zillie because, well, I actually have arms. It was hang-around-in-your-too-big-clothes-day for me today so I'm not up for modeling. It's a very soft sweater knit and I really like it, but it will have to be worn over something silky since it's very clingy. I like this cardigan better than the eShrug, but I still have ideas for another that I will morph from my (previously) TNT Ottobre tee. I think it will look better on me with real sleeves. That will be one of my next projects, since I need tops and layers more than skirts now (but I still have some skirts in the queue too!).So, while yesterday was mostly unproductive, today I managed to get a skirt and 9/10 of a cardigan done and I feel good. I have two new outfits to wear!"},
{"title": "Theme of the Day? Waste of Time!", "date": "Saturday, October 22, 2011", "text": "Today started out well enough. I was out of bed around 8:15, rip-roaring ready to start the day. Tired of messing with my skirt, I wanted to go shopping. I had plans to hit up TJMaxx, Macys, Dillards, Kohls, and maybe JCP all before hitting Walmart for groceries. But first Alex and I went to lunch at Applebee's and then went our separate ways. Him to hang out. Me to shop.Since Shoe Carnival is in the same shopping plaza as TJMaxx, I hit there first. I was having a grand time trying on shoes. And then my phone rang, and it was Alex calling to tell me there was a problem with the mustang. What seemed to be a HUGE problem, since water was pouring into the passenger's footbed area *inside* the car. Well, I already had 2 pairs of shoes picked out (buy 1 get 1 half off), so I bought those and then drove to meet Alex. Yep. Hot, rusty water pouring in. But absolutely NO water leaking under the hood or under the car. Weird, right? The car has no A/C, but I forgot about the heater. A 1965 heater, with a little mini radiator inside the car above the passenger's feet. Which was now leaking like nobody's business. Luckily, Alex's friend's dad came to the rescue and fixed it up by simply disconnecting the hoses to the heater and re-routing them onto themselves to close the system. A 1965 heater doesn't provide much heat anyway, so it won't really be missed. If it ever even worked since we got the car. I distinctly remember freezing my butt off in the car on the drive with Tyler to bring it home to Florida from New Jersey in the middle of winter the year we bought it.While I'm eternally grateful for the free and quick-turnaround fix, it did kind of put a damper in my shopping plans. But I headed back out after we were done dealing with the car around 4 PM.First stop, TJMaxx. I was in and out of there in 5 minutes. I decided I wanted a real department store with pretty racks and organized clothes not a scavenger hunt. So THAT was a waste of time. Next, Macys at the mall. Where I found absolutely NOTHING I liked enough to try on. It was all either too casual or too dressy. I didn't find career clothes. Waste of time #2. Back in the car and around to the other side of the mall, to Dillards. (It's not that I'm lazy, but I didn't want to walk from one end of the mall to the other. I hate malls.) I always find things at Dillards, and I did today. I tried on a lot. But again, nothing really did it for me. I'm kind of in between size ranges right now. Not quite all the way plus anymore, but not NOT plus, if you know what I mean. So everything was either too big or too small. Waste of time #3. By this time, it was after 6 PM and I still had the groceries to get. So, clothes shopping was done and I was off to Walmart and then back home to unload.Discouraged by my shopping failures, I decided to have another go at my skirt. Waste of time #4. While I fixed the tummy pooching problem by ripping off the waist facing and taking an inch off the top of the skirt front, I royally screwed up how the facing would fit by doing that. So now it's all puckered and weird. ARghhhh. I knew better but tried it anyway. Here is its present state:Since walking away, I've decided that I can probably save it by using petersham for the waist (almost typed waste — hah!) facing. I think I have some. I'll look later. In the meantime and as soon as I finish typing this, I'll rip off the now-understitched facing one more time while watching some TV before calling it a night.To end on a good note, my new shoes. I'm going a little crazy in the shoe department, but I love it. The last time I worked outside my home I was also a shoe fiend. Looks like old habits die hard (or not at all).Aren't these GORGEOUS?? This is the way for me to do Mary Janes. And that color -- oooo, I've died and gone to heaven Oz. (There's no place like home, there's no place like home!!)And one casual pair, since all I have is either flip flops or 15 years old. Not that I need an excuse to buy shoes. But I do need to clear out some of the 15-year old dust collectors."},

Ever. ;-) Still, thanks for the good wishes just the same. Next, I definitely don't have to worry about a short week, after leaving early yesterday afternoon. This morning, the traffic was non-existent so I was sitting at my desk and working at 8 AM. We had a working lunch meeting that went for 90 minutes, and I didn't leave for the day until nearly 6 PM. And I still have hours of stuff I left behind. It's really nice to be so busy, because it means that my time is well-spent and, more importantly, they trust me with all this stuff. I'm still glad it's Friday, though. ;-) I'm looking forward to sleeping in until 8 AM instead of 6 AM, with a cute little pooch snuggled in next to me since it's going to be downright FREEZING here overnight (in the 50s — our Florida thermometers are \"vanity sized,\" so 50 = 30.) ;-)So, the skirt. I tried it on after work while I still had on pantyhose and heels. Do you have any idea how hard it is to try on a skirt with a pinned-down waist facing while wearing pantyhose and NOT catching a pin in them? Trust me, don't try it. That smile is fake.There's a poochy thing going on there at the tummy, and it's not just the tummy (or last night's dinner).It's worse when my top is lifted up (so don't lift it up, Debbie, geez!).It's better when I yank up the front waist. Sigh. That means it needs an adjustment and I'm not sure if I feel like ripping out the waist facing. It's also going to be too short if I hem it with a normal turn-up (not turnip). I'll have to face the hem.Here's the back view, where all the style action is. I like it, but the seaming sorta points to the good china and I'm not sure about that look. So, I'm not going to sew it anymore tonight.I've got my jeans on and I think I'll finish the book I've been reading and catch up on the DVR. By the way, I finished Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father and loved it. I'm not political AT ALL, and neither is this book. But it does confirm what I've always felt about BO ever since I first heard him speak. He's intelligent, fair, open-minded, and a very good man. What you see is what you get. I found his perspective on being black in America and in Africa really interesting and thought-provoking. While this book is really more just BO's story than a racial anything, as a white woman, he made me think about things I never would've thought about on my own and I think (hope) I'm better for that.The book I'm almost done reading right now is Michael Oher's book. Not The Blind Side, by another author and upon which the movie was based, but Oher's own recounting of his childhood struggles and successes — which does differ in a lot of respects from the movie. I didn't intentionally pick two books on being a black child/man in America — it just happened. But I've found the differences and similarities quite interesting and I'm glad I read them sort of together. BO's book is much deeper, but MO's story as a child growing up in the projects and often in foster case, while a faster read, is well worth learning too. I would even say that MO had a lot more to overcome, since BO grew up in a much more privileged and stable environment. I highly recommend both books, and probably in the same order I've read them."},

I did get a real shower this morning because I demanded the well pump be turned on for 15 minutes and said screw it to the resulting water explosion by the well. I filled up a couple of buckets too, which I may need tomorrow morning. This is ridiculous. If (ahem) no one else calls in a professional tomorrow morning, I will. Along with no showers, we have no way to wash dishes or clothes and I am NOT going to go into a weekend with no resolution to this situation. Thankfully, I did my laundry on Sunday so I'm set for clothes. But Alex isn't. And the dishes the males stacked in the sink are grossing me out, besides the fact that we're almost out of clean forks.So on to more pleasant things. My McCall's 5523 skirt is coming along. I was sort of hoping to finish it tonight because our temps have dropped and it would be a nice cooler weather outfit, but I decided to be smart and not push it. This is the flouncey back, cuz the front is just a boring pencil skirt. The skirt itself is sewn up. I need to put in the invisible zipper, which I actually have in the correct color. Yay me! And then I need to add the waist facings, onto which I'm going to attach the half-lining I didn't use on my last skirt. Nice to have that all ready to go. Do you know there are 33 reviews for this skirt on PR? Wow, I had no idea. I don't particularly like the ruffle-y views for myself, but I do like this one with the flounce and the view with the pleats. I'm already thinking of making the pleated skirt as one of my next projects, while the pattern is still out. It won't be as fast to make due to those pleats, but it should still go quick enough. My whole closet is going to be filled with skirts soon. But I am loving all my mix 'n match possibilities each morning.After trying on a couple of my jackets, I found that I have nothing to wear outerwear-wise for cooler weather. Time to shop again. (Oh darn.) I'm not going to spend sewing time on outerwear this year, since it gets so little use and I'm hopeful this year's whatever will be too big next year. But I still need something, so RTW it will be. Finally, I had a little glimmer of hope today in relation to this job maybe turning permanent. Just casual conversation as an adjunct to another topic, but it was very positive and from the decision-maker. Keep your fingers crossed for me, because I LOVE THIS JOB and I would be happy with it for the rest of my working life. I have been here a little over a month now and I've yet to find anything to complain about. Seriously, it's that good. In fact, I keep figuratively pinching myself wondering when I'm going to wake up from my dream."},
{"title": "No Sewing Tonight Either", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "text": "This is how my day started:I'm going to be crude here, but in order to get ready for work this morning I had to do what my father used to term a \"whore bath.\" That's where you stand in the tub with a bucket and a rag and wash the \"important\" parts. Ahem. I also washed my hair, which is equally important. ;-) The biggest pain was emptying all the darn bottles into a big bucket. Arghhhh.As you might have guessed, we didn't have water when I woke up this morning. And we still don't have it now. And I'm really spittin' nails since someone is just now getting back to the project at nearly 10 PM. It seems a certain boob tube was more important. I'm really hoping it gets fixed before morning, but I'm not optimistic so I've got my back-up case of water ready. I decided it's more of a pain to pack to go to a hotel than to do bath gymnastics with bottled water. Plus, the dogs. Luckily, I was cheered up by the arrival of yet more shoes. One pair is a duplicate of the semi-metallic brown shoes but in taupe suede. They're very oooo-ahhhh, but unfortunately they feel half a size too big even though they're the same size, and so back they go. I sure wish I had invented Zappos. But these I think are staying.Yes, I know they are not my *most* flattering style, but I still love them. So hush. ;-)Plus, they're extremely comfortable and are going to look great with my Moneypenny Pussycat blouse. And a twin set I bought a few weeks ago that you haven't seen yet. The color is Cabernet Savignon, which makes them even prettier, right? I love the shiny black accents too. But my orange toenails are going to have to go. By the way, this is NOT what I wore to work today. It's the top half of what I wore out to dinner with Alex and then a skirt thrown on in place of the jeans so I could \"model\" the shoes.As you can see, I didn't do diddly squat about my dresser top last night. I was sawing logs by 11:30 PM. I don't think I'm going to do anything about it tonight either. But it's on my short list, especially since I've put it all out here. ;-)Speaking of the blouse, here's the fabric I'm going to use for the skirt to go with it. It's very similar to the skirt I had on the other night, but just enough lighter to not be such a drab combo, I think. (Especially with those shoes!) It's lightweight wool crepe, so it ought to sew like a dream and drape beautifully. If I ever sew it."},

Random thoughts follow.You know how when you wake up to go pee and feel smug because you still have another hour or two before your alarm goes off? Or is that just me? Anyway, I woke up this morning ONE MINUTE before my alarm was to go off. Grrr. I hate that. Especially on a Monday. After a Sunday that I stayed up too late watching mindless TV. Work was non-stop. It's good. But I'm feeling a little brain fart-y so I'm going to stay away from sharp objects tonight and just tune in some football and maybe clean off the top of my dresser while that's on. It's covered in belts, necklaces, and earrings. And dust. I hate clutter. (Although if you saw my sewing room the last month or so you would never believe that!) I want to empty out a top drawer and put the stuff in there. Handy, but out of sight. But that will be giving a mouse a cookie, because once I start clearing out drawers, I'm going to find lost \"treasures,\" which will make another pile somewhere. I think I'm going to take everyone up on their suggestion to just donate my old clothes and not worry about tags. The worst case is they'll end up in a landfill, which is my only other plan for them. How many years will it take all my poly knit tops to break down? More than I want to know. Does anyone want an unworn biker-ish fleece jacket? Sigh. I never got to wear it, after buying the pattern twice and then spending all that time on it. There's no way to adjust it down easily and it's just huge on me. Someone will like it, and not care that the front pocket flaps are fake and the pockets are really in the sideseams. Oh, another problem for tonight? We have no water. The well pump exploded again and my STBex isn't due home for another hour. I swear, if it gets to midnight and it's still not fixed, I'm going to a hotel. Tomorrow is the big boss' birthday. I hope no one gives me the stink eye when I refuse any of the cake. And, finally, my mother said she was going to call tonight. Another reason not to sew because as soon as I start, the phone will ring. I'm glad my work wardrobe is sizing up nicely and I have options and don't feel desperate to sew that skirt tonight. And there's the phone now …"},
{"title": "HP1047 Done, but no outfit yet", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2011", "text": "I finished the Moneypenny Pussycat blouse and I really like it. I don't like it with this skirt, but I had to wear something for the pic. (ETA: Yes, it looks OK, but just OK. It's too muddy for me.) The skirt I'm working on is muslined but that's as far as I got before sewing fatigue started setting in. The new skirt fabric is lighter and will be more contrast, which I think will look better. It should be an easy sew that I hope to work on during the upcoming weeknights.Back view.This pattern is one of the first Hot Patterns releases, back in 2005 (Holy Cow! Time flies!) and I think there were a few pattern issues with the original Slinky/Curvy/Glamour sizing. However, it's been reworked since then and is now multi-sized in one envelope like the current HPs. I had absolutely no problems with this pattern. All seams and notches matched up and the sizing was nearly perfect for me. At $7.95 it's a steal!As I said earlier, I cut a straight 16. I chose this size based sort of on full bust and sort of on my recent experience with 18 being too big. I was making a muslin so I didn't have much to lose. For my alterations, I added about 3/8\" under the bust curve. The empire seam as drafted was on the edge for me, nearly perfect, but since this is an easy fix, I went for it and now it *is* perfect. I also decided to widen and lower the neckline after all to make it more like the envelope drawing. As you can see, I just whacked off a very unscientific amount. I then laid the new neckline over the facing piece and hacked that off too.It worked fine.The sleeves are very narrow on this pattern. That's pretty much my only complaint. But it's easy enough to do a simple slash/spread to enlarge. I added 2 inches and redrew the sleeve cap higher since spreading the pattern flattens it a bit. Lastly, I sliced off some of the bell fullness, which was even more full after spreading the pattern 2 inches. Again, very unscientific.I think I ended up with an essence of bell sleeves without the hassle of dragging them through my soup.Whatever they are now, I like them.I also added 2\" to the length at the bottom edge of the lower bodice pattern pieces, but my hem is about 1-1/2\" so I probably didn't need all of that. Finally, I combined the two front facing pieces into one since there's really no reason for a seam in the middle. You don't need a design detail on facing. ;-) One feature that is not really apparent from the pattern envelope is that the neckband isn't really a band at all, but a really pretty shawl collar that morphs into the ties at the front. If you haven't done a tie-front blouse similar to this, you *will* need other instructions because HP's are kind of obtuse, not really complete, and there aren't any illustrations. But this is one of their older patterns and their instructions in newer patterns are much better. I'm going to try to find a pattern in my stash or instructions in one of my books to add to my review when I write it up for PatternReview.com. One last note about the directions — they tell you that all seams are sewn WRONG sides together unless otherwise indicated. This is a major boo-boo, because they're not, so don't let that throw you if you make this (and you should!) The buttons are courtesy of Carolyn and a perfect match, don't you think? Once again, thank you Carolyn for that button bonanza! I picked up this knit dress today while running through Walmart, my home away from home it seems. I'm not sure about it being work-appropriate — that neckline is pretty low. I know I can sew it higher, so I'm still evaluating. I like how it looks low, but I don't think I'm going to have any date nights for a while. Hahahaha! (I also bought a couple of new bras while I was there so girls are pretty perky today. I bought the same exact bra/cup size as my previous bras but went down in band size. That really shouldn't work, but it did. I'm now a 38DD in this bra. I haven't been a 30-anything in bras in a long time. More vanity sizing?)It's a faux wrap pullover, with ties that tie at center front.  I like it, but it's definitely a suck-in-yer-gut-all-day dress so it might hang for 10 more lbs or so. But for $18, how could I resist? I wish the details showed better in the pics. It's also got an asymmetrically gathered waist which you can't see at all.That's it from Chez Cook. I hope you had a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Sigourney Weaver Called", "date": "Saturday, October 15, 2011", "text": "… and she's really pissed that Melanie gave you her blouse. ;-)So here it is, in all of its 1980s shoulder-padded dolman glory. And if you think this is hilarious— Look at this:But in my time-warped way, I still kinda love it. Just not enough to wear it in public.That's OK. It got its fair share of wearing, and then some, back in 1985 or whenever it was I bought it. (And it's not shiny, like it looks in these pics. Weird how photos change some fabrics.) My personal color palette hasn't changed much since then either, which makes sense since *I* am still the same color, give or take a little gray and some wrinkles, and much smaller hair. Here's a couple more shots, one showing the deep pleats on the side front.And the other showing what a pain in the @ss it was to get in and out of this thing, plus the sleeves also had three small buttons up each to give it that very fitted look at my wrists. But the fabric (silk) is still in great condition. The whole blouse looks brand new. Well, except for that 1980s thing it has going on.Moving ahead to 2011, I present the HP Pussycat muslin. This is a straight 16, except for the sleeves. I had to add 2\" to those, but they sewed in with no easing required. Yay Trudy! I think the only \"alterations\" I'm going to do are (1) add some length at the bottom, (2) add a little extra length under the bust on the upper bodice, and (3) take some ring out of the bell sleeves. Hah. I slay myself. Or, I might just elasticate the wrists and call it done. The neckline isn't as low as the pattern illustration (but since when do those HP drawings ever ring entirely true? Ring! Hah. Get it?), but I really don't feel like altering it so it's going to stay as drafted, at least in this version.I'm going to cut the good stuff right after dinner and maybe I'll have a new blouse by bedtime."},
{"title": "Weekend Sewing Plans", "date": "Saturday, October 15, 2011", "text": "These are the patterns I picked to make this weekend from the HUGE stack of \"on deck.\" I will be muslining both. The Pussycat blouse because I goofed on my last couple of HPs by picking a too-big upper chest size and I don't want to do that again. Plus, the sleeves. My biceps haven't seen 13\" since I was 10. I'm also going to make a quick muslin of the skirt (view A, the gray one) to be sure on the length since chopping off at the bottom isn't a good option with the flounce. I've got the blouse muslin mostly cut out. I just have to alter the sleeve and cut it and then I'm ready for ugly sewing.Coming downstairs to get on the computer, I saw the box with my Fabric Mart order sitting on the kitchen counter, which must have arrived in the last hour. Wow. That was FAST! Wasn't it just Thursday that I straightened out the mysterious credit card problem with my order? I'm not complaining.I also snuck in yet another Fabric.com order earlier this morning. The sweater knits I received the other day washed up like a dream and I saw they had some moleskin, so I ordered another sweater knit, a taupe moleskin, and just enough other stuff to reach the $35 free shipping level, and used a coupon for 10% off, and OMG my fabric stash is exploding. (Run-on sentence much?) I sat in my sewing room today looking at it and contemplating that at some point fairly soon I'm going to have to pack it all up and move it. Now that will be a chore.Also this morning I had a little fun in my closet again. I've got a few past favorite garments from when I used to work in Washington, D.C. in the 80s. I was a clothes horse then, with a hefty income for a single girl with no other bills, and paid outrageous amounts for my clothes in the downtown department stores (does anyone remember Raleighs?), so I kept a few just for posterity. They crack me up when I see them every once in a while. Well, today, I tried on 2 of the blouses just to see how I compare in size now to then. They are 1980s size 12. Both pretty much fit, but one is too snug at the hip to button the last button so it technically doesn't fit yet. The other one — well, wait until I press it, get myself photo-ready, and snap a pic. It's very Melanie Griffith/Working Girl, complete with the shoulder pads of the times. But it's so out that it's actually in again, sans shoulder pads. So who knows — I may just end up wearing it one day for real. One of the skirts I saved — well, let's just say that by seeing how teeny tiny the width was on the hanger told me there was no way I was going to be able to zip it today, so I left it on the hanger for another time. But it's definitely motivation to get that teeny tiny again, although crunches will have to be involved for that. Speaking of closets and wrong-size clothes, do you think donating my self-made clothes that are too big is an option when none of them have size tags? I'm thinking that may be a big problem for a thrift store. But I also want them OUT of my house. My box overfloweth and I don't want any temptation to keep some to remake because while I could, I'm pretty sure I won't."},

I said, \"Thank you.\" Pause, pause. \"I made it.\" Her eyes lit up and she said, \"Wow! It looks so professonal.\" At first I thought she meant professional as in work. But I laughed later as I realized she meant professional as in RTW. I think her actual meaning was probably a bigger compliment since I'm sure I look professional/work every day.That's all I have today. Sewing room time tonight will only be to overcast/serge the ends of my new fabrics and start running them through the washer and dryer so I'm prepped for some weekend sewing. Later, atop my bed in front of the tube, I'm also going to go through my huge stacks of new patterns and make a plan as to WHAT I'm going to sew. I did remember to call Fabric Mart today and my credit card went through just fine today so who knows what the problem was. I had a shipping notice when I got home, so those fabrics should arrive at the end of next week.ETA: I had a question about where in Joann's I found the stretch bengaline.

{"title": "I Needed A Quickie", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2011", "text": "Today was crazy at work. We had lots of materials to gather and ship off for a conference in Atlanta on Friday, some of which were last-minute additions, hence the crazy part, and some I've been working on for a couple of weeks and today got to see printed and unveiled for the first time. It was nice to see my work \"in the flesh\" and it was even nicer to be an appreciated member of the team that made it all happen. All of this is to say I REALLY needed to sew when I got home (late) tonight.I'm very glad that while I cut out the drape-neck top last night, I didn't force things by sewing it. First, I needed that extra rest today but even more important (you see where my priorities are), it was a nice quickie project to sew up without too much brain power involved.And, here it is with the Love/Hate skirt. This will be tomorrow's outfit. I have a meeting tomorrow with a possible vendor for an odd packaging project and I want to look and feel good. New clothes always do the trick. I will probably grab one of my cardis to have handy for my daily freezing spell. I'm eating my words a lot lately it seems, but I'm actually preferring pantyhose most days since they keep my legs warm. Who wudda thunk?Here's the top on Zillie so maybe you can see the drape better. I made this top extra long so I could \"scrunch\" it up with a belt. I may or may not still shorten it. I'll see how it wears tomorrow.And my previously TNT Ottobre 02/07 tee underneath the cowl morph. While the tee still fits in the shoulders, neckline and armhole depth,  it's now way too big in the width. I sewed up the new top per this  pattern above and tried it on. Then I took in an inch at each sideseam,  straight up through the armhole and sleeve, for a total of 4 inches — and  it's still not tight. But I'm not complaining. I realized about a week ago that I was eating serving sizes based on habit and not on hunger. I reduced the portions, feel much better after meals again, and moved the scale significantly. I lost 8 lbs this week  and saw a number on the scale this morning that I haven't seen in a  decade. Woot!My Fabric.com order was waiting for me Monday night. Back row left to right: sweater knit, sweater knit, sweater knit, rayon challis, rayon challis, sweater knit. Front: wool, wool blend. The sweater knits will be cardigans. The rayon challis is to be blouses, and the wools will be skirts. My Fabric Mart order is delayed. I received a voicemail from them telling me they were ready to ship but there was a problem with my credit card. Hmmm. I guess I will need to remember to call them tomorrow from the office and get that sucker on its way. Not that I've got a shortage anymore of fabrics to sew or anything.Parting Thought: One of the first things I do when I get home from work is to check my email. It's so nice to be welcomed home by all the nice comments from you. It really starts my evenings off with happy thoughts. Thank you!!"},
{"title": "Nothing Really New", "date": "Tuesday, October 11, 2011", "text": "I don't have anything new to show, but I did get a haircut after work today. This is what I wore to work and the salon. I decided to be \"brave\" and didn't wear a cardigan or jacket. This meant I had to suck in my stomach ALL DAY LONG. lol But that's good for the ab muscles, right?I also wore my new pumps. I love new shoes that are comfortable all day, the first wearing. I wish these came in lots of colors because I'd be buying them too.There hasn't been much happening in the sewing room yet. Last night I had to go grocery shopping. I had put it off from Sunday since it was raining here all day and I didn't feel like schlepping groceries to the car in the downpour.Tonight was the haircut and then a late dinner. But I did make a very quick muslin of my cowl pattern and my pattern morph needed some adjustment. So glad I didn't just cut the good stuff the other night. But I'm going to throw the rest of my caution to the wind and cut the fabric tonight. Maybe I'll even get it sewn up. I'm not counting on it though, since I only have about 90 minutes before my internal batteries wind down.I've been thinking about Carolyn's \"Quickie\" post off and on today, and it suddenly dawned on me that I *want* most of my projects to be quickies, not that it means they will be unflattering or badly finished. But when I thought about it, I realized that pretty much everything I wear is a basic piece and basics usually are quickies. Sure, sometimes I branch out and make a jacket, even lining some, or a Ren Faire costume, but that's not my usual M.O. Pattern alterations is what usually takes the longest time, which is why TNTs are so welcome — because then I have a \"quickie\" that I can sew over and over. And I'm OK with that. Except that my TNTs are dwindling.If you want a little bright spot reading about someone who is new to sewing and still excited about the process, her new skills, and her continuing education, go read Stacie's anniversary post. It made me smile. Parting Shot: I told Tyler to be creative with his pics and this is what I got today (C130 prop). It's really fun for me to see bits and pieces of his Marine Corps life. His first Marine Corps Ball is coming up in a month. I can't wait to see those pics in his dress blues with his new rank! His on/off GF Kelli is flying up to be his date, and I know he's looking forward to that."},
{"title": "The I Love/IHC Skirt (Butterick 5574)", "date": "Sunday, October 9, 2011", "text": "Yeah, so of course I have to eat my words now that I have made one Connie Crawford pattern with no significant alterations. (And sorry Grandma Connie — you know I love YOU!)As you can see, it's finished. Sorry dissenters, this is my preferred hem length at the moment. :-) My thighs and knees are still chubby and I prefer to keep them under cover. As they slim down, my hems might rise. I added 4\" to the bottom of the pattern pieces and cut off 1.5\" and turned up a 1.5\" hem. I think that means I added 2.5\" in the end. Here's a better shot of the pleats:And my butt — I mean the back view. ;-)And to dispel any thoughts otherwise, a pose that shows that while I'm definitely going down, I'm still plus size. The gut is taking the longest to disappear. Must do crunches. Must do crunches. (Hate crunches!)This one has a lapped zipper, for something different, and a snap closure because I'm lazy. I also added elastic to the waistband instead of easing it to the skirt waist as the pattern directs. Right now, it stretches out flat when I wear it so it doesn't look elasticated. As I lose more belly, it should mean the skirt will still fit. I hope so, because I like the skirt. Worst case is redoing the waistband since I still have enough fabric left for that.I'm having a brain fart and can't remember the name of this fabric. It's a stretch woven, fake suede-ish on the front side and satin-y on the back. Help, what's it called?? (Ding! Ding! Ding! We have a winner! Thank  you Joy and KC. Yes, moleskin.) I love the satin side because it means no lining is necessary. I've had this in the stash for at least 8 years. I also love the moss green color.I started out my morning at the tire store, thinking I only needed the current tires rotated and a slow leak in one repaired. Nearly $400 later, I left with 2 new tires. But at least now I have 4 good tires on the car, having bought 2 others about a year ago.After spending that money, I headed to Joann's to spend some more. (That's what paychecks are for, right?) I was only going for zippers, but saw that Simplicity were on sale for 99¢ each. I couldn't resist. There's also a Hot Patterns in this mix that arrived in yesterday's mail. I think I now have about 147 patterns on my \"short list.\" After grabbing patterns, I wandered over to the suiting fabrics and found lots. This is only a fraction of all that I really wanted to bring home. And that print? Does it have my name on it or what? Brown and green and teal (not turquoise as it looks here). I'm going to use it to make a cowl neck tee from morphing my TNT Ottobre pattern (hmmm I hope it's still TNT). I think I have the pattern done and I was going to just cut and sew tonight so I could wear both it and the new skirt tomorrow, but I came to my senses. I really need to muslin it first in case I goofed on the morph.The solid brown and green fabrics above? Stretch bengaline! At Joann's! Yes, Belinda, really! All of the fabrics except the print will be skirts. I'm really into skirts and separates right now, in case you hadn't noticed. With these, my Fabric.com order arriving tomorrow, and a Fabric Mart purchase arriving soon after, I believe I'm now stocked on some office fabrics. Not that I'm going on a fabric diet or anything. ;-)"},
{"title": "The IHC Skirt Muslin (Butterick 5574)", "date": "Saturday, October 8, 2011", "text": "So here's the muslin, in a lovely shade of peach with green stripes. Ooo, don't you want some? ;-) So, I'll probably have to eat my words about CC patterns. Well, at least this one. Figures, right? This is the XL (16), by my measurements, straight out of the envelope. The only changes I need to make are to lengthen it and to remove from the front waist. There are lengthen/shorten lines on the pattern near the hip but I'm going to just add to the bottom because I like where the pleats start and I can't imagine them beginning 4 inches lower. Well actually I can, and I don't like it.The skirt per the pattern is definitely short — similar to the photo but a lot shorter than the line drawing indicates.And this is without a hem turned up. As we all decided yesterday, my skirts need to hit just below my kneecap. ;-)The back looks kind of funky because it's just sloppily pinned together in lieu of a zipper and the cotton is Vecro-ing itself to my butt. ;-) Oh — one more change. I'm also going to omit the sideseam pockets, because … well … they are sideseam pockets. Which is never a good look for me. I'm half-thinking scoop pockets would be good. But do I have enough mojo to actually do them, or will I be lazy and wuss out?Carolyn - this skirt is a fast cut and sew. It might be worth it to you to just fit the pattern instead of retro-fitting the pleat panels to a TNT skirt, although each method is probably equal time-wise. Although, the pleats are easy and I like how they're formed. And yes, I'm pretty much out of office-appropriate fabrics. Remember, I haven't worked outside my house in more than 20 years. My stash is full of casual fabrics. But not for long, since my sewing eyes are always bigger than my fabric stomach. Or something like that. ;-)* * * * * Parting Rant: This is the photo you see when you land on the Butterick home page. Is that really the best they could do with matching the motifs across the zipper? It's been bugging me for days now. 1. The day did not start well. I had a 9:30 AM nail appointment and woke up at 9:15.2. Because the power was off.3. I need a wind-up alarm clock.4. And to go to sleep earlier.5. I called and we rescheduled to 10:30.6. I went without a shower.7. I wore a skirt and hadn't shaved my legs.8. But I did brush my teeth — with bottled water.9. I want to sew something.10. But I'm pretty much out of work fabric.11. And my fabric.com order isn't due until Monday.12. So I ordered more fabric from Fabricmart.13. Not that it will be here any sooner.14. But you stashers understand.15. So it's clear the MJ shoes are out.16. Which I pretty much knew anyway.17. But when did I ask for advice on the length of my skirt?18. And I was wearing a dress anyway.19. And holding up the hem so I could get more leg in the photo.20. So there. Pfffft. ;-) **21. The power was back on after going to my nail appointment and running a couple of errands.22. And no, I still haven't bought invisible zippers.23. Darn. I wish I had remembered when I was out.24. I'm dilly-dallying about what to start on next in my sewing room.25. Skirts are still calling.26. I have a couple of fabrics that could work. 27. But they might end up orphans.28. Of course, I could always shop retail for a top.29. Hmm.30. I have to be out early tomorrow anyway to get my tires rotated.31. The excitement around here never ends. ;-)32. I think I'll go try fitting the I-Hate-Connie skirt.33. Are you in with me Carolyn?34.

Perfect fit, VERY comfortable. Digging that rounded heel. Awesome slightly metallic brown color, which doesn't show in pics. I still can't believe I'm loving to wear heels again. Next, the I-Don't-Knows. I love the look of the shoes … in my hand. On my feet, I don't know. First, they're too big. I could try the next size smaller, but I'm just not sure about the straps with my legs, which, let's face it, are not my best feature. ;-) Wider shot. Too young (the shoes)? Too stumpy (my legs)?With tights:And, as you can see, I didn't wear jeans today. I'm just not loving the ones I have for officewear, even on Jeans Friday.So, chime in on the Mary Janes. This particular pair is going back, but should I try another? And chime in on tights too. What shoes DO you wear with them? Do you match to the tights? Contrast? Heels? Flats?

{"title": "If Friday Is Jeans Day …", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2011", "text": "… Then Thursday Must Be Jeans Try-On NightBut first, here's what I wore today, now a little frumpled after work all day and dinner out with Alex and his best friend. I forgot about this twinset until I was digging in my closet last night and am so glad I found it. I love me some lime green. ;-)  I also love this necklace and even had a compliment on it today, but by the end of the day, it is OMG-HEAVY. I couldn't wait to take it off after this photo session.(My photography skills are even more lacking tonight as I managed to cut off my feet/shoes in every pic because I set the tripod a hair too close. Grrr.)Let the jeans try-on session begin …Self-made burgundy bootcuts from 2004. I tried them on with platform sandals and boy did my legs look long. Unfortunately, with my crap camera skills you'll have to trust me on that.These are the beltloop-less self-made jeans I mentioned last week, and the outfit I thought I was wearing tomorrow until I saw this pic. They are just too big and add 10+ lbs to me. No, thank you, I just lost that 10 and don't want it back again.These RTW jeans look better so I may be wearing them tomorrow instead. Or chickening out on jeans again and wearing a dress.Another for the clown pants pile. These were too tight 6 months ago. Amazing.These are the green \"progress\" jeans. The ones I tried on and photographed being way too tight in the next pic below, which was back in June. This pic is tonight. They fit, and are even getting too loose. And, no, they are not favorites anymore. They are too skinny in the calves and not flattering.It's really hard to believe these are the same jeans as above but they are. Parting Rant: My BMV order arrived yesterday. I broke my promise to myself and ordered yet another Butterick/Crawford pattern (Butterick 5574) because I want to try this skirt. (Carolyn — recognize anything sticking out in the upper right corner??)And again, I'm really PO'd at this pattern line, especially the instruction sheet. As usual with this line, there are no illustrations of the pattern pieces. Uh, hello, Butterick? I *NEED* those drawings. It's what I look at first to see how it all goes together. I don't want to have to read ALL of the construction steps just to see what I'm dealing with. That may or may not come later, depending on what the pattern pieces tell me. I like the puzzle of figuring it out for myself. But what also ticks me off are the lumpy-slouchy-woman-with-a-serious-wedgie drawings. It's irrelevant if my body really does look like that. I don't want to be reminded of it. Do you? I sew and wear clothes to camouflage and conceal my lumps. And, to me these drawings speak VOLUMES about what CC *really* thinks about plus-sized bodies. I've seen many drawings and paintings of larger and curvy woman who looked beautiful, as we all are. Not slouchy and depressed like these pattern drawings. But what's almost just as bad is that I bought the size range for this pattern that is NOT plus-sized. The sizes start at 2 in this range. And yet all of the fitting \"advice\" is aimed at the other envelope and assumes much bigger bodies. WTF? What size 2 has arms like the drawing on the left? If I had never been or sewn plus-sized, I wouldn't understand any of that at all.I swear, with all of you as my witnesses, if this skirt doesn't work without major alterations, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BUTTERICK/CONNIE CRAWFORD PATTERN AGAIN. And this time, I really, really, really mean it. Really. To leave you on a happier note, these will be arriving tomorrow. I so love having paychecks again, and a reason to dress up. And brown shoes."},
{"title": "Fixing the Clearance Top", "date": "Tuesday, October 4, 2011", "text": "Remember this oversized Walmart $7.00 clearance top?I spent 20 minutes tonight making it wearable, and now I have this:I pinned up a big tuck (red lines below) right above the shirred waistline and tried it on to be sure it was OK. It was, so I stitched about 3/8\" away from the shirring (yellow lines).Then I trimmed the tuck and finished the resulting raw edges all in one pass on the serger.The last step was to sew the underam seam deeper, and then trim/finish with the serger.And that's all I have tonight because I have laundry to fold."},
{"title": "More on the eShrug", "date": "Monday, October 3, 2011", "text": "There were a few questions in the comments about the eShrug, so I'll address them here.The eShrug is a downloadable pattern from The Sewing Workshop, that you print on your own printer and tape together. It's $6.00 and you can see/buy it here. It's an easy task to tape it together. All the pieces fit well and it will take about 5 minutes for assembly.What this pattern is NOT, is a fitted jacket/cardigan. As I said yesterday, it's kind of weird to look at and sew. But it's also extremely fast to sew, especially if you use a knit that doesn't require finished edges, as I did. As drafted, there is no sideseam. Front and back are morphed into one piece. I had to make a sideseam so the pattern would fit on my fabric width. But as I also said yesterday, I actually preferred the sideseam so I could sew the sleeves in flat. The shoulder seams are curved, which is one of the weird aspects, but hang straight. Although they sit forward and not actually on the shoulder.So, with all that in mind, here are the fast alterations I made.First, after it was sewn together, I scooped out the back neckline as shown below. I didn't like all that fabric bunching up at my neck. It didn't look bad — it just felt … weird. Next, I changed the lapel by simply folding down the front edge as shown below. I knew I wanted to do this because I actually had made up another version first in a fabric that turned out to be totally inappropriate and then compared that to a RTW cascade/waterfall cardi to see what the difference was between the two lapels. This is what I came up with and it worked.And that's it. I think I got my $6's worth, especially in the instant gratification aspect. I have a more structured waterfall cardigan Vogue pattern on the way. It will be interesting to compare them.Parting Shot: New shoes. I really need some basic black shoes because I do plan on making a black skirt soon (even though I don't wear too much black) because it will go with a number of cardigans I've either bought or plan to make soon. I really like the updated wedge, it's rounder and more flattering to the foot.Now I'm off to watch the football game before I hit the pillows, since Tampa is playing and it's one of the very rare times we actually get to see a home game televised due to poor ticket sales the past couple of years. The NFL's policy on that is a rant for another day."},
{"title": "This One's for Carolyn", "date": "Sunday, October 2, 2011", "text": "Hey Carolyn — I finally made a wearable version of Vogue 1250!If you remember, I first muslined this pattern in a black knit and altered the heck out of the pattern. Today, because I weigh less now, I removed all the alterations except for the FBA and downsized from a 20+ on the bottom to a straight 18-. I would've gone to the 16, but the upper bodice was already FBA'd and I didn't want to mess with it. I was also inspired by Art Attack's sleeved version and added sleeves to mine, but a little differently. I just drew on dolman sleeves and didn't use a dropped shoulder seam like she did. I'd rather have no armsyce seam than a dropped shoulder seam, but that's me.So here's the dress in a brown/beige ITY knit print, on its own. No pantyhose were harmed in the making of these Sunday night photos. ;-)Belted, because the dress needs *something.* I don't like sheaths on me with no accent pieces. I don't have the body for them. (Yet!)With the Sewing Workshop eShrug I downloaded, lengthened, altered, and made this afternoon.With the eShrug tied below the waist.The eShrug is a weird little downloadable pattern. It works but only after I made some alterations, like scooping out a back neck curve instead of going with the completely horizontal edge. I also reshaped the \"lapels\" so I didn't look like I was ready for take-off. And I had to add sideseams because the original doesn't have any but the full width of the pattern didn't fit on my fabric (even though the pattern gives yardarge for 44\" fabric and mine was closer to 60\" wide). That's OK though because it made it so I could sew in the sleeves flat, sleeves which I lengthened to full length. None of these changes took a lot of time, and lengthening instructions were included in the pattern, so I'm not really complaining. It was interesting to see how it was drafted and it was definitely instant gratification.My sleeve addition. Can you guess why I chose this particular sleeve length? If you look closely, you can see that I removed all extra width below the waist that I had added back in July, except for the width added by the FBA. I also lengthened the cowl facing about 1-1/2\" to give it a little more weight.And the back piece. The width addition is technically still in the pattern, but I removed some at the side seam before cutting my fabric and sewed out the rest when stitching up the side waist darts. There's still a little too much width/length at my back waist so if I make this again anytime soon, I'll try to remember to address that.Here's the sleeve inside out. There's an overarm seam and an underarm seam. I added a band instead of turning a hem for a little more length. I couldn't cut the sleeves longer because of the shape of the pattern.I think I like the eShrug with this dress the best, either way I've shown above."},
{"title": "Simplicity 2475: Done", "date": "Saturday, October 1, 2011", "text": "My skirt is finished, which means I have a new outfit for next week. That's the pattern above, in case you need a refresher. I didn't read all the reviews on PR, but most of the ones I did read mentioned it runs big. They weren't kidding. I ended up sewing 1/4\" deeper seams all around, which means 6 seams x .25 x 2 = 3\" removed. That's a lot. I'm glad I didn't rush to finish this skirt because I had a lot of pin-fitting and trying on to do to get it right. It's snug right now, but wearable. This will give me some shrinking room before I have to trash it.As to the \"Amazing Fit,\" it's not so amazing. I know I'm curvy. In a comment, NancyK said what I meant  when she said (paraphrasing) it would be nice to know what Simplicity had in mind when they made up the differentiations. Without that knowledge, it's kind of crap shoot no matter what. Especially when you go by your measurements and still have to remove 3\". Still, it's a nice skirt and the pleats at the back are a nice feature. Walking ease and visual interest.One more little complaint — the notches on the pleat inserts don't match up with the pleats. That's the second Simplicity pattern in a short time that has had wonky notches. Fine for experienced stitchers, but really bad mojo for newbies. The instructions also made my eyes cross. I think they're probably fine but they were so involved for simple things that I tossed them aside early on. While I'm not an instruction *follower*, I am an instruction reader just for entertainment if nothing else. Yeah, we complain about Burda's minimal approach and we complain with too much. What nerve! ;-)So here it is with the blouse I'll wear with it, and weekend hair I will not be wearing to the office. ;-)Rear view. Can you see the pleats? I decided to leave the zipper at the sideseam because I thought another seam running down the back would be too much and as I'm sitting here typing this, it now occurs to me I could've put the zipper in a princess seam. Duh. But the truth is I really didn't want to deal with re-doing the yoke pieces. Plus, I have to put zippered skirts on backwards and twist them around anyway, so what's the difference? The worst part about a side zip is that it makes taking it in down the road much more time-consuming.The fabric really picked up the flash (so did Dani's eyes) and looks very shiny. It's not really. The messy closet in the background isn't really either. … OK, it is.I still haven't bought more invisible zippers so the skirt got a burgundy one. I'm lame, what can I say. Maybe I'll get to Joann's tomorrow.I was going to line this, and even had the lining made and ready to attach. But something told me to pin it in first and try it. I'm glad I did because I didn't like how it felt. There was some serious static going on or something with the dueling polyesters. So now I have a lining ready for another skirt. You can also see that I didn't even try to match my serger thread. I won't tell if you won't.Parting Shot: The Marine is back in Yuma doing Marine things (and getting sunburned by the look of his face). Today he was promoted to Lance Corporal. Congrats Tyler!"},
{"title": "Shopping Not Sewing", "date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "text": "The mojo was in light attendance last night. I interfaced the skirt waistbands and that was it. I'll finish up the skirt over the weekend, and hopefully something else too.So, instead of sewing, I went shopping online before the BMV sale ended. I noticed the New Vogues were in the sale, then off the site. Not nice, IMO, but it's not like I was really going to sew any of the new patterns before the next sale. Instead, I bought some of the items that were on my wishlist, which will be plenty to keep me busy — along with those still in a holding pattern from previous sales. Carolyn will be happy to see that the Rachel skirt was purchased and will be on its way to me. ;-)Then I headed over to Fabric.com and some sweater knits and lightweight wools for skirts are on their way to me. It's going down to an artic 69 degrees this weekend so I need to be ready. Previous online shopping from PalmerPletsch.com arrived in my mailbox yesterday, including more interfacing and this DVD. I always enjoy the P/P DVDs and they are so reasonably priced. I'll let you know what I think about this one after I've watched it — hopefully over the weekend.I rounded out the evening by clearing some too-big pants from my closet. The brown pants second from the top are my wonderful stretch bengaline (from Australia) pants. I'm almost sad they are too big. Bye-bye stretch bengaline. I'll miss you.I also found a pair of jeans in the closet that fit and I was going to wear them today for Jeans Day at work but I really wanted to wear a belt with them because they are a little loose in the waist. However, in my infinite sewing wisdom, I didn't add belt loops to them. I didn't want to be pulling them up all day, so I'm not wearing them. Maybe I'll add some beltloops over the weekend. Here's what I wore to work yesterday. The dress is too loose to wear on its own, but with a wide brown belt under the cardi and the neckline Hollywood-taped closed, it works — which means now I have another outfit for a few more weeks, with an added bonus of being really comfortable. I really like this cardi. Some of the sweater knits I just bought may turn into its sisters."},
{"title": "Simplicity 2475: In Progress", "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "text": "I made no progress on any sewing last night. After writing 2 reviews, I fizzled. Tonight, I cut out and pressed the pattern tissue for this skirt and then cut out the waistband from the fabric to pin it and try it on. It fits. Well, probably. At least I know it's not too small, which is always a good thing when going right from unaltered pattern tissue to the fabric. But I have so much of this fabric that if the first make turns out to be a muslin, I can still make 4 more and a jacket. ;-)After testing the waistband, I cut out the rest of the skirt. And that's where I'm quitting. It has been a very busy week at work, which I like, but I'm tired. I've also decided I probably want to line this skirt. That means I need to baste it together to be sure it fits and then cut out a lining if it's a go. And, even though I've now cut out the waistband pieces, I'm thinking of moving the side zipper to the back. All of that is just too much for my brain tonight.This skirt is one from Simplicity's \"Amazing Fit\" line, with separate slim, average, and curvy pattern pieces. That's all well and good IF you know whether you are slim, average, or curvy. Nowhere does the pattern tell you how to choose between the three. As usual, it just tells you to pick your size from the measurement chart, and nothing about which fit you should pick. Now, I'm pretty sure I'm curvy. But on the other hand, I usually have to straighten hip curves on patterns. So, does that make me curvy some places and average others? I just think it's kind of lame for Simplicity to ignore how to choose your fit within a size because plenty of women don't really evaluate their bodies fairly. Maybe I'm just extra grumpy because I'm tired. My unsolicited advice is to cut the curvy because it's biggest and then pin to fit and trim away what you don't need. But then that sort of defeats the Amazing part, no? And makes it just a regular skirt pattern."},

{"title": "More Outfit Pics", "date": "Monday, September 26, 2011", "text": "Are you getting tired of seeing me posing in the mirror talking about clothes? Don't answer that. I think it was Julie who asked how I do good mirror shots. Well, Julie, as you'll see below — it's a total crap shoot. I turn off the flash, try to hold the camera as still as I can when I'm too lazy to get out the tripod, and then snap a billion of each pose and weed out the best. I'm not always successful. Some of these are the \"best\" of really bad and blurry. So, this is what I wore today. I think this is my first repeat at the office, but I didn't take a pic of me in it the first time. It was Monday, I stayed up too late last night, and I knew this would be comfortable — plus it was clean, pressed and ready. I also remembered that last Monday I was almost too warm in a sweater. Today? I was cold again. I really need to make or buy some sort of shawl that I can toss over my knees in the afternoon. It's my bare/un-PH legs that get the coldest.  I made everything. The top is Vogue 8118 (OOP), which I made 3+ years ago. The skirt is the half-lined Burda I just made. And the cami is self-drafted and made from ivory Powerdry. I'm so glad the cami fits again. The top is sheer, but not as sheer IRL as it looks here. I even made the undies I'm wearing but I'm not modeling those. Although I said I'd do pics on me when I had the coordinating skirt sewn, I went ahead and snapped a pic with today's skirt because I hadn't even tried on the finished blouse after closing up the sewing room last night. It was too late and I was in too-big pants that wouldn't have looked right with it anyway. I'm very happy with the fit and style and I'll be making another top from this pattern very soon, with a sleeve cap fix. Next, on to another Walmart purchase. This is the Before so don't panic, and I know it's completely unflattering in this state. But it was only $7 on clearance and it's my colors (brown and teal), and I'm thinking I can refashion it …… to something like this:It's got a shirred elastic waist but I think I can just cut the top off above the elastic, shorten it, and hide the seam in the blousing. Plus take in the sideseams and sleeve seams. For $7, it's worth a try.Here's what I'm wearing now, from the back of my closet. Both of these will be going in the too-big box after this wearing. The top is an Onion pattern and is quite baggy and too long. The pants waist comes up to my bra line. Hah. (Speaking of bras NancyK, I don't need an actual \"fitting,\" since I'm pretty good at knowing if a bra fits me properly. I've already bought a few in smaller sizes so I'm good in that department.)Tonight I'm going to catch up on some DVR'd TV shows so there won't be any sewing. It was also pouring rain on the way home so I didn't stop at Joann's either. There's always tomorrow. I think before I make a skirt, though, I'm going to be making a quick top that I can wear with a sweater I bought last week. And then a denim skirt for Friday, although I'm thinking that Rachel skirt would be great for a denim skirt (especially after seeing Julie's), so you may just get me yet Carolyn. ;-)Just a few quick pics of the finished blouse before I head to bed.As you can see, I made the view (B, I think) with the waist tabs and self-fabric belt. I didn't have enough fabric to cut the belt to full length so it's a little short. I also left off any pockets both because of the fabric shortage and the boobage. ;-)Speaking of boobage, I know I've said it before, but I really need to reshape Zillie. This top almost doesn't fit her because both her bust and her back are bigger/broader than me. Her hips are smaller, though, darn it. (I'll get a pic of this on me when I've got the skirt done.)I'm not happy with the hem. It's too ripply from fighting the fabric and the curved hem. I want to re-do it, but I don't know if I actually will. I guess it depends how it looks with the skirt to come and how motivated I am.The pleated \"design feature\" of the sleeves turned out fine. As I said, you'd never know it wasn't intentional from the start, so that's fine with me. Much better than fighting a badly drafted sleeve.Close-up of one of the tabs.Overall, I'd recommend this pattern but beware of the sleeves. I made very minimal alterations. No FBA because none was needed. The D cup front pieces were perfect on me, including apex height. I think I'm actually between a D and DD now. The sleeve bicep width was fine, even if the blasted cap didn't fit into the armhole. I also narrowed the shoulders and took a tuck below the neck on the center back piece due to erect posture (like a sway back alteration but higher). That's it for alterations. Oh, one last point of note — watch the front princess seam notches. I'm pretty sure one is in the wrong place. I'll try to remember to double-check it when I write a real review. Now to decide on a skirt pattern from the stash. And also something in denim to wear on Friday. Probably another skirt."},

The main hold-up will be buttons. I don't know yet if I have any suitable since I haven't looked in the bin yet. If not, I'll stop by J's on the way home tomorrow. Actually, I'll stop either way since I need a couple of invisible zippers to tide me over until I remember to place an online order.The print I'm using is a very drapey and slippery and sheer poly picked up at Hancock's a few years ago. I have to sew it very s-l-o-w-l-y because it has a mind of its own, wants to walk all over the place, and tells me that seam allowances are really just suggestions. I've mostly been able to tame it into submission, but I'm up to putting in the sleeves now and they are giving me fits. If anyone ever asks me what my least favorite thing about sewing is, my answer would be setting in sleeves. Or, more correctly, setting in sleeves with too much (read: any) sleeve cap ease. I've vowed that very soon I'm going to revisit some of my sewn blouse patterns and find one that has a great armsyce and sleeves and then use that combo from now on. I know I have at least one or two. I just have to read some past reviews and figure out which ones they are.I knew from my muslin that there was too much ease in these sleeves (like 1.5\"-2\"). But I also cut into the shoulder of the bodice pieces to narrow them and after rewalking the sewing lines, I thought I had corrected it. Apparently not. There is no way this fabric will ease and I don't have the patience for it or any more of this fabric to cut new sleeves. So I just said screw it and pleated the ease evenly on both sides of the shoulder seam. No one besides us will ever be able to tell it wasn't intentional. Heck, they don't even know (yet) at work that I sew. Carolyn asked what I was pairing the finished blouse with and suggested Vogue 1247 (the Rachel skirt). While that pattern is on my radar, I have a few other skirt patterns that I actually own and thus are higher up in the queue, so it will be one of them. The skirt fabric is below. It's kind of a brownish greyish olive something, and I have a TON of it. It will be good to clear some of it from the stash."},

Or, my muslin for Butterick 5678.Moving along from the trainwreck that used to be my blog and email, after running errands much of the day, I finally got up to the sewing room to steal more patterns work on more office clothes. (Sorry, I just couldn't help that one.) This is my muslin for B5678, which is a multi-cup pattern. I wish *every* top pattern was a multi-cup pattern. I measured myself (something I have to do now before each new item, since the measurements keep moving) and I'm definitely now squarely in a 16 for upper chest. I blended from the 16 to the 18 for waist and hip, and that was it. I still have to try out the sleeve, but even if that has to be adjusted, it ain't no big deal. And I need to shorten the back between shoulder and armpit due to super-erect posture, which is always a fit issue with woven button-front shirts, but that's also an easy fix.Since this fits but is actually on the near side of snug, I will sew the sideseams with a little more ease. In the real fabric, of course. Spongebob is cool, but not very work appropriate — even on Fridays.* * * * *A few last words on The Drama. First, thank you for your support. It's been a weird couple of days. And for those of you who are getting flamed on your blogs, I wish that wasn't happening.Second, this person posted a photo which she purports proves copyright infringement. What it proves is that — OMG — we both \"designed\" a perfect 4.5\" x 3.75\" rectangle, as part of a pocket to hold credit cards which, strangely, are all the same size too. You can't see the details in her photo but if you could, it would show that another of my pattern pieces she claims is a duplicate of hers is actually NOT the same size. As I said earlier, she must be using some kind of ruler I've never seen. What her photo shows me is how different these pieces are and that when one is looking through the eyes of a green monster, one sees whatever they wish. I'm also wondering where's the comparison of my other 13 pieces to her other 4? Could it be that they are different? Hmmm.I will leave all the crap comments on yesterday's post because I think they speak volumes about the authors, but now I'm done. Any further anonymous or thinly disguised slanderous comments against me — and especially my family — will be deleted."},

At about 10 AM, the fire alarms started shrieking throughout the building with a loud announcement that a fire had been reported in the building. We all stood around for a couple of minutes wondering if we should heed the alarm, then grabbed our \"important\" stuff (purses, phones, etc.) and headed to the stairwell. Let me tell you, I was very happy I was wearing the comfy shoes! We got to the building lobby and then outside, where we were handed cold bottles of water. At which point it became obvious that it was drill and not an actual emergency. Although it was the first drill where I've had beverage service. ;-)We were all herded across the street and down a block to a waterside park. Even a helicopter swung by to see what was up. Maybe it was part of the drill too?Speaking of shoes (I was), I picked these up last night at Target.Along with a bunch of other stuff that I've already decided I'm not keeping. Target's fit model (or models, who knows how many there really are) is just enough off from me at any size that I'm better off not buying clothing there. I realized that years ago but I thought I'd give it another shot. I brought some stuff home to evaluate different styles, etc. in a more relaxed setting, but I'm not going to settle for \"almost\" when I know I can either buy or make \"great\" so I'll be making some returns on Saturday. The shoes I'm keeping. I wore them bare-legged all day today and while they're not as cushy as the comfy shoes, they were fine and I didn't feel any need to kick them off as soon as I walked in the door. The heels are higher than they seem in this photo — between 3 and 4 inches, which is HUGE for me. I never thought I'd be wearing heels again.Today was fairly uneventful, until the drive home. It had been POURING the last hour at work and the streets downtown were flooded. Like 3 ft. deep in places. Really. It's amazing how quickly rainwater accumulates here. Even after 22 years, I'm still impressed. So, like many other commuters, I did a u-turn from my usual route and slowly made my way through the deluge to different streets. Surprisingly, the detours only added about 15 minutes to my trip. Not too bad.Parting Shot: The Marine is on his way back to Yuma as I type. Thankfully, the impromptu gift I ordered through Amazon got to him in the nick of time. Now he'll have something to read on the flight and over the next six weeks."},

I knew it wouldn't take long and I was right. An hour, tops, and a good chunk of that time was rethreading my machines, changing needles, and winding a bobbin, and keeping half an eye on The Biggest Loser (OMG how does anyone lose 37 lbs in one week?? Speaking of which, I've decided I want a personal trainer. lol).Here's the dress before, with 3/4 sleeves and a plunging, work inappropriate neckline.And after. The sleeves have been chopped, turned, pressed and coverstitched. The neckline was ripped out where it was orginally attached (it's sort of a faux crossover, so there's only very little of actual overlap) and resewn with less plunge. Not bad for a $19 dress from Walmart and a little time in the sewing room. Thread is free, right?Here's how I'm wearing it on Wednesday (or how I *did* wear it, since my tenses are messed up by writing this the night before). Yep, the dress goes with the comfy shoes.

Well yesterday I wore my new brown pencil skirt with the print … oh wait, I have the photo from the other day. This outfit:Plus I added pantyhose and wore closed-toe pumps.And I was HOT, and not in a good way (or in a personal summer way either). I ended up taking off the sweater by afternoon. What was up with THAT?Today I wore the skirt re-make and the print shell I had with it in the last set of pics, plus the short-sleeved brown cascade cardigan and the shoes in the pic above, no PH. My legs were a little chilly by the end of the day but overall I was comfortable. Especially during potty breaks. Is that TMI? ;-) I think someone hit the thermostat yesterday and today it was back to normal again. It was the same people who decided to all get on the roads at the same exact time this morning, adding another 15 minutes to my drive. Can we please have a sign-up sheet for commute times? ;-)I'm SO glad I kept those shoes, though. They are so comfy that I would still be wearing them now if I didn't have to take them off to get my capris on. I've already decided I'm wearing them tomorrow and will now have to build an outfit around them. The skirt re-make didn't even feel tight today. When I was trying it on after finishing it the other night, it was after a filling dinner so I was feeling a little puffy. I wasn't puffy today and it was comfortable. This is good, and bad. Good for obvious reasons. Bad, because it means I may not have as much time with it as I hoped. Catch-22.Last night I sat through 2 hours of video tutorials online because the graphics software I'm using is actually pretty new to me so I want a better idea of what I'm doing. I mean, I know what to do, I just fumble trying to find it in the software. (And while we're on the subject, who the heck at Microsoft decided to completely change the location of EVERYTHING in the latest iteration of Office? OMG I hate it. H.A.T.E.) Two hours of basic and boring tutes was all I could take and I was passed out on top of my covers in front of the tube by 10:30 PM. Tonight I'm going to try to work up the motivation to fix the RTW  dress that needs the neckline crossover raised, instead of watching more tutes. Tsk, tsk. I also want to make the  sleeves short instead of 3/4 so I can wear my short-sleeved putty knit  jacket over it. I'm looking forward to my first paycheck this week, more shopping (yes!) and more sewing on the weekend. Hi, my name is Debbie and I've become a clothes horse."},
{"title": "Skirt Re-Make", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2011", "text": "Here's the Before. The skirt pretty much falls off me. (BTW, this skirt fit in late-May and was too tight before that. I'm shocked.)And the After.I lost some of the \"trumpet-ness\" because I also chopped off 4\" from the length, but I gained a skirt I can (and will) actually wear. I made it a little snug on purpose because I'm not going to be doing this re-make again. When it gets too big to wear again, it will be tossed or donated.The skirt has 6 gores, 3 front and 3 back. Ordinarily, I probably would have removed the waistband and taken in each vertical seam. But this skirt has a side invisible zipper, which is in a pocket …… with button tabs. I didn't want to mess with the zipper or pockets. But I noticed that the center front and center back gores were wider than the side gores and decided that I could just alter the CF and CB pieces and not throw off the sideseams (or pockets) at all. So I unstitched the waistband above those pieces and then ripped out the seams connecting the centers to the sides, and ended up with this:(The dress underneath is still waiting for me to stitch the neckline higher. It will probably take me 15 minutes to do this, but yet there it still sits.) Oh, before any ripping, I had pinned the waistband so that it fit and then marked it with washaway marker. I measured the take-in distance at the front waist and removed that from the CF gore. I did the same for the back.  Then I sewed the gores back in and cut the waistband to fit the new circumference (most of the waistband was still attached to the skirt. I just worked in the areas above the CF and CB gores). I narrowed the front waistband in two places - I was trying for seams above the gores but I missed. I narrowed the back waistband at the CB only.I'm happy with the remake. It took a few hours but I think it was worth it. I couldn't have cut and sewed a new skirt with these features in the same time. Once again, I'm glad I have mad sewing skillz. ;-)Next up will be this skirt. I'm going to cut it down from the waistband and add new, tighter elastic. This one should be a pretty fast re-do. I think I've had a pretty productive weekend. My laundry is done. I made a skirt, remade another, returned unwanted purchases, returned books to the library before they were late, gassed up the car, and tomorrow's lunch is made and in the fridge. Now I've about 2 hours before sleep time so I'm going to watch the rest of the football game and just generally veg."},
{"title": "Drive By", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2011", "text": "Just a quick update before I head to the sewing room and football games on TV.Thanks for all the nice comments and your honest opinions about my shopping binges. (I'm enjoying the binges immensely, BTW!). I returned both dresses. After looking at my photos and in my closet, I decided that I really prefer the separates, and look better in them too — print or solid. I think it's more flattering on me to have three pieces instead of two. It breaks me up in a better way. Plus, I really like to mix/match which is why you see me buying pretty much within the same main color palettes. So, dresses are off my radar at the moment. Which, of course, is subject to change on a whim because I have lots of whims. ;-)I also returned the wild jacket, the target necklace and one other necklace that I decided was just so-so (the wooden-like bead one in the photo from the other day). While returning stuff at Beall's this morning, I also planned to get the mustard twinset. But, alas, it wasn't to be. What I thought was mustard in the store light was really more camel in the fitting room light and it matched my skin too closely. There was another shade, more yellow, but it was *too* yellow for me. I decided that there are more stores to conquer and I could be patient instead of settling. How very grown-up of me, right? hahMy initial assessment of what I have and what I don't tells me that I need more tops that go with my new work pieces. I have LOTS of tops that I like, but not that I'd wear to an office. I also would like a few more skirts and a couple more less structured jackets and/or twinsets. But I don't do \"Chanel\" jackets so I'm not sure how unstructured I really mean. I'll know it when I see it. ;-) I also need a couple more things to wear on Jeans Fridays, that aren't jeans. So, another denim skirt and a maybe a second from a non-blue denim. I think I'm set for this week without exact repeats of what I wore last week, so not quite as much pressure. Which is probably a bad thing as far as output since I slack off without a deadline.This afternoon, I'm actually going to try to rework a RTW skirt I bought 3 years ago and never really wore. It will mean ripping it apart entirely, but the fabric is so nice that I don't want to just toss it without trying to do something first. And during the week, I'll work on a couple of knit tops including a boring but needed ivory shell."},
{"title": "New Skirt and the Rest of the Loot", "date": "Saturday, September 17, 2011", "text": "How come I could sew this same skirt in an hour the other night and it took me all freakin' day today? Yeah, I do work best (at least more efficiently) under pressure. I always have.This is the finished skirt, along with the blouse and a brown belt I bought at Beall's last night and another sweater I bought at Stein Mart earlier in the week. I'm keeping everything. Oh, I'm also wearing the shoes I showed earlier. I'm keeping these too — they are just too comfortable NOT to keep. While I'm wearing them with all the rest of the outfits below, I'm sure I wouldn't really do that. I lined this skirt. Or rather, I partially lined it. I wasn't up for fiddling with a lining around a vent today. I also cut the lining on the cross-grain and used the selvage as the hem. I'm running out of invisible zippers. This one is burgundy. One more lining shortcut was to overlap the front pieces on the princess seams, mark (and sew) darts instead, and cut the front as one piece. The lining is machine-stitched to the zipper tape. So with all these shortcuts, it's not like the lining took that much extra time today. It was maybe a 20-minute addition altogether. I guess I just needed to goof off all day, catch up on some blogs, and check my email 300 times around sewing a simple skirt.It's becoming obvious that this is going to be the year of the sweater/cardi for me. Here's a close-up of the raw-edged trim. You can also see that I used a snap closure for the skirt. Nice and quick!Same skirt, brown twinset from Beall's. I'm keeping this too. The belt I already had. Beall's has other colors in \"my\" shades that I'm tempted to go back and buy, especially the mustard-colored set. It's a tiny bit snug but it's my week to retain water IYKWIM and the next size up was too big. It doesn't look too tight in this pic so I'm OK with it. What do you think about mixing browns like this? I was just trying things on without changing the skirt, but I think I kinda like the look. Too bad I don't have some leopard print shoes. Yet. Hahaha!The brown cascade cardi I showed in my last post.The bottom band looks darker here but all parts are really the same. The directional nap is catching the light differently. Another keeper, I think. (How many brown sweaters do I need? Or teal/turquoise? Hah!) I may trace off a pattern from this since I like the shape and that it's not too \"cascade-y.\" Wild jacket (knit) from Stein Mart. Not keeping this. I like it, but not enough to keep it for what it cost. And it doesn't really go with much of what I have. A dress from Beall's. I'm not sure on this one. It looks OK to me, but will I really be comfortable with the sleevelessness and being able to see down to my navel from the cowl? Well, it seems like I can. I always wondered if people taller than me can see what I see when I look down? Note to self: Buy more Hollywood tape with a Joann's coupon.Yes, I can cover it with a cardi like this, but then what's the point of keeping it only to cover it up? But by itself, it does make me look thinner, doesn't it? Maybe I'll keep it for going out. What do YOU think? Dress from Stein Mart. Not keeping. It's really a little too tight around the bust and I would have to hem it. I'm sure I can find or make something else that I like better, even though this isn't terrible. The necklace on the right? It can't go back fast enough. I feel (and look!) like I'm wearing a target. But it was worth a try if only to find out it's not me.And for the heck of it, here's a shot of 3/4 of my closet. The box on the floor at the back is my too-big cast-offs. Much of the stuff still hanging will probably find its way into that box, especially 99% of the pants hanging lower left. I don't wear ANY of them right now. The pants I do wear are out of the range of this shot. My love for prints is quite obvious, no? ;-)I'm going to sew some more tomorrow and watch football, after I decide tonight exactly what it is I'll be sewing. I have too many ideas/possibilities which is making it hard to narrow it down. It's definitely so cool to be dressing up again."},

Don't get me wrong — I'm tired and thankful it's Friday and the weekend, but I'm looking forward to going back on Monday. Hopefully, in a new outfit. ;-) Speaking of which, after shopping (details below), I did a quick straightening up of the cutting table and then cut out another Burda skirt. I decided not to press my luck on sewing tonight lest I turn an easy skirt into a skirt from hell so that's the extent of my Friday Night Sew-In but at least I spent some time in the sewing room. I'll sew it in the morning. In case you can't tell, it's brown. I used the fabric for a jacket 3 years ago and the skirt was cut from the scraps. Less than one full yard. That's another bonus about losing weight — my clothes use less fabric. The jacket is too big now so I won't have a suit. But I always liked the fabric so I'm glad to get a skirt from it. When talking about the floral twill skirt I just made, I forgot to mention that I added a kick pleat to the center back seam, so I could walk. I'm doing that again here. I just eyeballed the addition I taped on.Now for the fun stuff. I had to run to Walmart tonight, a phrase I think I say at least 3 times a week. I decided to go to the smaller one since it's next door to Beall's (a Florida department store) to see what they had to offer. I took some cell phone pics, so the quality isn't too great and I'm sporting some mighty goofy looking expressions. lolBut before I get to those, here's the shoes I bought at Stein Mart the other night. These are black, but I lightened the photo so you could see some details. I have a white pair very similar to these which I like a lot, so I was happy to find their sisters in black. I wore these today for \"jeans\" day with my denim skirt and a Sunshine Top that has black in the print. I wore them all day and then shopped until 9 PM and my feet felt great. Definitely a winner.Next up are these bone/nude sandals. I'm still on the fence. I like them because they are VERY comfortable and neutral, but they are also on the verge of fuddy-duddy. What do you think? But some days I don't care and am only interested in the comfort factor, so I'll probably keep them. They were on sale for less than $30 so it's not like they are a huge investement.Necklaces from both Stein Mart and Beall's. I could've spent $500 on \"cheap\" jewelry at either store. They both have a great selection and very reasonably priced.I think this one is my favorite. I love all the colors and the dangly bits.What looks red is really coral, so that's my color too.OK, goofy picture time. I did not buy this. It makes me look like a tree trunk. But I liked the interesting cowl neckline. It's double-layer and very deep cowl plunge.Here I am with my hand down inside the cowl pulling it outward. Hard to tell, though. I didn't buy this combo either. This is a Petite size and the skirt was still too long on me. The print looks black in these pics but it's really both brown and black and the bottom edges of both the top and the skirt are dark brown.I hiked the skirt up to my bra, hiked the top so that the \"stripe\" hit me under the bust and then threw on a short-sleeve brown cascading cardi. This actually looks pretty good now. I bought the cardigan. Yes, I could sew one but I can't knit and this one has nice ribbed edges that I can never duplicate with a sewing machine. I think this will get a lot of wear since it's short-sleeved and brown.This is a purple sweater. It looks horrible and felt very suffocating. I didn't buy it. I was also wearing it over my Sunshine Top because I was too lazy to get completely undressed again. And for a good laugh — Hoochie Mama Debbie. NOT office appropriate. Didn't buy this one either.I don't have pics yet of what I did buy, but except for one blouse, it's pretty boring. The cardi you saw above, plus another brown cardi/twinset, waist-length. I bought a dress too, but I'm just thinking about it and not sure I'm keeping it. Same for a couple more of the Stein Mart pieces. I'll try them all on again over the weekend and make some decisions. Plus I'll get a better sewing plan in the works, including maybe reworking Vogue 1250 and using a print. The black \"muslin\" I made earlier is way too big in the back now so I'm going to need to remove the extra width I added. I'm tempted to re-trace it and sew it as-is.Lot of grand plans. I'll see what actually comes to be after the skirt is done.Oh, and one more comment about pantyhose. I didn't wear any today with my denim skirt, of course, and OMG I was FREEZING by the end of the day. So cold that I turned off my A/C in the car for the ride home. And the outside temp was in the mid-90s if that tells you anything. I keep the house about 77-78. I think the office is 74-ish. It makes a huge difference to my bare legs. The girl — OK, she's in her 30s (I know because I overheard her telling her birthdate to someone and I felt old) so she's a WOMAN but she looks younger — who sits near me keeps a shawl at her desk, which is almost like a blanket.

The stretch factor meant I had to take deeper side seams than I did for my non-stretch denim skirt but that's the only change I made, and it was so easy that it's hardly worth mentioning. I'll definitely be making another one of these skirts very soon.This is me 5 minutes after the pic above, and after I had already disconnected the camera from the tripod.

First, it fits. Second, it goes together very fast. I started cutting/sewing later than I planned, about 10 PM. At 11:30 PM I was pressing up the hem. I now have a new skirt to wear tomorrow, completely different from today's all-solids outfit. The jacket is from my Stein Mart trip. I love it. It's green. It's puckery. And it was cheap — marked down to $24.Today was Day 3 at the office and I finally felt truly productive with some real projects to handle which kept me busy all day. I'd much rather be super-busy than slow. Early feedback on the graphics project I started this afternoon was positive, which makes me feel good. I'll finish that up tomorrow morning and make at least two people happy — the attorney who requested it and the marketing person who handed it off to me because it was over her head. (She's not a graphics person.) I also learned that my department has bi-weekly Friday lunch meetings, which are catered. So that's two days this week I'm not supplying my lunch. Nice! After work I had a nail appointment, then came home to make a late dinner and sew a skirt. I'm looking forward to vegging in front of the TV tomorrow night. Friday is jeans day and I'll be wearing my denim skirt. No one will know that it's really the same exact skirt I'm wearing tomorrow. ;-)Thanks for all the tips on bare legs and shoes. I did wear PH today and I was actually comfortable. As I said yesterday, I start to feel a little chilly in the office in the afternoon and bare legs aren't warm. I'll continue to alternate off/on, depending on the outside temps and humidity level. Right now, the air is really dry (for FL) and it doesn't feel so oppressive to be wearing hose. Plus, I'm not outside at all. I get in my car and drive to the parking garage and then I'm in the elevator to the office. My feet actually felt pretty good at the end of the day today. They are slowly getting used to real shoes. That's probably the last word on my PH habits for a while. Aren't you glad? ;-)Have I mentioned that I'm becoming a coffee addict after just 3 days? The office provides both fresh Starbucks coffee and the flavored single-serving Krueger cups all day long. Mocha Almond Fudge … yum!! Plus they provide plates, cups, napkins and utensils so I never have to worry about bringing my own from home. I tell ya — I love this place!"},

My lunch was still in the office fridge this morning so I was all set. I sat at my desk and continued to read Barack Obama's book, which got put on hold in the whirlwind of the last couple of weeks. (Meredith, I like it a lot so far, especially since the life experiences and observances of a bi-racial man are so far outside my own. BO has always been intelligent and well-spoken so I'm not surprised that I like his writing too.)I had to rush out to the grocery store after getting home tonight so I didn't get any pics of today's outfit, but this is what I wore, with an ivory cami under the blouse. The skirt is a brown knit Walmart special. I made the blouse a few years ago. It's a Vogue-something — Carolyn, you know it, I think. I left the pantyhose at home today.After dinner it was up to the sewing room to do SOMETHING so I would have an outfit to wear tomorrow. The nearly-finished Simplicity skirt won out for speed of completion. I added the hem facing, pinked the raw edge and then Steam-A-Seam'ed it into place. I was not about to hand-sew any hems and I knew I would hate the way a machined blind hem would turn out. So, SAS it was. Bonus that it was extremely fast. The whole hemming project took less than 30 minutes.I'm pairing the skirt with this teal rayon twinset and necklace I bought at Stein Mart last night. It's very unlike me to wear all solids together, but I'm desperate here. I think it works, but I'll definitely be sucking in the tummy all day. lol But on the other hand, I sit at a desk so my gut will be mostly hidden anyway.I think I will have to bring out the pantyhose again. My feet are not used to being in closed-toe heels for hours and hours and going barefoot in the shoes gets somewhat uncomfortable by the end of the day. My feet need to \"toughen up\" a little more, so I will probably rotate PH on/off. Plus, I was actually COLD in the office today and was kind of missing something on my legs.  This is the skirt graveyard pile. After further consideration, I don't think I have it in me to alter them and I'm not really loving them anymore. I think I'd rather make some new skirts that are more fitted. I'd buy some if I could find what I wanted. But as stitchers, you KNOW how that goes. I'm actually going to try to make a new skirt tomorrow night to go with a cool jacket I got last night. I'm going to use a pattern that I know fits me right now — the Burda I used years ago to make the denim skirt that fits me again and I've been wearing a lot. It's also a very easy pattern, so I may not be overreaching.I'm not dragging tonight since I got a good night's sleep last night, but I will be tomorrow if I don't end this here and say Good Night!Oh, one last funny thought. Can you believe I was actually contemplating making myself a nice lunch bag? Hah! I can't wear a lunch bag. I bought one tonight for $5."},
{"title": "Working Girl", "date": "Monday, September 12, 2011", "text": "Well I made it and I'm ready for more. Well, after a good night's sleep first.I'm working in the tallest building in this photo, and the view out my window is what you see here — the river. I really like everything a lot so far — the people, the office, the job, the pay. My first day went very well. This morning I signed a bunch of papers acknowledging policies, etc., got my official key card which gets me in and out of the office, ladies room, and parking garage. Then I had another tour and a re-introduction to co-workers. Next, it was a one-on-one with an IT guy for an overview of the firm's email, file management, and various other internal systems. That went fast, since it's pretty easy stuff for a computer geek like me. ;-) I'm definitely upgrading my cell or buying an iPad with one of my first paychecks. I want to read blogs during my lunch break. lol Speaking of lunch … I didn't have to worry about forgetting it since I was taken out to a nice restaurant a few blocks away. (I had yummy mushroom quiche and mixed greens salad). The lunch I brought today will be waiting in the office fridge for me tomorrow. Hopefully, no one works late and gets hungry. But if for some reason it disappears, there's a nice little cafe on the second floor of the building and a big newsstand in the lobby. (Both great for rainy days!)I made it home from work in less than 30 minutes and after giving the pups a big hello, I raced upstairs to get rid of the pantyhose and closed-toe shoes. I can't remember the last time I wore PH *all day.* I haven't decided if I'm wearing any tomorrow. The other females in the office are both bare-legged and hosed. Ha ha, not quite what I meant. It's not that the PH were uncomfortable, they are just a huge PITA on restroom trips. (TMI?)After changing, going through email, and calling my mom, I went out to Stein Mart and promptly spent $300. OMG. I am NOT keeping everything, especially since none of it is bottom pieces. But I did get some necklaces and shoes along with some other cute stuff. Maybe I'll have enough energy for a photo shoot tomorrow night.I just spent an hour trying on new and old stuff to come up with SOMETHING to wear tomorrow. During the process, I decided that tomorrow night I need to spend time in the sewing room ripping apart and taking in some too-big skirts. Even if I can only do one a night, that will still put me ahead.At this point (11:15 PM), I'm dragging. I went to bed on time last night and then just laid there wide-awake for 90 minutes. Arghhh. My mind would not shut down. While I technically got the absolute minimum amount of sleep I need to function, I know that's not going to be enough tonight. But I don't think I'll have a problem dozing off right away.And with that, I bid you Good Night!"},
{"title": "Simplicity 2451 and 2452 Pics", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "text": "Well, I won't be wearing either piece this week. Looks like I have some shopping in my future. ;-) (Carolyn, I was already planning to hit Stein Mart tomorrow after work.) I'm still not camera-ready so you get to see me with day-old hair and no make-up. Ugh. The skirt is fine, but it's 5 lbs too tight. Or I am. ;-) I expect it will fit in a couple of weeks since I'm still losing about 2-3 lbs per week. I haven't hemmed it yet because I think I'm going to need a facing or it will be too short for my preferences. And that's after adding 3 inches to the length. I just ran out of mojo tonight to deal with a hem facing.While the pockets are pulling in the front, the tightness is more evident to me in the back. I could actually live with the pockets, but the waist in the back is scrunching.The pattern has a couple of oddities. I'm going to try to write a real review next weekend, but we'll see how that goes. First, the waist yokes have *got* to be sized wrong. I added width to both the front and back of the skirt, and added corresponding width to the yokes. But I had to remove ALL the additions to the yokes, right back to the original pattern, for them to fit onto the skirt sections as the instruction show. How can that be? Sumthin' ain't right.Next, the pockets are way too narrow. I suppose it's probably good so I don't jam my hands into them, but I *want* to jam my hands into them. The pockets were one of the main reasons I chose this skirt, since the jacket doesn't have any. Also, if you understitch the pocket where it attaches to the skirt as instructed, and I did, then the pocket bag piece doesn't line up. In other words, there is no allowance for turn of cloth or slightly pressing the joining seam to the back. Finally, lapped zipper. Ugh. And hand-stitching the waist facing to the zipper and the yoke. Eff that. I changed the zip to an invisible, except the best color I had was black so it could probably be a little more invisible. I also overlocked the raw edge of the facing and stitched in the ditch from the front to catch and hold it down, and I machine-stitched the facing around the zipper (RS together) and turned it so it was all clean-finished and the hand-stitching was eliminated. Cuz you know how I feel about hand-stitching. All in all, the zipper turned out fine. I also don't like hook/eyes, so they aren't there. Next time, I'll move the zip up more. But I will NEVER see this so I don't really care. ;-)Here's the whole suit. I promise the bottom edges of the jacket are really even. I'm just standing with one hip out and one shoulder up.Now I need to go make some chicken salad for my lunch, fold some laundry, and head to bed. Thanks for all your good wishes! I'm sure I'll be fine. Tomorrow will probably just be a lot of orientation and forgetting everyone's name.The jacket is done. It's just OK. It's not better than RTW, but I guess it's about equal. I'm sure time in the Magic Wardrobe will help too. I made a second muslin and decided the jacket needed a horizontal tuck, as shown below. This really screwed up the bust curve in the front side panel and I pretty much just winged it. I ended up winging it too much and it's a little tight in the bust or armhole or something. It's not horrible, but not as good as I could have done.  The fabric is also a contributing factor to my non-love for this jacket. I love the color and how it feels, but it's polyester and so the seams are pucker-city and the hems are very obvious. It will be fine when I'm wearing it and in motion, but I think it looks terrible and boxy on Zillie compared to on me. At least I hope so. But I'm not camera-ready so it's Zillie you get. I was going to use the pleated lower back piece, but once I had it cut out and was working the pleats, it was very clear that it would be an ugly puffy thing in this polyester. So I used the non-pleated piece instead. Much better.I'm not giving up on the pattern, though, because I do really like the style. I just need to improve the fit. And once the actual sewing starts on it, it goes together really fast. It's not lined and with this view there is no collar to attach/finish. I think I will be on the lookout for some tropical weight wool to try it again. Moving on … I've already muslined this skirt pattern and have it cut out from the same fabric as the jacket. I expect I'll finish it in the next hour or so. Alterations were very minimal. I added width and then removed most of it. I added length. That's it.If I finish the skirt and still have energy, I may do a few mirror shots and post them later. I'm not wearing either piece tomorrow, but I'm sure they will make an appearance later in the week since I don't have a lot of office-wear choices right now. I think I'll be sewing every night after I get home. I hope I'm not too exhausted, because I NEED clothes. It's hard to believe I'll be in the work grind tomorrow. I haven't actually gone to work in someone else's office on a daily basis in over 22 years. Yikes. I hope I don't forget my lunch. lol"},
{"title": "Simplicity 2452: Two and a Half Days Left", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2011", "text": "There was no sewing yesterday. Tyler and I dealt with the insurance company, emptying the car, supervising the tow truck, and arranging a rental car. I never did get a nap, and fell into bed around 7:30 PM and slept straight through to 2 AM, at which point I got up and grumbled because I missed the opening NFL game. Then I was awake for a little while and watched some of Project Runway, until I fell asleep again. So, all in all, yesterday was a wash.Tyler's doing well, spirit-wise. Of course he's not happy that his car is wrecked but he's not as bummed out as I thought he'd be, which in turn makes me feel a lot better too. He's already looking forward to the next car. lol But that won't happen for a while since this one has to be sorted out first and he's returning to Yuma AZ in a couple of weeks for a 6-week stint. He'll also be promoted to Lance Corporal while he's in AZ, which means a little more money toward the next car payment. By the time he's back from AZ, we'll be thinking about Thanksgiving so maybe I can drive north again and do another round of car shopping and turkey-eating with him. ;-)This morning I was up early after all that sleep and sewed together the muslin. Below is Round 1 of alterations. I started with a 16 and then did a morph between Fast Fit for full tummy and another book I can't remember at the moment for the FBA (which is essentially the \"seam allowance method,\" if you're familiar with that). As you can see, there was a need for Round 2 of alterations. The full tummy adjustment gave me plenty of room across waist and hips, but there was not nearly enough room for the bust. At that point, I had to take a break for a haircut appointment, picking up the rental car, and a lunch date with my sons. It's very hard to eat low-carb in a Mexican restaurant but I did very well. No tortillas, rice, beans, or churros for me. ;-) When we returned from lunch, I went back to almost the starting point of the front side panel. I removed the full tummy adjustment because now I was going to use the Palmer/Pletsch princess seam FBA and that would add width all the way down. I did keep the seam allowance \"bump out\" at bust level.  Here's my re-altered (and completely mangled) pattern pieces. At this point, I think there's more tape than tissue. As soon as I get off the computer, I'm going to re-cut these pieces and sew them onto the remains of the first muslin and evaluate. If it's OK, then I'll add the sleeves and see where I am. Fingers crossed that I can cut the real fabric tonight, and maybe even start sewing it. Tyler is leaving tomorrow around 6 AM. I'll be up to see him off and then I'll be spending all day in the sewing room, hopefully emerging with a finished new jacket."},

I haven't been able to reach her yet, but I'm pretty sure this means I got the job (hoping I didn't just jinx myself!). If I did, I think I would start on Monday. And if so, my work wardrobe needs some SERIOUS help, and FAST!If I can make — and most importantly, FIT — a jacket and skirt from this fabric before Monday, I will have added at least 3 more outfits to my choices.Except, I'm undecided about WHICH jacket to make. I bought the pattern for View B/C. But, I'm now thinking with the gathers in front, that's not going to look so great unbuttoned since I will fit this to be tight right now, which means wearing it open. So, I'm contemplating two choices: One, make View A (the other jacket) or make View B/C with long sleeves and omit the gathers in front. While I *lurve* the gathered front, I think I'm leaning toward the other jacket for now. I'll worry about a skirt pattern soon enough."},

But I do have feet in real life. ;-) I also need a haircut; I'm getting kind of shaggy.This is the pattern, McCall's 6078. I started this top about a month and a half ago, and then set it aside. I originally bought the wrong size range and did something with blending my TNT Ottobre tee to size it up. I can't remember exactly what I did or I would show you. But  I wasn't thrilled with the results which is why I set it aside. Weeks went by and I tried it on again and decided I could salvage it. I've also since bought the pattern in the correct size range, thinking it will be a good basic, and I will try it again because this white one could fit better in the shoulders. I like the way it looks under the jacket, but I'm not so thrilled with it alone. The big expanse of white makes me look bigger. Let this be a lesson in clothing camouflage. Although I love my white refashioned skirt from yesterday on me. Go figure.I made the sleeveless view B (shown in the red drawing), but added short sleeves. Again, from my TNT Ottobre.

This pic below shows it belted.I'm wearing the Walmart skirt I showed a few days ago, and which I had planned to wear the putty jacket with (except it wasn't a jacket yet at that point).

Plus, I've really been missing this skirt in my casual wardrobe rotation, so it was time to refashion the refashion. In other words, chop it up again and make it smaller.This time I had to remove the back pockets and flaps because I was taking it in so much that I would've ended up sewing through the middle of them otherwise, as you can see by the pocket \"ghosts\" below. Here's the pockets sewn back on. Hopefully the \"ghosts\" will disappear after a couple of runs through the laundry and wearing. But, really, I don't care. I'm not looking back there and most tops I'm going to wear will cover up most of it anyway.Here's the \"new\" skirt from the front:And from the back. I also left a back slit this time, which should make getting in/out of cars a LOT easier. I made it on the snug side because it's stretch denim and will stretch, and I'm shrinking. This will be the last time I can re-make this skirt, since the sideseams are starting to slide to the back now.

Guess which was more fun? Sorry about the headless shot, but I'm looking like I'm home alone for the weekend, which I am. And I vacuumed. ;-)I purposely took in the sideseams a scootch more than what I pinched on the other jacket yesterday so this one would be a little tight, with the plan that I will shrink into it fairly soon. Until then, I'll just wear it open or break out the Spanx. Speaking of which (wearing open, not Spanx) — I had such a brain fade earlier. I thought I was done with the jacket after sewing the hems. Until I realized that I hadn't even thought about buttons and buttonholes. Oops. My sewing mind must still be on purses.One of the pairings for the jacket will be with this dress. I went to one of the other Walmarts in town (we have 3, and that doesn't even include the Walmarts 10-20 miles away) and found a few more things in my colors. It's hard to see in this pic, but the dress is a crossover bodice (which will have to be re-tacked higher), with soft diagonal gathers and a flounce where the gathers meet the side. I wish there was a pattern for this one, and no! I'm not going to cut it apart. But I thought about it. The dress really has 3/4 sleeves, but I'm going to cut them off and hem them to short since I live in perpetual summer, both locale and personal. ;-)It's time for me to do some surgery on Zillie because my clothes don't hang on her even close to how they hang on me.

I hope it's because of the long weekend, but who knows. Whatever happens, happens. And speaking of the long weekend — I'm alone for the next couple of days. Wooo! First time in a very long time and I *need* it. Tyler is at my stepson Michael's mother's house (my soon-to-be-ex's first ex! Hah!) in Jacksonville FL and the STB-ex, Alex and one of Alex's friends drove up there today (in MY car but that's another story). Michael, who lived his teenage and beyond years in Jax but now lives in Asheville NC, is turning 30 (no freakin' way!) on the 6th and is having a big party tonight to celebrate. All of the Cook men will be staying at the 1st ex's house. Isn't that hilarious? OK, I have a warped sense of humor and know both parties, so it's hilarious to me. On Sunday, they will return and Tyler will be here for a week on leave. Since I'm without an operable vehicle, I'm spending my time in the sewing room. As I mentioned last post, I want to make something jacket-ish from the putty-colored ponte-ish knit. Too many ish-es?. Hah. I've decided what I'm making. Remember this jacket I made a few months ago (and hated because of the pattern placement), and which I've never worn … Well, I still love the cut of it — i.e., the lapel width/curve and vee depth is perfect on me, the length is great, etc. (pairing it with this dress for a photo not so great!), but it's now way too big. So, I decided to experiment. I pinned out an inch on both side seams up through the sleeves (for a total of 4\") and tried it on. Pretty much perfect. The pink lines on the pic below are me inside the pinning. The pattern alteration for that is easy:  Trace the pattern to keep things neater and then just lop off 1-1/8\" from each side seam, front and back, using my rotary cutter guide arm. (Love that thing!)I'm also going to do something I've never done before — a SMALL bust adjustment. But only kinda-sorta. I did an FBA on the original tissue before my first make back in 2008. But I think now it's too much, so I need to reduce it. Which means an SBA instead of an FBA. That cracks me up. As a refresher, this is the pattern, Butterick 4818. Sorry, it's OOP. (Insert rant on Connie Crawford taking over Butterick's whole plus line.)Hopefully the next post will show a finished putty jacket."},

Every single bit of the cammie fabric came from the blouse that was sent, and almost every single bit of the blouse was used. I couldn't \"cheat\" and use my flat MARPAT fabric for straps since the cammie I received was pretty faded and my new fabric is … well … new. I like the way pieced straps look because you get characteristics of the original cammie that way, but they take at least twice as long to make and allowimg room for them on the cammie blouse makes the pattern layout more of a brain twister. This style for a cammie purse is definitely the most labor-intensive. On the others, I learned my lesson and made them simpler from the get-go.I had a major brain fade yesterday when inserting the zipper. It's done 100% by machine, because ya'll KNOW how I hate hand sewing (especially in purses). It has been many months since I made my same-pattern purse. Do you think I took notes on how I did the zipper? If you guessed Hell No!, you would be correct. This means I made a couple of wrong passes with the machine which had to be frogged. But once I walked away for a while, the solution came to me. And it was so obvious (after the fact), that it was almost irritating. lol But I did take notes this time, in case I actually do make up an official pattern for this.This one is almost exactly like mine, except for the last names, lining, and better interfacings. I used fusible fleece on all the outside pieces, except the two strips right next to the zipper. For those, I used Decor Bond which made them sturdy but not too bulky next to the zipper teeth. I trimmed the fleece so it would be caught in the seams, but only by a hair. This worked great to keep seam allowance bulk down. I also used the fusible fleece in the straps, except I did not apply it at the ends, again to keep the bulk down where I needed to fold the strap over and attach it to the purse or itself, around the hardware.The main features I couldn't find in any commercial pattern (big guys or little ones) was (1) the center divider pocket in the middle, which is not as wide as the outside so it \"cinches in\" the sides of the purse, and (2) the outside zipper strips which are curved and part of the purse body, and sewn entirely by machine, of course. With the improved interfacing, this purse is more rigid so hopefully the feet will actually do something on this one. ;-)* * * * *Moving ahead to my wardrobe dilemma …I'm not complaining on the reason, but with the continuing weight loss I really do not have much to wear to an office. I have my 2 interview suits and a couple of dresses, none of which mixes/matches. Everything else is too big. Yes, I can sew some things but (1) not enough in a short time and (2) I really don't want to, because it's not going to fit for very long and I need to re-do pretty much all of my pattern alterations. TNTs are a thing of the past for now. Wah!I think I will make one or two Vogue 1250s in a print, and one or two unstructured jacket/cardi somethings to coordinate with them, plus a simple and plain top or two. I think I can do at least 3 out of those in a week. (The \"week\" deadline is if I get the job — I still don't know yet.) In the meantime, I will need to shop so I can fill in with RTW. But I am going to limit myself to really inexpensive stuff, since again, I don't plan on it fitting for long so I don't want to waste money needlessly.Let's start the mega-photo section of this post, shall we? Pardon goofy eyes, dorky smiles, bare feet, mismatched prints, blurry focus and dirty mirrors. I was going for quantity and basic shapes. Also pardon my rambling thoughts. None of this is very organized.After my interview yesterday, I came home and changed and  headed out to Walmart for some household stuff and while there, I browsed the clothes and pulled some to try on. I had lots of success fit-wise, and in sizes that pleased me immensely. Yay! But everything is black, black, black. Or gray. Boo! I hate those colors on me. Especially near my face. This is in the Walmart fitting room, taken with my cell phone. Even crappier quality than usual, which I would've thought wasn't possible. ;-) The basic shapes are good (I have a similar cowl pattern, which I'll get to below), although the top is tucked up because it's too long. But that solid black is just not me. And even if YOU think it's OK, I don't, so I'll never wear it. Ask my mother. I'm stubborn that way and have been since I was 4 or 5 and she wanted  me to wear stuff I hated. Guess who won? ;-)This one is too boobalicious, I know. But it was the ONLY top in earth tones, except it was a size 10!! I tried it on just for kicks, though, and, amazingly, it's actually not too far off from fitting. There is an underbust seam, which hits me under the bust. What a concept. This means either I'm loosing boob or the Walmart \"designers\" (I *had* to put quotes on that idea) use more ease these days. Probably both.I didn't buy anything in the pics above, but I did buy this skirt below which is the same style as the skirt above but what looks black is actually brown. Yay for brown! The top is my unfinished McCall's some-number. It's way too big, but I can take it in, hem it, and add some sleeves easily. Fixing it up is on the agenda. But white is too stark next to the skirt, so I want to make a short-sleeved jacket/cardi-something from this putty-colored doubleknit I've got slung over my shoulder.Here are the three fabrics together. The skirt print has a putty color in it which is more evident IRL vs. the pics.I also bought these pants. In two sizes, because I couldn't decide which one would be better.  The 18 fits but is a little loose. The 16 fits but is a little tight,  but only about 5-6 lbs worth of tight — which should be gone in a couple  weeks. I decided I'd do some mirror shots to help me decide because  while I wouldn't care about keeping both money-wise, since they're only  $20 a pair, I really don't want to hem the same pants twice in month, you  know?? And I don't love black anyway. I've pretty much decided I'm keeping the 16s.Those are the 18s above, with a belt that is riding way too high. It's hard to  hold a too-big shirt in at the back and balance a belt and camera  shutter button all at the same time, while trying to smile pretty and not blink. Imagine the top fitting better, and  with sleeves.In other words, NOT like this. lolStill wearing the 18s here, with a shirt I thought might work. Until I tried it on. Don't let this shot fool you …… it really looks like this:More grabbing of excess fabric in the back, just to get an idea of shape. I *know* the jacket doesn't go with the pants. This one kind of bums me out. I loved this jacket and the fabric even more. Maybe one day I can alter it down. For now, it's unwearable.This pic below is the pants in 16 and a top that fits better, although it's really too low and my bra straps show if I don't pull it up like I did for this pic. Maybe some Hollywood Stay Tape will let me get by for a while longer.And here's something that hasn't been seen in public in YEARS — a side-view pic of me. As you can see, the belly is still there in plenty of form. So is my butt. ;-) But it sure is nice to see a lot less of both.Finally, what I'm really wearing today. Which I can also wear to an office if I trade flip-flops for real shoes. I want to make a short-sleeved brown cardi to finish this look and others. I will take in the sideseams and CB seam of this dress (and its sister) for as long as I can. It kind of needs it again now. Sigh.I'm hoping to hit up the cheapos: Target, Kohl's, JC Penney and Sears (some or all, depends on what I find) this weekend. It's a scary thought, though, because I'm now fitting into so many more things and I may have a hard time leaving things at the store. On second thought, I should probably skip the stores and chain myself to my sewing machine. Unfortunately, one of the benefits/curses of losing weight is that I actually like shopping for clothes again.Parting Shot:\"Planking,\" on a tree knocked down by Hurricane Irene.

In other Giveaway news, Mareen — I've also FINALLY sent your Fabric.com giftie on its way via email so check your inbox!* * * * *I made it to Joann's for thread and made some progress on the cammie purse yesterday, but not as much as I wanted. So finishing that is on the sewing agenda for today. This style is the same one I drew up a pattern (and made numerous muslins) for the cammie purse I carry. Except this one is turning out SO MUCH NICER due to better interfacing choices. I can see that I'm going to have to re-make mine, and possibly turn this pattern into another for my Etsy shop cuz if there had been a pattern like this one when I was making that first cammie purse, I would've bought it. So I'm thinking maybe others are also looking for a similar bag style (sans cammie, probably!).* * * * *And in interview news — I had my second interview this morning. I left 90 minutes beforehand to allow myself some traffic congestion, and I was there in 20-25 minutes. So I sat in my car for a while and read a book I brought along (Dreams of My Father by Barrack Obama). This firm has two locations, which are not really close to each other and on opposite sides of Tampa. Last week's interview was at the main office. Today's was at the \"satellite.\" Both are gorgeous spaces, and the one where I'd actually be working is where I was today, with the shorter commute. I got there at 8:51 AM (parking garage stamped the time on my ticket!), so I was driving pretty much during actual peak time. It went well. After the initial \"sit-down,\" I was walked around and introduced to everyone (and you bet I was noticing what they were wearing - kind of everything from business casual to full business). I take that as a good sign. I also take it as a sign that I may have some serious shopping and/or sewing to do. * * * * *And in other completely unrelated-to-anything news — I switched my car insurance from my current and long-time provider and will now save over $200 per year with the new one.

{"title": "Sunday Miscellany", "date": "Sunday, August 28, 2011", "text": "First, thank you all for the wonderful response to my wallet pattern! I can't wait to see what everyone makes — you *will* be sharing, right??(In case you missed yesterday's post, the wallet pattern you've been watching come together over the last few weeks is now available in my Etsy shop, and the link is at the top of the left sidebar.) Speaking of wallets … one of my testers, Beth, has blogged about her testing experience here. I think hers turned out very cute! (Especially for a test and a beginner's first-go at wallets!) Love the purple check! She did run into a snag with fabric choice which you can read about on her blog and which was my fault since the first version of the instructions wasn't specific about recommended fabrics and the prototypes I was showing on my blog used cammie fabric. (But, surprisingly, cammie fabric actually isn't thick at all.) The instructions are updated and I have a feeling Beth will be making another since they're quite addicting.Here's what my finished and stuffed-full wallet looks like from the side:In other cammie news … I've been working on a Marine cammie purse order and was all set to finish it tonight, except — I ran out of thread. And Joann's closed an hour ago. ARgghhhhh! This one is a \"special order\" from a man who is buying it as a surprise for his wife. (Hmmm ... I hope she doesn't read my blog!!) They have one son who is an active Marine and another in boot camp. He sent a \"retired\" cammie blouse from the active Marine and since both were baseball players, a lining fabric to reflect that was requested. I think this fabric is perfect — baseball and patriotic! It's killing me that I can't finish it tonight, but I guess I'll \"sacrifice\" and catch up with my DVR and just chill. In the meantime, here's a pic of what I'm wearing today. Remember when I mentioned a while back that I was buying the Walmart capris in my current size and then a pair in one and two sizes smaller? As of yesterday, I'm in the one size smaller now. My top  is belted and bloused because it's also really too big. Without as much tummy sticking out, it hangs way too far down. Yes, I should re-hem it. And maybe I will. ;-)Parting Shot: The Marines at Cherry Point survived Hurricane Irene without major incident. They lost power for a while and Tyler reported a soaked and dirty area rug in his 3rd floor barracks room. Yes, *third* floor, but apparently the strong winds pushed the rain under the door and they had a mini flood. But far worse than all of that was this \"horrible experience\" …\r\rClick to enlarge"},

The interview yesterday went very well.

Tyler's unit flew from Yuma AZ to Cherry Point NC yesterday, just in time to be in the direct path of Irene. The pilots took the Harriers inland instead of returning to base. Once back \"home,\" Tyler moved his car to higher ground before they were restricted to barracks. The Jeep had a dead battery so it stayed put. But it's lifted and sits very high up anyway. My sister and her husband are riding out the storm and watching over their boat at my mom's house in Eastern Virginia, while mom is on her way to Iowa to visit friends. I haven't heard any details from any of them yet, although I did hear a few mumblings from Tyler a few minutes ago when I woke him up — he's still on Pacific time so is sleeping in late. Even if they're on generator power at the base, I'm sure there's more than enough MREs around to keep everyone fed."},

{"title": "HotPatterns 1120: Out of the Ashes", "date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2011", "text": "It's been over a month since I started this dress and set it aside because I stupidly cut pockets out of the skirt panel, but it's finally finished. (Hey, no wallets or bags today — are you shocked??)Here it is modeled. I moved the tripod to the sewing room where there's better light. Still not great light at 11 PM, but better than my dark bedroom. I am definitely NOT as tan as I look in these pics.\r\rHands out of pockets\rI'm not sure about this print. It reminds me of a skeleton costume. \r\rHands in pockets, visually adding 4\" to my hips. Nice.\rAs I noted the last time I blogged about this dress, I was concerned about the neckline plunge. As it turns out, rightly so. It's *very* low, and this is right after pulling it up to keep it more decent for internet viewing. If you don't make a muslin like I didn't, you will wish you had.I added a free-form ruffle thing. I didn't want a neckband or modesty panel and I didn't want a flower. So, free-form it is. Very Anthropologie, right? (Say yes.)I cut a straight 18 for this patten. I ended up taking about 4 inches out of the CB seam at the neckline, tapering down to the waist seam.That's a lot. I don't know what size these alterations equate to, but it's got to be around a 14-ish. Some of this is weight loss and some of it is that HP are wider cut than I'm expecting. Again, a muslin would've prevented the slapdash (Hi Trena) fixes. But slapdash or not, they worked, and the dress turned out fine. But I didn't do an FBA and there seems to be enough bust room and the  dart placement is OK. However, I did cut off some of the bottom of the  back bodice because shoulder-to-waist was too long and was pooling above  my rear end. I'm glad I pinned things together and did a try-on. Much  easier than ripping out that seam in a knit. I didn't hem it. This is the \"knee length\" from the pattern. I may have added 1\", but I will need to check my notes on that. I will either leave it unhemmed or I will use the hem facings. I'm leaning toward the facings because the pockets drag down the front, making the hem edge kind of puddle between my knees. I think a lightly interfaced hem facing will help that. On that note, I would advise to use lightweight fabric for the pockets and pocket bags. There is a pocket facing that will hide any non-matching fabric used in the pockets.Now that I have it made and know what I need to change, I do think I'll make it again. But not until I've made 267 more wallets. KIDDING!* * * * *My studying yesterday was almost useless. I dutifully watched all 5 hours of video tutorials and then took the test. Almost nothing in the test was covered in the the tutorials. But a lot of it was general graphic and offset printing info which I know inside and out. I got a 91. I also took another test for software I haven't used for at least 4 versions and 10 years. I got an 87 on that one, with no tutorial or studying. I've always been a good test-taker though, which kind of points out how useless skills tests (and school homework, which I always skirted!) can be - since I can get a 91 on software I've never used and an 87 just winging it. I don't know yet if I'll even be called in for an interview after all this, but the headhunter is giving it her best. That's all I can expect. * * * * *Parting shot: Tyler is still in Yuma AZ and will likely stay there a few days longer than expected since Hurricane Irene is due to come right at his North Carolina base. But as we discussed, it's the military and he probably won't know until 10 minutes after he lands in NC. And, it's not like his Command is taking a preference poll of all the lower ranks. ;-)"},
{"title": "Still No Clothing", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2011", "text": "I have too many ideas and plans going on in my head right now. There are about 5 purse designs I want to get into pattern form and make, and at least as many clothing patterns I want to sew. I mentioned that I picked up some Simplicity patterns on sale the other day. Three of those are skirt patterns. Before that, I added a couple of Vogue dress patterns to the collection.There are just not enough hours in the day.At the moment purses are winning, mostly because my sewing room is already in purse-making mode (read: a MESS of purse stuff), but also because I'm not entirely motivated to sew clothes that aren't going to fit long. It's not so much the sewing, but the \"wasting\" of favorite fabrics. If I make something and love it, I'm going to be sad when I have to put it in the \"too big\" box.So yesterday, I made a pattern and a bag for a simple tote style but one which zips. Totes are great, until you set them on the car seat next to you and then make a hard right turn and everything spills out. Plus, I wanted a less-pricey option for the M.o.M. store. That's it above.Today, I'm going to be \"studying\" some graphics software. There is a months-long temporary job possibility but it requires experience with some specific software I've either never used or used a much older version years ago. I can easily work in any graphics software since they pretty much all do the same thing (generally speaking), but it's hard to get someone to believe that on just my word. So, my \"headhunter\" has purchased a tutorial course for me and then I'll take a test at the end which she can show as \"proof\" I know what I'm doing. All of this for a temp job? Yes, because it has a good possibility to lead to a permanent position with the same firm, or at the very least be extremely recent and relevant experience for my resume. So for the next 5 hours, I'll be watching streaming videos teaching me what I already know. ;-)I'd rather be sewing."},
{"title": "Wallet Testing", "date": "Saturday, August 20, 2011", "text": "As I said to my wallet testers earlier, the next time I grumble about Big 3/4 pattern instructions, I may have to think twice. Writing instructions and diagrams for the masses is harder and more time-consuming than it looks. ;-) But I can't stop now. My testers have made some great suggestions (with more to come) which I'll be incorporating and I'm confident that once this pattern is released, it's going to rock! Today I worked on another (non-cammie) wallet as a tester myself. Now that I've made 362 of them (not really), I know how to do it in my sleep but I wanted to force myself to follow my written instructions verbatim to weed out mistakes and confusions. Here's my result. (I'm also trying to work on taking better pics. That's harder than it looks too. ARghh) I used some fat quarters I picked up at Joann's last night. I told Alex I needed to run in for just zippers on our way to dinner. He waited in the car with his friend and when I came out, he told me I was in there for 30 minutes and that he could've picked out zippers in 30 seconds. Oops. I conveniently forgot to mention that I also had a list of Simplicity patterns to pick up during the sale, plus I breezed by the quilting cotton and picked up a magazine. ;-) All of that took 15 minutes, and the line another 15.Yeah, I really need more patterns, I know. Just like I needed another wallet. LOLI didn't work on any wallets from my pattern, but I did make the Spiderman credit card holder for my son that I had planned. It's nothing very complicated, but I did have to make two mock-ups first to get the overall and pocket size correct and make sure it still folded flat when loaded. The lunchbox panel was not the most cooperative with stitch tension so it looks a little off on the back. But Tyler won't notice that. I also tried pressing with a scrap and it actually didn't melt, so I was able to lightly press the finished wallet into shape at the corners and the main fold. I didn't take a photo of the lunchbox I used before I started, but it's similar in style to this one. Softsided, with a Mylar/plastic-y front. $5.42 at Walmart for mine.I cut the front off, pulled out the foam liner and then figured where Spidey's head would fall on my pattern and cut it to size. Because the lunchbox panel was narrower than my pattern, I pieced some cammie fabric to one end, which you can see in the inside view above.After I was done with that, I tested a couple of embroidery designs and made one into this little \"doo-dad\" bag.I have no idea what I'm going to use it for, but sunglasses fit into it nicely. I nearly had a heart attack last night before starting the embroidery, and then I had a case of STOOOOOPID. I put my embroidery disk into my machine and went through the menus to select the design and get it ready for stitching. Except I couldn't select the specific design I wanted. The touchscreen was not responding. I turned the machine on/off a bunch of times and tried different disks, all with the same result. I started getting a sick feeling that my machine was going to need service. Until I finally realized I did NOT have the embroidery unit attached. Duh. Once I put that on, all was well again and I felt stupid but very relieved."},

Marines aren't allowed to have anything bulky in their pockets, so a real wallet is out. When he heard that I was making wallets, he asked if I could make him something flat to hold his cards. No problem! The design in my head is very simple, but to spice things up I'm using a panel from a soft Spiderman lunchbox I bought at Walmart the other night. Tyler loves Spidey. (I don't think I ever showed the Spidey gear shift and visor covers I made for his Jeep from sheets.) He had a great Spiderman wallet from Universal Studios, but he wore holes in it and we've never been able to find a suitable replacement.

IOW, seven years later. Weird camera angle — I have a peanut head. lol But I look taller in this pic than in the other, right? I haven't been able to wear this skirt for *years* but I never tossed it because it's a favorite pattern (Burda 8623) and it was one of the very first things I ever coverstitched with my then-new coverstitch machine. You can't see very well in these photos, but there are seams running down the front and I used the CS machine to double-topstitch them, as well as the hem band.I'm SO glad this fits again, especially since I haven't yet taken in my white denim skirt. Maybe I'll just punt on re-doing it again and make a new white denim skirt from this pattern. If I only had white denim.The top I'm wearing in the 2nd, today-photo is the CJ wrap top I made a couple of years ago, and to which I had to add sideseam \"gussets\" to make it fit. It's now big enough that I can remove those (via serger, of course). When I get a round tuit. ;-) For now, I just wear it around the house. I should make another one of these too.I think I've lost around 40 lbs now. Since I didn't get on a scale at the start, I don't really know. I'm still not eating any processed carbs at all, and my total daily food intake has gone way, way down overall. Most days, I actually have to remind myself to eat because I'm never hungry. That is a completely new experience for me. It must be what naturally skinny people feel like. I really need to force myself to work out more, though. I was again shocked by my arms last night - they're starting to look a little flabby. Not fat-flabby but total-lack-of-muscle-tone-flabby. I wish sewing was a workout. ;-) Note to self: STOP looking at arms at night.Back to drawing my wallet pattern on the computer …That's the wallet graveyard. Except for the one on the right — I'm keeping and using it. But it still has one mistake. I can live with it, but I really should stop sewing into the wee hours because it was totally avoidable had I been paying better attention.But I was on a roll. I added a new \"option\" and I was in a hurry to see it done. It's a flap to hold more cards which slides into the left pocket …… like this:Nifty, eh? (I have lots of cards!)But not lots of dollars. ;-)Here's the outside, and my glaring error. Can you spot it?I put the zipper pocket on the wrong side. It still works fine. It just doesn't look as nice. (Note to self: Make this step EXTRA clear in the instructions.) I had already trimmed the seam allowances really close or I would've ripped and turned it. Sigh. This evening I will start putting the instructions together. I am definitely not sewing another wallet for at least a few days."},

Mistake #1 - that \"OOO RAH\" you see above? It's really sewn on upside-down. Grr. It's fine for wallet use, but for a photo it looked stupid so I Pshopped it 180.Nothing remarkable about the back. It turned out fine.Mistake #2 is on the inside here, but I'm not going to point it out. ;-)  I also found some forgotten FQs of more of this fabric. I really wanted this orange print as the main lining instead of the turquoise print from the prototype, so I was happy about finding more.Here it is loaded up. The credit card slots on the left are much better now. At least that was one mistake I didn't repeat. I even got some coins \"in action\" for the zipper pocket. Also, about the magnet. I unscientifically tested it last night by seeing how much \"attraction\" there was between it, the fabric in the billfold section, and some metal objects. My test showed almost none, so my conclusion is that the fabric and interfacing layers are enough of a buffer to prevent problems between the magnet and the credit cards. But one can still always use Velcro in place of a magnetic snap. I just didn't want the Velcro riiiiiip sound every time I opened my wallet in a store. ;-)So now I have to draw the pattern on the computer, write up some directions and take photos while making another. And then put it all together in a nice little PDF package. See you in about a month. Just kidding. But it will take me a couple of days or more, especially because I think I'm going to have a rush USMC purse order coming in tonight which will push the pattern down in the queue. Thanks to all who volunteered for testing. I'll definitely want at least one novice stitcher to test my instructions and one experienced stitcher who will be able to spot any pattern flubs. I'll contact 2-3 peeps from the volunteers when the pattern is ready. * * * * *And, yes, I know I still have spices and a gift card to finish up. I've just got a bit of tunnel vision with the wallet at the moment. It won't be too much longer, I promise."},
{"title": "Prototype", "date": "Sunday, August 14, 2011", "text": "My wallet is on its last legs. It's being held together by duct tape. I hate spending money to buy a wallet because then you have no money left to put in it. ;-) I think my wallet preferences are fairly common — I like it to be short (vs. the longer clutch styles), have an outside pocket for change so I don't have to open it up fully just to get or put a quarter, and I want plenty of interior pockets and slots for cards and receipts. So, with all of that in mind, I set out this weekend to make up my own. Of course, in USMC MARPAT (the cammie fabric) style. I'm happy to report that I think I've hit on a final pattern. Unfortunately, the pics below are not it. I need to make it again with some changes. This one, I suppose, is my \"muslin.\" Sheesh, can't get away from muslins even in crafty projects.I need to get Zen about muslins and just embrace them. \r\rThat's a passport sticking out on the left side, to give you an idea of scale\rThe main problem with this \"muslin\" is that the left side card pockets are too shallow and the cards can (and will) easily flop out. Not a good feature in a wallet. I also want to make some interfacing changes/additions.I'm really ticked this is a muslin because I'm just about out of the prints I used on the interior and I like them. I have a lot of patriotic fat quarters from my UFO Stars & Stripes sampler quilt. I may use some of those for the next — and hopefully final — edition.The \"Semper Fi\" name tape is just temporarily stuck to the outside. It's really a key ring, in case you were wondering what that metal ring is. Once I had decided this muslin wasn't going to work, I didn't bother making a custom name tape. But I will for the final.Where the bills are sticking out above is where I'd actually put loose change. But loose change is harder to photograph \"in action.\" I wonder how that magnetized snap will affect my credit/debit cards, but it looks so much nicer than Velcro. I think actual sewing time is about an hour, but experimenting took 2 days. The first one was even worse than this one. I'm also thinking of making this a pattern for sale. What do you think? And if I do, are there any volunteers for pattern/instruction testing?"},
{"title": "Rambling Photos", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2011", "text": "Another bunch of randomness similar to the other night, but this time with photos.I finished this bag earlier this week.And then yesterday made up a pattern and sewed this bag today. I really want to sew clothes but I'm paralyzed. I don't need any more casual tees right now. But if I start on dressier work clothes, will they fit in a month? I hope not, and so I don't really want to spend time and good fabric on them. Hence the purses. But I'm really going to need work clothes at some point. I wish I knew what point that is (and what my measurements will be then).This is what my sewing table looked like this afternoon after finishing a purse. AKA purse vomit. ;-) I really hate sewing in the midst of a mess. I always start out with a clear table and it ends up like this. I think I need a bigger table. I ordered some stuff from Nancy's Notions last weekend and it arrived today. Two LED lights to stick onto my machine, mostly because since I can't seem to keep a working lightbulb in my D1. I liked them because they are battery-operated so no cords, and they were cheap — 2 for $15. I haven't worked up the nerve to stick one onto my machine yet. What if I hate it or it gets in the way? I also got some more Wonder Tape, Steam-a-Seam, and clear elastic. The last clear elastic I bought from NN's was Lastin brand. This is Clover. I hope it doesn't suck. Also, can you believe Joann's didn't have any clear elastic or Steam-a-Seam? OK, I know you can, but they used to so what's up with that?I bought some more patterns. I really need to stop, which you'll see in a minute. One is the Hot Patterns Pussycat blouse that was on clearance at Fabric.com. Another is a McCall's skirt that I bought at Joann's on sale last weekend. The other is a Vogue dress I bought from BMV a couple of weeks ago (with others, but I didn't photograph those yet). Which reminds me, I still have to finish that HP dress once my replacement fabric arrives.Also from Joann's last weekend, 3 more Vogues. Vogue 1250 I had bought during the BMV sale and have muslined it as you saw a couple of weeks ago. I need to return to it. Do you see a pattern (hah!) here? The dress in the upper left I will probably not make/wear for a long time, if ever. Unless I need to go to a wedding after I lose a lot more weight. I just know this is a good style for me and it's a pretty much a classic, so maybe it will still be passably in style when my tummy disappears. What is up with the huge Vogue envelopes anyway? Have they always been like this? I don't usually buy many Vogues. It irritates my OCD for having everything fit in the pattern ziplocks and cabinet drawers orderly. Oh wait, it's the \"designer\" patterns, right?This is why I need to stop buying patterns. All of these are my \"short list.\" Yeah, really. I got a call today while I was out, from another law firm I had sent a resume to (I wouldn't type such a grammatically bad sentence if they hired me). Maybe they'll interview me. I think they wanted to pre-screen me before inviting me over. That's an easy guess since the woman calling pretty much said as much without explicitly saying those words. I'll give them a call back tomorrow.I've noticed some bloggers getting ready to sew for Autumn and Winter. They are ready for summer to be over. It must be the Florida in me, but I am NEVER ready for summer to be over. Which is a good thing, since it so very rarely is over around here. I'll be sewing for hot weather for at least 4 more months. If I had to switch seasons every 3 months, I'd never be caught up. Tyler sent me a funny video tonight. He's working night shift in Yuma. They pranked their SSgt. One skinny guy hid in the mini fridge and when the SSgt went to open it for a drink, he got a big shock. I'd link you to it, but it's full of F Bombs, since that's pretty much the only word Marines know. Oh, and \"Rah.\" LMAO. ;-)I found out yesterday that a USO center has been approved (finally) for Tampa International Airport. When my life gets back together, I'd like to volunteer there when I can. It's not supposed to be finished until 2013. I hope my life is back together by then.Who has Laura's blog URL? The Laura who, with her BF Hans, is on her way to Florida? Hers is one of the links I lost and can't find.It's almost 2 AM. I should go to bed. Or something."},
{"title": "Tuesday Outfits", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "text": "I'm back from my interview. It went well, but then I think ALL my interviews go well and I'm still unemployed. lol I would take the job if it's offered. As with most any position, there are both pros and cons, but with enough pros to outweigh the cons. I was going to elaborate but realized I could be Googled, so I'll be smart about it. But I will say I did like who I'd be working for, the practice specialty would be interesting to me, and the commute is very good — the potential cons were discussed during the interview so I've got nothing to hide about that. Anyway, I found something besides the blue suit to wear. I wore pantyhose which are not shown here. I actually took photos as soon as I got back, but my camera ate them so I had to recreate. I wasn't doing the PH again. I'm sure you understand.\r\rSpot the 3 sleeping pups\rThis \"suit\" is more RTW that I bought 3 years ago when last job-hunting. The skirt never fit quite right back then (too tight) but now it's on the big side. Good thing there's an elastic waist. Speaking of which, the darn elastic is twisted inside the casing. Not twisted in the way you can wiggle it to untwist, but twisted once before the ends were joined so it's permanent. How irritating. Another thing to add to my \"mending\" pile, that will probably never get done, right?The jacket is also too big, which is more obvious when I button it. In the pic above, you can see how much extra fabric/ease there is on your right, under my arm, and the princess seams are kind of baggy at bust level. Nice. The blouse I made from an Ottobre Woman issue, and it's now too big too and the bust darts are almost UNDER my bust. How can that be? I did not shrink in shoulder-to-bust length. I suppose it's the new bra which must be making the girls ride higher and perkier. Perky? Yeah, right, but I'll go with the illusion. But, really, that much higher? I don't think so.Although I seem to be only complaining about the fit of this outfit, it's really not noticeable unless you're me or I'm pointing it out. It's a flowy skirt and the blouse darts are hidden. I thought it was more appropriately summer-y than the boring blue suit. I must be right because the intern in the interview office complimented me and said I looked so nice. Of course, she also told me that others have shown up for an interview wearing scroungy jeans so capris and a tee would be an improvement over that. Here's what I'm wearing now. In case you haven't guessed today's theme - it's too big also. This pic was taken with me sneakily grabbing a bunch of fabric behind me while posing.\r\rThe footboard does nothing for my hips. ;-)\rAnd this is with the fabric hanging freely. Another one for the mending pile. Or maybe I'll just make a new tee from the skirt section since the bodice/shoulders are kind of droopy too. I'm glad I'm losing weight, but it does suck that I have very few clothing items that fit well right now. If I don't find a job soon, I'm going to have to BUY a new suit. Or resign myself to real alterations. Um, I choose Plan A. ;-)In case I wasn't goofy enough last night with my rambling stream of thoughts, here's me hamming it up after clicking 342 pics just to get 3. Exaggerating. About the numbers, not the ham.\r\rHey Sailor!\rAnd one more thing that's just about too big? My Spanx. Seriously. That's just not fair.* * * * *Thanks also for the ideas about checking my profile for my missing blogs.

{"title": "Lots of This and That - And Yet One More Giveaway!", "date": "Wednesday, August 3, 2011", "text": "I'm back! The trip was great. So much nicer to fly direct for 1 hour and 40 minutes than to drive for 11+ hours. And now that I fit into an airline seat so much better these days, it's not even too uncomfortable especially since I lucked into an aisle seat each way. My mom picked me up at the Norfolk airport on Friday. By the time we got to her house (near Williamsburg), Tyler was already at my sister's house (near Richmond) and working on replacing the transmission and clutch in his new-to-him car. By the time mom and I got to my sister's Saturday morning, the car work was done and so we all just hung out for lunch and dinner.  My mom left after dinner and my sister, her husband, Tyler and I hit the town. OK, we hit one place, but it's a nice one. The Tobacco Company in downtown Richmond/Shockoe Slip. There we had some cocktails (not sayin' how many!), listened to a live band, and people-watched. Marty & Lisa Feeling No PainTyler, Also Feeling Very Little PainSunday, we all headed back to mom's for some boat time for the oldsters and tubing for the Marine.Now You See Him …… Now You Don't!Shark BaitTyler and Marty manned the fishing poles and caught about 30 croakers, most of which were thrown back but 5 or 6 were keepers for dinner.Not a bad sized fishI did manage to get some sewing time in over the weekend. First, Tyler arrived in Virginia with 8 pairs of work coveralls — 4 worn pairs which needed old unit/name insignia Velcro removed and 4 new pairs which were the recipients of the re-used Velcro. Plus, I had to sew all the new pockets shut (for safety around jet engines) and remove all the beltloops. They may move out and join the Marine Corps, but they still always want sewing repairs! Honestly, I was happy to do it for him and feel like mom again. And he had warned me before the trip so I was prepared with my favorite seam ripper and the right color thread. Then on Monday, I gave my mom her serger lessons so she could finally use the new serger that's been collecting dust for over a year now. In addition to basic serger functions, I taught her how to thread it both from scratch and tying on. And then I cut the threads and laughed as she panicked. ;-) But she did fine. We had a refresher a couple of hours later to be sure she really did get it, and she did.(Speaking of projects and being \"needed,\" my sister also sent me home with 4 more shirts to embroider for her husband's towing business.The first ones were a very big hit!)* * * * *Today, it was back to normal and running some errands. Here's what I wore, both refashioned RTW pieces. The skirt is now too big and I'm not ready to give it up, so I'm going to rip it apart yet again down the back and take it in some more. This time, I'll need to move the back pockets since they will be touching if I don't.It's worth it, though, since I have been LIVING in this skirt.Ignore the belly and look at how much room is in the waist.The skirt now nearly falls down before the day is over.While I had the tripod out, it was time to document the green jeans again. They're still tight, but I can now zip them up which means that while the belly is slow to disappear, it is getting smaller.

It's not like I don't already have a bunch of new clothes, right? ;-) Um. Yeah.So, before I started the USMC purse, I snuck in another See & Sew 5593. I wear the crossover version I made earlier all the time and have wanted another. Now I have two I will wear all the time because I LOVE this one too.And I will love the first one even more because I took it in at the CB seam so it doesn't hang so tent-like from my shoulders as it's been doing as I continue to loose lbs. Now it looks like I have a waist from the back view. I made this same alteration to the new dress, as well as sewing the sideseams with 1-1/4\" seam allowances instead of 5/8\". I'm not sure what pattern size this equates to now — probably 16-ish? I need to do something with the first make, the orange stripey one, because it's really too big and I'm not willing to give it up. I think I need to buy another copy of this pattern the next time I'm at Joann's and before it's OOP since I cut it and will probably want it smaller as I get smaller. If I forget, which I'm likely to do, I'll just keep taking in the sideseams forever. Here's me in the new dress, with wet hair. Seems like all my pics lately have me with wet hair. Hmmm.

{"title": "HotPatterns 1120: An Expensive Muslin", "date": "Friday, July 22, 2011", "text": "I'm SO MAD at myself I almost can't type this! I have searched high and low and I can't find one half of the skirt back, which I know I cut out. So I've come to the only logical conclusion I can come up with and it's that I cut one of the pocket lining pieces from that skirt piece. I've never done this before, so I guess it was my turn. Arghhhhh! So much for taking the dress on my trip.I immediately checked Gorgeous Fabrics to see if Ann had any of this fabric left, which she did. And then I spent an hour debating whether I was willing to put another $20 into this dress (fabric + shipping). Part of the reason for my internal debate is that buying more fabric will bring the dress total to over $60, but mostly I debated because there are fitting issues that could've been sussed out in an ACTUAL muslin, but I was too lazy to make one. Did you hear read that, Diane??I finally caved and decided to buy the additional fabric. Ann is generously holding it for me until after I get back from my trip so I can buy more to justify the shipping. What? That's a good excuse, isn't it?While the dress is in limbo, I'll go over some of the potential problems I encountered. Every one of these could have been caught if I had made the muslin Trudy so strongly suggested in the YouTube video for this pattern. In other words, it's not the pattern's fault, it's mine. First, as Linda warned in the comments yesterday, the vee neckline is *very* low. Think Burda plunge. Because I can't sew the skirt on yet, I'm not sure if this is going to be bra-baring low on me. If it is, you will either see a fabric flower at the cleavage or I'll add something (neckband, modesty panel, binding, trim, something). Next, the front facing looks like it might want to roll outward. I'm pretty sure once the skirt is attached, that will weigh things down and it will be fine — especially since it was improved with me just pinning the front skirt piece on. I gotta say I'm not a fan of facings, though, especially in knits, which this fabric is. When I make this dress again, I'm going to have to rethink the facings. Overall, it's simply too big at the neckline. I cut a straight 18 with no adjustments. I should have gone way, way, WAY smaller in the neckline. Again, a muslin would've alerted me to this. I will fix it on this dress by just taking a deeper seam at the CB neck … … this much deeper: I need to remember this about Hot Patterns necklines and me because I've run into this before.Lastly, it's going to be too short for my preference. The pattern states \"knee length\" and it is. I had already added one inch but I don't think that will be enough. I think I'm going to use the leftover border from the print to add a band around the bottom.This is the skirt front just loosely pinned in place.I need to work on the USMC purse this weekend, but I really want a new dress! I might just see if I can sneak in a quick TNT as a palate cleanser. * * * * *The WINNER from the July 15, 2011 Giveaway (Amy Butler's Style Stitches) is:Congratulations JillyP!

{"title": "Wednesday Ramblings", "date": "Wednesday, July 20, 2011", "text": "I got this DVD from the library yesterday and did the two beginning sessions this morning. And it about KILLED me. But the burn is good, right? ;-)So, this DVD is aimed at new mothers. Yeah, well. I'm definitely not a new mother, nor do I ever plan to be again, but I do have the abs in need of dire rescue so I figured what the heck. It's actually perfect for me. It's toning exercises on a mat with a resistance band, a ball or pillow, and later a 3 lb. weight, without the bounce-around aerobic stuff that I suck at and just plain hate. Plus, the \"host\" Tracey Mallett is Australian and I do love those Aussie accents! I will definitely do \"just 8 more\" every time I hear her ask. But seriously, I think I can actually follow this DVD regularly. The time went fast, and I even watched it once before I did the routines so the total time I spent this morning was really double. I did have to fight off the dogs trying to lick my face all over with me down on the floor at their level, which could be a problem when I'm flinging weights around. Silly dogs. I'm sure we all looked quite a sight. No, there will be no photos of this. I also got a Pilates DVD from the library and I'll \"preview\" that one tonight. It's rated for Level 4, which I didn't notice until it was home and if the beginner stage from the above DVD killed me, this one may just close the casket and throw the dirt on top.  I'm still waiting for the South Beach Workout DVD I ordered from Amazon. It's supposed to be short but effective spurts of interval training that I can do on my eliptical bike. Hopefully I'll like that one so it can be my cardio. I hate cardio. I also dug out my old scale and it seems to be working. Maybe I was just wishing it was broken? I needed a starting place to figure out BMI, etc., so it was time to face the number. At least I didn't have to buy a new scale to do it. The number is still way more than I want it to be eventually, but it's actually less than I was expecting for now so I'm not depressed about it. No, there will be no photos of that either. ;-)I'm going to start on this pattern this afternoon. It arrived on Monday and should fit nicely into my informal \"Summer of Dresses\" plan. There are still others I want to revisit - Vogue 1250 and See & Sew 5593 to name two, but a new pattern to try out is TOO intoxicating so that's what I'm going to work on first.No matter what stage I'm in with dressmaking by this weekend, I'll have to clear off the sewing table and start (and hopefully finish) another one of these bags:Another mom of another Tyler in Marine boot camp found my blog and has commissioned me to make it for her. Her son is due to graduate from boot camp on August 22 and she wants to take it to Parris Island then. Ooo RAH!And MY mother has twisted my arm (ahem) to come back to Virginia the weekend of July 29 to teach her how to use the serger she bought probably 2 years ago now. She lives about an hour from my sister, where my Tyler will be that weekend working with my brother-in-law to put a new transmission into the car he just bought. We knew it needed a transmission when he bought it (no 3rd gear!), so this has always been the plan. And while they have the old transmission out, they will be replacing the clutch too — just because they can. (Insert manly grunting noises here.) So, I think Tyler may be close to SICK of seeing me after this, although I will never give up any opportunity to see him so my mom didn't have to twist my arm too tight. Which she knew and used to her advantage. Like all moms do. She's buying me a plane ticket so at least I don't have to do that drive twice in one month. Two-hour non-stop flight vs. 14 hours on the road? No brainer. See you next weekend mom!* * * * *Responses to some comments/questions:Diane:  \"No problem with you \"singling me out\" lol I appreciate your comments although I'm not convinced that you are a lazy seamstress - - - - I almost never even do a muslin. Therefore, you are not as lazy as me!\"Trust me, I am. Making a muslin is so I don't have to make something twice just to get it to fit. Muslins are fast and ugly. Making two whole garments takes a lot more time. And I don't even muslin every new pattern anymore. KellysSewing: \"Is your son still stationed in NC? Mine is headed to Camp Lejuene in a couple weeks for 2 years. Opposite side of the US for me!\"Tyler is at MCAS Cherry Point NC, which is about an hour from LeJeune (CP is south, I think, but I could be wrong). There's not a whole lot for a single guy to do around either town, but LeJeune is a HUGE base, so I'm sure he can stay busy. I hope you can work out seeing your son as often as possible. I know how hard it is when they're gone.Cheryl: \"I wanted to comment on your prospective ab workout. Don't train any muscle group more than one day in a row; the muscles need the time to recover. Surely it's got to be good news that 20 minutes every day is too much. :-)\"Fantastic news! See above comments re KILLING me. ;-)Mel: \"Terrific tutorial! I have a question though, does the panel add weight (and heat) to the front of the top? I have tops that just have a small modesty panel in the front of the neckline and not attached to the rest of the seams. Just curious as I live in the same \"hot house\" state that you do.\"andflynn37:  \"I love the prints you buy, but one question - I assume they are polyester? You don't sweat like crazy in the Florida humidity? I just moved to Florida and am afraid to buy anything not cotton...\"I've been in Florida for 22 years so I'm used to the heat and humidity. But today's polyesters are actually pretty comfortable to wear and do breathe. They also wick away the moisture and let it evaporate, which is something cotton doesn't do. I always feel damp wearing cotton, but usually cool wearing a good polyester. And I'm a slave to those great prints. ;-)I suppose the extra panel on the cowl top from yesterday does add weight, but I'm not really noticing it. I wore one of them all day yesterday running errands and I wasn't any more uncomfortable in the heat/humidity of a Florida July day than usual.Kira: \"Can the gift card be used by someone in the UK?\"Yes, as far as I know, since Fabric.com does ship internationally.Kris O: \"I love the fabric on your newly-made top. Did you mention the source and I just missed it?\"They are both ITY knits and recent purchases from Fabric.com.Belinda: \"Have you always loved bright colors or is this something you grew into?\"I've always loved bright prints. Which is strange considering how shy I can be in real life, until I get to know someone. Maybe it's my way of telling the world, \"Hey, talk to me because I'm too shy to start the conversation.\" ;-) But I've also been working on that, making it a point to say hi to strangers and smile. So far, so good. I've also had a couple questions about my dressform. It's a Dritz My Double, and I reviewed it here. In the review are also a couple of links to online discussions and tips about dressforms in general and how to pad them out to fit you (which mine doesn't anymore, but I don't really ever use it to fit me anyway).* * * * *And the WINNER from the July 13, 2011 Giveaway (Custom Couture) is …I chose lazysubculturalgirl because I just couldn't bear the thought of her feeling so guilty for so long about all those Old Navy things, especially since she so dutifully spent her husband's gift card on them. ;-)Congratulations lazysubculturalgirl!

{"title": "Tutorial:  Turning a Raglan Into a Cowl With Contrast Panel (and Giveaway)", "date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2011", "text": "I did finish my tops yesterday and then my book last night, so it will be off to the library this morning.  Here is the finished remake of the original Walmart top. The only changes I made were to change the black contrast panel to white and hem it about 3\" shorter. I'm very happy with this change, especially since it netted me a raglan pattern for \"free.\" Inside viewHere's the new top I made from the pattern I traced off the parts of the Walmart top while I had it ripped apart deconstructed. Yes, I'm wearing THOSE orange sandals again ;-) and sporting a wet head.To make this top, you need a knit raglan pattern with a scoop neckline. I actually didn't have a TNT that fit this bill or else I probably wouldn't have been so inclined to rip apart the Walmart tee. As I've been learning just now, finding a pattern for a plain raglan top is easier said than done (unless you win yesterday's Giveaway), but I did find one in the Kwik Sew line, here. This is obviously a hole in the Big 3/4's catalogs. I wonder why. Anyway …Once you have a pattern, you need to trace an additional front piece onto tissue or pattern paper. Don't cut the tracing until you've made the changes because you're going to be extending beyond the original pattern lines.To make the cowl overlay, you need to extend the center front about 1-1/2\" inches at the neckline (on half a pattern, for a total of 3\"),  tapering to nothing at the hem. If you want more cowl, extend more than 1-1/2\". Next you will draw the cowl facing. The facing is shown below from the dotted green line upward and is shaped so that when folded  down, it fits exactly onto the neckline of the new pattern piece. The differences between the original front and the new cowl are outlined in green. Hopefully, a picture is worth a thousand words here. However, not shown here and important is that the cowl front should match the back at the sideseams, but the contrast panel is about 3-4\" shorter at the hem edge than the front and back pieces. It must be shorter so that its bottom edge doesn't show when the top is worn and so that both fronts can be hemmed independently. Since the contrast is your original pattern, just fold up the bottom edge before cutting fabric.So, now that you have your pattern (right?), it's time to start construction. Note that my seam allowances are 1/4\" everywhere except the neckline edge (3/8\") and the hems (1\"). It's easier to turn and stitch a smaller seam allowance. I used a serger and coverstitch machine for construction. If you don't have one or both machines, you can use a slight zigzag stitch for seams and a twin needle for topstitching (or more zigzagging).Here we go …First, press under the neckline and bottom hem on the contrast panel. (I use glass head pins on knits that have a mind of their own so I can keep them in place while I position a press cloth and hot iron over top.)This photo isn't really a step - just showing what your contrast panel should look like now. I'm guessing yours won't be orange, though.Next, sew the back raglan sleeve seams to the back of the top. Back only — the front will come in a separate step later. After the back sleeve seams are sewn, turn under the neckline edge and press. Depending on your fabric's recovery, you may want to serge or ZZ some clear elastic to this edge before turning under and stitching. My fabric has good recovery so no clear elastic this time, although I did hold the pressed-under edge in place with some bits of Steam-a-Seam 2.After pressing the neckline edge under, topstitch it in place. I used my coverstitch machine. You can use yours if you have one or a twin needle or a zigzag stitch.Next, press under the cowl facing on the front.In the photo below, the cowl facing is at the bottom — just easier for me to press while it's in this position.Lay the front on your table, wrong side up, with the cowl facing still folded to the wrong side. Lay the contrast panel on top of the cowl front, also wrong side up. Pin (or baste) one front sleeve seam, as shown below by the blue \"pin\" lines. Repeat for the other front sleeve seam, making sure the cowl facing remains folded, to be caught in the front sleeve seam.When pinning, the cowl edge (with the facing still folded down) should stick out just a hair above the top of the contrast panel, as in the photo below.Here are both front sleeve seams pinned together. The two fronts won't lay flat now. That's OK.Next, flip both pieces over so that the cowl front is right side up, as below. You could've pinned/basted with both fronts right side up, but I found it easier to lay the cowl front flat while pinning and then flip.Next, put the back section (with the sleeves already semi-attached) on top, right side to right side. Pin/baste the sleeve fronts to the cowl/contrast \"sandwich\" at the sleeve seams, as shown below.Sew the front sleeve seams so that all three edges plus the cowl facing are caught, as indicated by the blue lines below.If you're constructing with a serger as I was, keep a long tail at the neck edge and using a blunt large-eyed needle (or your favorite tool), run the tail back through some of the stitching and then trim it, as shown below.At this point, the sleeves are attached to the fronts and back, but the underarm and sideseams are not yet sewn. So, while your top is still mostly flat, press under the sleeve hems and the front/back hems so you don't have to press in the round. It's just easier. Don't stitch them yet.Next, with right sides together (the pic below shows wrong sides together, so ignore that part!), stitch the underarm and sideseams in one pass (well, two passes), as shown by the blue lines below.Stitch the pre-pressed sleeve and bottom hems in place. Do not catch the contrast panel in the bottom hem.And, voila! Done!Neckline close-up:Front inside:And again, me wearing the new top:And now for the LAST Giveaway this week  …… (drum roll)… a $35 Fabric.com Gift Card!To enter, leave a comment on this post and I will use the Random Number thingie to pick a winner.

{"title": "Redoing the Raglan (and Giveaway)", "date": "Monday, July 18, 2011", "text": "I had the best intentions of sewing and blogging yesterday, but you know what they say about roads to hot places and intentions. ;-) Instead, I wandered in and out of my sewing room doing a bit here and there, but my real attention was on reading. A few weeks ago, I checked out Scott Turow's Innocent, which was his follow-up to Presumed Innocent, a bestseller from the 1980s. I started it Saturday night and as I became more engrossed with the story, it was harder and harder to put down and the trips to the sewing room became fewer and fewer.Funny related story - when I checked out the book, I noticed that it was pretty hefty page count-wise, but I didn't think much of it. It sat on my kitchen counter for a few days and Alex pointed out (in that lovely sarcastic way of teenagers) that this was a Large Print book. In other words, for \"old\" people. Hah! I never noticed. But words are words so it wasn't going to turn me off to reading the book. And (you know this is coming, right?), now that I'm actually reading the book in bed with a not-so-bright bedside lamp, I find I'm actually THRILLED that it's Large Print. I don't need glasses. I don't need to stretch my arms out. Mark  me down as officially old. ;-)During my trips through the sewing room, I was working on unstitching this shirt I bought last week so I could (a) trace a pattern from it and (b) change the black underlayer to my preference of white.Here's where it stands at the moment. The tracing is done and I'm putting the pieces back together. I still have the sideseams and a shorter hem and then I'll be done. I already have another one cut out. I'm hoping to get both done today, if I can stay away from my book until tonight. But I do want to finish the book tonight because the library called and another book I've reserved is waiting for me, plus I have one more book that I have to have back by tomorrow or I'll start getting fined. I've intentionally kept it out late because when I went to renew it last week, someone else had a hold on it and the system wouldn't let me renew it. I understand holds and I'm not trying to be greedy, but I think I should get at least one renew, don't you? ;-) However, the librarian told me that I could keep it out as overdue until Tuesday without incurring fines so that's what I did. My apologies to whoever is waiting but, well, I got it first. Neener neener! ;-)And now for the Giveaway  …Today it's vintage Stretch & Sew patterns. All three are intact and uncut.

{"title": "Vogue 1250: Alterations, Muslin & First Impressions (and Giveaway)", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2011", "text": "So here's my muslin for Vogue 1250. Yeah, it's black so the details aren't as clear but I did lighten the photos so hopefully you can see more than just a black blob. The jury is out. I think I look rectangular-ish from the front and I'm not. Except my hands are on my hips which kind of hides the curving out there. I also will not make this again in a solid until my tummy is flatter. Prints hide all sorts of evils. ;-) But I will keep this black version and revisit it again after saying goodbye to 20 more lbs. or so. Also, I didn't hem the bottom or the sleeves since this was a muslin, yet I did serge all the interior seams. Go figure.I did NOT make this straight out of the envelope. Anything but. The alterations were not hard though it was a little cumbersome at times wrestling full dress lengths of tissue. I took pics along the way for the little tutorial below.If you need to add more width to the lower half of this pattern, before doing anything trace the hip dart onto a scrap paper/tissue and set it aside for later. Next (and I don't have a real photo of this step so I doctored another), slash the pattern through the hip dart as shown by the red line below. This cut will be perpendicular to the shorten/lengthen lines printed on the pattern. Set aside the back \"skirt\" piece. If you do not need to made any width adjustments to the lower half, skip this step and leave your pattern intact. Because I needed both booty width additions and an FBA, some of my pics will show front and back separated.This is the front section, and what you'll be working with for your FBA. I cut the top from the bottom along the shorten/lengthen lines because (1) It's easier to work with a smaller piece and (2) I will need to shorten above the waist anyway. You can keep the front section in one long piece if you prefer and just make the vertical slash for the FBA all the way to the hem.Next, hold this newly created \"\"bodice section\" (or the whole length if you didn't cut it apart) up to yourself in front of the mirror and mark your bustpoint and then position the sideseam at your side and note how much more width you need so that the pattern Center Front meets your center front. This will be the width you \"spread\" the tissue during your FBA.Draw your FBA slash lines as shown in red below, making sure to draw one slash through the shoulder pleat since you will eventually be rotating the bust dart to there.Slash the pattern, leaving \"hinges\" at the shoulder and at the tip of the new side dart, as shown below. Secure each section with weights of some sort so they don't move. Snip the \"hinge\" at the shoulder so there is no more hinge and rotate the section with the red arrow below so that the side dart closes. This opens the shoulder pleat, which is just what you want.Fill in the slashes/spreads with tissue, as below.Reattach the front bottom skirt section to the front bodice section. Because I needed to shorten above the waist, I did it now and just re-attached the 2 sections 1/2\" shorter. Fill in the \"gap\" shown in red below with tissue, all the way to the hem. (If you did not separate the upper and lower sections, your slash in the middle of the pattern will have gone all the way to the hem and you should have filled it in already when you were filling in after your FBA.)If you do not need to add width to the bottom area, you're done and your pattern will look like this, below.However, if you DO need extra hip/booty width, you will have slashed your pattern as shown at the beginning. Realign the pieces and slide some tissue underneath so that it extends above the hip dart and a few inches on each side of the vertical slash.(I had previously added 3\" in length to the bottom of my pattern, in case you've noticed and are wondering. You can do this at the end of your alterations or when you're cutting.)This pattern has 1-1/2\" of ease at the hips. Figure out how much additional width you need (remember, if you did the FBA above, you already have added onto the front of the pattern piece). Divide that number in half. Then divide that result in half. Add that second result onto the Center Back seam of the skirt area. In the photo above, it's at the very left of this pattern piece, but unfortunately, I forgot to mark this photo.This is a subtlety shaped seam, so shape your addition to match.Now it's time to use the tracing of the hip dart you set aside earlier. Spread the tissue where you slashed through the hip dart the rest of your required width addition and slide the hip dart tracing into place so that the dart point is in the center of your spread. True the lines at the back waist and at the front sideseam.Trim away the excess tissue, as show below. (In this pic, you should be able to see where I added tissue at the CB of the skirt section, at the very left.) This section is now done. If you want to add hem length, you can do it now.Because I shortened the front above the waist and added width to the hips, I needed to make corresponding adjustments to the upper back piece. Below, you can see the tuck I made on the shorten/lengthen line.Next, I slashed from the shoulder to the bottom, leaving a hinge at the shoulder, and spread the tissue so that the width at the bottom equaled the total amount added to the width of the back half of the skirt section. (Don't calculate any vertical FBA spread from the front here, since the bottom front was already adjusted earlier.) True the curved back waist seamline at the bottom.And you're done! Below shows all of my alterations marked in red. Click to EnlargeAnd now for the Giveway …This is a repeat from a few months ago because that winner never contacted me.

{"title": "Kool-Aid Time (and another Giveaway)", "date": "Friday, July 15, 2011", "text": "At last count, there were 25 reviews on PR for this pattern (Vogue 1250). I feel like I'm already late to the party. But when this dress looks universally great on all the figures of the ladies who've made it, I'd be foolish not to try it too and if I like it, I'll just say that I was fashionably late. But I do have some misgivings. Namely, that my tummy is going to be highlighted, and not in a good way. I may be losing weight, but the tummy is definitely still hanging in there (and I do mean hanging!). You will note that I still haven't been showing side-view pics of myself. I do have my limits. ;-) So, on today's sewing agenda is a \"muslin\" of this pattern in a knit I won't care if I end up tossing. There's only 2 pattern pieces, so that should go quickly.Speaking of unloved knits … I think I'm going to be returning 3-4 pieces from my latest Fabric.com haul. Either the print scale was too small or too big, or the color just isn't thrilling me, or whatever. One is a border print which I loved, in theory. In reality, it's just not me. I think it feels too dressed up or something I can't quite put my finger on. But when I looked at it on Zillie last night, I immediately thought of Carolyn, which is funny now because at the very same time it seems she was posting about border prints on her blog. And speaking of my tummy, I got out the measuring tape yesterday. (Cue Dragnet theme music.)I still haven't stepped on a scale, but I had a pretty good idea of what I used to measure, as most stitchers do. I've lost 6 inches in my hips, 2-1/2 around the waist, and 1-1/2 in my biceps. But zero, nilch, zip around the girls. Many women seem to gain/lose weight in the bust first, but not me. Unless I'm pregnant, and that is a scary thought in many, MANY ways. ;-)  Looks like me and the girls will be keeping company for some time to come. Still speaking of my tummy, I also broke down and ordered a workout DVD this morning. I hate (HATE!) workout routines, but I need to do something about my lack of firm ab muscles. We'll see how that goes. I think I can handle 20 minutes a day without hating it too much, especially after I start seeing results. Results in the thighs would be welcome too. To answer some recent comments — I'm not following a particular named diet. But how I've changed my eating habits is closer to the Atkins Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL) step than most anything else. I've dramatically reduced carbs (to about 40-60g/day) and eliminated processed and low-fat foods. This means I've also increased proteins, natural, healthy fats, and produce (fiber). It's called \"shopping the perimeter\" in the grocery store and avoiding the aisles of processed, packaged foods. I'm never hungry and I don't miss the junk and sweets at all, which is still sometimes hard for me — the sweetsaholic — to believe. I can't even remember the last time I had (or wanted) chocolate. Really! Now, for today's Giveaway …Up for grabs today is Amy Butler's Style Stitches, 12 Easy Ways to 26 Wonderful Bags!I bought this book for myself a few months ago, and really enjoyed looking through and reading it. It's beautifully photographed, and the information and instructions for the bags in the book seem to be good, although I can't swear to that since I haven't actually made any of these bags. And that's the thing — I probably never will make these particular bags. It's not that they aren't pretty and I do love Amy Butler's aesthetic, but just to look at. AB is not really me. At the same time I bought this book, I bought another bag-making book and I'll be keeping that one for reference when the bag mood strikes. This one, however, should go on to another home where it will be loved and used. All the patterns are intact and still sealed into the envelope at the back.

Me and Carolyn  — Comment 'Hos. (Hi Carolyn!) How I get them matters not. I'm just happy when my readers do comment for whatever reason. And it's nice to meet you, Diane. :-)What struck me, though, is that you're intimated by me/my sewing and that other readers may be too. Puh-lease! LOL! I'm the most lazy, laid-back sewer you'll meet. Yes, I can exhibit OCD about aspects of *my* projects, but only for me and usually only when something's gone wrong and I'm not ready to give up. Usually, I'm going for the fastest way to do something, which is one reason I'm not a hand-stitcher. I know there are many ways to do things, many levels of project satisfaction, and that this sewing thing we all love is really for fun more than anything. So, please don't ever be intimidated. Ask questions if you want to and I'll try to answer them. I can't promise but not because I'm intimidating — it's the lazy thing I mentioned. Or just plain scatterbrainedness. ;-)"},

Oh, speaking of colors — I've had a few comments recently about me wearing blue (and thank you for the compliments!). I just wanted to set the record straight that it's not that I think I don't look good in blues, it's just that blue is not one of my go-to colors. I tend to gravitate toward other colors first. OK, where was I? Oh yes, dealing with the pile. So, I cut off the buttons from the items I pointed out yesterday and then tossed them. Sigh. It was kind of hard to do that and then see other messy kitchen garbage on top of my stuff in the trashcan. But I'm over it now. Mostly.After freeing the buttons, I refashioned (hah!) this dress, into …… this top. But instead of trying it out before I hemmed it, I just went ahead and hemmed it. I've since decided that I really need to take in the sideseams. A LOT. This dress/top had a lot of ease and I want to get rid of that now.For today, I'm wearing it with my new chain belt and my new dark denim capris. And my great orange sandals, which I really wish I had bought 2 pairs of now because I'm going to miss them so much whenever they wear out.I think I'm going to go back to Walmart after dinner (I swear, some weeks I live there) and buy 2 more pairs of these capris in smaller sizes before they're sold out. One to wear after more weight loss and one to cut up as a pattern because they fit me so well and even with losing more weight, I'm still going to be this general shape.As to \"In With the New,\" my Fabric.com order arrived today and I might be just a little bit overwhelmed. I think I need to get on the fabric wagon because I already have more projects in my head than I'll be able to finish anytime soon while still looking for a job. (No, haven't heard anything about anything yet. Sigh.)On to today's Giveaway … A bunch of old sewing crap vintage sewing notions and a vintage Kwik Sew slip pattern, size S-M-L-XL which has been rough-cut but all sizes are intact.Click to Enlarge and See the DetailsWhat can you do with a bunch of old wooden spools, you ask?

{"title": "This and That and a Giveaway", "date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2011", "text": "This post is going to be an unconnected stream of consciousness, just some things on my mind and on my sewing table. If you make it through to the end, congratulations! You'll be \"rewarded\" with a chance to win today's giveaway. What? I didn't mention that I'll be doing a giveaway every day for a week? Oops. But just so you know, it's not going to be all new books. I'll probably throw in a pattern or two and maybe an oddball thing. You'll just have to keep checking each day to find out. ;-)What I wore yesterday, for grocery shopping. Was I overdressed for Walmart? Hah. I think it's the long, dangly earrings that make me feel fancier because it's really just a simple knit dress. I wish I hadn't cut off my feet cuz my green flip-flops looked killer with this. Another side benefit of losing weight? Shoes that used to be too tight now fit again. Yay! The dress is RTW, size 14. Yeah, I know knits stretch, but still, a 14! Wooo! Who said size doesn't matter? ;-) I do need to sew the crossover shut. My Hollywood Tape quick fix wasn't quite cutting it. I also need to buy some new bras or take in the bands of my current ones in the interim. The girls are not getting the same support they did when my bra bands were tighter. New denim capris from Walmart, 4 sizes smaller than the black ones underneath I wore all last summer. Time for another Woo! I think the black ones will become another skirt.The new capris are a tiny bit snug but they are stretch denim so they'll be perfect in a couple of hours. I don't think I'll be making any pants again until I'm closer to my goal size, which I haven't yet decided on — I'll see how this process goes. I'm tempted to buy these in the next size or two down, since they fit so well and are cheap (in all sense of the word). My pile on the sewing room table. The dress from above, to sew the crossover closed. Below that, capris from a few years ago that fit now. I'm either going to make them shorter, make them a skirt, or just take off the hardware and then toss them. Under the capris is my red/white/blue denim dress (if you remember, it's the one with the big red buttons down the front, if you don't it's here). I've worn it once and washed it about 10 times. The denim never softened up enough and it hung like a circus tent on me. I'm going to take off the buttons and toss it.Below the denim dress is my embroidered linen Hot Patterns Princess Blouse. When I made it, it was a perfect, close fit and I wore it regularly. Now it just hangs on me and looks silly. I'll be taking the buttons off this one and then tossing it too. Below the HP blouse, the dress I wore to Alex's high school graduation — the one I originally bought my cool orange sandals for. I'm going to cut this off to a top. I'll get more wear from it that way since as a dress it's too baggy now and makes me look pregnant. Below that, the Butterick Connie Crawford blouse (the one with separate cup pieces). Too big, so I'll be removing buttons and tossing that one too. I've decided I'm not going to keep most of my \"fat clothes.\" They take up space and will be too easy to slip back into instead of reducing what I eat if I gain a few pounds down the road. I will keep some just for kicks and comparison, like I've kept my \"skinny jeans\" all these years. Next, SDBev asked to see more detail on this top, the RTW cowl with the black panel.Here's what the inside front looks like. It's just another front layer sewn (serged) into the raglan seams.And from the side:And, finally, the Giveaway. You made it! ;-)Sixth & Spring Books sent Custom Couture as an unexpected bonus with the Fabric Guide I reviewed yesterday. Custom Couture is not really aimed at me, since I abhor hand-sewing and I don't really embellish any RTW. But this look and these types of projects are definitely popular with the younger set (Gawd, I sound like a teetering old grannie when I say that!) and I see many similar looks on lots of sewing and refashioning blogs. But just because this isn't what I do shouldn't detract from the book. It's pretty, well-photographed, has lots of eye candy and inspiration, and good instructions to recreate each look. It just deserves a better home than I would give it. I do appreciate Sixth & Spring sending it to me though, and I am happy to share.Here are few random photos of some of the projects. There are others just as nice or even better but I just flipped pages and clicked on whatever I opened to since I couldn't decide.To enter the Giveaway, leave a comment below telling me why you'd like this book.

{"title": "Review:  Simplicity Fabric Guide (and Giveaway)", "date": "Tuesday, July 12, 2011", "text": "Sixth & Spring Books recently sent me Simplicity Fabric Guide: The Ultimate Fiber Resource for review.* Per Amazon.com:\"From SIMPLICITY, one of the most famous names in sewing, comes a comprehensive guide to all things fabric and fiber related. Lavishly illustrated throughout with color and archival photographs of fabrics and fabric-related items, this is the essential tome for textile fans everywhere. It covers fabric basics, natural and man-made fibers, fabric types, specialty finishes, trademark fabrics, more!\"And I definitely agreement with that description. This spiral-bound hardcover reference guide is beautifully laid out and photographed and contains lots of fabric and sewing information, which makes it a pleasure to look at as well as interesting to read.It starts off with A Brief History of Simplicity and moves into a Brief History of Fabric and then  onto Fabric Basics, such as how fabric is woven and/or loomed and the various types of weaves and knits.Next, Fibers are covered, both natural and manufactured, and includes a burn chart so you can put your new knowledge to test on those mystery fabrics in your stash.From there, you'll move into the Fabrics section with over 100 large, clear photos of various fabrics coupled with text descriptions, uses and sewing tips. Next up is a section on Linings, Interfacings & Stabilizers which provides an overview of the different types and reference charts of what to use when.The Working With Fabric chapter describes the characteristics of various fabrics versus the style garment to be made, plus grain, yardarge, pattern layout, preshrinking, nap & more. Sewing tools and notions are thoroughly covered, including a needle chart and a detailed description of more pins thank I think I knew existed.Color Choices is a primer in color theory and Fabric Care covers cleaning, pressing and pressing tools, fabric storage, and stain removal.Thread is up next with a brief overview of thread construction and detailed descriptions of thread types. Matching thread to fabric and matching thread to needle is covered in both descriptive and chart form.At the end of the book there is a small glossary, measurement charts and/or instructions for quilts and bed coverings, window treatments, and tablecloths. There's a section on taking body measurements for garment sewing along with a Simplicity pattern size chart.Finally, there is a section for adding your own fabric swatches and notes, and tear-out guides for fabric width conversion, estimating yardage, and a quick button size guide.As I read through this book, I liked how the information was presented both in long form for leisurely reading and in condensed chart form for when you're about to start a project and are hot on the trail for the Just the Facts, Ma'am. In other words, it's very thoughtfully laid out and reader-friendly. Even the smaller print in some areas is easy for this 40+something to read without her reading glasses. I give this book high marks and recommend it to any beginner-to-intermediate stitcher wanting a good, solid fabric reference. I know the more advanced stitchers will already have one (or ten) books on fabrics and this guide is not really aimed at you, but it's still a nice read and I thoroughly enjoyed the \"extra\" information in the beginning and ending chapters. I think you will too, and it would make a great gift for a new stitcher you might like to encourage. * * * * *Now for the Giveaway — Please leave a comment on this post if you would like to be entered into the drawing for a copy of this book. Following me won't increase your odds of winning, but I do like to see that number go up. I'm just sayin'. ;-)The Giveaway will be open for one week. I will close comments on Monday, July 18, 2011 and the winner will be decided by the Random Number Generator thingie and posted on Tuesday, July 19, 2011. This Giveway is open to anyone, anywhere as long as you leave a comment below during the next week.* * * * **Note that while I was not paid for this review in any way by Sixth & Spring books, if you click the link above to Amazon, I am an Amazon affiliate and will receive a small (minuscule!) percentage of each sale generated by the click-through."},
{"title": "Shopping Day", "date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "text": "Caution:  Extreme Photo Heaviness Ahead!Today was errand and shopping day. First stop, the post office to drop off my sister's package. (From all the nice comments yesterday, I think I need to start taking orders for more of those blinged blue shirts! Uh, NOT!) Then it was on to the Marts — Steinmart and Walmart …First up, Steinmart. I went in to look for a new pair of white flip-flops. Did I find any? Nope, but the trip was not a loss as I hauled a lot of other pretty stuff out with me instead. On my way back to the shoe department, I spotted this shell, which I didn't buy but instead snagged with some cell phone pics so I can copy it later, or just dream I will. All of the embellishment is 1/2\" strips of bias, either ruffled or stitched on flat. The neck is trimmed in grosgrain as a visible facing. Onward to the shoe department, where I tried on and liked lots (no white ones though), and narrowed it down to three pairs. These are black and the straps are stretchy and criss-crossed through a ring at the front.Next, pewter metallic. I had been eyeing these in white on Zappos and I may end up getting them since this pair fits well. These were on sale and half the price as on Zappos. Last and favorite. Too bad I just gave my sister that top because these would look great with it. On to accessories and jewelry …Another chain belt similar to my gold one I showed a few posts back, but his one is bronze-y.And a necklace for $7 and 3 pairs of earrings for not much more. I had been thinking I need some bigger (but not crazy) earrings. These will work well for me.And finally, back through the clothes racks where I picked up two tops to study and return. My mom and sister call me the Queen of Return because I do that a lot. Buy things to look at for a while and then return them. But no harm, no foul, right? It's not like I wear them with tags hidden and then return them.Except I think I will go ahead and keep this one. It fits (regular size, not plus - wooohoooo!), will look great with my orange sandals and white skirt, and it was only $15.The reason I bought the top above and the white one below is because they are essentially the illustration views from this pattern, which is the pattern I used for the plain white shell I started before my trip (and which is still unfinished). Except the print has a little cap sleeve attached, which I liked. First, because the extra coverage is nice, but mostly because it means you can avoid the lameness of turning a narrow hem and stitching to finish the armhole. I think this is much cleaner and attractive.This is the plain white one. It's too tight (obviously!) and too sheer. Here it is next to the unfinished McCall's version on the right. Almost identical, but the McCall's has more drape to the cowl. I'm not sure if I really need an FBA because those horizontal stretch folds between the girls happen even if I pull the top up so the wider hip area is across the bust. I'm thinking it may just be what you get with a cowl plus boobs. I'll need to do more research on that and force myself to not be lazy if I decide I really should do an FBA. I do like having the RTW to compare and to see what they did for finishes but it will definitely be going back.Next, on to Walmart where I picked up two more cheap knit tops to study (and probably keep). I love this one. It's a raglan cowl with a black underlayer on the front only so you can see the black behind the cowl. I would prefer if the underlayer was white though, so I may just take this apart to make a pattern and re-do it with white. If I don't take it apart, I'm still going to make a pattern or morph an existing pattern. The two views are to show how long it is now and approximately where I'd hem it to.The yellow lines show the raglan seams, which the black underlayer is sewn into.And if I thought the top above was long, hoolie doolie - this one is nearly a dress. Maybe it's meant to wear with leggings? Yeah, well not on this girl!This one will be very simple to copy. It's a gathered neckline (below the band) with a cut-on neckband. On the neckband is an overlay (really just a loop) of gathered print. I can see my TNT Ottobre tee turned into more of these quite easily, don't you agree Belinda? ;-)The sleevecap is gathered and it's a flutter style, but not too much flutter which I like. And the modeling session is over. Back into my own clothes.Parting Shot: Between Steinmart and the UPS store, our daily summer afternoon deluge happened. I sat in the car for 15 minutes waiting for it to pass. I finally gave up and ran barefoot into UPS to drop off my box. I got hosed, but I didn't ruin my shoes since I left them in the car. While I was waiting in the car, I took some cell phone pics to share the joy. Can you tell how deep that car is? That happens in about 5 minutes here, and then 30 minutes later, it's gone and the streets are dry again. Welcome to the tropics. Time to put my umbrella back in reach again, instead of just tossed into the back where I couldn't reach it without getting out and soaked anyway."},
{"title": "Sunshine for My Sister", "date": "Sunday, July 10, 2011", "text": "Mission accomplished and I can get my sister's birthday gift in the mail on her actual birthday, even if it won't arrive until Wednesday. What can I say? I'm always late with birthdays. After FORTY-ONE years, she should be used to it. ;-)Here's a try-on, on a human model — ME! Hey, it's only natural to borrow clothes between sisters, right? This one has just enough extra ease and length added from my versions that it should fit her perfectly. (Yes, I'm still living in my white skirt, which you can see by the wrinkles. It's unusual to see me in all solids, isn't it? So not me.)And, of course, more bling. Arranging and then touching each crystal with the hot-fix wand took longer than making the top itself. I counted 138 crystals. I wish the camera captured how much this thing sparkles — she will light up a completely dark room. ;-)I continued them around the back of the neckband too.I didn't get to put the finishing touches on my dress, but it was a productive weekend in the sewing room so I'm happy.Yep. More fabric. Curse you Fabric.com. I was just browsing (I swear!) on Fabric.com and noticed new ITY knits since the last time I looked. I am powerless over a good knit print and before I knew it, I had $169+ worth of fabric sitting in my cart. But instead of pulling the trigger, I took a breath and walked away. And wouldn't you know, Fabric.com also noticed I had abandoned my cart and quickly emailed me a 15% off discount code to tempt me back. It worked. I really love ITY knits lately. First, they are a dependable order. What I mean by that is that I always know what I'm getting with them, unlike, say, rayon knits which can be hit or miss — and are usually miss. Second, the best prints seem to be ITY and you all know I love me a crazy print. But the strongest reason I'm loving on the ITYs is because they are very easy to sew/fit and are actually quite comfortable for me to wear. I know, polyester right? But I wore an ITY something (either dress or top) every day while I was away and most days I was outside a good deal of time. I sweated, yes, but not because of the polyester. It was HOT. You would be sweating buck nekked. ;-) But what I didn't do was stay wet and soggy. The ITY knits do breathe and they stay dry since moisture (a pretty word for sweat) quickly evaporates. In other sewing room news, I'm making progress on my planned weekend projects. The embroidering of the RTW shirts is done. Here's the tees and polos for my BIL:And the \"special edition\" for my sister …… which has been properly blinged. Hey, if Elizabeth can make up verbs, so can I, right? ;-) I added some hot-fix crystals to the wheels of the truck and car and a line underneath it all, plus one yellow crystal for the truck's flashing light. Cute, yes? Lisa will love it. I think she got the sparklie thing from me in my younger days, when as my kid sister she used to adore and worship me. Ahem. ;-) But really, I used to wear a lot of flash. Now I'm old and boring. I think I should change that. Well, the boring part anyway. Can't do much about the old. Speaking of embroidery, why is it that as soon as you walk away for just a minute, the thread jams? I diligently sat in front of the machine the entire time during the first four stitch-outs and they all were smooth sailing without a hiccup. Then I started the fifth and last and decided I wanted a drink so I left the machine stitching and went downstairs to the kitchen to grab some water. Yep, you guessed it. When I got back upstairs, the thread had jammed, the stitching had stopped, and I had part of a \"G\" to clean up and stitch again. Arghh. After the embroidery was done, I cut out Lisa's birthday top and it's ready to sew this morning as soon as I switch serger and coverstitch threads. I decided on the Hot Patterns Sunshine Top, with a few minor alterations that I made while cutting. The \"hand-me-down\" tops I brought her were both sleeveless, but I know she has bigger arms than I do so I widened the sleeve and armhole a little bit. I also made it longer for her long torso and I added a little more tummy and booty room since hers are bigger than mine. Good thing she doesn't read this or she'd KILL me for saying that."},
{"title": "Miscellaneous Saturday Musings", "date": "Saturday, July 9, 2011", "text": "I'm slowing getting back into the home groove after being away. My laundry is done. My suitcase and cosmetic bag are back in the attic, and I'm ready to pass the weekend in the sewing room.My sister's birthday is on Monday, so I won't actually hit the date but I'm going to make her a top this weekend and she'll get it mid-week. Even though I'll be late, I think it's still nice to get a birthday gift after the actual date to keep the celebration going a little longer. At least that's what I'm telling myself. ;-) I haven't decided on the pattern yet, but I'll be using this turquoise ITY knit (which looks more blue than turq in this pic but it's not).I'm thinking either a Sunshine Top or a Jalie waterfall top. Both of these are TNT for me, and I should be able to use either for my sister with minimal adjustment. I always thought she was wider in the shoulders than me, but I brought up two of my \"cast-offs\" for her and the one I saw her wearing fit perfectly in the shoulders so I won't make any adjustments there. I will need to add tummy room and keep the length longer than my own preference since she's 6 feet tall and all torso.  These are the tops I brought to her. First up, the Petite Plus Shapely Shirt that I made sleeveless a couple of years ago. As I was packing for my trip, I was also clearing out the closet and when I tried this on, it was HUGE, just completely swimming on me. I gave it to my sister last Saturday morning before we headed out for our day on the boat and she immediately put it on and wore it. It fits her perfectly and I think she'll wear it a lot this summer as it has her favorite color (turquoise) in it. Plus, she loved the matching buttons.The other top I gave her was this new Sorbetto. I put it through the laundry and it did not shrink a bit. I decided it was just too loose for me to be comfortable and it would gather dust. I'm not sure if this one fits my sister — it might be too small on her, but at least it's out of my closet. I wish I had more of the fabric since it's so nice, but I don't. Can't cry over \"spilt fabric.\" This is what my sewing table looks like right now. At the left side are (RTW) 2 navy tees, 2 navy polos, and 1 turquoise tee. The purple is a rayon knit I was using to test an embroidery I put together yesterday. Embroidering the RTW shirts is my project for this morning.My BIL bought a flat-bed tow truck last year and has been running a side business with it. My sister had set up a crappy DIY website and had begged me to re-do it, but I was always too busy. Then when I lost my job in April, I had some free time. I asked her for the login info and spent a couple of days redesigning it and updating the search elements. Since then, they have been getting LOTS of calls. So … I thought I'd thank my BIL for his help with Tyler's car by sending him a few shirts he can wear out on the tow jobs. I'm doing one in turquoise for my sister too, and will add some sparklie bling to it so it's more her style. This is the quickie \"logo\" I'm going to use. I think I'll design something nicer down the road and reacquaint myself with my digitizing software but I know they'll appreciate the quickies for now.Then, if I get through my sister's new top and the embroidery and still have time left over, I will deal with this dress. I ended up not taking it on my trip because I didn't finish the sideseams or the hem and I'm still trying to decide if I want it short or long. I didn't miss it though. I lived in the dresses I did bring, plus my refashioned white denim skirt. I actually got 3 wearings out of that before it hit the laundry. Pretty good for a white skirt, and for me not messing it up. I can see that it's going to get worn to death this summer. I already love that thing. I think I'll even shop for another pair of cheapie white Walmart capris to make a replacement skirt in a smaller size when this one gets too big. I brought 2 pairs of capris with me for the trip but didn't wear pants at all. Like I said last post, it was SO HOT and dresses and skirts were the way to go. Just as a point of reference, it was 96-98 degrees at my sister's. It pretty much never gets above 93-94 here in the summer and is usually closer to 91-92. Those few degrees seem to make a big difference in my comfort factor.Parting Shot: A better shot of Tyler's \"new\" car, in its current home. He can't wait to lose that front license plate once his Florida plate arrives and he can ditch the Virginia temporaries. I'm sure you can see why this car appeals to him much more than a \"boring\" new Hyundai."},
{"title": "I'm Back, With Photos", "date": "Thursday, July 7, 2011", "text": "I got back yesterday afternoon, after a long, long, LONG drive. I had a GREAT time and my dorky pics below do not do any justice to the fun we had. I'm just glad I remembered to take out the camera every once in a while.So, let's start our review of \"How Debbie Spent Her Summer Vacation,\" shall we? ;-)I left last Thursday about 6:00 AM and drove straight through to Cherry Point, NC. My new GPS I bought last month sent me off on a slightly different route than my son's GPS I had been using previously — and it saved me a LOT of time. This time, the trip took just over 11 hours, including a couple of stops for gas and potty breaks. Last time, the trip was about 13 hours including stops.I pulled into the base about 5:30 PM and waited for Tyler to meet me at the gate so I could get my entry pass. Since he wasn't expecting me for a couple more hours, he had made plans to help two friends change the oil in their cars so we drove to the \"Hobby Shop\" where I watched the car maintenance. It's a great facility for these guys — a complete auto repair shop with lifts and tools and helpers, all for $2 an hour. There are about 12 bays total. This pic shows only 3 of them:Here are the guys under one of the cars they worked on. Can you see how clean the floor is? After each use, the Marines have to sweep and mop before they can check out.After the car shop, we drove to Tyler's barracks so he could clean up and change. Then we had some dinner and checked into my hotel. Tyler spent the night with me in the hotel and left early for work the next morning. This aviation display was at the tourist center behind my hotel and I snapped this pic as I was heading back to base the next morning.Friday was a work day for Tyler, but his CO let them all leave around noon. He got permission to take me on a little tour of his \"shop\" and the flight line. This is Tyler in the hangar with his hand on what he does — ordnance, i.e., BOMBS. I probably wasn't allowed to take pics so I won't say here exactly why this Harrier jet was completely dismantled, but it was. And it was cool to see it in pieces.After our little tour, Tyler got his hair cut so he wouldn't have to worry about it upon return. Male Marines have to get their hair cut at least once per pay period. (I got some sideways glances as I sat in the barber shop with him, since not too many females go into the place. I said I was there for a \"high and tight\" too. lol) After the barber shop, we walked back to his barracks, packed up his clothes and then we left for Richmond VA around 4 PM.We got to my sister's house a little before 8 PM, had a late dinner, and then we all headed out to a redneck bar up the street. Tyler was recognized as a Marine without having said a word and scored a couple of free drinks for his service. This is Tyler and my sister Lisa shaking booties on the dance floor.We drank and danced some more and played some darts. Lisa lost. LOSER! ;-) My BIL Marty won.The next morning, Tyler found Marty's silly cap and we all had a giggle and wondered what the reaction would be if he showed up on base with it.Saturday was spent out on the water (the York River), near my mom's house where Lisa and Marty dock their boats. My mom lives about an hour from my sister so it's a great deal for both - no Marina fees for my sister and my mom gets regular visits. We took the \"party boat\" out for some fishing and touring. The weather was gorgeous, but very hot. It's hotter there in summer than here in Florida, but no one ever believes me. We slathered sunscreen on but I still managed to come home with a red face, which is starting to peel today. Lovely. Mom and son:Tyler and Marty (with a fish):The requisite \"King of the World\" pose on a boat:Later, back at Lisa's, getting ready to cook the crabs we caught:Sunday morning, Tyler and I took off alone to do some car shopping, which was one of the goals of our trip. Car shopping around his base is awful. Mostly trucks, and very small inventories of everything. A few weeks ago I suggested we shop around Richmond since there are tons of car dealers and a much bigger population so many more choices. We started at a Hyundai dealer. Tyler tried out a new Elantra, which was nice in a very sedate, \"mom\" sort of way. In other words, not really anything a 22-year old Marine gets excited about. But he had pretty much resolved to go with boring since his loan approval wasn't enough for exciting and cool. Hah! Background note: Tyler has his Jeep on base now, but it's old and the AC doesn't work and is too expensive to fix, and it's just not a comfortable ride for weekend getaways. It's fine for short trips around town, and hauling stuff. But he really wanted something else too. Plus he's Tyler, which if you knew him you'd know that means he always has to have more than one vehicle at his disposal. He's been like this since he could walk — first with trikes and Power Wheels, then ATVs and dirt bikes, then real cars. So, we got back from our test drive and he says, \"Hey, I think I see an Impreza over there\" … at the very far, far end of the used lot. And figures, he was right. The dealership had just taken in a Subaru Impreza WRX the previous night as a trade and it wasn't really on the lot yet, it was on the dirt road behind the lot. It hadn't been inspected yet and wouldn't be until Tuesday when the mechanics were back after the holiday. That meant he could only \"test\" it in the parking lot. Which he did. And he was in love. You see, the Impreza WRX is EXACTLY the car he really wanted and had been talking about for the last few months. But the new ones are too expensive and the older models are impossible to find. The salesman told us that the manual transmission didn't go into 3rd gear, but my BIL Marty is a certified mechanic at a Honda dealership in Richmond, so if that's all that was wrong with the car, he could fix it. So we left a deposit on it, said we'd return the next day with my BIL to look it over, and we then headed back to my sister's for the evening festivities, which was …Marty's race at the local track. That's him in the 28.It was an exciting race, to say the least. Marty didn't win. But there was LOT of contact between him and this blue car (his arch nemesis!) and it made for exciting spectating, although my sister wasn't exactly thrilled to see her husband spun around numerous times. lol Here's Tyler sitting in the race car later that night after it was back home at my sister's. You can see some of the damage on this side. The other side is much worse. Marty races again in 2 weeks, so he's got some repairs to do.Sitting in the stands at the track was like sitting in an oven and it brought back memories of sitting in stands for high school football games. We all got more sun and sweated out about 5 pounds. Lisa and Tyler hit the pool as soon as we got back.Monday morning, we all headed back to the car dealer so Marty could look over the Impreza. Except for the transmission, he deemed it to be in great condition mechanically. Cosmetically, the interior is perfect and the exterior has only a few small dings. We told the salesman we'd be back in the morning to road test it after the inspection and that Tyler would be buying it unless it blew up on the road test or something. We lazed around back home for a couple of hours. Well, \"we\" did — Marty spent the afternoon building a little stairway/deck up to their pool. Tyler helped a little, but Marty had it well in control and was done in just a couple of hours. Around 5 PM we headed out to Marty's family's gathering for some 4th of July cookout food and a couple of games of \"Cornhole,\" bean bags thrown at opposing targets with a cut-out hole. Something I had never heard of until my first trip to see Tyler at Cherry Point. Apparently, it's a very popular game in the South. Who knew!The weather wasn't too great the night of the 4th, but we did finally manage to light off our fireworks arsenal back at Lisa's around 10 PM, and then soon after called it a night since Lisa and Marty had to get up for the work the next morning and Tyler and I had to go buy a car and then return to base.The Impreza did pass inspection, and Tyler bought it at a great price (far below market even including a trannie replacement) and will be able to pay off the loan a lot faster than if he bought a new car, which will be much better for his checkbook. He'll return to Richmond with it in a few weeks when he and Marty will put in the new transmission to be ordered. Until then, he'll just drive without 3rd gear, which isn't really a big problem. 1st or 4th would have been much worse. Here it is driving in front of me as we headed back to NC. And a silly shot out the back window when I was in front. I'm surprised it came out at all, since I was driving and had just held the camera up and quickly clicked. Excuse the bird poop on my window.All in all a very busy week, but lots of fun. Tyler hasn't had this many days off in a row since he graduated boot camp so he was enjoying his \"lazy civilian time\" as he called it. I had a great time but I'm also happy to be back home with my pups, who I missed a lot. Oh, and Alex too. hahahahaParting Shot: A sign seen on the drive back. What exactly is Jesus Couture??"},
{"title": "What I Wore to the Interview", "date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "text": "Yesterday, Juliane commented:\"Since you are building a work wardrobe, will you share a bit about how you are deciding WHAT clothes you need (your anticipated work environment, professional or casual, color choice, shoe styles, etc.). I am looking to return to work in academia and am also facing building a wardrobe from the ground up, and you seem to have such a good handle on this project that I thought maybe you would share your thought processes on this.\"I'm sorry to disappoint, Juliane, but I'm not really making new work clothes yet since I don't know where I'll be working. I'm trying to limp through interviews with my existing wardrobe pieces from my last job search 3 years ago. I do want to make a suit but I'm not going to rush it. As far as shoe styles, while I love the look of high heels, I can't wear them. I go for what I hope is a good mix of stylish and comfortable, but comfortable always comes first. I can't really be too picky right now, but I'd prefer an environment that is more business attire than casual. I don't really want to wear jeans to work every day. But I will if I have to. ;-)For the interview this morning, I went with the blue suit. This pic is after I returned home from the interview so I'm wrinkly from the car and a little disheveled after throwing the jacket back on. Check it out — I'm even wearing pantyhose (and I didn't hate it). The above pic and the next are a more accurate representation of the suit color vs. the last photos of it when I asked for opinions on skirt length. It's not a bad color on me but blue is just not one of my favorite colors in general. So why did I buy it? I have no idea, except that it was pretty cheap and fit well. Maybe I was thinking of using it as a pattern, but I don't remember at this point. I decided on this skirt length (obviously!). Any shorter and I don't think I would've been comfortable while sitting and exposing half of my chubby thighs. At this length while sitting, it rises up to just above my knees. With the suit, I wore this Ottobre Woman blouse I made 3 years ago. It's hard to tell, but in real life there is a perfectly matching blue inside the roundish thingies in the print and the taupe is a good color on me and (I think) a pleasing contrast to the blue. The pin looks kind of like a crab in this pic, but it's actually a cursive H turned diagonally. It was my grandmother's and the H was for her — Helen. The interview itself went very well. I think I'm probably perfect for the job and I was getting the feeling they thought so too. But — it's in St. Pete, not Tampa, so it's a bit more of a commute. It's a HUGE place and I'm sure there would be advancement opportunities, and they have a great benefits package. But I'm not counting any chickens at this point. Time to wait and see. Yesterday, I did start the McCall's cowl neck top I showed last post, but ended up abandoning it because I didn't like how fiddly the cowl is and it just wouldn't sit nice under the jacket. I really need an FBA with it too. I was just winging it on resizing, since I ended up with the envelope of smaller sizes because I went with \"Medium\" without realizing it was for 12-14. I used my TNT Ottobre tee as a sloper to adjust against. It fits OK, but across the bust is definitely too tight. I'll revisit this once I get back from my trip. I have enough white ITY left for another shell of some sort, whether it's this one again or not.This is what I changed into about 5 minutes after the suit pics were taken. It's the Walmart dress that reminds me of See & Sew 5593. The print/color is kind of bland on me, but it's fine for around the house and/or running errands. Except I'll never go to Walmart actually wearing it. Does anyone else do that — NOT wear clothes (or fabrics) to the places they came from?This will be my last post until I'm back from my trip. I'm hoping to leave at 5 AM tomorrow morning, and I still have a hem to sew and laundry to finish, and then pack my stuff plus Tyler's list of more stuff to bring him. What does a Marine do with FOUR guitars in a barracks room he shares with another Marine?Have a great holiday weekend (or just weekend to the non-USAers)!"},
{"title": "What I'm Wearing Today", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "text": "I've been wearing my \"new\" skirt all day, and it passes, but the next time I do this (and there *will* be a next time since I still have blue and black denim capris in the too-big pile), I will make a kick pleat in the back. It's a little bit tricky getting into the car and going potty. ;-)The top is my latest make of the Sunshine Top I showed you last week. I love it with this white skirt and this is what I'll be wearing on Friday in Virginia (after a run through the laundry, of course). Can you see my gold chain belt? I dug this out of the drawer. I bought it over 15 years ago and it now fits again. I love this belt, so you may get sick of seeing it. I hemmed one dress this morning (the blue print tie-front one) and still have the Vogue to do. That will be either be tonight or, more likely, Wednesday afternoon after my interview since I still have to hem my blue skirt for the interview tomorrow (I think I have another one being set up for after I return from my trip too) and I'm actually thinking of making a plain white shell to wear with it and I haven't even cut the pattern tissue yet! Yeah, Deadline Debbie - that's me. ;-)Here's the pattern (like the solid red one in the drawing below the photos). Now, I'd better get busy! Fingers crossed the power doesn't die again, since a t-storm is going overhead right now.Vogue 8724 is nearly done. I need to serge the sideseams and then hem it. I think I'm leaving it ankle length for now, with the option to change my mind when I'm tired of tripping on it going up the stairs. I bound the neckline using my CS machine. I trimmed the back neckline for the binding, but left the front alone.I solved the armhole problem with binding too. It looks really small here, but this fabric is very stretchy. See? (Yes Andrea, the armhole problem is basically that the bust needs more room but it's also the short kimono sleeve combined with a full bust. They don't usually mix too well.)So now I have two new dresses for my upcoming trip that are nearly finished and awaiting hems. I thought I'd get that done tonight but I found myself distracted by a flashback to my teenage years and a weird feeling that I was actually contemplating \"refashioning\" something like all the trendy young women seem to be doing these days. Refashion? Me? Well, yeah, at least for tonight.As I was sewing the Vogue dress, I was thinking about what I wanted to bring to wear on my trip and I was really missing my now-too-big white capris, since they pretty much scream SUMMER! Remember these?Then it dawned on me that they are so big that they could be a white denim skirt without too much trouble. The last time I turned jeans into a skirt was back in 1970-something. Around the same time I was wearing hiphuggers, platform shoes, crop tops and had a flat tummy. I also remember hand-embroidering a big red heart on the butt of another pair of jeans I cut-off into shorts. Yeah, we old farts were refashioning and wearing designs on our backsides long before 2011, but I digress. So after dinner, I sat in front of Jeopardy with the capris and a seam ripper in my hands. Fifteen minutes later, I had the inseams and crotch completely ripped out and starting pin basting to resemble a pencil skirt shape. Yes, today was my day for getting stabbed with pins. (While I was doing this, I was also thinking of some sort of basting invention that is fast to put in, doesn't stab, is fast to take out, and is reusable. Sorry, but I came up with zilch.)So here's what the back looked like after a couple of tries. I ended ripping out all the existing center back stitching and cutting through the waistband so I could take it in about 4\" and blend that \"dart shape\" into the new CB seam. For the front, I overlapped the inseams and crotch curve and pinned it into place. I trimmed the inside with my serger after I was satisfied everything was working and double topstitched to mimic the original felled seams.Then, around 9:30 PM just as I had put the bottom edge to the serger to finish that edge before hemming it, there was a big crash outside and the power went out. This house could not possibly be any darker at night with no light sources. I fumbled my way downstairs to grab a flashlight and some candles. (The huge crash, BTW, always happens when the power blows. We have above-ground lines here and a big transformer box-thingie on a pole on the property line. Even though I know what the noise is, it still scares the bejeezus outta me.)I called the electric company and the recording told me they already knew and that power would be restored by 12:30 AM. Yeah, last time it was about 8 hours. I was so disappointed I was kicked out of my sewing room. But I did the next best thing and started reading by flashlight the new sewing books I was sent to review (more on that later!), and around midnight the power came back on. Yay!! Back to the sewing room to finish serging that hem, which I'll press and sew in the morning along with the other hems waiting for me. I made it a little bit tight both because it's stretch denim and I'm planning to keep shrinking me. So here's the nearly finished skirt. I'm so happy with it. It was fast, free, and fills the casual white bottoms void. I probably won't wear tops tucked in with it and I certainly won't wear my PJ top. ;-)Back view. The pockets used to have jeans buttons on them, but I noticed one was gone so I cut the other one off and sewed the flaps down. Those flaps always curled up anyway, so this is a good solution for me. Parting Shot: We had a visitor this afternoon. Meet Bandit (who's checking out all the crap still on my sewing room floor). He lives sort of behind me, and has a yard with a wooden slat fence that needs to be secured in one spot. Until it is, Chili visits him on a regular basis and sometimes Bandit comes into our yard. No one answered at Bandit's house, so we had him until about 8:30 PM when his dad got home. He's a very friendly dog and is welcome to visit anytime."},
{"title": "What's More Painful?", "date": "Monday, June 27, 2011", "text": "… trying on an in-progress garment that's been pinned together, or ripping out basting stitches? I do both, but I can't decide which method I like best (or least).Anyway — here's what I'm working on now, Vogue 8724. KMQ enabled me on this one after hers turned out so pretty!  And kudos for Vogue Patterns' speedy delivery. I ordered this on Wednesday last week, on the last day of their sale (with some others, ahem) and the order was sitting in my mailbox on Saturday, just in time for this pattern to be my next project. (Did I mention I should be making a suit? Hah! I'm taking a cue from Peter on that one for the moment.)Vogue 8724I got it cut out yesterday, but then I lost steam in the sewing room after sewing the front pleats and left it. This morning, I got up bright and early and sewed the bust darts and back princess seams and then pinned all the pieces together and prepared myself for the painful try-on. Ouch!I cut an 18 as usual for the upper chest and it fits fine there (sorry Ann, I think I just blew your theory) and morphed to the 20 for everywhere else. Technically, it fits but there ain't no graceful drape below those pleats as they go over my tummy. Hah! That's OK, the tummy is going down so I'll just let the knit compensate and camouflage for the time being and not adjust it. This pattern has separate bust cup pieces, which is fantastic since I made NO FIT ALTERATIONS whatsoever. How often does that happen? I will need to do something about this, which KMQ did warn about but did I listen? I think I will just cut two new bodice pieces. Or I'll live with it. I'm still deciding.This is the right side of the fabric, which I'm sure many of you will recognize. It's one of my very favorites and I bought TONS of it when Lucy's Fabrics was still selling the Best Rayon/Lycra Prints ever. Sigh. That means you will see it again at some point. I drank the Kool-Aid and this pattern also fell into my cart last week. I'm not sure my stomach is ready for it yet, though. Vogue 1250This is definitely my Summer of the Knit Dress, but they are so comfortable and cool to wear and I think I'll get more mileage from them as I keep losing weight.Thanks so much for all the nice comments on the M6363 dress fiasco in my last post. I really do like the third version and getting it to work wasn't that hard. There's only 4 pieces (w/o the sleeves) and two of those are the ties. Yes, it sucks that the pattern has those oddities I pointed out. But since I have now pointed them out to you, the fixes won't take you long if you really do want to make it - even out the shoulders and tuck the CF/CB if it's too wide for you. Just buy the pattern on sale instead of being impatient like I was and you'll be even less irked at McCall's than I was. ;-)"},
{"title": "McCall's 6363: The Dirt", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "Usually, I wouldn't keep going this far on a pattern that is obviously poorly drafted and just plain weird, but I actually liked how it looked on me and thought I could fix the weirdness without too much trouble. I was wrong. It's more trouble than I want to deal with right now. But I will end up with one wearable and one maybe-wearable dress, so it's not a total loss.Again, here's the muslin:A close-up shows some of the oddities. The biggest problems are that the shoulders are two different sizes and shapes and the way the dress is pulled when it's tied makes the armholes behave differently. On one side (your left), the underarm is really low and shows the bra, even worse than what this photo shows since I've actually got a tank on under this muslin. On the other side (your right), the strap wants to slide off my shoulder and my beige bra strap is showing.I thought I could simply fold the pattern over itself and trace one  armhole/shoulder to get two that matched. As I said earlier, I was  wrong.The way the dress pulls, the armholes actually have to be  different so they appear the same when worn. So, I raised  the armhole on your left and filled it in where my bra was showing, and I  made both shoulder seams the same length because while the two  different shaped armholes *may* be an actual design necessity (I'm still not sure on this one), the fact that one front was a good 1/2\" longer than the back shoulder seam is simply a drafting error.With  that done, I cut #2. And cursed myself for choosing this crappy rayon  knit. I know both Fabric.com and Fabric Mart have been selling these  prints like crazy, but they really are not the best quality.  As you can sort of see in the pic below, the neckline is too big and is now folded over and pinned, until I decide what I'm going to do with it. I'm tempted to just throw it away. I bound the neckline and armholes on my CS machine. That went OK, but too bad the neckline is too big.Here's the other problem with the pattern. It rides up one hip because of the tie in front pulling everything in weird directions. As you can see, the pattern is also not very friendly to linear prints in the back since the CB seam is shaped and you cannot match motifs all the way down. Here's version #3, which has all the pattern corrections I'm going to make on this one. I used an ITY knit that I've had in the stash for a while, unloved, since I'm not really a \"blue\" person. But the print has grown on me, and it's OK for summer casual. I think this is the dress I will wear on my sister's boat next weekend.The back still doesn't match up perfectly, and never will, but it's much better than the #2 version and isn't quite so glaring.The ITY has more recovery and the back doesn't ride up as quickly, but it does still ride up so it' a dress that needs regular adjustment. I also used clear elastic on the neckline and armholes, which I think is helping to keep things in place better than the versions without it. I ZZ'd it onto the wrong side and then turned under a 3/8\" hem and coverstitched.I narrowed the neckline by making at tuck at the center of the neckline, which, yes, is off to the right of the pattern like it looks here. On the back piece (not shown), I cut the CB seam about 3/4\" deeper, starting from the neckline and tapering to nothing over about 6 inches.If you look carefully, you can see the different adjustments to each armhole and the different shapes of the straps. Even though one is included, I cannot believe a sleeve will work with this and if you look at the pattern illustration, the sleeved views are drawings only — not modeled by a human. A more careful look at the pattern photo shows exactly the problems I encountered, but they are easy to miss when you are trusting an envelope and are intrigued by an unusual style. The green line divides the model in half, but look at how weird and uneven the neckline and shoulders sit on her now that I'm pointing it out.I'm really disappointed with this pattern because I like the idea of it and it looks good on me! I have ideas of better ways to execute the design and I may try it out one day, but for now, I'm moving on."},

{"title": "McCall's 6363: Muslin Thoughts", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2011", "text": "Before I talk about my muslin for M6363, I have to say \"I told ME so!\" As soon as I buy fabric for a suit, I get an interview (from a company who's been holding on to my resume for at least a month). The interview is next Wednesday and I don't think I will have time to fit and make up a complete untested suit pattern by then without stress and/or frustration but I'll keep it as Option #1 for now. Option #2 is to hem the skirt on the blue suit. Option #3 is to shop for and buy a RTW suit. I'll have to weigh those options and make a decision by Saturday. Don't be surprised if I go for all 3 options. But hey — at least I have an interview! (I even had my hair trimmed today before I found out, so I'm ready in that regard.)OK, so on to the muslin …I used a really crappy rayon knit with minimal stretch and no intention whatsoever for this to be wearable. I cut an 18 at the shoulders and straight 20 everywhere else, with no adjustments except for square shoulders at the shoulders only, not the armholes yet. New setting on camera = less blurryIt's snug, but it basically fits. Except that I think I need to start cutting a 16 at the neckline and shoulders because this one feels a little loose up top, like the last dress. That's nice, but it also sucks since 16 and 18 are usually the split in pattern sizes. Thankfully, it's not too hard to grade down necklines and armholes.The pattern itself is drafted like crap, with at least three glaring errors. Is that karma for paying the non-sale price for it? First, since one of the views is maxi length, the front and back pieces are each horizontally split and you have to join the parts into a whole before cutting fabric. The front piece is below. Can you see that it doesn't match up? It's not me — if you match one side (which I did), there's no way the other side will line up. Easy fix, but something the proofers should have caught.Next, do you see the notation to Gather? WTF? There's no shoulder gathering in the line drawing or instructions and it's only on this one side.And worse, both shoulders and armholes are different sizes/shapes. No wonder BMV is looking for pattern drafters! ;-)Still, I like the design even though it's the oddest thing I've ever seen — mistakes or not. Look at this! It's a big pouch of fabric that hangs like a saggy boob until you stretch it across and tie it off. At first, I thought the instructions were wrong for attaching the ties because I was thinking it tied on the opposite side. But once I actually did exactly as the instructions instructed and looked at the line drawing again to check what side was what, all was well. I made it far more complicated than it is. What a dork.I'm going to narrow the neckline and raise the armholes and then cut it from a nicer fabric with more stretch. Since I'm still unemployed and with the luxury of time, I've decided to again make the long drive to North Carolina, pick up Tyler and then head to my sister's in Virginia for the 4th of July weekend. One day over the weekend will be spent frying like eggs on my sister/BIL's boat, which is docked at my mom's an hour away so we'll see her too. I think this dress in a soft rayon knit will be perfect for the outing since I'm not yet at a point where I'll even go near a bathing suit. Hopefully, next summer. Parting Shot: The Marine is \"deployed\" this week. Not really deployed, just a week-long training exercise which has his squadron living in \"tin can\" barracks with no a/c, sleeping on cots, and doing their jobs as if they were deployed, including live ordnance — aaack! He's enjoying it, but he also seems to have a lot of down time for goofing off like in this photo (read his note on the tank and maybe you can guess what he wishes was really in his camelback/canteen).I was contacted by author Melissa Bourbon Ramirez in March when she asked if I would like to receive an advance copy of her latest book, Pleating for Mercy. She provided a link to her website, where I saw the cover illustration and read the book's intro:All the Cassidy women possess special gifts. Harlow Jane Cassidy’s is creating beautiful dresses. But she’s about to discover secrets in her own family, and another gift—one that can reach beyond the grave…When her great-grandmother passes away, Harlow Jane Cassidy leaves her job as a Manhattan fashion designer and moves back to Bliss, Texas. But soon after she opens Buttons & Bows, a custom dressmaking boutique in the turn-of-the-century farmhouse she inherited, Harlow begins to feel an inexplicable presence…One of her first clients is her old friend Josie, who needs a gown for her upcoming wedding. But when Josie’s boss turns up dead, it starts to look as if the bride-to-be may be wearing handcuffs instead of a veil. Suddenly Josie needs a lot more from Harlow than hemming a dress. Can Harlow find the real killer—with a little help from beyond?Dressforms, rolls of fabric, and a sewing machine on the cover? The main character a dressmaker involved in a mystery? How could I say no? Of course I wanted to read this!The book arrived in early May but I had to put it on hold for a little while due to my then-upcoming trip to North Carolina and Virginia, and job-search activities. I finally was able to start reading it a couple of weeks ago, and then right as I was getting near the end, I left it at my dentist's office and there it sat for a week. Arghh. I picked it up yesterday and finished it last night.So, how was the book? It was captivating and a very enjoyable read. Ms. Ramirez does an excellent job of weaving together a murder-mystery with our favorite hobby/obsession — sewing! There are varied characters you'll get to know through the author's wonderfully detailed descriptions and you'll still be trying to guess \"whodunit\" by the last few pages when the mystery is finally solved. As the story unfolds, there's a little love interest for Harlow, some spiritual magic, lots of sewing, and even a number of cultural references only real stitchers will get.This is a fun read, perfect for vacation or, if you're like me, holed up on your bed turning the pages at 2 AM to find out what happens. I'm looking forward to the next installment in this new series.Pleating for Mercy will be released on August 2, 2011 and is available for pre-order from Amazon, paperback and Kindle, by clicking here. (I have received no compensation beyond the advance copy.)"},

Well, except for no feet. Imagine my orange sandals please. Back to the original post below …* * * * *The dress is done and I'm wearing it right now. I went to the library today and to Publix (grocery store). So, how sad is it that my library card *expired* and they had to reactivate it? That's not to say I don't read — I do. I just haven't been to the library lately. Like in two years! I also had a $7.50 fine to pay. Oops. So, the above pic is nice and clear, in focus, etc. As soon as I go for the mirror shots, all hell breaks loose as seen below. I'm still using Tyler's camera and it hates mirror shots. I really need to explore the thing some more and experiment with its settings to see if I can improve things. Until then, you're stuck with these:Arms cut off, blurry.Arms included, but still blurry. Wet hair in both. Truth be told, I'm not all the way thrilled with the orange trim. It looks better when you're looking at the dress as a whole, but maybe I should've just stuck with the same print. Oh well, I ain't ripping it out now. It will grow on me. Like mold.I ended up taking two pleats in the front so the dress shoulders wouldn't slide off of my shoulders. This worked. The rest of the dress is still too big though, so next time I will fix that. The sleeves as they are now are HUGE and if I lift my arms, you can see straight into them at my bra. Note to self: Don't lift arms in mixed company!Speaking of the sleeves, I trimmed them in orange too for no particular reason except to carry the orange theme a little too far.Tonight, I'm going to clear off the sewing table which is still holding yesterday's haul, the pattern for the dress above, and a few other odds and ends and then I'm going to veg with a book or two. Most are nutritional/diet reference books and one is a Scott Turow novel. I'm afraid if I start the novel, I'll lose the rest of the week so I'm going to hold off on that until the weekend. Plus, I'm near the end of another book except I left it at the dentist's last week. They're holding it for me but I keep forgetting to stop by. You would think I'd be on auto-pilot for that place by now but I'll be near there tomorrow for something else, so I'll get it then and finish it before starting the next one. I don't like \"UFOs\" in my novel reading same as projects in the sewing room.Parting Shot:  Here's the McCall's 6363 pattern piece I mentioned yesterday. Isn't that hilarious?While unemployed, job-hunting, and changing my overall lifestyle, I've been trying to make it a point to go *somewhere* every day. Even if it's just a very small errand. Yes, this burns a little extra gas but it forces me to get dressed for going out instead of giving in to the temptation to stay in my PJs until dinnertime, which in turn makes me feel better about stuff in general. (Of course, with all the new clothes I'm making and the old ones I'm fitting into, my laundry has doubled but that's another story!).Monday's outing was Joann's. You're thinking, uh-oh, right? Well, you wouldn't be wrong. It was a good day for the sewing room, since my Fabric.com UPS delivery was waiting for me upon my return. Here's everything all together:The coveted McCall's pattern, for which I was too impatient to wait for a sale. But sometimes you just have to feed the soul and not quibble over a few bucks. This dress has the weirdest front pattern piece I've ever seen. I'll show it to you as soon as I start working on it, which will be in the next day or so.Next, thread — which  was my \"excuse\" for going to J's in the first place since I was out of some of my basic colors. I pile up the empties and take them with me to replace, which is why you see empty spools in this pic. (Yes, I should just make a list, but this works for me so it's what I do.) I also bought buttons. More on that project in a second but I noticed today that Joann's button walls seem to have improved. There are a lot more choices and prettier buttons than there used to be. It's about time.This is what the buttons are for. Ignore the plaid; it's for \"winter\" so will be stashed for a while but it caught my eye so I had to get it, and I don't usually wear plaid so I have no idea what's up with that. Underneath the plaid is a dark taupe poly suiting, which was 50% off today and so I got it for less than $4/yd. I'm going to make a suit and here's my reasoning — as soon as I start on this very interview-appropriate suit, I will find a job. You know, Murphy's Law and all. (Hey, it happened last time I made an office wardrobe!) Plus, I need a more complicated (slow!) project or my closet is going to explode from my recent output. The Simplicity pattern is for the jacket. I already had it from the last trip to Joann's during the $1 Simplicity sale. I'll decide on a skirt pattern after the jacket is done. I may even use this Simplicity for that too since I think my TNT is going to be too big.  Jane, I blame you for this book. ;-) Seeing it on your blog over the weekend planted the seed and then your comment about the convenience of all of the flowers in one place did me in. With a 50% off coupon, it was $7 of eye candy I couldn't pass up.The Fabric.com haul. The prints are headed for the washer. The solids will be stacked in the closet for a minute. This white solid replaces the one I just returned as the first one was much too gray of a white for me; I wanted bright white. Thankfully, this one is so it will become a simple shell very soon.Finally, the orange ITY knit against the orange in the latest dress fabric. Perfect match. So that's what I'm off to work on now since I'm really writing this Monday evening even though you're reading it Tuesday. I told you, patience is not something I'm known for. ;-)"},
{"title": "Simplicity 3874: In Progress", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2011", "text": "I didn't get the total evening of peace and solitude I thought was coming last night because *someone* didn't bother to check any movie times before leaving the house and so they ended up only doing dinner, when Alex was looking more forward to a movie than dinner. Sigh. I will refrain from posting further comment on that and will turn my attention to my dress instead. Here's how it looks now. It's not done yet, but it's close. That's a craaaaazy print, right? I wasn't sure I liked it when it arrived many months ago, which is why I was willing to \"sacrifice\" it in the name of a muslin if necessary. It's grown on me, though, and I think it's fun for summer.On the next make (yes, there will be another), one thing I will change will be to lengthen the casings so that they are closer together at CF. I think there's too much room between them when attached per the pattern markings. I don't like how much of the tie shows on either side of the knot. Not a big deal, for sure, but something I can improve on next time.The main thing I will need to change next time is sizing. This pattern is for wovens, not knits, and even though I took that into consideration, it's still a little too big on me. Next time, I will \"shave\" some width off the center front and center backs, top and bottom, to bring everything down a size or two. On this one, I started with the 18 for the neckline and morphed to 22 for waist-hips. I should've started with the 16 and morphed to 20. It's OK on this one because the semi-elastic waist ties cinch everything in. For the neckline, though, I may need to add some gathers to the CF before I finish it. Right now, it sits way too wide on my shoulders. I'm planning to add a neckband (not a binding) and that will close in the neckline somewhat, but I haven't decided yet if that will be enough without the gathers. I have some orange ITY knit arriving from Fabric.com today and if it looks good with the print, I will make the neckband from that — both to give the eyes something to rest on and also so it ties into my orange sandals. If it doesn't match, then print neckband it is.This is the pattern — Simplicity 3874. I originally bought it for the dresses, but tried a failed experiment with the jacket a few years ago. I've had these dresses in my \"on deck\" basket for a long time. I wish I hadn't waited so long. Parting Thought: I want this pattern and I want it NOW! BMV has Vogues on sale right now. Waaahhhh, why not McCall's?? Do I want it badly enough to pay $11.37 for it, along with the Vogues at $4.99 that are already in my BMV cart, or can I have patience enough to wait until all BMVs are on sale? I wish I knew how long I'd have to wait for that."},

If not, it will later. In either case, it's one more piece of out my stash.

Thanks to Sarah who posted about June's FNSI because I've been meaning to join this sew-along for a while but hadn't managed to get my act together. I'm happy to say that I actually started and finished TWO Friday Night projects. The first was to cut off the brown jeans I tried on the other day and make 'em capris. I cut off about 6\", pressed and topstitched the new hem, and now they'll get worn over the summer until they are too big. Yeah, not exactly a \"project,\" but it did involve sewing.Next, I made good on my repeated threats to make yet another Hot Patterns Sunshine Top. I've lost count, but I'm definitely over 5 on this pattern. I forget where I picked up this fabric. Does anyone recognize it?Here it is on Zillie:And here it is on fuzzy me, paired with my \"new\" capris. * * * * *A number of you asked about the animation from yesterday's post. I converted the pics to B/W GIFs in my photo-editing program and then ran them through an old little program I have that will take a bunch of GIF files in the order I select and make a GIF animation file.

I was digging through my closet again and pulled out this suit. It's still got the tags on it. I have no idea when I bought it but judging by the skirt, I was probably still in my 30s. Being blue, it's not even one of my colors but it's not horrible. I wish these crappy pics showed the actual color. But the good news is that it's an 18P with a pencil skirt and it fits. Anyway … I was playing with lengths by pulling the skirt up and down. Are you ready to give your opinion? Here we go …Original length. I know it's too long for 2011 and I wouldn't wear it now at this length, but I like it. I've got very thick calves and it hides them nicely.Shorter …Even shorter …As an A-line (blech) …Parting Shot: (which may take a few minutes to completely download and play through) — This is a B/W animation showing the usual routine when I'm taking mirror shots. I think it's a hoot!I just can't get enough of this dress — lol. My apologies if you're sick of this pattern by now. Today is a typical Florida June day — bright and sunny, a billion degrees and a billion percent humidity. Come on down! Frankly, I was enjoying the low humidity and no-rain days we'd been having until last night, when the skies finally opened and Arizona was pushed aside in favor of Florida again.After returning from a lunch date with Alex, I dragged my tripod downstairs and outside and stood in the shade, while sweating and feeling my make-up run off my face. All for some decent (read: non-crappy dirty mirror) pics. Ah, the sacrifices I make to show off. ;-)Here's the first make of this pattern. It's too hot/humid for the coral cardi today so I'm actually going sleeveless, and out in public too. I'm digging the \"farmer tan\" arms, aren't you?As usual, click any pic to englargeAnd make #3 from yesterday. I did take in the sideseams a smidge between this one and the two previous. Can you tell? There was a mention from \"t\" in the comments yesterday about this TNT maybe not being so TNT anymore, but since my shoulders won't change size, I can keep taking it in on subsequent makes for a long time.Definitely click to enlarge this one cuz those dots are doing weird thingsI tried to work on a new pose, but then a gnat flew into my eye.

Number 1 is the Hot Patterns Sunshine Top, runner up is the Ottobre Woman (02/2007) tee. Number 4 is probably the Jalie waterfall tee, and I'm too lazy to go find the pattern number. There is nothing like a TNT pattern that you can just cut and sew. I started cutting this about noon and finished sewing an hour ago, with blog reading, resume sending, dog walking, lunch, and laundry breaks in between. Oh wait, not quite finished since I still need to do the bottom hem but I needed another break first. Sewing is such hard work. ;-)For this one, I used the scoop neck version and kept the gathered short sleeves (OW 02/07) I added to the crossover version. I trimmed the seam allowances from the neckline and bound it with a binder attachment (3/8\" A) on my coverstitch machine, and added a flower front and center with a covered white button from the button bin. I think I love it!I also coverstitched along the front empire seam. I swear it's straight in real life — the pleats are making seam look wavy.You can sorta see the gathered sleevecap.The fabric is a brown/white ITY knit from Fabric Mart and speaking of favorites, I think ITY knits are also in my Top 3, or even Top 2. The \"good\" rayon/Lycra knit prints are Number 1, but they are getting harder and harder to find. And like Forrest Gump, \"That's all I have to say about that.\""},

Being able to share and know someone is out there paying attention is amazing. I'll also let you in on a little secret — one of my goals for 2012 is to travel to NYC for a fabric-buying trip and/or to another location for one of the sewing get-togethers (if I'm actually still welcome to any PR events, long story for another time!). Since I'm not embarrassed by how I look anymore, I'm looking forward to getting out and about! So watch out cuz I'm gonna be meeting some of you soon! ;-)* * * * *Before getting into the shower, I had another try-on session in front of the huge mirror in my bedroom.

So, my apologies but you'll have to use your imagination on some of these pics. Hey, at least my new cheapie Walmart PJs didn't shrink up in the wash. You'll be seeing those in nearly every pic. ;-)Here we go …These are green, and one of my favorites. I made them in 2006 and the last time they fit was probably in 2007.Now:(Click to Enlarge)2006:The \"Turkey Pants\" from 2008. Too big now. Yay!2008:(which reminds me, I need to dig out that jacket too)Brown jeans I made in 2008, which never fit again after I washed them a few more times. They fit now. One leg is cuffed up because I'm thinking of shortening them to capris, since they should be too big by the time it's winter here. And for laughs, \"Mom Jeans\" (khakis) from who knows when. The are RTW and I have never worn them. I don't know why I still have them, except maybe to crack myself up when I pull them out. Technically they fit, but look at those front saddlesbags that I don't even really have. More green jeans. From 2004 on the right. On the left, how they don't fit currently. These will be my next benchmark.(I still have that twinset too - I have a BIG closet!)I'm starting a box for all the too-big stuff. I'm not quite ready to toss or donate yet because I want to try on later for reference and the fat girl in me says keep 'em around just in case. Once the skinny girl appears and takes over, the box and its contents will go. So, yeah, I'll be moving a big box of trash. Parting Shot: Recent fabric purchases from Fabric Mart, Fabric.com, and Gorgeous Fabrics. One fabric not shown is a brown ITY knit with white polka-dots from the Fabric Mart order that arrived yesterday. I'm going to be using that next to make another casual summer dress.

{"title": "The Long Journey (and LONG post!)", "date": "Monday, June 13, 2011", "text": "Gwen asked, \"What diet are you following?\" The short answer is nothing in particular.The side story is … I did have success with Weight Watchers about 7-8 years ago and I contemplated it again but, truthfully, I just can't afford the fees right now and I was never impressed with our local meetings anyway. Those two things alone would make it a no-go. But I also remember being CONSUMED by the whole thing. Counting calories/fat/fiber, counting points, counting down until my next fix … er … meal, counting pounds lost and re-gained, counting my checkbook. Don't get me wrong — I think WW is basically a good system for many people and I did lose 60 lbs with it (all found again when I went off the plan), but I've come to the conclusion that it's just not for me. I need to get away from always thinking about food in one way or another. WW stresses that it's not really a diet but a lifestyle change. I disagree. In my mind, it's a diet. A lifestyle change to me is one that you don't have to think about too much after a certain point and it just becomes What You Do. I don't want to count points or calories for the rest of my life. But that's getting ahead of myself. Let's backtrack.The long answer is (pull up a chair) …I didn't actually set out to lose weight. With all the other upheavals going on in my life, I was relying on my old standby of food for comfort. I was finding lots of love in those cookies and Kit Kat bars. ;-)But then, I had major dental work (which is still ongoing and will be for a while), which forced a dietary change. I literally could NOT eat the same foods I used to. So, full disclosure time (pull an ottoman up next to that chair and put your feet up) …About 4 years ago, I was having some dental pain and went to a dentist who turned out to be horrible in a terribly insensitive sort of way. He told me point-blank that I'd have to have ALL of my teeth extracted and then started pushing implants to the tune of close to $50,000. (Yeah, like I could afford that. I could barely afford the $300 for the pleasure of that examination and bad news.) The bad teeth news wasn't new, even though I have *always* taken good care of my teeth and visited dentists regularly. I had been told previously that I needed periodontal work, but I had NO IDEA it had progressed to this point. I wasn't even 45 and the thought of an \"old lady's\" gummy mouth and dentures really did me in. Visions of Apalachia and Skid Row filled my imagination. I was a complete wreck. And I was very embarrassed. So I put my head in the sand and ignored it. But then one tooth visible in the upper front decided to enjoy some gravity action and eventually was hanging down a good deal more than my other teeth. Man, I didn't want to go anywhere or see anyone, and pretty much didn't. (Any photos of me in my control during the last 5 or so years have had this tooth Photoshopped back to normal. Any others, I simply didn't smile with an open mouth.) I know it sounds superficial and what-not, but for my whole life I had always been told I have a pretty smile and it was a part of my identity. And then it wasn't and it was ugly and weird. I was very self-conscious. I never smiled full-mouth in public anymore.Enter Dr. Amir. I really just lucked into him. I saw an ad, knew I had to do *something* for the job-search and my overall well-being, and made an appointment to test the waters. He's been wonderful (and the previously-mentioned good looks and London accent don't hurt either!). I literally cried out my heart to him, blubbering about suddenly having no job, a pending divorce, being an overall emotional wreck, etc., etc. He told me that I did NOT have to lose all my teeth, that there were really only (yeah, \"only\") some that were too far gone to save, and all of them except that one dangly tooth were in the back. He was so kind and supportive, and assured me he would work with me on pricing, payments and treatment plan to fit my budget and schedule. And his specialty, I later found out, is implants but yet he wasn't pushing those on me at all. He listened to me and came up with a plan that would work for me right now.Dr. Amir has been true to his word and now I'm OK. In fact, I'm feeling so much better about all of this that I'm even willing to put it out to the world for all eternity. I've always been a spill-your-guts kinda girl, except this \"secret\" had been so embarrassing and demoralizing. I can't tell you how glad I am that it's behind me and I can let it go.So, back to the \"diet\" …I had just had the upper extractions done and was given the final partial denture thing to fill in the holes (it looks a lot like a retainer and stays in with clasps and not denture adhesives) 1-1/2 days before I left for my sister's graduation party in Virginia. And my mouth HURT! Dr. Amir told me that it would hurt for a while and recommended soft foods, but *good* foods like fruits and veggies — he's a health nut but more on that later. He was going away that weekend too, and actually called me on his cell during his trip to make sure I was OK for mine. See, I told you he was great!Anyway, after the first day of feeling too yucky in general to even want to eat anything, it became quite a learning experience to see what I actually physically could and could not eat. Especially on a 14-hour road trip where driving through fast food joints was the plan. I quickly learned that McDonald's french fries were excruciating. I couldn't believe it! (And haven't had one since!) In fact, pretty much *anything* at McD's was out, except those delicious frozen drinks they sell. So for the ride up, I lived on Frappes and frozen strawberry lemonades and watched Alex eat the solid stuff. Yes, those drinks are high-calorie, but when they are your ONLY calories, it's not so bad. As the trip progressed, I also tried some of their yogurt with fruit and that was OK too, except for the apple chunks. Wendy's baked potatoes were OK too.During various hotel stays, restaurant outings, my sister's party, etc., I learned that pretty much any bread/grain anything was out. I just couldn't chew breads or pasta, which really surprised me because I thought they would be \"soft.\" Eggs and grilled fish were in. (Thank heaven for my mom's deviled eggs at the party!) Other meats were out. Rice, too weird. Ripe fruits and cooked veggies were in. Lettuce, and thus any salads, out. Any of my usual \"comforts\" such as cakes, cookies, etc. just didn't feel the same in my mouth so they didn't comfort - out. Candy - I still haven't had the nerve to try anything sticky, so out. Hard candy, very weird to suck on but I've had a few. Beer, in. Oops. ;-) But besides many of my usual foods being too painful or weird-feeling to eat, I also had to eat whatever I could eat VERY SLOWLY, and with very small bites. I still do. Now it takes me a LOT longer to eat a LOT less. This is a Good Thing, even if Alex does tease me about how slow I am. ;-)Once we were back from the road trip, my weekly trips to the dentist for check-ups and adjustments started. As I mentioned earlier, Dr. Amir is a health nut. In a good way, though. He's not preachy, just casually educational and supportive. He wears these really funny shoes that have toes. They crack me up, but they look so comfortable. Alex tells me they are rock climbing shoes.  I could tell in the first week that I had already dropped a significant amount of weight from just plain not eating and I mentioned this to Dr. Amir as a positive \"side effect\" and we then continued talking about food options during my weekly visits. He said I should stay away from non-fat anything, since the fat is usually replaced with sugar and/or other unhealthy things to make the food still taste good, and that the fats in dairy and proteins are actually good for you. We discussed eggs being the \"perfect food\" both in consistency for my mouth and for their nutritional values. Eggs are very much erroneously maligned by Big Junk Food. You don't raise your cholesterol by eating cholesterol (eggs), you raise it by eating too many bad carbs/sugar which turn into the bad cholesterol in your body (it's more complicated than that, but this is long enough!). I actually really knew all this already, but we are so marketed about processed junk from Big Food that it's easy to buy into the non-fat hype and not think about it. I'm glad Dr. Amir reminded me because my brain started clicking …… and after knowing what I was actually eating and still losing weight without being hungry, I decided to do a little bit of research on my own to learn more about why it was working for me. It turns out that I've fallen into a derivation of Atkins or a Ketogenic diet, which is to say cutting carbs and increasing the fat and protein, which causes the body to rely on fat instead of sugar for fuel, and it's this fat-burning process which is making me lose weight. I'm NOT eating like the \"induction\" phase of Atkins which is to cut out almost everything except fat/protein. It's much more balanced than that, and I'm not feeling deprived at all. I think I would feel deprived during an Atkins induction.My typical food choices now are fresh eggs or Egg Beaters every day; yogurt with fruit (and fat); fresh fruit such as bananas, oranges, peaches, melons, and tomatoes; steamed fresh or frozen green veggies; soups; seafood such as tuna, oysters, crab, shrimp, fresh fish; and cheese. Meats have been limited to chicken and ground turkey and sometimes very small amounts of beef and pork, depending on consistency. Which is fine with me, because I've always actually preferred fish to meat. Pasta is still nearly impossible to chew so I don't eat much of it and instead will nuke a small potato or eat more veggies. Rice is still weird and will probably always be. Regular breads are out, but I have been making little egg or seafood \"pizzas\" with the whole-grain 100 calorie rounds because their consistency is a lot easier for me to chew. (My sister had them and I tried one there.) My sweet tooth is satisfied by oranges and peaches, or low-sugar puddings sometimes mixed with a sliced banana, or oatmeal with brown sugar or honey. Surprisingly, I haven't really craved chocolate at all. (I know, right?)At this point, I'm not really craving anything and I'm not ever hungry. In fact, I'm spending hardly any time at all thinking about food and when I do eat, I'm eating less and still very slowly. It's like the inverse of what I was saying about Weight Watchers at the beginning of this long, long, LONG ::smile:: post. I feel I've made a positive lifestyle change and am not on a diet. It helps tremendously that there are definitely things I simply cannot eat without discomfort, but I'm truly not missing them. They were a (bad) habit, not a physical need. My physical needs are being met and the old habits are being replaced with healthier and more nutritious choices.But it's also more than that. With my smile back, I'm also feeling better about myself in general and am not inclined to comfort myself with junk food. I'm not embarrassed to open my mouth anymore. I smile all the time. So, I've got a partial upper denture. So what!! It could be a lot worse. A. Lot. Worse. I never thought I'd be thankful for a denture, but I actually am. It's made me feel like me again on the outside, which is making the inside feel pretty good too. Now, I don't recommend getting some teeth yanked out to jumpstart weight loss, but for me it forced a change for the better. I'm choosing to see it as a positive.I go back to see Dr. Amir tomorrow. I'm having a routine cleaning, a cavity filled, and we'll make plans for the bridge work that's to come for my lower teeth, so I can avoid a lower denture completely. Life is pretty OK right now. And it will be great when I find a job and can really start my new life."},
{"title": "Memory Lane", "date": "Sunday, June 12, 2011", "text": "Thank you everyone for all the nice comments on the Sorbetto top. The photos look much better than it actually fits. I could deal with the hip flare, either by ignoring it or by actually taking in the seam, but it's the upper chest that is worse. It's just too wide. I've got it balanced pretty well in the pics but as soon as I move, my bra straps are sticking out big-time and it just hangs on me weird. It's not ever going to be something I love and wear in public, especially since it's too big now and I'm still planning to lose weight so it will only get bigger. But as a house or PJ top, it will be fine. I'm still hopeful, though, that a trip through the laundry will shrink it up a little bit and make it a squidge better for the short-term. We'll see. It takes me a while to save up enough whites for a full load. I don't tend to wear a lot of white clothing as inevitably I slop something on myself. Even making this top, I must've pricked a finger with a pin because I found a drop of blood on it. Luckily, I found it *before* I touched it with the iron so it came out. Now, onto the main topic of this (long-winded) post …I hope you don't find my \"what am I wearing\" posts (like this one is) boring or too self-serving, but I will own up to the self-serving part as I'm trying to document for myself what I'm wearing, and when, to go along with the weight loss journey. I thank you in advance if you make it through to the end.I haven't had a working scale in years (helps with the denial) so I'm not sure how much I've actually lost. I'm guessing 15-20 pounds. I'm also guessing I still have about 80 to go. I know I can do it, and I'm determined to make it happen before my next (milestone) birthday in March 2012. I was born in 1962 — you do the math. ;-)I'm not planning on getting a new scale for a while longer because the current number is still going to be a downer and I think for me it's more effective to judge by how my clothes fit and look and my trusty measuring tape. A scale is only a number after all and even in my thinnest days in my 20s, I always ALWAYS weighed more than anyone else my size (which was a 1980s size 12). I know \"big bones\" is a fatty excuse, but I really do think I have *dense* bones or something, that just weigh more than someone else's. Ten pounds of boobage doesn't help the number either and I never lose weight there. ;-) All this means a scale has never been my friend and won't be now. The next step is exercise and firming up to go along with the reduction in food intake, which I've now started. I have an eliptical bike in my air-conditioned bedroom for heaven's sake and I decided it was time to dust it off.So, here we go …These RTW capris fit me 2-3 months ago. They are size 24. I can now *easily* pull them on and off without undoing the fly, and in this pic the waistband is riding on my low hips. To give you perspective, the top I'm wearing hits below my stomach. I wore them around the house yesterday and Alex was calling them \"clown pants,\" which is what prompted a new try-on session this morning. I will be donating these white capris as soon as they are washed. I really liked having white capris, so I will be looking for another RTW pair. I'm not going to be making any new pants for a while. I have plenty in my closet that I'll be digging out soon enough.I was looking up stuff on my blog yesterday and came across another pair of capris I made 4 years ago and had completely forgotten about. When I saw the blog post last night, I figured I had donated them since I didn't remember seeing them in my closet. After a closer look this morning, I found them hanging in the back squished between the other pants that I'll soon be fitting into. This is what I'm wearing right now. Dani approves.These are my \"Best Jeans Ever\" jeans. The last time I tried them on was about 2 weeks ago and I couldn't zip them or button the waistband. Now they fit and are actually more loose than tight. I can tell I'm losing belly fat quicker than anywhere else, which is fine with me. You will notice that I don't show side-view pics very often and am still not quite ready to. One downside is that all of my tops are now too long since there's a lot less belly to hold them up but I can deal with that side effect. I'm wearing 3\" wedge sandals in this pic so my legs look pretty long for me. The top is from BWOF from 2007, I think. I couldn't get my belly into it last month. Now it's loose.The capris I bought at Walmart recently are size 20. How true that is, I don't know. But I do know I couldn't wear any of my smaller pants and capris 2 months ago and now I can wear a good number of them. I still have more RTW and MM jeans for the trip downward and will keep testing loss progress with those every couple of weeks or so. Once I'm too small for my oldies, I will probably then buy a scale.Parting shot: Dani with Chili's bear. She's sneaking in a play and a chew because she knows if he caught her, she'd be Dead Meat.

{"title": "Colette Sorbetto - Meh", "date": "Saturday, June 11, 2011", "text": "So it's done and I'm not loving it. (But I'm rocking those groovy candy PJ pants, right??)It's not that I don't like the top *in theory,* but this one is too big on me. I should've started with a smaller size as it seems to be drafted to sit wide across the shoulders (which is apparent in hindsight as I look at the pattern photo again). It also feels too big at the underarms, and the hips are doing that Judy Jetson flare thing. I don't need extra flare at the hips — I bring enough of my own to the table. ;-) Yes, technically I could take things in here and there, but I really don't feel like removing the armhole bindings so I'm not too motivated to try to fix it.I'm going to toss it in the wash to see if it shrinks up a little. If not, I'll probably just wear it around the house since even with its faults, it's still comfortable and perfect for those really hot & humid days we'll be having soon.I'm not sure if I'm going to try it again. I think some easy TNT knit tops are calling my name first."},
{"title": "Colette Sorbetto - It Must Be The Heat", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2011", "text": "Two sleeveless tops in a row. I can only chalk that up to summer, although the weather has actually been pretty great with low humidity and hot, sunny days. Like a few others out in blogland, I'm currently working on the Colette Sorbetto pattern pictured above, which is a FREE download available on the Colette blog, here. I haven't taped together a pattern print-out in a long time, having let my PMB collect dust for a couple of years. The whole print-out, including instructions is 25 pages. I wish I would've thought to set my printer to only print the pattern pages instead of walking away after hitting Print, but I didn't. The instructions are thorough and well-illustrated but this is a very easy top and I don't need printed instructions for it. Oh well.After trimming and taping the pattern pages (there's only a front and a back so it went pretty fast), I cut it out and held it up to me to check FBA requirements. Yep, I needed one - about 1.5\". I did a regular slash/spread FBA and lowered the bust dart, and changed the angle so it was pointing more upward instead of straight across. Next, I cut a muslin from a sheet scrap, leaving off the front pleat because I didn't need that for a fit evaluation. The muslin front:I went with the largest size (18) but I probably should've cut the 16 at the upper chest as the neckline area was a little too wide. To bring things inward, I pinched a \"dart\" from the neckline and smooshed it flat on the pattern. The back needed a swayback tuck, confirmed by pinning one into the muslin as you can see below.Other observations: The adjusted bust dart hit in the right place (on me, not Zillie), the overall length of the top felt too short, the armholes needed to be raised about 3/8\", and I didn't need a square shoulder alteration — which I thought would be the case since the shoulder seam angle was very different from the smallest size (0) to the largest (18). If I had to guess, I'd say this is a slight grading error, but it suited me just fine. ;-)I made the length and armhole alterations on the pattern and cut the good fabric after dinner tonight. There are only two pieces but since I am underlining this very sheer fabric, I cut the top twice — once in the fabric you see and again in a plain white shirting cotton. That took all of 15 minutes. I briefly contemplated making this reversible, but was too lazy to actually do more than think about it. (Although since the neck and armholes are bound, it would be extremely easy to do.)Here's where I left off for the night:Tomorrow I'll attach the front to the back, cut and attach the bias facings, and hem the bottom. I saw another version of this top in the Colette Patterns Flickr pool, where the box pleat is inverted and only stitched about 4 inches down from the neck. I like that and if I'm happy with this first make, I think I'll copy that idea. I have some cotton voile in the stash that would be perfect.Can you tell that I've had a lot of sewing time this week? C'mon people, call me! I NEED A JOB! Trying to remain optimistic, but man this job market sucks."},
{"title": "Simplicity 3805: Done (Photo Heavy)", "date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2011", "text": "The simplest little top, and it took me 5 days to make it. Well, not really. It took me 4-1/2 days to start it. I just wasn't in the mood to sew over the weekend, but I did make the pattern alterations so that when I was finally ready yesterday, it took about an hour. After I decided on the pattern, I then realized that the size range in the envelope (20W-28W) was too big for me for the top. Figures, right? Well, I took the easy way out and kept the alterations simple. There are center front and center back seams so I just cut off 3/8\" from those cutting lines (which equates to about 3/4\" off each front and back) so the neckline wouldn't swim on me or expose bra straps. Since this pattern is drafted for wovens and I was using a knit — low stretch, but still a knit — I figured that would compensate somewhat if I had chopped to much. Plus, I still have about 2 yards of this fabric so if it was a complete wadder, I could always start over. I altered for my square shoulders as I cut out the tissue and I also made a 5/8\" length tuck above the waist (below the dart on the front). That's it. I did not do a FBA and left the dart as-is. A quick holding-up of the tissue to me told me it was going to hit pretty close to the right spot and I was counting on the knit to provide any extra bust room needed.It worked. (Early AM with bedhead and smeared mascara from yesterday. Lovely!)What I did NOT measure was where the hem would hit in relation to the jacket. Oops. So I quickly cut and sewed a tie belt so I could blouse the top a little to make its hem shorter than the jacket.On Zillie:On me:Under the open jacket (why does my head look so HUGE in this pic?): Under the closed jacket. I went a little photo crazy this morning. ;-)Here's the unaltered dart. Pretty good, right? I wish all tops were this easy.There are neckline facings, which I understitched and also topstitched to keep those suckers in place. The armholes (on the right in the pic below) are just turned and coverstitched.The single line of topstitching around the neckline continues down the center front seam, where it echos the twin rows of coverstitching elsewhere on the top.The center back seam is also double topstitched to match the front.I like how the neckline slit peeks out of the jacket.Parting Shot: The Marine driving around on the flight deck in what looks like a toy truck. ;-) Unrelated, today is his annual gas chamber qualification. He went through the gas chamber at boot camp, where the drill instructors made sure to unseal their gas masks so they all got a nice big deep breath of the gas. His letter home after that said it was horrible but at the same time he felt \"so macho\" afterwards and wanted to do it again. Well, he's got his wish today."},
{"title": "This and That", "date": "Saturday, June 4, 2011", "text": "I think I'm creating a sewing blogger sin since today I'm talking about showing cheap RTW instead of Me Made June anything. The horror! ;-)I was in Walmart yesterday. I go there a lot. It's cheap, and I'm unemployed. I was also by myself, which doesn't happen much as Alex usually tags along. Since I had this luxury of time and no impatient teenaged glaring, I decided to look at the cheap Walmart clothes and try on some capris just to see what RTW size I am now. It's always a boost to try on even bad-fitting RTW pants when you know you've lost weight. At least for me it is. I don't even think about trying on ANYTHING when I know I've gained weight. ;-)I'm happy to report that I've dropped two sizes. Woo! And the capris actually fit well. So I bought them. (You knew that was coming, right?) They were only $14 and if I keep losing weight as I'm planning, they won't fit in a month anyway. I definitely don't want to sew pants and not be able to wear them much. I have a closet full of those for the trip downward, some of which are now seeing the light of day again.After the capris, I wandered around some more and found really cheap PJ sets. I need new PJs. I usually make my own because they're a fast and gratifying project and I usually have some \"What Was I Thinking Fabric\" for PJs in the stash. But I really don't have any stash fabric suitable for PJs and to buy new PJ-specific fabric would cost more than Walmart PJs. So I bought 3 sets, at $12-14 each. And wore one last night.This is me this morning shortly after waking up. It's still me right now as I'm typing this as I haven't showered or dressed yet. I think they're pretty cute. They will probably only last this one summer, but that's OK. It's one thing off my sewing list and how the heck could I buy/ship the fabric, add tricot piping trim and 7 cute purple buttons for $12-14? I don't sew to save money, but sometimes my time IS money and, well, you know the rest …I actually cleaned the mirror but it didn't help muchLast, another trip back to the fitting room after I found this dress. Does it look familiar? It's almost a complete match for the great See & Sew 5593 pattern I recently made 2 dresses from (and will be making again soon). It's also a smaller size for me and it fits, even at the underbust seam. It will need some Hollywood Fashion Tape on the crossover, but no big deal since I just stocked up at Joann's the other day. It's not an exact replica of the pattern, but it's close and the overall look and comfort factor are very similar. There are no pleats at the skirt front and the bodice underbust is gathered to the waist seam. As you can see above, the neckline has cut-on facings. These are just folded over and sewn into the shoulder and waist seams. They are not stitched down along the neckline. Interesting. I may copy that. The shoulder seam also has clear elastic serged into it. Below, you can see that the back neckline is faced with a narrow bias (or not?) strip, like Sherril did with her dress. The armholes are just turned and coverstitched.This will be a weekend/casual dress for me since it's sleeveless and a skootch shorter than I'm comfortable with for office wear — if I ever find an office job. Ahem. Getting impatient here, sorry. I'm planning to wear this today so I'll try to remember to snap a pic. I've been LIVING in my 2 makes of the S&S pattern since it's HOT and dresses are so comfortable and breezy.On the sewing agenda today (bet you thought I'd never get to that), is a sleeveless top/shell to match the green skirt I made last week. I'm not sure what pattern I'm using yet, but I've narrowed it down to these three. I'll pull out the instructions/line drawings for review and make a decision then.A couple of closing notes and then I'm off to the shower and sewing room. 1. That rayon knit print fabric that I just bought from Fabric.com? Trash. Horrible. It's already boxed and ready to ship back. Ick. I hope you didn't buy any, and if you did because of me, I'm sorry.I just bought some more knit prints from Fabric Mart instead. I'll keep you posted after they arrive. 2. Leg make-up. A few of you have commented about it in lieu of pantyhose. Help! What brand? Where do you buy it? Drugstore? And what shade would you recommend for dead fish underbelly as a starting point?"},
{"title": "B4818: Done, and KS3231 Too", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2011", "text": "The jacket and coordinating skirt (KS3231) are done, although I think I need to re-do the elastic in the skirt to be tighter. Which will be a royal pain since it's serged onto the waist edge, turned, and coverstitched. I'll decide after it's gone through the laundry cycle to see if the elastic shrinks back up. Steaming with the iron helped a little. I've decided I'm also going to make a sleeveless top from the skirt fabric to wear under the opened jacket, for a 2-piece dress effect. I just got back from an interview (it went well) and snapped a smudgy mirror pic before I changed. This is RTW that I bought 3 years ago when I was last looking for a job. I had never worn either piece and the tags were even still in place. I bought the set for the jacket, since the price was right even if the dress was too snug.A month ago, I couldn't get the dress around my butt and belly, tons tighter even than when I first bought it. On a whim this morning, I decided to try it on even though I just finished pressing another outfit. It fit! Except that it was too long from shoulder to waist, making the waist shaping hit at the wrong place on me and the neckline too low. (It's also not as long overall as it seems in this pic - the perspective is a little off with my camera angle. And, yes, Belinda, I can button the jacket. lol)For those of  you that think my sewing is so wonderful :coughcough: … I present my 60 Second Quick and Ugly Fix:Yep, I just folded over the shoulders and stitched them down. Pitiful, huh? ;-) At some point, I will probably unstitch the ugly fix and do it right so I can take off the jacket, but the dress is fully-lined so it's going to take more than 60 seconds for that one. For now, no one will know if we don't tell them.I wore these shoes I recently bought. They are the pair that Zappos had on my porch less than 14 hours after I ordered them. They fit perfectly and are comfortable. Oh, and I said \"screw it\" this morning and left the pantyhose in the drawer. Which is probably why I slowed down to take the mirror shot instead of ripping off my clothes. ;-)"},
{"title": "Sunday Shopping", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2011", "text": "Did I finish my jacket and start my skirt yesterday? Uh, no. I went shopping. First stop, Joann's for their Memorial Day notions and Simplicity pattern sales.From the notions wall (which isn't even really a wall anymore since they rearranged the store a while ago): Stretch needles and 110/18 topstitching needles (Singer because they were out of Schmetz) and Hollywood tape. I can't say enough good things about the Hollywood tape. I use it on my left bra strap every time I wear a Hot Patterns Sunshine Top because my neck is off-center or my shoulders are uneven or *something* and any top with a wider-cut neckline eventually slips and shows my left bra strap. Just the left one. Weird, I know. Do NOT pay full-price ($10.99) because you can either stock up during a notions sale or use a coupon. I also use it on crossover necklines for insurance. So much easier than a safety pin and it won't wear a hole in your fabric. Cute little metal tin too. I also bought 2 yds of the fabric you see under my Joann purchases at $7.98 per yard (sale price). It's a very nice rayon/Lycra knit. At Joann's! Who knew.  From the Simplicity pattern drawers, which were quite picked over by the time I got there:These are the first Simplicity patterns I've bought in probably a year. I tend to buy most of my patterns online now because I know they're in stock in my size and I get to avoid dealing with the crazies who ravage the pattern drawers during sales. Yes woman in the blue dress, you know who you are!Many of the patterns I really wanted were out of stock and I noticed during a visit to Simplicity's website that a lot of OOP patterns are patterns I would've bought IF Simplicity.com had good sales like BMV. Simplicity, are you listening?? (Your 30% sale this weekend is a start, but 30% off isn't enough of a draw for me.) Next stop, Walmart for some drugstore items and a cheap necklace to wear with the new jacket. Last stop, Fabric.com:The three prints are rayon/Lycra, and the white solid is a poly ITY. I really need a solid white top to wear with skirts and jackets so while boring, it will probably be the first make from this group. And why am I buying MORE fabric when I have an entire fabric closet to soon pack up and move? I plead temporary insanity.Also, I found this Fabric.com coupon from RetailMeNot.com, and it worked for me:  Coupon Code for $10 Off orders of $50 or more June 8, 2011: TRY112I would have had time in the sewing room after shopping and dinner, but the Marine has decided he wants to shop for a new car. Yes, this is after Alex and I took his Jeep up to him not two weeks ago. So this new plan meant a lot of telephone time trying to teach him the loan process and how to deal with car salesmen (er, salesPEOPLE). I'm pretty sure I have him convinced to only look around today and to NOT sign anything no matter how irresistible the salesperson makes the \"deal\" seem. If he does buy a new car, he'll still keep his Jeep with him on base. He just wants something newer and spiffier and since he now has all this money to burn because he has absolutely NO EXPENSES after savings, cell, and car insurance, well — I was 22 once too. I understand. He's looking at Ford Fiestas, Mazda 2s, Kia Souls and Rios, and probably a little of everything else. Now off to the sewing room to try to make some progress before the Marine calls with his first can't-resist-deal. ;-)"},
{"title": "B4818: Almost Done", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2011", "text": "The jacket is nearly done. All that's left is buttonholes and buttons, which I'll do this afternoon when I get back from some errands. I don't hate it and I will definitely wear it, but in my heart I still wish the print placement was better. I know not everyone sees it, but I'm one of those people who does. However, I've decided a big smile and lots of dramatic arm movements will distract even the most OCD like me. HeheheheI thought BConky came up with a GREAT solution to add a faux waistband. I even cut, sewed and pressed the strips, and left the jacket's sideseams unserged so I could open up slots and insert my prepared strips into them. And that's where I stalled. While the strips did a wonderful job covering up and/or camouflaging the blossoms dead center of the jacket, I wasn't loving what they were doing to the overall aesthetic. I kept pinning them on, taking them off, pinning them on, taking them off. But I couldn't get past my feeling that they were cutting me in half and fighting with the eye on a very busy print, even more-so after adding pockets that were purposely cut to NOT blend in. In the end, I decided to ditch the faux waistband \"design opportunity,\" especially after looking at the jacket as a whole. As you can see, almost every angle has big red blossoms and I think (hope?) those keep the eyes busy enough to not just land and stop on center. Besides, it's not like I'm going to be standing still like a mannequin when I'm wearing it, even without dramatic arm movements. But I'm going to see what I have in the stash and/or keep my eyes open in the stores for a solid scarf to hang down under the lapels because like many who left comments on the last post, that was also my first thought for a fix after discovering my \"disaster.\" Plus, one of my favorite features of this pattern (besides the awesome fit!) is the lapels. I love the shape, I love the depth — they just work perfectly for me — and a scarf underneath will make them show up better.I'm going to be using textured Mother of Pearl buttons from the \"Carolyn Collection\" (and I note I'm glad to see she has ended her blogging break before my cold sweats kicked in). The iridescence in the MOP picks up all the colors in the jacket nicely without screaming \"Look at me, I'm something else assaulting your eyes!\" ;-) The skirt to wear with this jacket should be a breeze. Solid color with no print to worry about, elastic waist and knit and TNT so no real fitting except length, and one, yes ONE, pattern piece. The machines are already threaded with the right colors and ready to go so let's hope I'm not eating those words tomorrow and have a finished outfit to show off. And speaking of eating … another great thing for still-recovering sore teeth/gums in the summer? Watermelon! OMG I love this time of year for the watermelons you can buy for $3 out of some dude's pick-up truck on the side of the road."},

No problem, I still have a few brand-new pairs from 3 years ago when I was last job-hunting. I get out one pair, scrunch them up and stick in one foot. Scrunch again and in goes the other foot. So far, so good. Until I had them 3/4 up and promptly stuck my thumbnail through the left thigh. Yeah, straight into the trash for those. Apparently, I'm out of practice with these dreaded things, but luckily pair #2 went on without a hitch. (I'm a fast learner!) It's well into the 90s here, even in the morning hours. I thought the hose would be torture, but they actually weren't too bad. Granted, I only walked outside from the house to the car and then from the car through a parking lot and I didn't have any potty breaks until I got back home and took them off for the day. ;-)Since I stole the image above, it's only right that I link back to its rightful owner's page — 10 Ways to Recycle Pantyhose.(The \"interview\" was fine.

I hope they keep hurting for about 90 more lbs. ;-) I'm wearing clothes I haven't worn in 3 years. Woo! But a happy life outlook also helps because I'm finding that I'm not medicating with food these days either. I eat when I'm hungry and that's it, and even then it's slow going and I end up giving up before cleaning my plate. I made chocolate chip cookies for the Marine last night and boxed them all up for shipping without sampling a one. If this keeps up, I may even surprise myself with some exercise.Miscellaneous tidbit #2: I was asked if the dogs are going with me. Yes! Although, unfortunately, Pepper may not be going with anyone, as she's not been doing too well lately. Old age is quickly overtaking her.Miscellaneous tidbit #3: I was also asked if I'm staying in Florida. Yes. I'm staying in the same exact area, actually, for Alex. I will not move him away from his base of friends and everything he's ever known. That limits the apartment search, but there are still plenty to choose from. I'll be getting at least a 2-bedroom apartment — one BR for me and one for Alex, but if I can swing 3 BR, that will be my first choice. Otherwise, a DR or LR will be sacrificed to the Sewing Gods. If Peter can sew and hoard machines in a NYC apartment, I'm sure I'll be fine. As for leaving Florida one day — my recent trip to NC and Virginia confirmed that after 21 years, I am a Florida girl. I was only gone for 4 days, but I still missed the perpetual sunshine and bright blue skies. I don't think I could ever go back to where the skies are gray as often as not. And I haven't even touched on winter temps, say anything below 65 … Brrrr. Now I'm off to work on that Butterick jacket, which is cut out and waiting for me.

The alterations are already done from the first make so I should be able to just cut and sew. Fingers crossed.The solid is a knit, which will be a gored skirt. At least that's the current plan. Always subject to change, of course.I was reminded in the comments yesterday that it would've been pointless to vacuum, what with the Rapture and impending end of the world.

Truthfully, I never look at See & Sew patterns but I think I should at least glance at them now from time to time. Here's the front. As you can see, I added sleeves. I wanted this dress to be office-friendly without another layer. I swiped the top-gathered sleeve pattern from my ever-trusty TNT Ottobre 02/2007 tee pattern. You know the one that Belinda and I have made at least six zillion times now.Click any photo for a larger viewHere's the back. It's got a CB seam which I did account for when cutting the fabric. I think I matched things up pretty well, and even though the \"stripes\" look off-center in this pic, the thinner stripe really does hit at exact center in real life, just the way I wanted. When I made the first version of this dress, I was tempted to lay the back piece on the fold but I'm glad I didn't. There is subtle shaping in the CB seam and that shaping gives me a little waist definition in the back and adds to the swish factor of the skirt.Here's a close-up of the sleeve cap, but it's still hard to see that it's gathered.  I also made a stand-alone \"scarf.\" I use that term lightly because it's really just an 8\"-wide length of fabric, folded in half with shaped ends. I wanted an extra something to add when wearing a jacket. Which brings me to my question for all of you …Which do you like better? The green jacket — there *is* green in the dress print which isn't showing as much in these pics as it does in real life.Or the brown jacket? I'm thinking I like the green jacket for warmer temps like NOW and I like the unexpected color and contrast. The brown jacket seems more autumn/winter to me, even if the temps don't drop too much most days here in Florida. If it matters, the browns match perfectly between jacket and dress. I'm curious to see your opinions but I won't promise they will change my mind. ;-)On to some construction details …As a full-busted girl, crossover tops do tend to gape and/or expose too much. And since I used a cheater FBA of just adding gradual length across the bottom of the upper bodice pattern piece, I knew the neckline would need some help to stay snugged-in. I eliminated the front neckline facings and used clear elastic instead.Because the clear elastic I was using is 3/8\" wide, I trimmed 2/8\" (1/4\") from the 5/8\" seam allowance on the neckline so I could just lay the elastic at the edge to attach it and then folding it over would net me the same neckline width as the original pattern. Got that? ;-)I used a small ZZ stitch to attach the elastic. I left a long tail at the start so I would have something to grab onto when starting. I used my Teflon foot since clear elastic does not usually feed smoothly under a regular presser foot. While stitching it onto the neckline edge, I pulled the elastic very taut to build in some \"snugging-in\" when worn against my chest. If you look closely at the elastic edge below, you can see that it is slightly rippled. I also left a tail at the finishing end so I would have a holding-on point when coverstitching the neckline, but you can't see that in the pics.Because there *is* now some stretch and a slight gather built into the neckline edge after attaching the clear elastic and I didn't want to wrestle the neckline while doing the coverstitching, I cheated and used some Collins Wonder Tape. Here it is below with the paper still on and before I folded the neckline edge over. Again, you can see some slight rippling which is a Good Thing for wearing, but not so good for turning and stitching without stopping and readjusting every couple of inches w/o the Wonder Tape.Here's the neckline edge folded over and stuck down onto the Wonder Tape. It's now ready for coverstitching (or topstitching if you don't have a CS machine). Sewing the shoulder seam like this *is* covered in the pattern directions, but I took pics anyway. The red line below is the finished edge of the front bodice. You can see that the back shoulder is sticking out 5/8\" (the seam allowance) past this. The pins are holding my shoulder gathers in place until I sew the shoulder seam. Just be sure you leave the 5/8\" seam allowance as shown when you sew the shoulder seam for this view so that when you turn under the back neckline edge, it lines up with the finished edge of the front. Like this:Lastly, here's my super-technical FBA. I also had to cross the front pieces over each other more than the pattern markings on the tissue or I'd be showing everyone my navel. ;-)  I recommend that when you get to this step, take the extra time to pin/baste and try it on. I ended up needing to ease the lower skirt waist to the upper bodice waist at that joining seam because I crossed-over more than the pattern, but when worn it looks perfectly flat (except for the pleats, of course). BTW, in my first post about this pattern I noted that I cut out to the 22 width from the armhole downward but ended up removing back to the \"19\" (between 18 and 20). I did end up adjusting the pattern too instead of leaving it like I said I would do. I decided it's better not to challenge the sewing brain cells too much with \"maybe scenarios\" that I won't remember 6 months from now. This ended up being the exact right move since I had to ease the top bodice to the waist and without the trim, it would've been a much bigger stretch. Parting shot: More new shoes on the way! I ordered these last night from Zappos at about 1 AM Eastern Time and they are being delivered TODAY per the UPS tracking number. How do they do that?? Well, I'm not complaining and I hope they fit.

Ahhhh, it's good to daydream, and would somebody please pass me that winning lottery ticket!Out of dreamland … I've cut out the crossover version of this See & Sew dress and hope to get it mostly or completely sewn before I hit the hay tonight. I'm using the second knit I bought at Joann's last week because I'm thinking it will go well with a RTW jacket I already have.

So far, so good. In my previous life mumblemumbletwentysomething years ago, I was a legal secretary at some of the big law firms in Washington, D.C. That's the field I'm hoping to return to now and those big D.C. names on the resume, no matter how old, should help.

Understanding legalese has always come naturally for me and my office skills are still top-notch so I'm hoping I can slip back in without too much searching. Plus, the pay and benefits at law firms is always better than at other places. I also started looking into getting my paralegal certificate and I think that will be something I'll do in the near future. Phyllis - feel free to weigh in on this. ;-)I lied when I said my dental visits were over for now. Or, actually, they lied to me. Well, not really — they are just being thorough, which is welcome. This is a new-to-me dental practice and they have been awesome. Very kind and caring. And his London accent and good looks don't hurt either. ;-) I have another follow-up next week, and then that should be it for a little while. I still have more stuff I need done, but for now I have a pretty smile again and a workable care/money plan. Things seem to be moving along, and I feel pretty good. Always a good thing, right?Thank you again for all of the love and support. It helps more than you'll know!"},

This pattern is definitely a keeper. I'll be trying out the crossover bodice view next because this scoop view was super fast and easy to make and my alterations were minimal. I also quickly (as in less than 2 hours cutting to done) made up a short-sleeved version of the cardigan from Jalie 2566 to wear with my dress. I had made this pattern years ago and the first cardi still fits, so the alterations were already done and all I had to do was cut and sew. The orange of the cardi is a perfect match for some areas of the dress print, despite my camera colors being a little off in the pics. My orange sandals from DS#2's graduation last year were also great with the print. I guess they are now the Official Graduation Sandals, having been worn to two in a row.I left off the belt because it made my chest look like All-Boob-All-The-Time, and I turned the neck \"binding\" outward and coverstitched it instead of folding inward and topstitching because I liked the bit of contrast. I think next time I will bind the neckline and armholes with my coverstitch machine. The instructions have you just turn under those areas 5/8\" and stitch, but I like a more finished look. A new necklace and matching drop earrings completed the look. Here are my altered pattern pieces. My floor is disgustingly dirty so please ignore that — I know I have been. ;-) I added 3 inches of length to the bottom but I should've added another inch or so. I ended up adding an additional 1-inch band to the bottom edge, which you can't discern at all because of the print so no harm no foul on that quick fix. For both bodice sections (front and back), I made a 3/8\" tuck to remove length and altered for square shoulders as I cut the tissue, which are usuals for me. For the front, my (ahem) super-technical FBA was to start with the 18 for the shoulders/upper chest, morph out to the 22 width at the sideseams, and add length at the empire seam by graduating from the sideseam. I didn't need the entire width of the 22, and ended up sewing back to the 18-ish line (I'd call it 19) at the waist area and then keeping the 22 width from hip downward. I will probably keep the pattern as-is, though, as \"just in case\" insurance for different fabrics. It's easy enough to remove what isn't needed and not so easy the other way around.* * * * *Now onto the weekend …Alex and I drove to Cherry Point, NC all day Friday. ALL day. We left Florida in both vehicles at 6 AM and arrived to the base gate just before 7 PM. We  had walkie-talkies and had fun with them during the trip. Boys and walkie-talkies seem to go hand in hand. I never would have thought to bring them on my own.After checking in and getting our temporary base passes, we dropped off Tyler's Jeep in his barracks parking lot and then went up to Tyler's room for a quick tour while he changed into civvies and grabbed his \"assault pack\" (backpack to you and me) with his change of clothes. I have to say it was SO COOL being met by him at the gate in full cammie gear. He really is a Marine. ;-)We went out for a leisurely dinner off base. The \"boys\" had steaks and ribs. Still nursing my very sore teeth, I had soft fish and a soft crab cake and a few bites of a not-so-soft baked potato. I  would have picked the seafood anyway so there was no sacrifice involved in that. After dinner, we drove to a hotel about 20 minutes north of the base. After partaking of the hotel's free breakfast buffet (Tyler had one of everything and still eats at boot camp speed!) Saturday morning, we left the hotel about 10 AM and drove 4 hours to my sister's in Richmond, VA. Upon our arrival, we hung out and visited for a few hours before the start of her party. Once it was party time, we consumed way too much beer and lemon drop shots. I would've eaten more and drank less, but the teeth situation forced me to drink more and eat less. Yeah, that's my story. There was a DJ, karaoke, cornhole competitions (who knew how popular that game is??) and dancing. I'd show you pics of the party, but my sister hasn't sent them yet. And they will probably be too incriminating anyway. It POURED rain all during the party, which was outside in her back yard, but luckily my BIL had rented a huge party tent and had set it and other smaller canopies up that morning so we all stayed dry and comfortable. Well, except for my sister who ended up on her backside in the mud. But that's another story and nothing unusual for her. Her nickname is \"Grace.\" ;-) Use your imagination. Sunday morning, we left Richmond and headed back to North Carolina. Once we arrived at the base, Tyler high-tailed it into the barbershop and got his weekly \"regulation\" haircut. He goes into withdrawal if his hair is more than 1/8\" long in the back. Then I hung around outside his barracks while Tyler and Alex pulled off the Jeep's plastic wheel guards to allow the big tires more clearance. (Tyler's room is on the 3rd floor, the 4th door from the left in the pic below.)He looks pretty happy with his stuff from home, doesn't he? That's my cammie purse on the chair. The Marine guard at the front gate asked about it and commented positively, which made me happy.Alex had fun trying on Big Bro's combat gear.The view from the \"kitchenette\" to the outside door.It was a GREAT weekend. It was so nice spending time with my sons and my sister, her husband,  and her friends, some of which I've known since they were all 12 years old. But it's back to the real world this week, and looking for that perfect job. Plus one more follow-up trip to the dentist tomorrow and I'm done there for another month or so."},

It feels uncomfortable and I'm doubting right now that I'll ever wear it, so I'm setting it aside.

Meanwhile, Sherril  quickly enabled me with her fast and fabulous make of See & Sew 5593. I just got back from Joann's with the pattern and I'm going to make it up for my \"little\" (14+ hours) road trip this weekend up to Virginia for my sister's graduation from nursing school.

{"title": "V8648: Still Plugging Along", "date": "Sunday, May 8, 2011", "text": "Here's where the dress stands right now. I should be able to attach the skirt before the night is over and be almost done with it. I'm REALLY looking forward to being done with it because it has been a MAJOR PITA. It still doesn't fit as well as I want, but because I'll be wearing it under a jacket, I'm calling it Good Enough so I can move on. It will probably still have to hang in the Magic Wardrobe for a month before I like it.After I had finished the FBA and Rounds 1 and 2 of alterations, I decided I really should've done my usual alteration of shortening the upper bodice by about 1/2\". I didn't feel like starting over so I just kind of fudged it. The back was easier because I made a straight tuck through the center back panels and a gradual tuck on the side back panels which tapered to nothing at the side seams. The front was a little trickier, since the girls were already using the extra length at the side front panels but there was a definite droop in the center front panel. I ended up doing the equivalent of a sway back alteration to the center front panel. Would that be a sway front? Ugh, that's depressing. ;-)Those little tweaks are not the reason I'm ready to pitch this pattern, though. It's those blasted straps that will NOT lay right no matter what. Other reviewers have mentioned the oddity so I'm sure it's not just a personal figure quirk and instead is a drafting weirdness/error. Below is the tissue on top of the adjusted tracings I ended up using. Keep in mind that the strap angles of the tissue had already been adjusted from the original so you're looking at a HUGE cumulative alteration. Can you see how much more I adjusted? And look at how much I shortened that back length. I've *never* had to do anything even remotely similar to any other pattern. I might as well have just freehanded a bodice a started from there. It couldn't have been any worse. My advice if you're contemplating making this dress … Enter At Your Own Risk!

{"title": "V8648: Alterations and Muslin", "date": "Thursday, May 5, 2011", "text": "I'm not moving quite as fast as I wanted, but I'm still making good progress. The first (yes, there will be more) alterations are done and the muslin is actually fairly decent (ode to George Carlin). The final dress will not be two-toned like this, although I like the look. But I am planning for it to have a contrast waist so I'm not all one big print head to toe. These pics make it painfully obvious just how much comfort eating I've been doing over the last few years. Sigh. Sewing for the body I have now and planning to sew for a \"new\" body by this time next year. The front is mostly good, but it's too wide in the neckline/shoulders. You can see my bra strap and then some. I'm not at all thrilled with the bias panels throughout. They are a pain to work with. My final fabric is a stretch woven, so I'm pretty sure I'll be cutting it on grain and substituting the stretch for the bias. If you could see the bottom hem clearly here, you'd see how much difference there is in length between the panels due to the bias. You can definitely see the seam ripples though. Yuck.The back is also too wide in the upper sections and a squidge too narrow over the cheeks. Big surprise there and I have officially turned into my mother. ;-) I'll let the seams out in the skirt and take them in on top. Here are my alterations for the front. It looks like a lot, but it's really not anything out of the ordinary for me for a top or a skirt. There are just a lot of pieces to keep track of for this particular dress.The upper sections are just a usual FBA for princess seams a la Fit for Real People.I made width adjustments across the side and front pieces to put the princess seam over my apex, which is why you see all those slashes/spreads across the middle section too. (This adjustment is also detailed in FFRP with the princess seam bust adjustments.)Before doing any FBA adjustments, I pinned the upper and middle sections together like this: For this pattern, all the edges don't fit together perfectly because the construction order changes the size of the pieces a little. I just guessed my best and aligned landmarks how it made the most sense to me. Also, be sure when you're taping the new tissue in to fill the spreads that you remember the pieces will still need to be separated when you're don, so don't tape them together at those areas. Luckily, I didn't goof on that this time. Usually, I would have to say, \"Ask me how I know.\" Below are the alterations for the back. I needed to add more width to the waist so I slashed from the shoulder downward and spread at the waist what I needed. It's now too wide at the upper back so I should have just altered at the waist and trued the sideseams. I'll need to take in the upper section, which is basically exactly that alteration instead of what I did. Oh well. Can't win 'em all. I really just think this neckline is just set inordinately wide, so beware.For both front and back skirt sections, I wanted to keep the peg-ness of the skirt so I didn't make width alterations evenly all the way down the pattern pieces. Instead, I slashed horizontally at my hipline and then vertically to the upper seam. I spread the hip area and then trued the side (or sides) to the hem like in this section below from the front:Lastly (for this round anyway), I combined my usual square shoulder adjustment with tilting the neckline angle inward, as both a preliminary tissue try-on and Patty the Snug Bug warned that it was going to be too wide without adjustment. To do this, I slashed as you see below, leaving a hinge on the neckline side. Since this \"wedge\" is usually added to the top of the shoulder seam for square shoulders, I thought this was a brilliant combo fix. ;-)  If you don't have square shoulders, you'll probably still want to do this and then likewise trim off the shoulder seam to compensate.For the next muslin (I'm only going to muslin the upper section again), I'm going to narrow the front and back middle sections and on the front, reshape and reduce the bust curve. These should be small tweaks so overall I'm pretty happy that my alterations were darn close on the first try.Parting Shot - How Tyler's crewmates commemorate their CO's last flight with the Unit:"},

Here he is in his Alphas this morning, getting ready to check into his unit. Such a goof ball. Alterations on the Vogue pattern are coming along. I've done the first round on the bodice and will probably just add to the seam allowances for the skirt. Maybe I'll be able to cut a muslin before I head to the dentist this afternoon. I'm sure I'll need more adjustments after I try on the muslin. That's just par for the course with me. There was a comment last post about my going bare-armed. Hah!

My plan is to wear it open like this with a belt, but I don't have a belt yet. I may make one. I really wanted an orange jacket, but the stash wasn't cooperative with that and I am NOT buying anything new that I will have to pack and move, so black it is. I have a knit that I'm thinking of turning into a cardi though, so maybe I'll get something orange after all. This black fabric is ANCIENT. I bought it years and years ago from Fashion Fabrics Club when I first started sewing, in the days before FFC bought out Denver Fabrics. It's a weird fabric. Stretch woven something that's either poly or nylon or both. It's also got a pattern of stylized M's woven in and I had to put a tape on each wrong side so I wouldn't screw it up. It took me about 3 tries to accurately mark the wrong side of each piece because I couldn't decide which side I wanted to use as the right side and then just confused myself.You can see the design here:The instructions for this pattern are ridiculous. As in stoooopid. First, they would have you use the lining fabric for all of the inside, which means that fabric would go right up to the neck edge. Which means it would definitely roll out and show because that's just Murphy's Law. I used more of the black for the inside yoke pieces and understitched the neckline (a step missing from the instructions). But the worst part was how Simplicity instructed to sew the facing. Hopefully I can explain this. You are to construct two complete jackets using the same exact pattern pieces, one from the lining fabric and one from the fashion fabric. Then sew the facing OVER the lining (after turning under and narrow hemming the outside edge of the facing) and topstitch the facing down onto the lining. That meant you'd end up with 3 layers of fabric where the facing is, and more if you count the turned-under hem of the facing edge. Like I said, stoooopid.I made the lining and then laid the facing over it and cut away the lining plus a seam allowance. I then joined the facing to lining like you'd do for any other lined jacket and bagged the lining with a jump hem instead of sewing lining bottom edge to jacket bottom edge. Really, the instructions are so bad that Simplicity would've been better represented if they made this an UNlined jacket. Here's a quick shot of me in the jacket, over my Saturday slouch around clothes. Parting Shot: Chili on my desk reminding me that it's time to go outside.

Do I sound bitter? Oops. I can't wait until I'm off this emotional rollercoaster.Today was the day for renewing my expired driver's license. Oops again. ;-) Luckily, here in Florida appointments can be made for these services (which are actually adhered to) so the process is relatively painless. I had gone another day before my license expired, but found out in that way that Life likes to remind us who exactly is Boss, that I needed a certified copy of my marriage license to prove my maiden vs. married name difference. Hah. How ironic. So, $50 for the certified marriage license from Virginia and $48 for the license renewal later, I'm legal again. So anyway, I had an hour before I needed to head off to the DDL office and I forced the ambivalent mojo to just shut up while I made my pattern adjustments. I took pics along the way so I'd have something to show for this post besides a bunch of whining. (Oh, but whining feels SO good sometimes!) I started off with the regular slash/spread FBA, as below:And then filled in the spreads with tissue everywhere except the horizontal bust dart.I then extended the dart with my Sharpie and drew a line upward into the area on the pattern that is to be gathered to the yoke. I really wouldn't have drawn the lines except for you guys. ;-)Next, I cut on those Sharpie lines (leaving a pivot point in the corner) and closed the side dart, which opened up the dart you see below.I filled in that dart, because it's not really going to be sewn as a dart — just as additional gathering in the existing gathering section of the yoke seam. Here are the finished alterations. They're always easier to see on the dark floor. Here's the altered sleeve too. It didn't have a hem allowance (odd?), so I added that too. Maybe tonight I'll feel like cutting out the real fabric. Oh, one more thing about the whole driver's license renewal thing. I moved to Florida almost 22 years ago. I went to get my Florida license shortly thereafter and had to take the written, eye, and road tests. So far, so good, right? Well, since then I've been able to renew twice by mail/internet. Today, I was fully expecting all three tests again. Why else have me come in to the office. Nope. I only had to read one line on the eye test. No written, no driving. That's just downright scary, isn't it? Twenty-two years later and Florida has NO IDEA if I can actually still drive. (I can.) But do you know what is even scarier? Trading a 22-year old license picture for what I look like now. Ugh. My last illusion is busted wide open. ;-)"},

Here's the result:Not too bad. I will need to do about a 3/4\" FBA, and enlarge the sleeve bicep a little because it feels snug with my tee underneath. I'll rotate the resulting bust dart into the gathers at the yoke (which were just loosely pleated in the muslin so don't judge the sewing there too closely). I also need to narrow the shoulders about 3/8\" and probably should've started with the 16 instead of the 18.I've obviously forgotten how to sew for myself since I had a brain fade and forgot to make my usual square shoulder adjustment before cutting the tissue. Luckily I remembered before sewing the shoulder seam and I just made the adjustment during construction. I'll fix the tissue while I'm doing the other alterations but it would've been nice if I had just remembered before I cut. Ahh. Too many things on my mind these days.I'm undecided on the length. I think I want it short like this, but I will probably add an extra couple of inches for insurance. My main plan is to wear it with the graduation dress from last year. With pants, I'd want it longer but I don't think I'd be wearing it with pants. At some point, I'll have to cut bait and fish and make a decision.  You can sorta see my new haircut in this pic. It's not a new style. Just back to the usual. It was past my shoulders before I got it cut, which is WAY too long for me both in looks and care.

{"title": "B5197: In Theory, But Done Anyway", "date": "Wednesday, April 6, 2011", "text": "The not-handsewing-the-zipper idea works in theory. In reality, it's kind of a pain in the butt wrangling the interfaced (very stiff!) purse around the needle to make it happen so I think the next time I make this, I will have to move to Plan B, which would be to still NOT handsew the zipper lining piece, but instead, use Wonder Tape to hold it in place while I topstitch both outside and lining from the top.Whew! Run-on sentence much? But it did work as I imagined and I did finish the bag. And it's HUGE. It's more like a laptop case size. But my mom likes big purses, so she should still be OK with it. She can definitely fit a magazine (or five) inside, and she likes that.The lining is from the last piece of a Laurel Burch cat print I've had for years. I still have about a yard left so you'll see it again at some point. I'm not thrilled with the puffy factor of the lining, though. I handtacked the inside corners to the outsides but it still wasn't laying flat, so I shoved a covered purse bottom made from Peltex down inside. At first, I was going to have this piece in between the lining and outside, like in my purse, but I had to change my mind after seeing the lining misbehave. It seems to be working to hold the lining in place and the solid color works to break up the busy print, which might otherwise be *too* busy if you've got a lot stuff in the bag. Here's the Grandma bag with its daughter Mom purse. Mine looks pretty saggy, but it's not really. I'm beginning to think it's harder to photograph bags than clothes.I thought using a commercial pattern would go faster, but it turns out it didn't really save much time at all if I don't count the muslining for my self-drafted pattern. The Butterick pattern was OK, though, and I'll probably use it again for the shorter version of the bag I just made and then it won't turn out so huge. I'm not sure which bag pattern I'll use next. I have at least one or two more to make and I'm enjoying experimenting. I might also get back to sewing something wearable one day soon too. ;-)"},
{"title": "B5197: Another Chapter In \"I Hate Handsewing\"", "date": "Tuesday, April 5, 2011", "text": "I'm slowly working on the Grandma purse, using Butterick 5197 (you know, the one with the Dumbest Pattern Piece Ever). I followed Bunny's example for this one and used a combo of fusible fleece and Decor Bond to interface. It's not finished yet but I'm pretty sure this combo will be perfect. Thanks Bunny! :-)On to the subject of this post title … It's not so much that I *hate* handsewing, but more that I dislike it very much when it's not necessary. I prefer to use my machine whenever and wherever possible.Case in point: There is a band/gusset that encircles the whole purse. At the top of this band, a 20\"-ish (I think it's actually 22\" but the pattern is upstairs) zipper is to be inserted. Remember that — twenty or more inches of zipper.The purse is lined, and the pattern instructions would have you press under the seam allowances where the lining meets the zipper and then handstitch the lining to the zipper tape.Twenty-ish inches, times two (for each side of the zipper).Uh, no.So, I'm trying an experiment. I sandwiched the zipper between the outside and lining pieces so they're both machine-stitched to the zipper at once. The zipper separates so it's quite easy to do each side this way separately. I've left the last 1/2\" of the lining pieces unstitched (1/2\" seam allowances) at both ends of the zipper and will either machine-stitch the rest of the lining at these spots or I will handstitch if it doesn't work like I think it will. Even if I end up handstitching, four inches is a HECK of lot more palatable than twenty-ish up and down each side of the zipper. Don't you think? Yeah, I thought so. As one of the last steps of construction, I will edgestitch along each side of the zipper catching both outside and lining fabrics. I'm playing it safe at the moment in case my experiment is a bust and I have to rip out the zipper. But if I'm on track with this deviation from the instructions and it works, I'd do the edgestitching earlier on in the process.Oh and here's a little tip. If you're ironing the panels next to your white-ish zipper and you see that your iron suddenly has a white streak on its sole plate, don't clean it off and keep ironing. It's the zipper melting, dummy. ;-)"},

{"title": "B5197: Dumbest Pattern Piece Ever", "date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "text": "I've decided to move on to a commercial pattern for the next purse, for a few reasons: I'm kind of tired of working with \"my\" pattern at the moment. It's really more my style than my mom's. And I bought a whole bunch of purse patterns during the BMV and PR sales and on Etsy and I'm wanting to use one (all of them!). If I'm being honest, it's the last reason that's tugging the hardest, and who am I to argue? ;-)So last night I decided on a modification to View D of Butterick 5197, shown above, and this morning I started cutting out the pattern pieces. But before I had all the sheets unfolded, I was confronted by this:The Dumbest Pattern Piece Ever. Yes, an ENTIRE pattern sheet printed with crisscrossing diagonal dotted lines. OK, so the pattern instructions call for pre-quilting your chosen fabric (which I'm bypassing), but does one really need an ENTIRE pattern sheet to know how to do it?I had to look up in the instructions to see exactly what was supposed to be done with this sheet and I learned that you are supposed to pin it to your fabric/batting sandwich, then baste it, and then sew over each of the dotted lines. Really? The writers conveniently forgot to mention how long it will take to pick out all those leftover bits of tissue after you tear off the \"pattern.\" Why didn't Butterick either instruct to use a quilting guide on your machine or just chalk the lines in using a ruler? Dumb, dumb, dumb.  And how many trees, worker hours, press runs, and energy units were wasted in the making of this?Other runners-up in the Dumbest Pattern Piece Ever category? Rectangles for anything and/or pattern pieces for elastic instead of a length measurement in the instructions.What pattern pieces have you come across that make you scratch your head and laugh?"},

{"title": "USMC Purse Done", "date": "Thursday, March 31, 2011", "text": "The purse is done, but I think it's really my final, \"wearable\" muslin. There were some issues with my pattern that I didn't catch in muslins 1-3. Nothing serious, but it means I have to fix the pattern and trace it again. I also had a \"construction issue\" at the end. This is why you shouldn't sew when you're tired. The zipper should not caught in the seam past the top corner. I knew this, but it just wasn't computing when I was pinning things together with the bag turned inside out. I think I ripped out this end three times. It didn't help that I bought the wrong kind of zipper. I saw the right color, the slightly bigger teeth, and the label for \"purse.\" I didn't pay attention that it was closed on both ends, with two pulls in the middle. Oops, but that's what happens when you have a teenaged son glaring at you as you try to rush through Joann's. ;-) I ended up pulling off the stop at one end and sliding off one pull. Here's the way it should, and does, look. Here's the inside. It's OK and will be useable as-is, but the side pockets would be better if I had attached them higher up. I also screwed up with the lining pattern and the bottom is about an inch bigger than the purse. I just sewed a tuck across the width of the lining on each side of the center pocket to take out the excess. Not the most elegant fix, but it's never going to show, especially with my stuff inside the purse. You can't even see the tuck in this pic of the empty inside. I added purse feet, which are entirely useless. LOL! They don't support diddly-squat. But they look good, right? ;-)Here's the other side. I added a pocket and a custom \"name\" tape. On the pocket is the tab from the sleeve cuff, with the button as it was.I like that the straps use various pieces of the original cammie blouse so there are things like seams and buttonholes included. This was not really my plan to start with but I had no choice when cutting the straps so I went with it. My Viking 6010 sewed over all that bulk like a champ.I ended up making a key ring from the Semper Fi embroidery in my last post. Nothing left over but some button plackets, a collar, and some felled seams I cut off. I'll save the buttons and send them to my son, who called earlier in the week asking how to sew on a button. I referred him to YouTube. lol I'm not sure if I want to jump back into the same pattern, with corrections, to sew up a purse for my mom or if I want to use a different (commerical) pattern. On the one hand, it can be frustrating to have to work out every little construction detail on a new pattern on your own by winging it the first time. On the other hand, I think I've now conquered most of the bugs and #2 should go much smoother. Right? Still, it's a tedious purse and maybe not the best pattern for this thick fabric and I'm thinking I should try something different to compare. Mom will be happy with whatever I decide."},
{"title": "More on the Purse", "date": "Monday, March 28, 2011", "text": "Here's the inside of the purse. I was flummoxed (don't you love that word? I do.) about what to use for interfacing since I wanted the purse to be very firm but not unsewable (I think that's a word I made up) due to bulk. Peltex is WAY too thick, but I bought some anyway. I was right, but all was not lost since I used it to make the bottom insert which will be hand-tacked to the seam allowances between the purse shell and lining so it doesn't move around. What I'm going to do with the other yard and a half, I haven't a clue. ;-) At least it was 50% off, right?I settled on horsehair canvas for most pieces because for some reason I have a LOT of it and mostly because I didn't want to wait on mail-order for something else. I still have no idea what that something else would be anyway, although I think I'm going to try Bunny's tip of fusible fleece and Decor Bond on the next one. If you haven't seen Bunny's purses, click that link for a look at it and the next post - beautiful!  The horsehair canvas worked well though.For the side panels I used some really, REALLY crappy Pellon that has been collecting dust in my sewing closet since I first started sewing and learned very quickly that this stuff is rubbish. Did I mention it's awful? So much so that it has already unfused itself and has now become a sew-in interfacing after the fact. But I put on my optimistic hat (or lazy hat, depending on how well you really know me) and used it anyway because I didn't want these panels to be as stiff as the rest of the purse since once the lining is inserted, the center divider pocket will draw in the sides so the purse will go from looking like this …… to this. More or less. It's still sitting very lopsided at the moment, but you get the idea.And this is where I'm stalled right now, since I just ran out of the color of upholstery thread I was using for topstitching and now I have to go out in the rain to Joann's (I was just there on Saturday, you would think I could plan this stuff better) and HOPE they have more of this color. Chances are not especially good since Guterman thread is on sale this week. Flowers courtesy of Michael as a thank-you for his shirt. One week later and they're still looking great, aren't they?

{"title": "Purse in Progress", "date": "Monday, March 28, 2011", "text": "I've been working on and off all weekend on my USMC cammie purse. Since I'm winging this, I had to keep taking breaks to mentally work through just what the heck I was doing, how it would go together, how the lining with an attached center pocket would work, sizing and re-sizing the bag to fit the cammie pockets, what to use for interfacing, etc. All the stuff that a commercial pattern does for you. Purse design is not as easy as it may look. The muslin graveyard. After three, I declared my pattern done and cut into the cammie fabric. And by \"cut into,\" I mean I cut apart a used cammie blouse I picked up at the local surplus store. I also had to unstitch the pockets since I was using them on my bag. Lordy, whoever made these things made them to last through a war or something. ;-) Ripping out the bar tacks holding on the pockets took forever. For the lining, I'm using a polka dot quilting fabric I already had. That sewing room valance I had planned for it wasn't getting made any time soon anyway. Here you can see the center divider pocket. You can also see part of the other interior pockets, one of which is pleated to hold my cell phone, and you can see the hook for the key fob I'll be adding. Just above the divider pocket you can see where the seam is left open to turn the whole shebang right side out, once I ever get to that point. Right now the lining and the purse exterior are still separate, because … … the purse exterior isn't yet done, as you can see by all the pieces in the pic below. That's the lining in the upper left corner. I also embroidered a name tape since the surplus shirt came with \"Garcia,\" and I didn't think that was close enough to \"Cook\" to go unnoticed. While I was at it, I stitched out Semper Fi too and will add that in somewhere. I think I use the embroidery capabilites of my sewing machine about once a year these days. Here's what's left of the cammie blouse, which is nothing more than lots of little scraps and a collar. I cut up the sleeves into strips for the purse straps and had to creatively lay out the other pattern pieces on the body of the shirt. In other words, reverse origami.Hopefully I will get this done in the next couple of days, work schedule permitting. And then I'll be starting all over again because I'm making one for the Marine's grandma too, for Mother's Day. And maybe another for my sister, but probably not in cammie fabric.

I spent way too much time yesterday looking at downloadable purse patterns on Etsy before I decided I should just try my hand at my own pattern, save the purchase money, and end up with exactly what I wanted. I worked up a pattern after dinner and what you're seeing in the pic is my first muslin. I need to enlarge the bag a little so the pockets will fit better on a sharper angle. Real USMC cammie blouse pockets are set on that same angle. Why? I don't know. Anyone? Bueller?

Hopefully, Michael will send me a modeled pic or two once he's got his new shirt in hand (or on body?) since my hanger shots are dismal. The fabric is really nice. I think Michael picked a winner in terms of color and weave. It's 100% cotton and a good shirting weight. Wrinkling during sewing and handling was minimal, so it should wear very nicely. Here's the back view. I moved the back waist darts a little more toward center, after confirmation from Peter. I also deepened them a little since Michael is very slim in his lower torso. Here's a view of a sleeve placket. I promise, it lays flat even though this pic indicates otherwise. You can see the buttons better in this shot too. They are purple-y brown with a pearl finish. I like the purple tint as a subtle accent. I hope Michael does too. Michael wanted the finished length about 1\" shorter than the unhemmed muslin, so I cut off 1/2\" and then turned up a double 1/4\"-ish hem. It's probably closer to 3/8\" if we were to get out a ruler. I had an extra button, so I sewed it to the inside button band. Hopefully, it won't be needed but it's there in case. That was the only button I sewed by hand. The others were attached with my machine. Yay button-sewing foot!For a bit of personalization and fun, I used the lettering on my machine to create a \"label.\" You can't see it clearly in this pic, but it reads: HANKO • NYC • 2011. I'm going to toss the shirt into the wash today to remove markings and glue stick, and then it will be in the mail tomorrow. Julia asked yesterday what kind of glue I use. For this, just a regular washable glue stick from Office Depot. (Let it dry before sewing so you don't gum up the needle. Pressing with dry iron speeds that process.) On other projects I also use Glue Pins, which is a clear washable more liquid-y glue, and/or Collins Wonder Tape. They all have a spot in my notions arsenal and are so much easier to sew over than pins. ;-)Now I'm off to tidy up the sewing room and decide what's up next.

I only have the hem, buttonholes and buttons to do and I will get those done after I finish this post. But I had to take this break to say:I HATE flat-felled seams! OK, maybe \"hate\" is a little strong. But they bug me. A lot. They are so fiddly to do neatly. Sure, they get better with practice (and a glue stick), as shown in my examples below. The first photo shows my squiggly seam allowance on the wrong side of the sleeve head. I *know* it will never be seen (after Peter is done inspecting my sewing, which BTW, because I'm sewing for someone else is not nearly as straight as my usual output. Figures, right?), but it still bugs me. This is the other sleeve head, after I arbitrarily decided learned from practicing to trim a little extra from the seam allowance that is folded over. Not perfect, but much nicer. I can only imagine that if this shirt had three or four sleeves, I'd be close to perfection. ;-)But since this particular seam is in a location that will never be seen when the shirt is worn, why bother with flat felling it? It's one thing if you have a factory with machines dedicated to flat-felling men's shirt seams, but in a home-sewing environment, serging the armhole seams and topstitching is just as good as spending all that time trimming, pressing, and wrestling seam allowances that will never be seen. And it's just as sturdy too. I mean, women have been wearing serged armholes for years now, right? ;-)Yeah, yeah. I know there are one or two good reasons for flat-felled seams (especially the seam on a long sleeve that might be rolled up), but I'm venting so I'm not feeling generous toward those reasons right now. And the venting felt so good. :-)Now Michael, if your missing internet has miraculously shown up again and you're reading this, don't fret. I'm still enjoying the whole process of making this shirt.

Me included. So what if February is over. Yesterday, I was finally able to cut out Michael's shirt from the good fabric.But let me back up just a second. The yellow muslin arrived in NYC the week before last. Peter pressed it, and Michael modeled. Peter and Michael think it fits well. I agree, except for …… the back waist darts.I think the darts are too close to the sideseams and should be moved a little more toward the center of Michael's back. And maybe deepened a hair. Peter and Michael are having a fit another fitting evaluation today and will let me know.In the meantime, since dart placement can wait until the end, I went ahead and cut the shirt. I am cheating with plaid/check matching by using bias accents to avoid the matching altogether. This means a little extra stabilization was needed for all that bias, so I used a very light fusible on both sides of the cuffs and collar stand, interfaced the entire front button placket, and cut the inside yoke on the straight grain to stabilize the public view outside bias yoke. As I'm typing this, I just realized I forgot the sleeve plackets. Oops. I also went back to my copy of Nancy Zieman's Sewing Express and used her Express Collar technique. The collar is now one piece, shown at the bottom of the photo below. Odd looking, isn't it?(Don't bother clicking the above photo because it will still be blurry. My camera battery died an ugly death just as I snapped that.)With the Express Collar technique, the seams (and thus bulk) at the points of the collar are eliminated and the undercollar is automatically on the bias with a seam in the middle. I reversed the layout, though, since I wanted the upper collar to be bias. All it meant was to lay the pattern piece 45 degrees different than the instructions. I also interfaced the whole thing, since I was using lightweight interfacing.Next will be to actually start sewing, which I hope to do tonight."},
{"title": "Butterick 5610: The Wearable Muslin I'll Never Wear", "date": "Saturday, March 5, 2011", "text": "I didn't start out to make a wearable muslin. I figured if it worked, I'd wear it. If not, I'd just toss it. Looks like I'll be tossing it … into the donation bin. Someone will wear it, but it won't be me.Side note: I was in the sewing room about 9 AM today, but only just now finished it (sans bottom hem) because as it became clearer that I wasn't going to like it, I just dawdled and wasted time and went in and out of the sewing room ALL DAY LONG. Does anyone else do that? Sheesh. If I had just plowed through, I could've finished it and had my next project ready to sew. It fits perfectly. So what's the problem? Well, never trust pattern drawings — especially those without an accompanying photographed modeled shot. The neckline is way wider than the drawings suggest. I think I'd call it a scoop-neck bateau, which isn't a real style name I don't think, but it fits. The front of the neckline is definitely scooped. It could even be a little lower and I would still like it. But where it's supposed to cover my bra straps on the sides? It doesn't. Not even close. And it's not something I can pin, tape, or bra-saver into place, and since the top half is already two layers (more on that later), there's no way I'd ever wear another layer under it. Sewing Demons - 1Debbie - 0Here it is on me. You can't really see my bra straps too clearly but that's only because it's a nude colored bra and my hair is making a shadow. Trust me, in real life the bra straps are loud and clear. And those two inches I added to the length for insurance? Completely unnecessary. If I were really going to wear this, I'd chop it off at least 2 inches. Sewing Demons - 2Debbie - 0I also had a wild hair and decided to pipe the front seam between the upper chest and torso. I like effect. Too bad it's mostly hidden in the print. Just like the pleats.Sewing Demons - 3Debbie - 0Overall, I still like the idea of this top. But it's got a few stupidities that I will have to correct if I decide to make it again. The neckline for starters. But look at this mess:Yes, those are full copies of the upper sections as facings. With instructions to hand tack most of it. Yeah, right. Not. If I make this again, I'm either making new facings that don't include the sleeves or (more likely) binding the (corrected) neckline. For this one, I used the \"burrito\" method for the sleeves so there is a seam at the edge instead of hand tacking and I stitched in the ditch from the front to catch the facing. Besides the PITA factor of using these facings as-is per the pattern, they are just screaming for a stretched-out neckline that rolls to the front and floppy sleeves. I avoided that by edge-stitching the neckline seam allowances to the facing and then taking extra time to hang the top from Zillie and pin very carefully before tacking the facing into place. For a top I won't wear. Sewing Demons - 4Debbie - 0Tomorrow, I'm planning to cut out Michael's shirt in the good fabric. I'm hoping the Sewing Demons have had their laugh and moved on."},

{"title": "Butterick 5610: Pattern Alterations", "date": "Monday, February 28, 2011", "text": "Subtitle: \"Or How I Really Need To Vacuum the Sewing Room Floor\"Please try to ignore the shreds of Ren Faire costume still on the floor but laying the patterns out here was the best way to get the photos even if I haven't yet completely cleaned up after the costume shop closed. So, onto the alterations. I'll start with the back. I usually start with a size 18 pattern for the upper chest and neckline area and then I'll grade outward for my ample lower half. This sizes in this envelope stopped at 18, so I had to grade (and I use that term loosely) outward without any helper pattern lines. I compared this pattern piece to a TNT back piece to get a visual on how much I needed to add. Because the sideseam grading lines on the new pattern were an even 1/2\", I graded to a \"20\" at the sideseams by just adding an even 1/2\" all the way down the pattern. This keeps the integrity of stitching line. But (excuse the pun!) because my lower half is bigger than a pattern 20, I still needed to add more. Instead of adding it at the sideseam — which usually has a Judy Jetson effect on me, because I need the space over the cheeks, not at the sides — I split the pattern from the upper edge to the hem and added a wedge of new tissue. In a close-fitting top I'd alter differently, but this is a casual-fit tee and the additional ease across the back by adding this fast wedge is OK for that. I also added 2\" across the bottom for additional length (because I like the extra insurance when making a new pattern), and I raised the armhole to correspond to the square shoulder adjustment I made to the shoulder/sleeves pieces.The front has pretty much the same alterations (adding for belly instead of butt). Because it's a full pattern piece, I had to make the alterations to both sides. Technically, I could have done a more traditional FBA and rotated the dart to the front pleats, but (1) I tissue fit with the pleats folded into place and decided there would be enough space for the girls with the quicker alterations, and (2) I am lazy. The wedge and the sideseam increase gives me more width across the bust, and then continues downward for more width across the abdomen. The sleeve and neckline yoke are all-in-one pieces. I added to the shoulder area for my square shoulders, and also added an additional 1/2\" to each underarm area so they would match up with the 1/2\" I added to the sideseams on the front and back pieces.Yesterday, I cut out a \"tester\" and hope to sew it up in the next day or so. It's not a true muslin, because I used wearable fabric. If it works, great. If not, I won't cry. I'll just make adjustments and try again."},

Hopefully, he and Peter will take some pics over the weekend so we can approve the fit and I can start on the final shirt. Since Peter has already made this pattern for Michael, I'm anticipating that there won't be any issues. Fingers crossed.Until then, I've continued deconstructing my husband's RTW shirt. Tanit-Isis left a comment on my last post asking for an inside view of the RTW placket before I ripped it apart. No problemo. ;-)To refresh, this is the finished RTW placket from the outside, public view:And here is what it looks like on the reverse:The placket piece itself is 2-1/2\" wide and the finished width is a hair under 1\".As you can see below, the slash for the placket is trimmed down to 1/4\" seam allowances. This construction method actually differs from Sommerset's method that I linked to last post, and is instead …… the method shown in Nancy Zieman's Sewing Express. This book comes from my mom's sewing library, but she gave it to me 8-9 years ago when I first picked up sewing as an obsession instead of a chore. If you click on the pic below, it should open full-size. (BTW, I recommend this book for other timesavers too. It's got a lot of good tips. Not sure why mom gave it away, but I'm not complaining.)Over the weekend, I'm hoping to get the pattern adjusted for this new-ish Butterick pattern, and maybe even get a fast muslin done. But I also have some work and household errands, so we'll see where I end up."},

With all of those faults, this is still actually somewhat nicer than  my usual muslins. Don't faint when you try it on Michael. The final  shirt will be bee-you-tee-full. ;-)An interesting side note:  I took apart one of the sleeve plackets on my husband's discarded RTW shirt. This is what it looks like before surgery.And this is after.Hopefully you can see that there are no stupid \"Little House on the Placket\" pieces here, and instead it's just like Summerset's wonderful tutorial. Although the finished RTW placket is somewhat wider, which is easy enough to adjust if desired. I'm going to use the RTW method any time I have to do a regular sleeve placket. It's just so much faster, easier and absolutely NOT fiddly at all. A total no-brainer, if you ask me."},

Or is that a fuzzy memory from a past dream? :-)I've pulled out the muslin I cut out almost a month ago now. Time flies. I will have it sewn by tonight and in tomorrow's mail to NYC. There's not much to say about it yet, as it's just a muslin. I'm mostly just documenting so Michael and Peter see that I really am progressing again. I am not sewing pretty or even completely. For instance, the yoke is single-layer and most seams won't be finished. It's for fit only, and the fabric (bright yellow pique) is awful enough that it would never do for a wearable shirt anyway.Parting shot: As you can see, I wasn't the only one thrilled to see Tyler this weekend.

{"title": "The Marines Have Landed", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "text": "My son (left) and one of his friends (from boot, combat training, and now his current school) arrived at Disneyworld late Friday night. So late, that it was actually Saturday morning. We took them back home for a short visit. But short is better than nothing, and we were thrilled to have some time with them. I hadn't seen Tyler since Christmas Day in North Carolina and DH hadn't seen him since his boot leave over Thanksgiving. Saturday we hung out at home for a little while and then Tyler took us all out to lunch. Saturday night, the Marines donned their dress blues to head out on the town. Yes, it was all planned for attention-getting and free drinks. They reported that it worked and they had zero out-of-pocket expenses. ;-) But I think they've earned a few free drinks, and it makes me happy to see how happy and proud they are about their new lives. And don't they look gorgeous!! Reko was tempted to wear his Ren Faire duds to out-fancy them, but he went with jeans and a tee shirt instead. Sunday, they slept in a bit and were then driven back to Disney by Tyler's former girlfriend, Kelli, who is now just a good friend. DH and I met up with the three of them again after Magic Kingdom closed, for a late dinner at Planet Hollywood. We dropped the Marines off at their hotel and said our goodbyes around 2 AM. (Kudos to Planet Hollywood for offering a military discount, which saved us over $25 on the bill!)On March 1, Tyler heads back to North Carolina for his next training school at the Marine base at Cherry Point. He will be there for a 2-3 months, depending on exactly when he picks up his next class. There's always a waiting list for training classes. In the meantime, the Corps will keep him busy doing something or other. Once that class is almost over, he will be assigned a Permanent Duty Station (PDS) and we'll finally know where he'll be stationed."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - The Whole Shebang", "date": "Thursday, February 17, 2011", "text": "I am officially done. I knocked out the hat in the afternoon and Reko came over after dinner as previously planned. Everything fit perfectly, no alterations required. The only adjustment was to make a pleat at the bottom of each doublet sleeve and add a button on top of the pleat, so the hem area would fit his wrists tighter and keep the shirt sleeve lace peeking out. That was not the most elegant fix, but it worked and looks OK, and there was really no way to take in the wrist without taking apart the whole sleeve.Yes, this is his actual facial hair. Don't you just love that curly mustache?The hat was super-fast to cut and sew. Now that I see it with the rest of the costume, I'm OK with using the brocade for it. I also like the black lining showing. It balances the black in the slops (breeches). Reko is wearing my collar pin. It's got black and red stones and coordinates perfectly. He also has a big gold cross he'll be wearing, plus a leather belt to hold  his flask and sword. The only thing still MIA is a feather for his hat. Reko will shop for that himself. Reko got a big laugh out of the codpiece and has now tasked himself with coming up with witty replies for the comments he's sure to hear. The little eyelets were not working as anchor tie-ons, so I went for the big guns and used some grommets I had on hand for the bottom. The bottom of the codpiece hides them. For the top anchors, I sewed two more buttons onto the waistband on either side of the fly and fashioned \"buttonholes\" out of the leather ties with creative knots. I've now lost count of how many buttons I've sewed on for this costume. I think I'm close to or over 30. Reko bought the perfect shoes from Etsy. They're hard to see here, but they are handmade black pleather pull-on booties and have a definite Olde World vibe. He's wearing black tights. I had to give him a quick \"How to Put On Pantyhose\" lesson, which was hilarious. I will take outside pics whenever we get to the actual Ren Faire. I'm looking forward to seeing him in character. BTW, his character is named Don Sancho Christo Perico De La Vincente De 5th, and he will speak with a Spanish accent. I can't wait!"},
{"title": "I Hit a Wall", "date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2011", "text": "I should've been sewing a hat last night but instead I vegged in front of the tube. I needed a break from costume sewing. Reko is supposed to come over today for a fitting, but I'm hoping I can convince him that tomorrow will work better since he can leave with a hat if he waits until then. I've decided to use the extra fabric from the costume and line it with black. I can always buy a better solid red later and make another hat if this turns out to be more print than either of us wants. Thank you everyone for all the really nice comments. They've made me smile. However, I will NOT be starting a costume sewing sideline any time soon. lol This project has been fun, but it's been very time-consuming and it would not be lucrative in the least. I have spent over $200 in supplies and patterns (Reko's wallet, not mine!) and far more time than I want to add up, but I think I'd have to sell this outfit for $1,000 to turn a profit. I don't think there are too many peeps out there willing to pay that kind of dough for a costume. For those of you who think my sewing has been extraordinary, I shouldn't admit this, but I will. The sewing has been no more difficult than sewing most any other thing. It's the fancy shiny fabric and trim that makes it look impressive. There are a lot more pieces to this outfit than what we wear around town these days, but that only adds time, not difficulty. But if you want to continue to toss adoration and envy my way, please feel free. ;-)Now I need to go cut out some hat pieces."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - Doublet Sleeves", "date": "Tuesday, February 15, 2011", "text": "You're probably tired of all these costume posts. I promise, I'm almost done. Last night I made the sleeves for the doublet. They are separate because they tie on, giving the wearer the option of sleeves or no sleeves. Kind of neat thing, although one's armpits are pretty much fully exposed.Below is one of the completed sleeves. It's a two-piece fully lined shaped sleeve, but the front seam is left open and just caught in four evenly-spaced spots so that the shirt underneath can peek through. Each of those four spots has a button sewn on top (that's 24 buttons for the costume, in case anyone but me is counting.). These Renaissance folks were all about layers and having all of their finery showing through slots, panes and slashes. The more, the merrier, and the richer you appeared to be.The pattern calls for sewing tabs at the top of the sleeve, but I vetoed that because it meant the ties would be separate. Instead, I sewed the ties (black real suede) into the top of the sleeve to align with the tabs under the doublet flanges. Less opportunity for Reko to lose the ties and more opportunity to get the sleeve tied higher into the armsyce area. Here you can see the 3 black tabs sewn under the doublet flange.Joann's didn't have small grommets so for now the scratchy eyelets will have to do. I used black Ultrasuede for the tabs to avoid the extra bulk of turned seam allowances on a tiny rectangle. I'm thinking if I have to stay with the eyelets for the codpiece anchors, I will make little \"flaps\" from the Ultrasuede and attach them to the inside of the breeches to cover the rough spots of the eyelets. Reko is wearing tights under the breeches and even if the rough backs of the eyelets don't bother his skin, I think they would still snag the tights. Most men aren't used to dealing with runs in their hose so better to be safe with little cover flaps, I think.Here is the top of the sleeve tied to the tabs. The flange is still folded upward. Once the flange is back in its correct position, the ties are mostly hidden.We'll probably trim the ties so they are more hidden, but I wanted to start with them too long vs. too short and get Reko's input on how much length he needs to tie them.Here's the (mostly) completed costume, with both sleeves tied on. It will be 100% complete after the fitting. I still have to make a hat, but I've decided I don't like the color of the red fabric I initially purchased. It's not bright red enough. So, back to Joann's yet again later today. Or, maybe I'll just use the bright red from the costume. I do have enough left over. I just don't know if it will be too much. Although what exactly is too much on a shiny red and gold Renaissance costume?;-)And the back view.You can sort of see the shirt fabric peeking out of the right-side armpit. The sleeves only tie at the top so the bottom of the armhole is completely free. Good for Florida ventilation, right?I will definitely have photos of Reko dressed up, but I will probably have to wait for him to take them so that he's got all of his accessories on too. He's all about photos of himself in his various costumes, so I don't doubt there will be plenty. This red is so hard to photograph inside. I'm sure the outdoor photos he'll take will be much better. And besides, a little break from all of these costume shots will probably be welcome. ;-)I'm really looking forward to some easy sewing - like a men's dress shirt. Hahaha! It's coming, I promise, Michael, I promise."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - Coming Together", "date": "Monday, February 14, 2011", "text": "Here's the doublet, without the detachable sleeves. I'll be working on those today. I think they'll go fast since they are basically just lined tubes. There are tabs  under the sleeve flanges with brass eyelets in them to tie the sleeves onto. But the eyelets are rough on one side, so I'm going to head to Joann's later to find small grommets instead. I don't want the sleeve eyelets to rub a hole in the shirt and I don't think Reko will want codpiece eyelets to rub a hole in …whatever. The doublet is a lot of work. Let me repeat. A. Lot. Of. Work. None of the work (did I mention there is a lot of it?) is particularly difficult. It's just that there are many, many separate pieces to cut and get ready before you put them all together. I started working on the doublet Friday evening and spent all of Saturday and all of Sunday (with few breaks) to get it to the stage you see in these photos. Simplicity would have you hand-sew the entire bottom hem of the lining onto the fashion fabric by hand. BY HAND! Hahaha. Not me. Not to mention how much of a PITA it would've been to press a hem into the shifty lining fabric. Instead, I sewed the lining as you usually would for a vest — armholes, neckline, and leaving the bottom hem open so you can turn each side of the doublet separately, then sew up the sideseams in one continuous seam. Which would be OK except the sideseams aren't really sideseams. They are princess seams that curve to the back. So, it wasn't one continuous go but two per side because everything didn't want to line up without some rearranging around the curves. But that was still OK, since I could do all of it by machine. Where I went off on my own was to re-open a section of the center back seam of the lining. Through that hole, I turned the doublet sort of inside out (\"burrito style\" if you're familiar with that on yokes and collars, etc.) so I could sew the lining and doublet hems RS together by machine. The CB seam is still open in case I need to make any adjustments. I'll sew that 5 inches by hand instead of the complete hem of the whole doublet. I can handle that.Here's a preview of the completed pieces. After the sleeves today, I'll work on the hat. Reko will be here Wednesday evening for a final fitting and will then wait while I make any adjustments or, hopefully, just sew up the open seams."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - The Doublet Beginneth", "date": "Sunday, February 13, 2011", "text": "The doublet should be called a centuplet. It has SO MANY pieces to cut out and interface. And if the envelope design wasn't enough for me, I divided the torso sections into two so I could use a second fabric and I added a collar stand. All of the torso pieces had to be cut single layer so I could fussy-cut the designs across the center front and center back. I cut and fused for HOURS yesterday. I stopped counting at 37 pieces. Today, I've been adding trim to most of those 37+ pieces, adding eyelets to the sleeve tabs, and sewing on the button loops — which are really just black hair elastics. I have FINALLY started sewing all the pieces together. I'm hoping to have a mostly finished doublet by the time I go to bed tonight.I think the rest is just simple construction and some hand-sewing of the lining and buttons.I ended up fusing two layers of the interfacing to the torso fabric so  it would have the same hand as the main, more red fabric. It's a beautiful fabric, but it was far more drapier than I was expecting so I had to \"beef it up.\" Update on the puffy shirt: I fixed the backwards buttonhole/button on the one cuff and then ran the shirt through the laundry to get rid of the sticky tape used to hold on the lace until it was stitched. Then I had to re-press it. And I was again thankful my iron came back to life. I hope Reko has an iron. ;-)"},

And it would be, except that I put one buttonhole and button on the wrong side of the cuff for one sleeve. THANKFULLY, I hadn't cut the buttonholes yet. So, one puffy shirt and one sleeve complete. One closure to be reworked tomorrow. Don't sew buttonholes in a hurry so you can take pics for your blog. ;-) But that's the only thing that gave me trouble today. The sleeves and cuffs themselves went together without a hitch. And for some really good news? My iron is working again. I have no idea. In desperation earlier this afternoon, I decided to give it one last try and it turned on. I *know* it's not the outlet because it's plugged into it now and the backup was plugged into it earlier (before I stomped on it in a fit of frustration and tossed it out the window — just kidding. Maybe.). But I'm not going to question it and just enjoy having it back. Thanks for all the tips on where to buy another one, though. I do have a Tuesday Morning nearby that I've never been to. I think I'll swing by soon and see what's available for a better back-up in case my Rowenta wants another vacation. Next up after the buttonhole is fixed will be the doublet. I'm looking forward to working with the fancy stuff again. This linen (cotton/linen blend really) is perfect for the role, but it has shredded all over my sewing room.

{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - Easy Puffy Shirt? Hah!", "date": "Wednesday, February 9, 2011", "text": "So remember the other day when I said the shirt would go fast because it's easy? Yeah, about that. Well …… it is simple but it's also fiddly and has stupid instructions, skinny ties to turn, and lots of gathering. Which means it's taking longer than I thought it would. (Don't you hate that?) Plus I had to redo the collar stand because using self-fabric as interfacing was useless and it just did not want to cooperate. Or maybe I was just too impatient the first time. I plead the Fifth. But look at the fabric shreds at the bottom of the pic to see what a PITA this fabric is.I suppose technically it's my fault for buying cheap Joann's linen. After dinner tonight, I pulled out Ye Olde Fusibleth, recut the stand pieces, picked the lace out of the first version, and had another go at it. Much better. And that's where I quit for today.The sleeves have yet more gathering top and bottom, lace, and a buttoned cuff.I will have to pay attention for those too, darn it.ETA: I don't know how I forgot to complain about this during the first edit, but my freakin' iron died today. No warning signs. It just won't power up and get hot. Yes, I tried different outlets. It's the iron. So I've had to use a back-up iron and I hate it. It's brand new (bought for the Marine who promptly left it behind) and it leaks water like nobody's business. Right out of the hole you add water to. It actually splashes out when you stand it back upright. What a piece of crap. Which means it's actually a good thing my son left it here. Well, good for him. So, it's either Walmart or Target for a non-Rowenta or Joann's for another over-priced Rowenta. I don't want to have to deal with this right now, but I definitely miss the weight of my Rowenta compared to the back-up and I'm ready to throw the back-up out the window."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - Is That a Codpiece on Your Breeches Or Are You Just Happy to See Me?", "date": "Tuesday, February 8, 2011", "text": "So I've sewn and stuffed the codpiece. It's hysterical. And speaking of funny, I always find it amusing when I hear complaints about how revealing clothing is \"these days.\" What days? Waaaay back during the Renaissance, men were showcasing their \"packages\" and women were pushing up and baring most of their bosom, even if they were wearing layer upon layer of clothing.So, here's the pattern pieces for the codpiece. Not much to say about those. If you want a less-3D result, you would go down a \"cup size\" or two by reducing the \"princess seam\" curve on the front. I told Reko that it turned out more 3D than I realized. It didn't seem to bother him. But he's a guy. ;-)Here's a semi-side shot. I haven't done anything to attach it yet, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to go with the brass eyelets. A pair under the waistband on either side of the fly and one pair at the bottom of the fly. The leather ties will lace through them. I'm glad *I* won't have to pee while wearing this. Oh, and here's a tip. Make buttonholes BEFORE you stuff the legs if you want any maneuverability while sewing them.I cut out the puffy shirt last night and will sew it later today. It's very simple so it should go together quickly. Ignore my iron-cleaning rag under the board. Ewww.After the shirt, I'll be starting the doublet. My second fabric finally arrived yesterday. I'm thinking of using fusible horsehair canvas (which I have) on the torso pieces of the doublet to make them really sturdy. Back in the day, doublets were actually stuffed with real horse hair and other stuff. But I'm still thinking on this. It could be overkill. I'll test on a scrap first and think about it some more. Opinions?* * * * *Also in the mail, my order from the last BMV sale arrived. I didn't renew my Club BMV membership because I don't think I ordered enough patterns last year for the 10% additional savings to pay for the cost of the membership. But that won't stop me from continuing to order patterns during the $2.99/$3.99 sales. It's so much more convenient to order online, knowing that the patterns are in stock in my size, I won't be spending any gas or travel time, and I won't be tempted by impulse buys in the store. I'd rather pay $1 more per pattern to avoid all that and have them delivered right to me in a few days. I really wish Simplicity would have these sales on their website.So, what did I buy?Vogue 8689 - I love the seaming on this blouse, plus the multi cup sizes. I've had this on my wish list ever since Vogue released it, waiting for one of these BMV sales.Butterick 5429 - it's a wardrobe pattern but I bought it for the top, which is a cute twisty  neckline.Butterick 5619 - another wardrobe pattern which I bought for one piece — the jacket. I'm not sure if I'll actually make it, although it's a good candidate for the Jacket-A-Month Sew-Along. This is one of those patterns I bought for bedtime reading. ;-)Butterick 5436 - I could easily draft this, but why bother when it's only 3 bucks? This will be a good birthday present in July for my sister, who loves to cook. I'm sure I'll make another scrub top for her too, as she always begs for those. I also love this plus-sized model. I think I own every Butterick pattern she's modeled for.Butterick 5616 - I already have a similar TNT jeans jacket pattern so I have no idea why I bought this except that the illustration drew (hah!) me in. The text description is \"very loose fitting.\" Not a good sign. But the drawing *is* cute, isn't it?Butterick 5610 - love this and will definitely make it soon. If soon means March, because I think I'm booked until then."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - Slops Nearly Doneth", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2011", "text": "I'd say the slops are 98% done, if we don't count the codpiece. I still have to sew down the waistband facing and do the buttons/buttonholes. Since the codpiece is a separate thing, that will get its own posting. I'm still working out in my brain how to attach the thing. I'm thinking brass eyelets probably.The legs are stuffed. I hope Reko can sit down. ;-) But it's soft bridal tulle, which isn't scratchy and weighs almost nothing, which is a good thing because these slops must weigh about 5 pounds before the stuffing.Here's a close-up of the legband trim. I'll be using both of these trims on the doublet so I wanted to coordinate both pieces. Plus, I'm almost out of the trim used on the panes. I've set aside about 45\" to use on the doublet.I added a fly shield behind the front opening and will sew the buttons onto that. I have about 40 of these buttons in the stash so they're \"free.\"That's where I'm leaving things today. Now it's time to make some nachos and other snacks, and break open the Smirnoff Ice in time for the Superbowl. Can I say I'm already tired of seeing Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston on the pre-game shows? Sheesh. Let's see some tight ends instead, OK? (Did I just type that out loud?)The breeches (paned slops) are about 75% complete. I still need to stuff them, add the waistband, add some sort of closure TBD, and add trim to the leg bands. Plus figure out that codpiece. I'm waiting on a double-check lower thigh measurement from Reko because the leg bands look kind of small and I'm now doubting my measurement. Then again, Reko has skinny legs so it's probably fine. But better safe than sorry and it is 2 AM after all. I like the black fabric in this photo because it shows the sheen that makes it look like silk even though it's just a high thread-count sheet.To attach the leg bands, I pleated the black fabric behind the panes (strips) so the panes would lay flat. They are interfaced and lined, and far too bulky to gather or pleat. This is what it looks like from the reverse. I wasn't OCD about the pleating because it will be covered by the lining (breeches).This is what it looks like from the right side. The leg band looks like a completely different color, but that's because the grain is laying in the opposite direction of the panes and the light hits it differently. On a moving body, everything will look the same. Or that's the plan. ;-)I'm hoping to have these finished before the Superbowl starts, as the Smirnoff Ice will be coming out and I probably shouldn't be operating heavy machinery at that point. ;-) I like both teams so I'm hoping for an exciting game and will be happy with either as the winner, although I might be leaning toward the Steelers just a little bit.

{"title": "Ren Faire Costume - Ye Olde Sewing Continues", "date": "Friday, February 4, 2011", "text": "Tomorrow the paned slops should progress to the wearable stage. In case none of that made sense (and I don't blame you!), pane = the strips of fabric that hang over another visible layer (the slops) and breeches = the lining. All 3 layers attach to the same waistband and leg bands. Feel free to jump in with better information. Renaissance garb is still new to me. I've been calling the whole thing \"breeches\" because I think slops sounds weird.Here's my progress so far. The panes have all been completed and attached top and bottom to the slops. What you see below is one half; the other half is slightly visible on the bottom of the pic. The slops are basically puffy no-sideseam shorts. The breeches/lining are not puffy, but still no-sideseam. They are also shorter than the slops so that when they are both sewn together, the slops layer puffs around the thighs and hangs over the leg band like the puffy hem skirts/dresses that are recently popular. There will be \"stuffing\" (bridal tulle) hand-tacked between the breeches and slops to help retain the puff. I really hope I don't forget that step and end up frog stitching.Here you can sort of see that the panes hang free over the slops. It will be more apparent once everything is assembled.The brocade is very ravelly and I think I'm going to thread the serger with black thread tomorrow and go around the edges of this layer before I put everything together. I know they didn't have sergers in the 1500s, but they didn't have sewing machines either. Too bad for them. ;-)I did finally hear from the Ebay seller of the other fabric I'm waiting on. He apologized and promised that it's on the way via Priority Mail. I checked his feedback and he did have a couple of comments about slow shipping but nothing about missing items, so I'm going to stay optimistic. I've got plenty to keep me busy until it gets here, and I'm waiting on more trim to arrive too. Plus, I also need to squeeze in a men's shirt muslin in the next few days. (Hi Peter and Michael!)"},

I'm starting to get worried and may have to come up with a Plan B. I've still got time, so I'm not in panic mode yet.There are over 30 pieces to cut for the breeches, and I'm happy to say that that's done. Most of it is straight line rectangles (panes, waist and leg bands), so it wasn't difficult cutting. The black is  an unused cotton sateen sheet that I just happened to have in the linen closet. It is being used for the breeches underlayer and the reverse sides of the panes and bands. Free fabric is a good thing with an expensive project like this.I block-fused one yard of the brocade with Palmer/Pletsch Light and then cut all my strips and the cod pieces. (Thanks, Linda F, for the info in your comment!)I completed one pane just to see how it would turn out with the trim attached. I'll assembly-line sew and press the others.Here's a close-up:That's all I have today. I hope to be productive this evening and make some good progress on the breeches. It's easy sewing. The fiddly bit will be fitting the breeches onto the bands by either gathering or pleating. I haven't decided which yet."},
{"title": "Ren Faire Muslin - Modeled", "date": "Tuesday, February 1, 2011", "text": "It fits pretty great and Reko loves it! Yay! Here's the doublet front. There are some diagonal folds in the front, but they're because of the poor pinning job. I'm not going to worry about these. Reko is wearing one of my husband's shirts under the doublet to simulate the full linen shirt he'll be wearing with the real thing.The back is a little tight at the top. Reko says it doesn't feel tight, but I'm going to let out this seam a smidge because the real doublet will be lined and thus a smidge tighter than this. The wrinkles around his waist are because I didn't clip/trim the contoured seam there. Same for around the armholes.He liked the idea of detachable sleeves and was going to ask me about them, so that worked out. I'll need the supplies for that. I should be able to pick up what I need locally for pretty cheap.Next up were the breeches. These fit pretty good too. The only alterations will be to make the waistband and leg bands tighter. We've also decided to give a \"codpiece\" a go. Ahem. I *won't* be fitting that! ;-) And I have no idea what I'm doing with how to attach it. Hopefully, I can figure it out.My next step will be to trace off the front and back pieces of the doublet because I'll be using two fabrics and the pattern is for one piece and I do want to keep the tissue pieces I did cut intact in case I'm \"hired\" again next year. ;-) After that, I will begin the cutting marathon for the breeches.Reko is always involved in some activity that requires a costume. Here he is this past Sunday, during the Warrior Dash. I think I want to be Reko. ;-)* * * * *In Marine son news — tomorrow Tyler moves up from Private to PFC, which means a stripe and a raise in pay. This is an automatic TIS (time in service) promotion after 6 months TIS. Well, not quite — he gets to skip almost an entire month because his enlistment date was August 31. If he had enlisted August 1, he would have been be promoted no sooner. This will continue to be a bonus for him throughout his career because his TIS will always count from August 1. Nice!"},
{"title": "Ren Faire Muslin", "date": "Monday, January 31, 2011", "text": "The muslin is done and Reko will be here this afternoon to try it on.Most of it was pretty straightforward sewing and construction. The breeches have a pattern problem, though, so I'm glad I did the muslin. There is an outer layer (the puffy view you can see) and an inner layer/lining, which is not puffy. The problem is the thigh circumference on the inner pattern is smaller than the smallest leg band pattern. This means the leg band is too long for the breeches lining. I should've measured and compared before, but I didn't. So I just made a tuck for the muslin and will measure Reko's actual leg when he's here so I can make just one adjustment instead of guessing and then re-adjusting.The doublet sleeves are drafted to be detachable. Reko and I haven't discussed this yet, but I'm going to try to steer him to use the detachable sleeves so he has more style options. Plus, the Ren Faire runs through April and it will be HOT here by then. Detachable sleeves would be a good thing. For the muslin, I attached the sleeves. They're cool sleeves, both literally and figuratively. They are two-piece and the seam running down the front of the arm is open, and just tacked at 4 spots with a button/buttonloop so the shirt underneath will show through. Those (wealthy) Tudors (or Elizabethans? Or both? I'm not sure.)  loved to slash up their clothes and show lots of layers of fine fabrics.I also added a collar band. The pattern doesn't have one, but looking at period illustrations and other Ren Faire costumes, I think it's more appropriate to include it.Once the fit is adjusted, if necessary, the hardest part of all of this will be all the cutting I'm going to have to do. Lots and lots of pieces and pretty much everything is lined. I will start with the breeches since the second fabric for the doublet isn't here yet. I'm hoping to cut a few pieces per weekday evening so I can have weekends for the fun part of sewing."},
{"title": "More Costume Fabric", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2011", "text": "I went to Joann's yesterday morning to shop for some odds & ends for the Ren Faire costume. I was actually able to find everything I needed. Well, except for a *whole* bolt of muslin, which is why I only bought a half (about 12 yds). But I still used a coupon on it and the cutting counter lady told me to come on a Friday morning the next time I want a whole bolt.On top is the first brocade I showed you already. The second brocade should be in transit. The others from left to right are:  (1) bridal illusion to stuff and tack into the breeches lining so they keep their puffy shape; (2) a half bolt of muslin; (3) red lining for the hat; (4) the main hat fabric which is a red suede-ish crushed velvet-ish synthetic; (4) crinkled gold poly silkie stuff for the doublet lining; (5) a new black cotton sateen flat sheet I remembered I had shoved in the linen close, which we'll never use on a bed but I will use for the breeches middle layer and lining; and (7) a white cotton/linen blend for the shirt.I also have some gold trim and interfacing on the way, and I think with that and the expected second brocade, I'm set.After coming home from J's, I cut out Michael's shirt muslin to clear off my cutting table, and set it aside (until Feb 1, Peter, I promise!). The shirt muslin, not the table. ;-) Then I cut and pressed the Simplicity doublet, hat and shirt pattern pieces, and then cut the Indie breeches pattern. I thought I would have to trace the breeches pattern but it turns out that only one size is printed and if you need larger sizes or longer leg lengths, you slash and spread the main pattern. We need the printed size, so lucky for me.After that, it was off to the local chinese buffet for dinner. They have an overwhelming and very tasty selection, plus all-you-can-eat steamed crab legs on the weekends. DS#2 likes crab legs and I love all seafood. It was yummy and DS#2 and I put a major hurtin' on some crab legs! DH isn't a seafood eater, but there's PLENTY of other choices to make him happy too. Here are two crappy cell phone pics. I realized after I took these that the lens window on the phone needed a wiping. Oops. Consider the haze a \"mood effect.\"After recovering from that, I went back to the sewing room and cut out muslins for the doublet and breeches. I'm all set to sew them together this morning. Reko and I have tentatively planned for him to come over to try on the muslins Monday evening, so I need to get cracking."},

To change that up I've gathered some pics of what's sitting around and nearby the sewing room.Costume supplies have been arriving daily. First up, one of the fabrics and some buttons. I ordered 20 brass-ish (\"ish\" because they're poly) and the Ebay seller sent them in a cute little drawstring bag that looks like it could be part of the final costume somehow. The fabric looks orange in this pic, but it's really a brilliant red and exactly what I was expecting. It ravels when you just look at it, though. Figures that I just vacuumed the floor. One more Ebay fabric to arrive, some black something locally (maybe?) and I'm thinking a white cotton sheet for the shirt, unless JoAnn's has something decent. Hahahaha. Yeah, right. I'll probably end up buying one black and one white sheet from Bed Bath & Beyond.Next, all the patterns are here. I've been reading through the instructions at night, and I think it's going to go well. There will be some fiddly-ness but nothing seems especially difficult or outside my skill level. (I hope I don't have to eat those words later!) Muslins will be cut and sewn over the weekend and my \"customer\" will try them on early next week. February 26 will be here before I know it!In MPB Men's Shirt Sew-Along news, I stole one of my husband's old dress shirts. I don't know why the buttons are showing up as green since they're white. I'm going to unstitch parts of it, just to have a look. My husband has given his OK, in case you were wondering.I've also laid out the pattern for a muslin and will cut it hopefully later today. Yes, the fabric is a hideous bright yellow. This will be a real muslin, sans the actual muslin fabric. I.e., quick and ugly. Michael, you might want to dig out some sunglasses for this one.The real fabric is slung over the upstairs banister still waiting for its prewash. We had a (another!) well leak last weekend, which threw a wrench into the laundry plans. But it's fixed and the fabric will go into the machine tomorrow morning.I don't usually juggle multiple sewing projects so this should be interesting. (Cue maniacal laugh.)"},

I also increased portions since I'm cooking for increased servings. The main reasons for this post, however, are because (1) it's yummy and yummy should be shared, and (2) I thought Michael would like to see that his new blog is actually making a menu impact.We had steak fajitas the night before so I had leftover meat. I shredded it up a la food processor and added the meat layer over the pasta. Michael used cottage cheese. I used ricotta.Michael finely grated his Asiago cheese. I couldn't find that insert for my grater so we got shreds.Dinner is served!"},
{"title": "Comparing Men's Shirt Patterns", "date": "Tuesday, January 25, 2011", "text": "I hope this doesn't make your eyes glaze over, but I thought it would be interesting to compare a new-ish men's shirt pattern with a 1980s 1979 men's shirt pattern.Specifically, KS 3244:And McCall's 6890:This is Michael wearing McCall's 6890. Great fit.Michael wearing Kwik Sew 3244. Much more ease, and too much length between shoulder and upper chest. Look at the fabric bunching up in his armpits.Both pattern sizes used were for the same body measurements. In the comparison pics below, the KS is in white tracing paper, the McCall's is tan tissue.The front piece. The KS has a cut-on button placket so ignore that section with the Xs. The pieces were lined up at center front. The KS has more length above the armhole, which you can see on Michael above. There is also significantly less sideseam shaping and the McCall's armhole is cut higher and a little more toward the torso. The KS shoulder is more sloping. Both patterns are about the same length from the armhole downward. (The green KS Michael is wearing is not hemmed .)The KS neck is too big. Nice collar points, though, right? ;-)The length difference is confirmed in the pattern pieces. The McCall's pattern has 5/8\" seam allowances for the collar and stand pieces and the KS has 1/4\" seam allowances, so the difference is actually a little more than it appears in the pics.Michael in the McCall's, rear view. Lovely.Not lovely. Way too much ease. Way. Too. Much.The KS yoke is longer. The width is nearly the same. Note that the neck opening is also the same. The extra length on the KS neck is all in the front piece.The McCall's has a back pleat under the yoke. I've aligned the two pieces at the actual center back. The KS is wider from mid-armhole downward. The back armholes are actually closer in length than they appear here, after accounting for the difference in the yoke length. Note the waist dart option on the McCall's.The KS sleeve is too short. I'm pretty sure Michael doesn't have gorilla arms, so that's just odd drafting IMO.The KS cuff is shorter, but not as much as it appears here because of different seam allowances.The sleeve pattern has significant differences. First, the KS sleeve cap is much flatter, resulting in those folds down Michael's arm. The overall sleeve is wider at the bicep area and a few inches below. This is too much fabric on Michael. The McCall's has the elbow dart built in (green arrow), something we don't see very often in contemporary men's or women's patterns. The McCall's sleeve fits Michael much better and is just a nicer hanging sleeve overall. It's interesting to me that the more shapely sleeve fits \"longer\" on Michael too, even though there really isn't that much length difference between the two at first glance.Parting Shot: This is where Dani was during the pattern comparison photo session. She was sound asleep until I came into the room with a camera. She's made herself a little nest from the comforter scrap we keep on top of the bed for the dogs.As you can see, the bed is still unmade. She'll jump off and stand by as it gets made, and then hops right back up when I'm done. Ahh. The life of a princess."},

Reko asked if I can sew his costume. I told him he can't afford me (haha!), but that I would sew for free if he buys all the supplies. He has a $200 budget. For me, it will be a fun challenge. The Festival starts February 26. With this and the MPB Men's Shirt Sew-Along, February is shaping up to be a busy sewing month!Reko and Pvt Cook (at Parris Island):Reko sent two photos for the general idea of what he's looking for. His character is a Spanish ambassador, nobility with some money, so no peasant clothes for him. He requested red and gold.First, the doublet. This is the general shape, and Reko wants the long sleeves. (I've since learned that most sleeves on doublets are detachable — interesting!)And the pants, \"paned slops\" in RenFaireSpeak. I'm learning a whole new sewing and fashion vocabulary.After a day spent Googling and Ebaying, patterns are on their way to me as I type.This one is expensive ($21), but comprehensive. I've decided I'm paying for it since I want to keep it when we're done.This Simplicity, which I just missed the Joann's sale for, so I went to Ebay. I think I'll use this for the doublet, unless the one above is simpler than I'm anticipating (but I don't think it will be).And finally, this one for the slops because I like overkill. ;-)Back of pattern:Next up was fabric. I looked at my usual online sources without success. Back to Ebay, for this:And this:I'm going with two fabrics because the first one above is too expensive to use for everything, and, well, I was really getting into the \"designing\" aspect. This is the basic premise, but ours will have long sleeves for the doublet and I think we'll be leaving off the codpiece. ;-) I'm not sure about the white shirt underneath. Reko is going to look for one to buy, but I may end up making that too. We'll see. It's not hard, but time may be the biggest factor.* * * * *In MPB Sew-Along news, I received the pattern I'll be using (McCall's 6890) and have checked to see if all the pieces are there. They are. I've pressed them and while I'm waiting for the RenFaire supplies to arrive, I'll be comparing the vintage McCall's to the contemporary Kwik Sew pattern I used for Michael's way-too-big-muslin and sharing the results here. I'll also be sewing a down and dirty muslin because even though Peter has already made this pattern for Michael, ya never know, ya know? Better to be safe than sorry.Now I've got to call the repairman because my convection wall oven blew up yesterday. As in really blew up. It made a loud noise, turned bright yellow/orange inside the oven, and went dead in a big poof of smoke. Thankfully, it's still under warranty and I have a non-convection oven below it. But what a pain. Especially since nearly simultaneously, the well sprung yet another leak and it took DH hours to fix it. Not having a shower scrapped my grocery store outing, but today is another day. It was not a boring weekend."},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 3764 - Finished", "date": "Saturday, January 22, 2011", "text": "Here's the inspiration again, for comparison.Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. If I were to do it again, I'd change the \"lapels\" because with my winging it by eye and not testing it before cutting the real fabric, they came out wider and more downward pointing than I wanted. But that's only when comparing it side-by-side to the inspiration. I've looked at photos of other \"biker\" jackets and saw both types.Here's the back:I added the yoke to the pattern and topstitched along each side of the lower center back seam. I have no idea what the inspiration jacket looks like from the back.Close-up:I did end up with a button and buttonhole on the inside to hold the underflap in place. The sweatshirt fleece is just too heavy to support itself without this. I used the flattest button I could find in my button box, positioned it below the curve of my bust, and it doesn't show from the outside at all. I'm very happy with this solution.You can sort of see the bottom hemming in the pic above. I forgot to take pics, but I cut the facings without hem allowance and just folded the hem up once over the facings and caught the facing bottoms in the coverstitched hem. It's not the most beautiful from the inside, but with this fabric, I needed to avoid bulk wherever and whenever possible.As I mentioned in an earlier post, the pocket flaps are fake and I used sideseam pockets instead. You can see them as the bright green patches above. They're caught in the hem to keep them in place and also hand-tacked in a couple of strategic spots. I'm very glad I went with the sideseam pockets with this fabric, because the front of the jacket is already quite thick with four layers of sweatshirt fleece after it's all zipped closed. This is a *very* warm jacket. The sideseam pockets don't show at all, until I put my hands in them. Here's a pic that shows the pocket opening with me pulling it open.Kudos to those people who arrange clothing for catalog and other photo shoots. It's really hard to get everything smooth and symmetrical. What did they ever do before Photoshop? ;-)Today I'm going to dust and vacuum the sewing room, pre-wash the Men's Shirt Sew-Along fabric, and check that the vintage pattern from Etsy is actually all there.

But I did pick it back up tonight and have made a lot of progress. I'd say I am almost done, except I need to deal with some fiddly bits and that will make me procrastinate. (Is it worse when you know ahead of time that you're going to procrastinate and you do it anyway? Maybe I'll surprise myself.)I stole pockets from a Vogue jacket pattern I have and shortened them a little so they wouldn't hang into the hem area. This is one side before being sewn together at the sideseam. You can see the facing on the back pocket bag, which means virtually any fabric can be used for the rest of the pocket and it won't show. Perfect. I used a green jersey from the stash.I forgot I was adding the epaulets until I had sewn the first sleeve in. Oops. At least I hadn't serged the seam allowances. A little voice was nagging at me to try it on first and I'm glad I listened. I'm not going to add any butttons or snaps or anything, the layers on the shoulder are plenty thick now and I don't need something else up there. I even broke a needle tacking one of the epaulets down.I sewed in the sleeves and closed the sideseams. Here's a peek.I need to decide how I'm going to secure the front facings and whatever you call the underlayer of a double-breasted front. But this jacket is as warm as a heavy winter coat to me and it's just too hot to keep putting it on and off to get everything aligned correctly. It's supposed to cool down here again tomorrow so I'm hoping to get back at it tomorrow night or Saturday morning.Then all I'll have left is the hems. I'm a little tired of this jacket right now because I'm not thrilled with the fit in the armholes. But it's a casual sweatshirt jacket and I'll get over it as soon as I've been away from it for a few days. Before I can do that, I have to finish it. ;-)"},

Then again, since I don't think I'll be eating anything today, who cares! lolThe dogs received these delightful little guys. Judging by how crazy their noses went as I unwrapped them, they taste very good. I think they're OK for humans too going by the ingredients list, but the pack would never have forgiven me for that.

I hope to finish it tonight, except I have to solve two problems first.First, the flaps are faux — and good thing because they need to be tacked down before I take flight — but I do want pockets. So I'm thinking plain ol' sideseam pockets. I need to decide what to make them out of. The fleece is going to be too thick, so maybe 1/2 fleece and 1/2 jersey. Or something like that.The other potential problem is I think I may need an inside closure for this, since it is a double-breasted jacket. A button or hook on the inside flap is going to land exactly at the wrong spot and will show. Right now, this is only a potential problem until I try on the finished jacket and see if I really do need to secure that flap. Then I'll worry about it for real.All the *thinking* when you change or draft a pattern really slows down the sewing process. Mostly I like it, but sometimes it makes me crazy.Gail asked if I was doing the shoulder treatment from the inspiration. This should answer that question Gail. ;-) It's a little Mad Max since there are a lot of layers, but I think it will be OK.In MPB Sew-Along news, my fabric(s) arrived today. On top is the aqua/brown check that Michael picked out. Under that is something I picked. ;-) They'll get prewashed this week."},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 3764 - Zipping Along", "date": "Sunday, January 16, 2011", "text": "If you look at the inspiration jacket carefully, you'll see there are some differences between it:and the pattern:Mainly, the inspiration does not have the slanted seams in the front and the zipper is inserted into a separate seam which is not drafted into the KS pattern, and the inspiration has pockets/flaps inserted into the princess seams.This meant some time at the drafting table for me. Here are my resulting pattern pieces:The horizontal length adjustment tuck I mentioned last post is visible on the piece on your left. I straightened the diagonal front seam, and also added some hip/tummy room from the waist downward at the princess seam. Straightening that diagonal seam by just drawing straight downward works for me because the pattern is actually too small at the hip and this solves both problems at once. Or at least I hope so, since I pretty much just winged it by putting on the muslin, drawing on it to get a general idea of what goes where,  and then eyeballing that onto the pattern pieces.After that was done, I traced the main piece and split it apart for the zipper insertion. These are the two pattern pieces you see on the right in the pic above.I also made a pocket flap piece, shown on the left. I'll insert it into the seam about where you see it on my (very messy) floor in the pic. I haven't decided yet if I'm going to make working pockets or just have a faux flap. If I do go with working pockets, I'm not going to create a separate pocket bag and instead will have a *really* big pocket bag since it will actually be all of the facing yet to be attached. I do not want another layer of sweatshirt fleece here to add more bulk than I provide myself. ;-)Here's the zipper inserted into the new seam I created:My zipper was an inch too long, because I decided to add an extra inch and a half to the length of the pattern. That meant wrestling with the metal teeth. There's a tool to do this, but I don't have one. I used needle nose pliers and a flathead screwdriver, and lots of struggling.But I eventually persevered and even managed to re-use the zipper stops so it doesn't look Becky Home-Ecky.I know I won't finish this today, but I should be able to make some good progress. I'm off tomorrow and hopefully I can finish it then. Our weather is staying cool this week so maybe I can even wear it.Go Jets!"},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 3764 - First Look", "date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "text": "Not too bad for the muslin. And this time, I made a *real* muslin. I.e., ugly old bed sheet.One of the things I wanted to test was where the collar landed on me. But it's fine. On the pattern envelope, it seemed to end a little too high up on the models. Unfortunately, I did a great job of covering up the collar when taking the pic, so you'll have to take my word for it.I added my usual square shoulder alteration as I was tracing the pattern. Other alterations will be to raise the armhole and tuck out shoulder-to-waist length. Both can be done at the same time. Then I'll adjust the sleeve to match. I knew I'd have to do this, which is why I waited to do a sleeve muslin. I'll muslin it after the adjustments.The back isn't too bad either, but I will have to add some additional booty room for my generous backside. Because I'm twisting and holding my arm funny, it looks like more room is needed than in actuality. I drew the approximate amount I'll be adding. I will spread the pattern instead of adding at the CB seam since the high hip is where I really need the extra.I'm also going to add a back yoke just because I think it will look better in the finished casual jacket. I'll incorporate the shoulder-to-waist length tuck when I do that.For a refresher, this is the pattern envelope again:* * * * *In MPB Men's Shirt Sew-Along News: My fabric delivery was delayed until Monday. I'm guessing due to the weather. The Etsy seller let me know this morning that she was mailing the pattern today. It looks like I'm still on track for a February 1 start. * * * * * Back to the football games, and the jacket. Go Steelers! Go Jets!"},
{"title": "The Wheel Has Already Been Invented", "date": "Friday, January 14, 2011", "text": "Today's post features nothing but stolen borrowed photos from around the interwebs. But that conveniently ties in with my theme today: Don't Reinvent The Wheel, so I'm going with it.First up, Michael's \"muslin\" arrived in NYC yesterday and he and Peter were kind enough to quickly take some pics so we could all evaluate the fit.From the front, not 100% great but not too bad. Cute doggie tail though.From the back, HUGE! (Yes, Michael, this shirt *does* make your butt look big. Gasp! I didn't say that out loud, did I?)Compare with the Liberty shirt Peter made for him last year (and Michael's much cuter little tush):Peter tells me he made NO alterations to this pattern. Quite a difference in fit right out of the envelope from one to the next, wouldn't you agree?To refresh memories, the green muslin is KS 3244, here:I used the size which corresponds to Michael's measurements. Unfortunately, it's the smallest size in the envelope but still too big on him.  I was afraid of this while making it,  because Kwik Sew does run big in the men's line. But since it was  already here and on-hand, I opted to give it a try. Nothing ventured,  nothing gained, right? And I did have a fun weekend in the sewing room  with the return of my mojo because of this project.To go smaller with KS 3422, I'd have to bring out the rulers, cutters and tape.  While technically I *could* alter/grade it down, the better option would be to begin with a pattern that fits better from the start and spend my time on perfect collars and sleeve plackets.A quick Ebay search last night for a copy of vintage McCall's 6890 turned up nada. But Etsy came to the rescue, and in exactly the correct size and for only $2.50. I think my altering time is worth at least $2.50, plus $1.00 shipping. Without hesitation, I bought it. This is Peter's copy of the pattern. Mine should be the same and will hopefully arrive by Feb 1, in time to officially start the Sew-Along.Meanwhile, my sewingpatterns.com order finally arrived from the slow boat to China. Sheesh. I ordered — and paid — for these December 20.First up will be knocking off this jacket, hopefully making substantial progress this long weekend. (And the gods laugh hysterically.)Pattern, Kwik Sew 3764:Somewhere in the immediate queue will be Kwik Sew 3823, to knock off Knip Mode 2008-08 and Lillian's lovely interpretation of it here:This will take a little fudging because on the Knip Mode pattern and Lillian's version, the tie hangs freely. On the KS version, the tie is sewn into the center front seam. I prefer the former. It won't be too hard to alter the pattern for that, and much easier than me trying to source that issue of Knip Mode before our fleeting winter temps fleet back out. Because it's a KS, I probably will have to alter for fit too. Look at how low those armholes are in the pattern pic.* * * * *Thanks and photo acknowledgement to Peter, Michael, Lillian, and Kwik Sew."},
{"title": "Banana Bread/Cake Care Package", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "Instead of vegging in front of the TV last night, I baked. I don't know why, but my baking urges always seem to strike at night. I've been known to bake apple pies from scratch at 2 AM. Weird, I know.Anyway … my younger son came home from a friend's house one day last month and just RAVED about her mom's banana bread. Hmm. I always thought *mine* was pretty good. LOL! He ended up getting the recipe from her to bring back to me. I figured he must be impressed if he did that, so I said I'd make it for him.The first time I made it was right before Christmas and we brought it on our trip to visit the Marine. Unfortunately, said Marine was too sick to really want any and we ended up bringing a lot of it home (where it then disappeared quickly).Younger son was asking for it again so I decided to make some for him, and for the Marine so he could actually eat it this time. I also baked and sent a bunch of the big chocolate chunk cookies you see in the photo. The care package of goodies makes me feel still useful as a mom. lolNow, with that build-up, you'd think I would be raving about this recipe too. I'm not. It's OK and tastes fine; it's just a bit too sweet for me. But that explains why DS#2 loves it. He's a sugar fiend. ;-) The Marine will eat any baked sweets so it's good for him too.I did add chopped walnuts this time, a must for banana bread IMO but which is not in the original recipe, and that improved it to my taste — a very little bite since I'm still trying to consciously eat healthier these days and this bread/cake is decidedly NOT low-calorie. However, I do like how all that sugar gives the bread/cake a slightly crispy crust. You can see how much DS#2 likes this, by how much is already gone from the cut loaf.If you have a very sweet tooth or know someone who does, here's the recipe:Grandma Harris' Sour Cream Banana Bread1/2 Cup butter, room temp2-1/2 Cups sugar  (I know, right)4 eggs1 Cup smooshed ripe banana1 Cup sour cream (I did use low-fat sour cream this 2nd time cuz that's what we had)2-1/2 Cups flour1 tsp baking soda1 tsp baking powder1 tsp vanillaOptional: 1 cup finely chopped walnutsPreheat oven to 325. (The recipe calls for 325, but I really used 350 since 325 seems too low to me.)Combine dry ingredients and set aside. Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well. Add banana. Slowly add dry ingredients and mix well. Add vanilla and sour cream (and the nuts, if you're using them).Pour into a greased and floured 10\" bundt pan. Bake 50-60 minutes, or until cake tester/toothpick comes out clean.I made this the first time using the bundt pan but because I wanted two separate loaves so I could send the Marine one, I used two large loaf pans last night. The cooking time was about the same. I just set the timer for 40 minutes and tested. The loaves needed an extra 10 minutes, for a total of 50.* * * * *It was fun baking and texting with the Marine at the same time last night. I sent him pics of the goodies in progress and he's ready and waiting for them. They'll arrive tomorrow. The chow hall has good food, he says, but he's missing the homemade stuff from me. Awwwww."},
{"title": "Clap On, Clap Off", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2011", "text": "(Or, When Peter Found My Round Tuit)On Monday, Peter posted \"The 14 Shirtmaking Tools You Won't Want To Live Without!\" Ten minutes later, I had already bought and paid for one of them via Ebay. Today, it arrived. (Take note of the fast shipping, SewingPatterns.com. Hmprf.)What did I buy? A Clapper. Well, more precisely, a Point Presser/Clapper.I've wanted one of these for a while (anyone watch Family Guy and know the \"a WHHHile\" line? Cool WHHHip? Anyone?? No?? OK, then nevermind), but it's been on the back burner because I don't remember I want it until I need it. Kind of like those extra pattern weights I mentioned the other day. Getting old and losing brain power sucks, but Peter's reminder was finally the needed impetus.I have had its cousin for a long time, but I've never been really and truly happy with it. It's OK, but it has shortcomings. Jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none.The smaller cousin is meant for pressing curves as well as points and the curvy end of this flat point side gets in the way more than it helps. When I'm pressing a long pointed seam open, I don't want that darn valley there but the flat length is too short to easily avoid it.It's often not quite long enough and it's sometimes fiddly to get a seam flat on the edge. See the difference in length and width between the two? It came with printed instructions on it, blue ink. Well, I had to sand that off in a hurry because the blue transferred onto the item I was pressing one day. THAT was a surprise I didn't need, thankyouverymuch.And, I went all out and bought this nifty padded cover with it and I HAVE NEVER USED IT. OK, that's not really a shortcoming for the board per se, but it still irks me. I had to dig it out and dust it off for this photo. ;-) I don't use it because you can't get a flat surface with it on. It doesn't fit the board tight (enough even though I've steam-shrinked the crap out of it). Which means it shifts when I'm pressing and it's just not worth the PITA factor.Plus, I've never had a real clapper. I have a hardwood seam roll stick thingie (flat on one side) that I've been using as a substitute, but this actual clapper is just a little bit heavier and less cumbersome, and should work even better. It's funny how a block of wood can make a girl so happy, but it does. I can't wait to try it out for real.In other shopping news, these ITY knits arrived yesterday and the order with Michael's fabric and my jacket pattern is due on Friday. It's looking good for some activity in the sewing room this weekend."},

My husband stayed behind for work and to take care of the dogs. Apparently, he was feeling silly on Christmas Eve and the poor pups were the victims. The photo above is what I received on my cell phone late 12/24. It also had an audio file attached with my husband doing his impersonation (which he does non-stop every Christmas) of the Santa in A Christmas Story: \"Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!\"Yes, I know Christmas is over, but this photo was too cute not to share. I hope you agree. The Marine is doing much better now that he's in from the cold. Loving his new \"pad\" (barracks) in Pensacola and making some friends. He has a \"96\" (96 hours of liberty) this coming holiday weekend and will have his first taste of off-base freedom. He's not coming home, and I think he's actually looking forward to being with the guys and not obligated to Mom. Hah! How dare him. LOL!I hope this video will work (hey, it does!). It's a small, short cell phone video of his current digs. Nothing fancy here. ;-) But much better than boot camp and combat training!"},
{"title": "One Muslin To Go — Hold the Buttons", "date": "Sunday, January 9, 2011", "text": "Michael's muslin is done and will be on its way to NYC tomorrow. It's probably the most finished fit muslin I've ever done, everything except buttons, but I needed the practice. It's also a weird fabric that looks *better* in the photos than in real life. How often does that happen? IRL, all the seams are puckered and nothing presses flat (definitely a poly blend). You can sort of see what I mean in the collar pic below.I thought I was going to have the most trouble with the collar and stand, but it went pretty well. Probably because the gods know this is a tester. I'll probably screw up on the real one and have to re-do it ten times. Isn't that always the way?I did channel my inner Peter when stitching the stand on though, which is always the part that could be better on every other shirt I've made. Maybe that's why it came out pretty good?This time, instead of using my edge stitching foot and having to stop to remove pins because it doesn't flow smoothly over them, I thought about what Peter probably does with his vintage machines and feet. In other words, I used my flat-bottom straight stitching foot and one of its toes for a guide, and sewed right over the pins. I'm interested to see Peter's future blog post on this and his other techniques. That's one problem with sewing before the \"Along\" part officially starts. One is kind of on her own, sucking wind. :-)Here's the finished placket. Well, finished except for buttonhole and button. I did finally find the Nancy Zieman technique I knew was floating around here somewhere. It's in her Sewing Express book. NZ's technique is essentially the same as Summerset's tutorial. The only difference is the slit opening is cut differently and you can sew all the way across the top of the placket area when attaching the fabric strip. I think I'll try this on some scraps while I'm waiting for Michael to try on his shirt, and for the fabric to arrive.The cuff looks pretty good in this pic, but that's only because you can't see the inside. On the muslin, one is better than the other because I used two different techniques. I think I have a handle on them now and the cuffs on the real shirt should be fine. Don't panic Michael. Remember, this is a techniques muslin for me as well as a fit muslin for you.Finally, I even made and attached the pocket. I think my OCD is showing. ;-)It was GREAT to be back in the sewing room! Thank you Michael and Peter for kick-starting the mojo."},
{"title": "Men's Shirt Sew-Along Progress", "date": "Saturday, January 8, 2011", "text": "Lookee, lookee — actual current photos from my sewing room!I started out my sewing day by tracing the pattern.Then cutting out the \"muslin.\" I'm using a green oxford fabric (a blend I think, judging by the seam puckers I'm seeing) instead of actual muslin. I've had this stuff forEVER, paid very little for it, and it's just time it moved out of the stash.I really need some more pattern weights and I might actually remember to pick up some big washers at Lowe's or Home Depot one day. Until then, I pull out my scissors basket and use those. This pattern fits on less than 2 yds of this fabric. I still have enough for another one. Why is it that some fabrics just won't go away?I don't usually make detailed muslins but I haven't ever sewn a men's long-sleeved dress shirt so I decided that I would use this one to learn and practice techniques. Specifically, sleeve plackets. These are my first set of sleeves for the day (yes, first). The fabric is the same front and back so I used my usual cheater method of marking the wrong sides with tape.And then I faithfully followed Kwik Sew's directions in the pattern. Bad decision. And surprising, since KS patterns usually have good methods. This is not a real under placket. It's a crappy cheater method, and it looks it.The top placket isn't much better.Before I continued, I scrapped these and went looking for a better, more attractive method. I pulled out David Coffin's shirt book and immediately was reacquainted with the reasons it collects dust on my bookshelf. There is a lot of good information in the book, but it's not something you would have by your project as a reference while sewing. It's a more in-depth read than that and it's put together in a weird order to me. The video is much better, but I don't have a VCR anymore so my copy is pretty much trash now.I knew there was a relatively easy continuous placket method out there somewhere. I thought I had seen it in one of Nancy Zieman's books, but maybe not because I couldn't easily put my hands on it. Enter Google.Lucky for me, Summerset's Pin & Needles blog was one of the first Google hits and her tutorial is perfect! I had new sleeves and plackets cut and sewn within an hour.Isn't this better?And the under placket (is there a better term?) looks a thousand times better.After the plackets were done, I sewed the cuff pieces together, took pics and stopped for the day. I'm hoping to finish the muslin tomorrow, if the collar and stand don't give me fits. It's been a while since I've done one and I'm out of practice.Who else is joining Peter's Sew-Along?"},
{"title": "Plan B … er … MPB", "date": "Friday, January 7, 2011", "text": "I have given up waiting on my patterns to arrive from sewingpatterns.com and have ordered a replacement jacket pattern from Fabric.com. But other than that jacket, I still don't really feel like sewing for me.Meanwhile, Peter over at Male Pattern Boldness, has announced a Men's Shirt Sew-Along, to begin February 1. While I do have my own men to sew for, none of them really needs or wants a classic shirt at the moment. I thought I'd just be watching the Sew-Along from the sidelines.But then the gears began to sputter in my brain and I came up with the idea to secretly sew a shirt for Peter's partner Michael (say that 3x fast!).I ask you, who is more deserving of receiving something from this Sew-Along than poor, poor Michael, who has been waiting (and waiting) since August of last year for the suit Peter promised him?And who is mentioned prominently at the top of Peter's blog as someone for whom Peter sews (but doesn't really)? We won't mention the reluctant mother comment. Oh.And who is it that puts up with 12, or 6, or 20 vintage sewing machines strewn all about a NYC apartment (not to mention old phones and bicycles), and then is put to work lifting the old boat anchors when Peter's \"back is out?\" (You know, maybe if Peter wasn't always tripping over his cousin Cathy's high heels, his back would be \"in\" more often. I'm just sayin'.)So, yes, a shirt for Michael! It's a good idea, isn't it?But what isn't a good idea is to sew it secretly, a/k/a blindly. Things like measurements and color choices might be an obstacle that still would land Michael a new shirt, but likely one he either couldn't or wouldn't wear. So, the cat shirt is out of the bag and Michael is in on the project. He's given me his fabric preferences, one or two of which just might be on their way to me as I type, and Peter has filled me in on a few basic measurements.So this weekend there WILL be actual sewing going on, as I'll be making a muslin for Michael's new shirt. I'll be using Kwik Sew 3422, because I already own it.While you're waiting for the next update here, go give Michael some (more) love over at his new bloggy home, Pleasing My Palate. I think he could write about emptying pencil sharpeners instead of food and the preparation thereof and I would still read it. OK, same goes for Peter too. I love them both."},

I've been waiting for my patterns to show up, and I must say that I am decidedly NOT impressed with sewingpatterns.com. I will never order from there again. Yes, that's harsh, but there are other options available to me that don't immediately take my money and then delay on the product. And yes, I could start a different project, but I've got that jacket in my head and nothing else is calling to me, so I wait.Moving right along …I don't make actual New Year's resolutions, so this isn't really that except that it happened to coincide with the time of year. Anyway, I'm sort of back on Weight Watchers. Being down in the dumps about missing my son has had me seeking out comfort food even more than usual and, well, it's got to stop!I say \"sorta back on\" because I'm not officially all the way back on the WW plan yet only because I need to buy a new scale this weekend to have a starting point (ugh, I dread the number I will see when I do). After that purchase, I will pay the fee to join WW online so I have access to the plan's tools. Then I'll not be \"sorta\" and will be officially on the plan again. It's a good plan for me and it works with my life. Well, when I don't go running for the fast food and chocolate. Your mileage may vary.I wasn't going to post anything until I was actually sewing something, but Michael's new blog, Pleasing My Palate, inspired me. For those who read Peter's Male Pattern Boldness, you'll recognize Michael as his partner (and photographer extraordinaire). For those who don't read MPB, what are you waiting for? ;-)OK, so on to the food — Stuffed Cabbage Rolls.I've always liked the traditional version of this meal. I like cabbage. A lot. (I even love Brussels sprouts.) Must be my German half. The other half is Italian, in case you were wondering. All of my grandparents went through Ellis Island, so the eating gene had not been Americanized too much when I was growing up and we had lots of authentic yummy meals, if not exactly the healthiest. Mealtimes at my Italian grandparents' was an *event*. And if it was a holiday too? OMG. ;-)This version of Stuffed Cabbage Rolls keeps the flavor I like, but turns out a much healthier meal. And it's easy to make too.1 Savoy Cabbage1 Cup Brown Rice, cooked2 Teaspoons Olive Oil1/2 pound white mushrooms, sliced1 onion, finely chopped3/4 pound ground turkey breast1 large egg, lightly beatenSalt and pepper to taste3-4 cups of Marinara sauce (25 oz jar or your own)Preheat oven to 350.I didn't follow the recipe exactly because it calls for jarred sauce and fresh mushrooms, neither of which were on hand last night. Instead, I used canned mushrooms and then made up a quick red sauce using stewed tomatoes and tomato paste in cans, leftover green pepper bits, and traditional Italian herbs from the spice rack, which was cooked down a bit to reduce the liquid.1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.2. Carefully separate the cabbage leaves until you have 8-10 good size leaves with the \"thick\" part near the core removed. You really only need 8, but 10 is good for filling in any \"holes.\" Thinly slice the remaining cabbage.3. Using tongs, immerse the big leaves into the boiling water for about 30 seconds, until they are wilted. Set aside.4. Put the remaining cabbage slices into the boiling water and boil for about a minute. Drain and arrange in the bottom of a large baking pan.5. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add onions and mushrooms and cook until veggies are tender, about 8-10 minutes. Remove to a large bowl.6. To the vegetables, add the turkey, rice, egg, salt, and pepper and stir until well mixed. I used my hands. ;-)7. Divide the turkey mixture among the 8 cabbage leaves. Fold in the sides and roll up to enclose the stuffing.8. Place the cabbage rolls, seam-side down, on top of the sliced cabbage in the baking pan.9. Drizzle with the marinara/tomato sauce.10. Bake uncovered about 1-1/2 hours, or until the stuffing is cooked through.Per serving (2 rolls): 431 calories, 8 pts"},

Unfortunately, I won't be starting the jacket I showed last post because the pattern hasn't arrived yet. Grrrr. So I'll probably be doing something quilty, since I don't have anything else in the queue.In the meantime, I'll show off some Proud Marine Mom photos from our trip to Camp Geiger last weekend. Our trip was good and I'm very glad I went. This was certainly the most unusual Christmas I've ever had. Unfortunately, my Marine son was SICK AS A DOG when we got there. But he's only got 3 more days and he's done living out in the cold weather for a long while. He'll be on his way to Pensacola, Florida on Tuesday for his next round of training and we're hoping maybe we can catch another quick visit there before he moves on again. But at the very least, we'll be back to regular communication again as he'll have his cell phone back and will be able to call and email daily.Even sick, he's still a hambone.Part of the Rec Center, which has flat screens hooked up to gaming systems, pool tables, ping pong, foosball, and Wi Fi with laptops to share.We got to go with them through the chow hall on Christmas Day during breakfast, and were able to eat Christmas Dinner there later that day. Eating in  a chow hall surrounded by thousands of Marines in uniform makes for quite an unusual Christmas family dinner.  LOLFormation. This is all of Fox Company. DS#1 is near the red dot. From behind, we could only pick him out by the childhood scar on the back of his shaved head, since — black, white, male, female — they all look alike. They are standing in front of their barracks, although they didn't really spend much time there as they train and sleep out in the field most of the time.His favorite Christmas present:  A nap. DS#2 and I put in a DVD and just let him sleep.It was great to get to see him, of course, and to get a small glimpse into his new life. We fed him lots of OJ and Vitamin C drops, and he was kind enough to send me home with whatever crud he had which netted me a high fever and 3 days in bed. I'm feeling better now, and I hope he is too. We'll get a call on Monday, if not before. I can't wait."},

(Well, at least I hope you noticed — lol!) All I can say is I just haven't been in the mood. For anything. Hahaha!My Marine son's visit during his leave was wonderful. We spent a lot of time together and, of course, it went far too quickly. On December 7, he started combat training in North Carolina, where he's been sleeping nearly outside without heat. It's been in the 20s there at night. So, in other words, my Florida boy has been freezing his you-know-what off. ;-)There's very little communication while they're training, not even the snail mail letters like from boot camp. But they do have their cellphones and sometimes get to make a quick call as a reward or if given a little free time. I was thrilled to get a 5-minute call last Thursday. I was even more thrilled to learn that his group is being given on-base liberty for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day — a rarity for this stage of training. So, you know where I'll be heading on 12/23. Yep, an 11-hour drive to Camp Geiger, North Carolina. We got another, longer, call from him on Saturday and although he's still freezing, he's having a pretty good time shooting and blowing things up every day, just for fun … er, I mean, TRAINING. ;-)My younger son is going with me on the Road Trip. My husband is staying behind to care for the dogs. So I will actually have both sons for Christmas. This will probably be the last time for a few years, if not forever. They do grow up and leave the nest, and the military life ahead for my older son will be unpredictable at best. Excuse me while I grab my tissues. Again. ;-)I've spent all weekend making hundreds of Christmas cookies, which I'll be bagging up to take with me, and then handing out to Marines without family visiting them. That's helped to put me more in the Christmas spirit. Knowing I'll have both of my boys for the holiday has helped a lot too. ;-)The sewing mojo has been conspicuously absent, until today. I don't spend much time on Pattern Review anymore, but I happened to catch this thread this morning, where Vibek is looking for a pattern for this jacket she saw at Nordstrom's:A suggestion for Kwik Sew 3764 was given, and I'm going to shamelessly copy Vibek and Nordstrom's, when I get back from North Carolina. I've already ordered the pattern (and one more!) and I have the perfect fabric in the stash.This also ties into the Gigi/Carolyn inspired A Jacket a Month sew-along going on at Stitcher's Guild. I know I won't sew 12 jackets, but 4 or 5 would not hurt my wardrobe at all. Plus, I really liked having a head start on my winter wardrobe from all the sewing ahead of time I did for my trip to Parris Island. There's a lot to be said for planning ahead. Especially during a cold snap last week here in Florida.So, Vibek, if you're reading, thank you. I owe the return of the mojo to you. But I'm not going to hurry it — I still have lots to do before I leave on Thursday."},
{"title": "Home on Leave", "date": "Wednesday, December 1, 2010", "text": "We're home with our new Marine! Our trip was good, and Family Day and Graduation were fun. After the Private was dismissed, we drove up to my mom's in Virginia for Thanksgiving. We left Virginia Saturday and arrived back in Florida in the wee hours of Sunday morning. The Marine passed out in the car at 9 PM, being used to getting up at 0400 and to bed at 2100.I was *very* sick the week before we left and had a relapse in SC the day before Family Day, but I made it. I never did have any pie on Thanksgiving — that's how sick I was. lol But my son made up for me. I've never seen him eat SO much and SO fast. And he hasn't stopped yet.Apart from being an eating machine, he is exactly the same young man who left for Parris Island 3 months ago. Which is good. Many teenagers do change at boot camp, but Tyler is older and already had the Marine persona and values, so I wasn't really expecting major changes.He did great and says boot camp was easier than he thought it would be, even fun sometimes. He earned the highest rating of Expert on the rifle range (you can see his badge above), and excelled at all physical and written tests. We're very proud of him!I'll be scarce for the next week as I catch up with both my son and work. Being down for the count for two weeks has left me with a big pile. The sewing room will gather dust for a while longer.The Marine will be off again on December 7 for his combat training in North Carolina for a month, then he'll be off to his first school in Pensacola and somewhere else for the next school, the location of which he'll find out after he's through the first school. We won't be seeing much of him for the next few years, but at least he will have his cell phone and laptop back.I'll leave you with this photo taken at my mom's. He's not entirely pressed out or wearing his ribbon and badge, but we *had* to see him in his Dress Blues. ;-)"},

I don't think I'm going to make a new Sunshine Top unless I get a wild hair tomorrow, but I may toss an old one into the suitcase \"just in case.\" ;-)I ordered tees for the whole family from a great Mom & Pop internet store (MarinePride.com) and since they do their own screen printing, I was able to request that the design on mine be printed a few inches lower than normal to make it easier for me to lay my pattern on top and not have to worry about cutting off the design. I've usually had to fudge things a little when I've remade football tees in the past.Here's the Before:And the After: I think it came out perfect!I re-used the ribbing from the tee instead of binding the neckline. It was the perfect length for my new vee-ish neckline. Karma.This is the tee under the jacket. I'll be wearing this and the new jeans for Family Day on 11/23. Notice how the jacket collar and flaps match the color of the Drill Instructor cover (that's hat in civilian-speak) on the tee. Karma again.I also bought a little \"jewelry\" to wear on the jacket, and probably everything else I wear that week."},

It's actually been mostly done for a few days, but I had to make a trip to Joann's for more coverable buttons before I could finish it all the way. I lucked out — it was Buy 1 Get 1 Free on the Notions wall, where these buttons are in this store. I even remembered at the last minute I still needed a drawcord for my fleece jacket and got that too.There are pockets in two of the front princess seams. You can sorta see them if you look hard. Look for the bartacks. (These photos can also be enlarged if you click on them.)Back view:I was sweating it out on the last of the topstitching thread because I have no way to buy more of this exact brand/color since it was part of a free bunch of thread I received a few years ago when I complained to Maxilock about some defective serger cones. Yes, it really is this shade of green, but it looks neutral on the red.Luckily, I realized early on that it was going to be close and switched to a non-matching bobbin color on the seaming that's covered by the lining on the wrong side.One thing I was not so lucky about — forgetting to interface the hem when lining and jacket were still separate. There was no getting around it because the hem wanted to curl the tiniest little bit, so I had to bite the bullet and go back inside the jacket/lining so I could fuse some interfacing to the hem allowance. But it made all the difference and the hem is great now. Doing the right thing is usually the right thing. ;-)Tomorrow, I'll be working on re-making my Parris Island Family Day tee, and then I'll be done with the trip clothes, I think. But I still might cave and make myself a new Sunshine Top. How can I travel without any of those? ;-)Just about a week to go before we leave. All of a sudden, it seems like the time flew. Was it really almost 3 months ago that I was a blubbering fool? It almost seems like yesterday."},

I needed his brute strength to get the lug nuts and wheels off, and to break the initial grip of the bolts on the calipers. I'm sure I could've done it, but why strain when he was right there! He was amazed at how easy it was. Of course then I had to throw in an \"I told you so.\" ;-)We were done in an hour. I think we would've spent more  time shuttling the car to/from a repair shop. We definitely would've  spent a ton more money, and been \"advised\" to spend more. And we  wouldn't have had such a fun (yes, fun!)  mother-son bonding morning.Kidding aside, if you have a jack, stands, a socket wrench, a big C clamp (for pushing the caliper pistons back into the casing) and a teenaged boy/strong person for the grunt work, anyone can replace brake pads. Sheesh, brakes pads are a no-brainer compared to Burda WOF instructions! Only a few years ago I probably wouldn't have ever considered doing this job until I was sort of forced into being a brake assistant by my older son. At that point, I realized just how easy it is to replace the major brake parts and how ripped off you are at brake shops. Seriously ripped off. At the very least, inspect your calipers and rotors yourself from time to time before you go into a shop. You can see them without taking the wheel off. A little education could save you hundreds in repairs you don't actually need because those brake shops love to scare you into thinking you need the whole shebang when you don't. Still don't believe how easy it is? Check out this video.Side note: That little green chair in the photo? Playskool circa 1983. Best money ever spent. We bought a new table and 2 chairs set when the boys were little, which was used all the time back then and we're still using the chairs for odd things like this. It's amazing how useful a tiny chair can be."},
{"title": "Kwik Sew 3369: Progress Report", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2010", "text": "This was just thrown onto Zillie for the pic so it's looking kind of messy and frumpy at the  moment. I had hoped to be finished this weekend, but other errands and chores conspired against me. I don't have too much more to do, though. The 2-piece sleeves are joined and topstitched but still laying on the cutting table. The lining and collar are done too. I just need to attach them all and do the buttons/buttonholes. The jacket sleeves are the red print. What you're seeing above is the lining.For the pocket flaps and collar, I used this faux seude. I'm going to cover buttons in 2 sizes with the faux seude, for the flaps and front closure. I think. It might be too much going down the front of the jacket so I reserve the right to change my mind on that. Plan B will be to cover the front buttons with the print.I ended up using two different threads for topstitching. On the jacket itself, I'm using a light green, which reads neutral on the print but is light enough that the topstitching actually shows. But that thread actually reads as green on the faux seude. So, for the flaps and collar, I used a medium gray. Both are upholstery threads.With all this topstitching, I have to again sing the praises of having a separate mechanical machine set up as a topstitching station. This will be the first jacket I've topstitched since acquiring my vintage Vikings. What makes me extra happy is because topstitching shows on both sides at once on a jacket (where the lapel flips over), for once I don't have to worry about what the underside will look like since I can use the upholstery thread in the bobbin too. (Whew, that was a bad sentence!) I think I'm as happy with the old Vikings as I am with my coverstitch machine. And, trust me, that's saying a lot!We leave for Parris Island in less than 2 weeks, so it's time to step it up! Our Family Day tees arrived on Saturday, which means after the jacket, I'll be re-making mine into a female shaped tee. Two weeks, people! Two weeks, until I see my son again. Wooooo!!But before I pick up on either of those projects, I'll be replacing the brake pads on my car today with Son #2. Son #1 is usually my mechanic for maintenance jobs like this, but he's otherwise occupied at boot camp. However, all his tools are still in the garage, and I've done brakes before with him. They aren't hard, just dirty. New brake pads cost $20 and about 1-2 hours. Replacement at a chain shop is at least $100 before tax and hidden fees. You do the math. I'd rather take my savings on our trip. I just hope I'm not eating my words tomorrow and I'm glad I haven't had my manicure yet. ;-)"},
{"title": "Whew!", "date": "Friday, November 5, 2010", "text": "I expected to have a progress post this past Monday after a weekend of sewing my red denim jacket. As you know by now, that didn't happen. Instead, my employer went off and decided to merge with another company last week and I ended up working about 35 hours in lieu of sewing. But it's finally calming down a bit and so I started working on the jacket tonight.Here's a refresher:I've cut out all the denim pieces. Tomorrow, I'll cut out the lining. And then, fingers crossed, I'll be able to sew it up over the weekend. I swear, I'm not going to check my email lest work try to sneak into my plans. I already have something like 546 messages in my Inbox already. No lie.During a work break over the weekend, I caved and ordered some RTW jeans which arrived today. I shouldn't have bothered. They are HUGE, and I can't believe I was actually contemplating altering them, for a minute. I also ordered some shoes and was sent the wrong size. So that order was a bust all around. Sigh. Everything will be packed up and returned tomorrow. I'm debating whether to go down 3 sizes in the jeans and try again. Yes, they are that big. Thank you vanity sizing. I ordered by measurements and not size number and they were still off that much. Pffft. Can you tell I'm PO'd? I don't have time for this!Speaking of time, it's down to 18 days now until I see my son in South Carolina. I won't say the time has flown because it mostly hasn't. But it did start picking up once we were past the halfway point and I did finally stop crying at the drop of a hat. LOLAnd here's something from the Really Odd Coincidences Department. My best friend from high school and I keep in touch via phone and email intermittently. We haven't actually seen each in person in a very long time due to distance and family obligations when our kids were younger. Well, we hooked up again after my son had left for boot camp. Turns out hers (a few years older than mine) was already there. It also turns out he had a few minor medical issues (broken hand, gall bladder) that kept him in the Medical Platoon for two extra months (as if 13 weeks isn't bad enough!). But the best part? It turns out he was released from Medical two days ago and picked up by my son's company. I don't know yet if they're in the same platoon. But even if not, it means they are graduating the SAME DAY and we'll be seeing each other in South Carolina. You can't make up a story like that!Keep Delta Company in your thoughts November 15-17 as that's when they'll be doing \"The Crucible,\" the hardest part of Marine basic training. They will get only 2-1/2 MREs (Meals, Ready to Eat) the whole time, at best 4 hours sleep a night, will have many planned obstacles to overcome, and will end up marching a total of about 48 miles with full packs on their backs. Once they complete that, they will have a private Eagle, Globe & Anchor ceremony with their Drill Instructors and will then officially be Marines. Family Day and Graduation will be the next week and because of the Thanksgiving holiday, the ceremony will be on a Wednesday instead of Friday and they'll get 2 extra days of leave, which thrills me to no end!And one last thing: Mondo was ROBBED!!"},

LOL. I think your outfit looks just perfect.  Why are we sewers our own worst critics??\"I promise, I'm not singling you out as a bad thing, KMQ. I got your meaning and giggled. But your last statement had me scratching my head a little.Was I being my own worst critic? If so, I didn't mean to be. I point out sewing flaws only on this blog, not in real life. Trust me, I'm not one of those people who gets a compliment and then follows it up with a self-deprecating sidenote. I say \"Thank you\" and smile.But KMQ's comment made me think I should explain that I point out sewing flaws here so that maybe others can avoid them or learn from them, or even just simply relate. Sewing is solitary and sometimes it's nice to know we're not alone in our joys or our oopsies.For instance, the pattern matching being a little bit off across the front of the fleece jacket? I can live with it. Really. I promise, it's not going to bug me every time I look at it. I know (as another commenter said) I'll either be in motion when wearing this in real life or it will be unzipped. I know probably no one will even notice anyway, least of all mention it. But do I wish it was a perfect match? Yes, I do. I'm happier when I don't make mistakes. I think that's normal.  I admit that I can be a little OCD about fixing mistakes if something  is fixable. But if it's not, or I'm out of fabric or time, oh well. Move  on, next project.  I've also learned that as a finished garment ages, I stop noticing my mistakes and enjoy the creation as a whole.So, by my pointing out that I forgot to figure in the zipper when matching the print, I was hoping we could all learn something, and by typing it out, that *I* might remember for the next time. My memory works better if I've made a note somewhere, even if I never look at that note again.That's all."},
{"title": "McCall's 5981 - Finished", "date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "text": "It's done, and I like it better now with some sleeves although I'm still hating the mismatch across the front. Sigh. Hopefully, I can wear it open most of the time until I get over it.I also like it better with the edge of the collar gathered up a little so it's not hanging over the shoulders. Note to self: Buy real cording, the fleece scrap as cord ain't cutting it. ;-) With the collar gathered like this, it's not quite so linebacker-y. I like the similar oversized collar on the Vogue cardigan, but in fleece like this jacket, a big collar is also a very thick collar.(Once again, the colors are all wrong. The fleece is black just like the pants, but in the photo it's quite washed out looking, which makes the print pop more than it does in real life. Ah well. Please use your imagination.)If it happens to get really cold, I can also rearrange the collar like this:Fleece sticks to itself so the collar will stay like this without any fasteners, but maybe I will think about some sort of a more secure button & elastic loop at a later time. I do wish the neckline was higher without the collar arranged upward. If I were to make this again, I would definitely raise it. It's pretty to look at as drafted, but quite impractical if you need to stay warm and don't have a scarf handy.Oh, the other stupid part of this pattern? The collar is a big rectangle, but you're told to cut it as two pieces and seam it at what will be center back. Pffft. I cut mine on the fold and eliminated a step and a bulky seam that would only get in the way when attaching collar to neckline.I'm not sure what's up next. I may start the red floral denim jacket or I may start on a new nightgown. Probably the jacket, since it will take longer and I can always bring \"old\" PJs if I run out of time.Actually, what should be up next is a bit of vacuuming in the sewing room. The floor is barely visible through the thread snips and fabric scraps. ;-)"},
{"title": "McCall's 5981 Progress Report", "date": "Monday, October 25, 2010", "text": "(The print is MUCH more subdued than it looks here and the colors are a bit off. It's always a crap shoot as to what the digicam will do to a fabric.)Ah, the joys of pattern alterations. I was spoiled sewing all those already-altered TNTs recently. Yesterday was spent finishing up the B/W top from last weekend and then cutting out the jacket pattern and doing an FBA. I did not make a muslin. It's fleece. It's stretchy. And if it somehow fits horribly, I'm indifferent enough that I'll probably just toss it. The fleece has been in the stash for years and years and it's good to finally use it up.So far, it's coming along OK, but I'm not quite thrilled. The neckline is too low, as you can see with the B/W top I left on Zillie underneath. I don't think I'll have time to go to a Plan B, so I'll just have to suck it up and hope that it's not cold enough to need to zip it up.  (No wonder the pattern envelope shows a turtleneck worn underneath.) I also feel kind of linebacker-ish with all that gathered collar.  It's a lot of collar. But I'll keep plugging ahead because I have been known to change my mind. ;-) And at this point, all that's left are the sleeves and hems and then I can make a final judgment.My pattern matching across the front is so-so. The exposed zipper chops it up and I didn't allow for that. If there was no zipper, the motifs would abut and match great. Oh well.The pattern itself goes together well and everything seems to match up fine. But the instructions have got to be the WORST I have ever seen for a fleece jacket, or knits in general. Things such as fusing interfacing to the facings (you can't press polarfleece on high heat), easing and setting in sleeves in the round, and setting in the zipper in a way I can't even begin to explain except to say that you are somehow supposed to leave the front facing unsewn between the top/collar edge and the hem allowance and then kind of stick the zipper in and fold/press the fabric and facing around it. WTF! Crack smoking writers for sure on this one. If I remember, I'll share the instructions in a later post so you all can have a good laugh too.I omitted the patch pockets because I didn't want a big wad of fleece hem allowances at my hips. Instead, I added single-layer pocket bags behind the fronts and made sideseam openings. Just like the green Vogue cardigan I recently made. So much like it, in fact, that i just stole those pattern pieces and used them. ;-)Living in Florida, I don't sew a lot of polarfleece — although I should, judging by the abundant stock at the local Joann's. ;-) It really is such an enjoyable fabric to sew with though, so maybe I should do more fleece gifts. Fleece projects always seem to go fast and minor mistakes are easily hidden in the pile. Not that I've made any.On another subject, my son is down to his last 30 days of boot camp and I can hardly wait to see him! He's doing very well, his spirits remain high, and we continue to receive lots of letters from him. Those letters are the highlight of my day when they come and stalking the mailman has become the daily routine. I am so glad he's turned out to be a good letter-writer (my son, not the mailman!).Have a good week!"},
{"title": "A TNT Tops Weekend", "date": "Monday, October 18, 2010", "text": "Another productive weekend, and I'm done with sewing tops for my trip. Well, I may decide to sew one solid, but we'll see how that fits in when I'm done with everything else. I was tempted to stray into new pattern-land, but then I came to my senses and remembered I'm on a deadline so I just kept plugging away with the TNTs.First up is Jalie 2806. Nothing too exciting here. The print will go with all the pants I'm bringing (jeans, brown, green, and black). I borrowed belled long sleeves from an Ottobre pattern (not my TNT below) and finished them with an elastic casing so I can push them up when I feel smothered — which is always in long-sleeved tops.Next, I stole the flounce from this Butterick 5493 and …… morphed it onto my all-time TNT tee, the Ottobre Woman 05/2007.The print doesn't thrill me but it will work with all 4 pants, and it will be fine for just lazing around at my mom's or in the car.I also added a second flounce, which is just a duplicated and shortened version of the original from the Butterick pattern. I was also going to fully bind the neckline (w/o CS machine, due to bulk) but before I turned it, I decided I liked it unturned and floppy. It goes with the flounces. I finished the edges of it and the flounces with a wide 3-thread stitch on my serger. I'll revisit those flounces with another fabric/top in the near future. This top also got the belled Ottobre sleeves with an elastic wrist casing.Finally, a TNT from the past that I wore to death a few years ago. I decided it was time to bring it back. (Mostly because it's so fast to sew!) Kwik Sew 3378, the twist front top.Technically, this top will only go with my jeans and my black velour pants. But really, it's just black and white (neutral) so I can wear it with the green pants too. The tie is maybe too long, but I'm toying with the idea of adding a buckle (a la the Jalie tie top), if I can find the one I know I have around here somewhere. If not, I may shorten it or I may just tie it in a bow. I also haven't finished the sleeve hems yet. I'm deciding if I want to add a vented cuff to them or just straight hem them. I don't usually wear black or black/white, so this one is a deviation for me. I love the fabric though, so I'm sure I'll wear it a lot, which is why it got 3/4 sleeves for Florida.It's hard to see the twist in these photos, but it's there.Next up is a fleece jacket. I'll be using a mostly black fleece, which has been sitting it the stash for a LONG time because it is black. But since I'm bringing the black pants, it's now or never for it. It will also match the green pants (and jeans, of course).After the fleece, then the red floral denim jacket. And maybe a new nightgown if I have time.I'm probably overpacking since I'll have access to laundry at my mom's, but the range of possible temperatures for the end of November is really cramping my \"pack light\" self-directive. I will need layer options in case I end up freezing my butt off and I will also take one already-made short-sleeved top (probably the HP Sunshine top) in case it's actually warm. I'll just wash and wear it and the USMC tee every day if I have to. LOL!So, let me recap what I think I'm bringing:4 pairs of pants4-5 long-sleeved tops1 short-sleeved top1 USMC tee1 nightgown (to be made)1 long-ish cardigan1 brown zip-up jacket1 fleece jacket (in the car, not suitcase)1 denim jacketsocks, undiesblack flatsbrown flatsIs that too much for a week? Remember, I will be wearing one of the combos for the drives so not quite everything is going into the suitcase. I wanted to bring my HP Riviera jacket and another top, but I've talked myself out of those because that IS too much. What am I forgetting?"},

That doesn't happen too often.First, I finished up the fiddly tasks, which included hemming the sleeves of the Vogue cardigan, adding hem facings to my brown pants to finally finish the edges, and adding back pockets to the green pants that match the Vogue cardigan.Next up, I cut out and sewed this top:The pattern is from the February 2008 issue of Burda Plus magazine, design #404. I've made this top two times before so it's a TNT, but this is my first one with long sleeves. The first time I made this, the final pattern was morphed between the Burda pattern and my TNT Ottobre 02/2007 tees. Ottobre fits me better in the armhole and has better knit sleeves drafts. Burda's sleevecaps for knits are always way too high.You can't see much detail in my photo, but the neckline is shirred with elastic thread. The line drawing below shows that better.Finally, last night I cut another Jalie 2806 (the scoopneck waterfall top), with sleeves borrowed from another Ottobre top. The fabric for this is a print which will go with my brown and green pants, plus a pair of RTW black velour pants I've decided I'm taking on the trip.

{"title": "Vogue 8546 Finished", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2010", "text": "Well, almost finished. I still need to hem the sleeves but I'm out of the thread I was using so I need to go get more first.The fabric underneath is just that — fabric. But it will become a top to take along on the trip. It has greens which match this cardigan (jacket?) and the matching pants perfectly. I've been hoarding this piece for years, but its time has come.I opted for a lazy fast & easy closure method. I sewed ties to the inside fronts and called it done. The \"lapels\" of the jacket hide where they're attached and they don't show when worn open, even with movement. I really only want something to hold the fronts together on a windy day so I don't take off into the clouds. These ties will do the trick and won't get in the way on other days.I finished the entire edge with a 2-thread stitch on my serger. Because it's unlined and the reverse side shows as the lapels, there's really no way to turn under a hem and not have the wrong side show somewhere. The edging thread looks shiny in the photos, but it's not. It's just plain sewing thread, nothing fancy. There's a lot of distance to cover and I had to do two passes because my serger decided to mess up on one section for no reason at all. Stupid serger. ;-) (This is why I ran out of thread  before I could hem the sleeves.) But everything happens for a reason since I actually like the edge better with the second pass.The hood is not elegant at all, both in how it lays on the finished garment and how it's sewn. I think I'd like to make this pattern again but I will definitely be turning the hood into a flat collar before I do. Even when I manually lay it all nice, there's still a big weird fold in the middle.But truthfully, unless I have a valet dressing me, it will never lay that nice and will look like this mess instead. Good thing I don't have to look at my rear view.As you can see, I did manage to eek out the pattern onto the green fabric. My less-than-2 yards was considerably less than what the pattern calls for. I did have to shorten the cardigan to make it fit on the fabric, but only 1/2\" by just folding the pattern up at the bottom. But since I didn't turn a hem, I gained that length back anyway.I also had to cut the pocket bags from another fabric. You can see it peeking out when I pull on the pocket. But I do have to pull for it to be obvious that there's a non-matching fabric in there. So, no big deal at all. No one else will ever notice. (My topstitching looks horrible here, but it's a weird camera angle and I swear it's even.) And, of course, I had no fabric left for a self-belt, but I wasn't  planning to make one anyway.Overall, I like this cardigan a lot. It reminds me of a favorite coat I had in the '80s, which had a throw-over-your-shoulder cape/cowl kind of thing. I loved that coat.Someone mentioned in the comments that they were unsure if this would be flattering to larger busts. I think it's very flattering, because those lapels totally hide what's underneath and the big vee shape makes one's eyes follow that and not rest on the bust area. One day, I'll be photo-ready and get a pic of me wearing this. No promises as to exactly when that will be. ;-)Next up will be some tops for the trip, but I haven't decided what pattern & fabric combos yet."},

I cut the pattern blending between shoulder and hip sizes as usual and then cut the ugly fabric without any other alteration to get a starting point. I also wanted to see how it all goes together before I'm working on the real thing, because it's not lined and the back side of the hood seam is what shows per the pattern. All seam allowances are topstitched like a faux welt seam would be so it's not like there would be loose seam allowances flapping around.I totally screwed up when sewing the sleeves though and ended up with seam allowances on the outside. Hah! Good thing this was a test or I'd have a lot of ripping to do. Serves me right for only half paying attention. But I did decide that I can sew just the hood seam opposite of the instructions and end up with the better side showing. Realistically, I'm just not going to be using the hood that much (ever?) and if I do, it means the weather is horrible and no one is going to be looking at my hood seam. ;-) I'd rather have the nicer part showing when the hood is down.As to fit, I'm happy to say that it's pretty darn good. Which tells me this pattern has a LOT of ease. I need to add some more room at the back hip (a/k/a my butt), but other than that, no other alterations are needed. There's plenty of bust room and the center fronts do meet. The sleeves fit in both length and width over a long-sleeved top. Bust and waist levels seem to be good. It's a raglan and my square shoulders don't seem to be an issue — I lifted the collar/hood to check, but it would hide any problems if there was something to hide.I am going to shorten it all around about 3 inches but only because I'm  squeezing this onto a finite piece of fabric and if I don't shorten it,  it won't fit. I'm still not 100% sure my fabric is big enough. I think I need to lay it all out and pin it while on the floor to be sure. Fingers crossed, because I really want to make this from the green fabric, not the brown.The last issue is a closure. The pattern calls for a belt. I don't want a self-fabric or purchased belt because I'm not going to wear this closed very often and I don't have enough fabric for a self-belt anyway. But if it's windy, I will have fabric blowing all over so I think I need something. I'm thinking a couple of well-placed buttons and loops and/or hidden ties will do the trick. We'll see if I can come up with a solution without expending too much brain power. I am trying to get *something* finished for my trip after all and brain power takes time.So now I'm off to fight the masses so I can restock the food pantry and after that, I'll pick up on this project again. The sewing part is easy. I just need to spend some quality time with my cutting and marking."},
{"title": "Rethinking", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2010", "text": "OK, so the mostly-finished jeans are out due to a fabric deficiency. I haven't tried any washing additives, but I might, so I haven't tossed them yet. But this wrench in my plans got me to re-evaluate what I already have and think about a new direction.I still want jeans, but I'm not desperate so I'll put those on the back burner for the moment. I always have the Turkey Pants if needed and it will be Thanksgiving after all. ;-)I've decided these green doubleknit HP Marrakesh pants are definitely going on the trip. They fit well, look nice, and are comfortable. The ginger colored Riviera jacket you can see peeking at the edges might be going on the trip too. Depends on what I actually get made from my new plan and what goes with what when I'm done.I still have enough of the green doubleknit left to make a simple jacket or vest, so I'm going to do that. These pants will also go with the red floral print I've picked for the denim jacket (which is still on my list, just a little further down at the moment).My main goal right now is to be able to look nicer than jeans and a tee shirt but still pack sensibly and, as much as possible, to avoid garments that need ironing. We'll be packed pretty tight in the car once we get my son's gear loaded in. So, I'm going to try to stick to mostly knits, without looking like I'm wearing sweat pants. ;-) I'll probably plan on repeat outfits since we'll have access to my mom's laundry room and that will allow me to pack/make less. I also have these brown doubleknit pants made from one of my TNT pants patterns. They're cool weather favorites so I think they'll be going too, but I need to add some length to them because right now, they aren't hemmed and are just raw-edged. That's OK for around home, but not for a trip. I still have some of this fabric too, so I'll probably just face the hems or add a band. I should have done this already, but was just too complacent.The jacket is good to go, but I think I'd rather have something a little nicer/newer (this jacket saw a LOT of wear last year — I'm tired of it) and so I may also make a jacket or cardigan out of the leftovers.What I do need is some long-sleeved tops. It shouldn't be that cold in SC at the end of November, but it will definitely be long-sleeve weather for me and I don't have many in the closet. I'll pull out TNT patterns and knit prints for those tops.Easy jacket patterns I'm thinking about, which hopefully will not require much in the way of alterations:Vogue 8546McCall's 5981"},

Yesterday, I had to deal with a computer virus I picked up somewhere/somehow Sunday night so I didn't get back to the sewing room until today. The jeans are mostly done. All I need to do is finish and sew on the back pockets, do the waistband button/buttonhole, and hem them.But I think I'm going to ditch them before I get to all of that.Why, you ask? Well, even though I prewashed this denim in hot temps at least three times, my hands are turning dark blue with even the slightest touch on the denim. I really don't want to put up with that and I'm pretty sure 20 more washes won't cure it. Vinegar and/or salt is an old wives' tale which won't fix this. So, it looks like these were the muslin for my pattern changes. Which worked, BTW — they fit exactly how I like my jeans to fit (yes, tummy wrinkles and all).Back to the cutting table. At this rate, I may be wearing my old PJs to my son's graduation. ;-)"},

You should be able to tell by the photo above which garment called the loudest.All Hail Ye Tried N True!!Let's do a comparison, shall we?Last weekend: Unfold, cut and press never-used Burda jeans pattern. Cut out and sew muslin. Stare in the mirror. Remove muslin, go downstairs and watch football for a while. Back upstairs. Put muslin back on. Stare in mirror again. Make pattern adjustments. Cut out and sew next muslin. Stare in the mirror. Close down sewing room for the week and go watch football and Mad Men. Do some laundry. Go to bed.This weekend: Try on last weekend's muslin #2. Fold up pattern, both muslins, and set aside. Try on slightly too-small years-old jeans from TNT jeans pattern. Try on capris from same jeans pattern. Try on 2-3 other pants/capris from 2nd TNT pattern. Write whiney blog entry. ;-)  Get out TNT jeans pattern. Trace front and back pieces. Slash/spread to add 3/8\" to each piece (1-1/2\" total addition to width). Trace/adjust pocket pieces & waistband. Cut *denim.* Set up Viking 6010 for topstitching. Sew pockets, fly, darts. Go to bed. Wake up. Check blogs and emails. Baste inseams, outseams and crotch. Try on. Take pic of fly for blog. Write blog entry, and get ready to go finish the perfectly fitting jeans.See any differences? ;-)"},

Not too much happens in the sewing room when work is like this. Sigh. I think I used to have more stamina. I know part of the \"fatigue\" is being a little depressed (not clinically, so no advice for doctors or drugs please) with my son gone at basic training. I miss him. It's normal. I'll get over it. But in the meantime, it makes me feel even more sluggish. And then couple that with the monthly hormonal week and well, it has not been pretty. ;-)So, what does this all really mean? It means I haven't progressed further than initial alterations and a second muslin on the \"new\" Burda jeans pattern from the last post. It means that I'm re-thinking whether I want to spend the time to get this pattern into shape or just set it aside and pull out a TNT. (The Burda pattern is promising, but it will take a little more fiddling.) It means I'm not in the mood for fiddling and if I am only going to be sewing on weekends for a while, I will end up running out of time before making the things I want to take with me to my son's graduation. It means I realized I do actually have some decent full-length pants hanging in the closet that I forgot about and do I really need new jeans at all? (Yes! I always \"need\" new jeans! LOL!)So, I'm in the midst of rethinking and trying on stuff from my closet. Anything made with my old stand-by TNT pants patterns still fit the best. I think I should heed the signs. However, I may just start on the jacket instead and let the pants issue simmer a little longer. But because I *am* feeling quite fickle, who knows what will happen in the sewing room this weekend. Hopefully, I'll progress on something and not just overthink things per my usual tendency. Being excited about a project will actually give me more energy, so I need to come up with a plan that ignites a bigger spark.* * * * *But my son *is* doing great. His letters are arriving with wonderful regularity and he's still got his sense of humor and positive outlook. I love his letters! He's doing well with all the tasks at hand, both mentally and physically. He's now moving into Phase II and has seen the newest recruits to arrive and bumble their way through what he was watching, which made him realize how far he's come already.

But we will be in Parris Island SC for my son's graduation from boot camp at the end of the November and if I don't want to freeze my butt off, I need to get cracking now. My cool weather wardrobe is severely lacking.(Yes, I know the temps are low-60s during the day there at that time, but that IS cold to me. Plus, we'll be at the base at Oh Dark Thirty on Family Day the day before graduation to watch the Motivational Run and temps will definitely be below 60 at that time of day/night. Brrr!)My son's training company color is red. I've read that most families will dress in the appropriate colors for their recruits' company. I don't have or wear a lot of red so nothing I have will go with a red tee shirt underneath (which I'll purchase). But I did manage to find this piece in the stash, which will be perfect for another make of Kwik Sew 3369. You can see my previous version here.But before I start that, I'm going to try out this Burda jeans pattern. I've had it my stash for a LONG time and with all the TNTs I've been sewing lately, the sewing mojo wants a little more challenge. I may eat those words, I know. But I need to do something since I seem to have outgrown most of my other \"good\" jeans. Hrmpf.I wish I could wear the Jalie jeans pattern that everyone and their dog has made. But it just isn't made for the body I have and even though I could make the pattern fit, it still won't flatter. See that girl in the red top on the Burda envelope? See her chunky thighs, especially at the knee? That's me, my body type — which is definitely not the Jalie jeans body type. I'm hopeful this pattern is true to the photo.So that's what I'm working on today during football games — first a muslin for the Burda jeans without any alterations to get a starting point. And then I'll work on the alterations that I'm sure will be coming.After the jeans and jacket, I have plans for a couple more \"winter\" items because after graduation we'll be going up to my mom's at the Virginia shore for Thanksgiving. Hopefully, I can stay on course and get these things made that I've had in the cue for at least two years now. I want to pack light, but I still will need some warmer tees and other pants (read: stretchy!) for Turkey day. Worst case is I'll just wear my \"Turkey pants\" from a couple of years ago but I'm really hoping I can get to the wonderful brown velour that's been biding its time."},

It sped up considerably on Opera but it still has too many quirks for me. Like it would keep showing entries as new even though I'd \"Read\" them numerous times. That's a huge time waster, and frustrating. And there's just too much clicking and/or scrolling just to get it to recognize that I had read something — only to have it show up as Unread the next hour. And I'd have to sign in to my Google account multiple times a day. Nope, GR is not for me. It annoys me and wastes my time.I tried Feedly. It's OK, but it's too cutesy or something, I don't know. I admit that I didn't give it very long, but it just didn't feel right for me so I moved on.I don't and won't use IE so that's not an option.Some of the blogs I read are not on Blogger so using Blogger's Follow feature misses them, even though I already do check the Blogger Dashboard often for a quick idea of what's been updated while I'm checking to see if any comments on really old posts or spam need moderating. (Side note: Isn't Blogger's new Spam filter great?)The bottom line is I just want a reader that gives me a plain old list of blogs with an easy visual as to what's read and what's not. Nothing fancy.Because of Deb's comment on my last post, I tried FeedDemon. It's the closest reader to Bloglines that I've tried so far so I think this will be the one. It has a little advertising block in one corner if you use the free version. If it keeps performing as well as it has so far, I will be happy to pay the $15 to remove that ad block if it really bugs me. But I'm so used to tuning out ads that it may not even be an issue after a few more days.Thanks Deb! :-)"},

Oh yes. My rant of the day (well, yesterday, really).On the heels of the announced demise of Bloglines, I've seen many recommendations for Google Reader, which at this point is the ONLY choice left. The problem for me is that I HATE Google Reader. H. A. T. E. There, I said it. And I know I'm in the minority.I've tried it numerous times over the last year or two and it's just kludgey. Sure, Bloglines has had its own share of problems but aside from that, it's just a better feed reader IMO so I overlooked them. Especially when during some of their outages, I would try Google Reader again and each time go running back to Bloglines.So yesterday I did the export/import thing again so that Google Reader could pick up where my Bloglines is leaving off because I knew the only other choice would be to manually visit each and every blog I regularly read and who has time for that! GR was TORTURE. Oh My Freakin' Gawd. It was so SLOW. And it sucked every last resource out of my pretty powerful computer. So much so, that I was beginning to wonder if it was going to explode. Seriously. OK, maybe not. But close.Well, today I learned I'm going to have to eat just a little crow on trashing Google Reader. (But I still think it's kludgey.) The resource sucking? Totally Firefox, and its horrible handling of Javascript. Firefox is not a speed demon with Bloglines either, but it's been quite passable and not the honkin' big resource hog as with GR.I downloaded and installed Opera this morning and the clouds parted to let the angels sing. IOW, GR is now at least speedy if still kludgey.But you know what this means, right? I have to decide if I want to spend the time to move over completely to Opera or use both it and Firefox. I know I'm getting old because the more things I have to change, the crankier I get. And to think I actually used to enjoy (and get paid for) troubleshooting software. Yep. I 'm old.

Nothing fancy - just a bunch of circles from the print and some coordinating solids fused onto sturdy interfacing, cut with pinking shears, gathered and joined by hand, and then some crystals fused in the center. It's got a pin backing so I can remove it when laundering.It shows up more in real life than in the photo, because the photo doesn't capture its 3D-ness.I'm not sure what's up next on the sewing table.

You could even try these easy styles in a lightweight T-shirt fabric. Semi-fitted unlined tops feature gathered scoop necklines and finish just below the hips.

But I've had such great successes with other HP's and so I was disappointed and desperately wanted to break out of my current HP wadderville. I pulled out this pattern to see if it had some shaping that would flatter me instead of just cover me. It does, which may be surprising for a Peasant top, and I''m very relieved to say that this pattern was a success! Whew! I was beginning to doubt myself. ;-)Here's my top, belted:I did not follow the pattern instructions to attach a casing for the tie because I wanted to be able to wear it either cinched or loose. I previously made a Sunshine top with a separate belt option and find that I wear it both ways a lot, so I wanted the same option with this top. I added some of the solid purple from the border to the ends of the ties. Although they appear as two dark blobs in this photo, in real life they look nice and I like the bit of contrast.I chose the short sleeve view with the bottom edge of the sleeve gathered onto a self-fabric band, instead of binding the bottom per the hem. My fabric, a very nice rayon border knit from Fabric Mart (sold out!), was a bit too bulky where it was gathered to do \"real\" binding so I chose the less fiddly method of just adding a band.Here it is, unbelted. For the neckline I did not bind it with my coverstitch machine because those gathers just wanted to give the binders fits. Instead, I bound the edge manually and then used the CS machine to topstitch, trimming the excess binding from the back with duckbill scissors. Or maybe I'm just out of practice, having not used my CS machine for months. (Gasp!)I know in the photos the print sorta looks like bullseyes on the girls, but it hits me a little differently than Zillie and isn't so In-Yer-Face. I'm glad I bought enough of this fabric to hoard for another top later. It's really nice stuff and good quality rayon print knits are hard to come by.Notes about this pattern:1. The neckline is on the wide side, as shown in the envelope drawings. I decided to go down one size at the neckline to keep the bra straps hidden. This was a good decision, as the neckline is just how I like it and I think one size bigger would've been a scootch too wide.2. I did not do a traditional FBA and instead used my cheater method of starting with my shoulder size (16) and then blending outward to a bigger size at bust level (and then still bigger at butt level, but that's a usual alteration for me) .3. The sleeve pattern was fine. I know earlier versions of this pattern had complaints about the drafting and marks for the sleeve pattern, but it's apparent that HP listens because there was nothing wrong with this version and it now had front and back notches (although I note there were no corresponding notches on the bodice pieces, but you hardly need them).4. As noted by the Beginner label on the envelope, this is an easy pattern that goes together fast and doesn't require a lot (any?) fitting. This pattern was released before HP started with illustrated instructions, but unless you are a true rank beginner, you don't really need drawings with this one. Cut out the 3-4 pieces, gather the edges to fit as desired, sew them together, hem. Voila!5. Mark the front or back inside the top so you don't put it on backwards. The front is more gathered than the back, but when you've got a busy print like this, you may not notice. Well, at least I didn't at first. ;-)"},

And I'm thinking these will also make unique but useful Christmas presents.Anyone interested in the directions to make one for yourself? Stay tuned!* * * * *It's been a slow sewing week here. I was sick with a stomach flu mid-week (ugh!).And then with the day-after-day rain we've been having, trees have been soaking up all the water and dropping branches left and right. About 3 AM Friday night/Saturday morning, one of our neighbor's trees fell on our power lines, creating a loud electrical explosion and then pitch darkness immediately after. And we have water on a well so our pump was dead without power too.It took until 2 PM Saturday for the electric company to get here and fix it. And then \"all\" they did was string new cable. The old power lines the tree landed on are still holding up the tree and are about 6 feet off the ground, and I'm *assuming* not live anymore. I hope the job isn't quite finished and the power company is just waiting until they don't have to pay doubletime to a weekend crew. I'll be calling tomorrow to be sure.But we stayed out of the fridge and freezer and the food was fine. And the rainy weather meant the house stayed cool too, without sun beating down on it. So, the only thing I lost was sewing time. It could've been worse."},
{"title": "Clean Underwear", "date": "Monday, August 23, 2010", "text": "Yes, clean underwear. Not that I've been wearing anything else, but at least now my washer is fixed, my wet clothes have been rescued and laundered, and I can wear my *favorite* clean underwear again. It was a bad pump, and let me tell you — water sitting in the washer for 3+ days STINKS. A lot. Worse than dirty underwear. Ewwww. ;-) After the repairman left, I ran that load through 3 times and it finally passed the sniff test.Now that the important news of the day has been relayed, in sewing/quilting news … I finished the second runner for the Ucreate August Create-With-Me Sewalong. This is the runner I'll be giving my sister for Christmas. Let's hope come December, I remember that I made it and where I put it. I might hang the Rainbow Runner in my sewing room instead of using it as a table topper. Still thinking on that though.The backing is an old Mary Engelbreit bumblebee print from stash. So another length of old stuff out. Yay!After hand-sewing the binding for my rainbow runner, I didn't feel right about not hand-sewing the binding for the giftie so I sucked it up and got out the hand needle again. (I even bought a pack of new needles today for next time. Yes, I know.) I made better time on this binding because I decided I only needed to pull the thread tight every 4-5 stitches all at once instead of between each stitch. Machine sewing bindings is tons faster, but the handstitched bindings really do look nice. I may end up a convert yet.I'm still not ready to sew clothes yet, mostly because I have a couple of non-clothing project ideas that have been percolating. But I think I'm almost there because I did start looking at some patterns for tops last night."},
{"title": "End of the Rainbow", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2010", "text": "The stripe for the binding fabric arrived on Thursday. During Project Runway, I made the binding and attached one side to the quilt by machine. Those are two of my little piggies standing guard. I collect pigs and have a ton of them around.Yesterday (Friday), I pinned the binding around to the back and started attaching it by machine. I must have ripped out the stitches about 300 times. OK, slight exaggeration, but it just was NOT going well. I gave up and had some dinner. (Here's the back print, by the way. I've had this in the stash for over 8 years and am glad to be using it up!) After dinner, I ripped stitches again and then threw in the towel, loaded up a movie on the DVR, threaded a hand needle and ladder-stitched the binding to the back by hand. For TWO HOURS. OMG. But it's done, and looks pretty darn good if I do say so myself. I'm not sure if I have the patience to ever hand-stitch a binding onto a bed-size quilt, or even another table runner. I'd rather perfect my machine binding skills, I think. This quilting stuff is harder than it looks. ;-)I was planning to throw this into the washer and dryer to crinkle it up, but when I went to move the current load from washer to dryer, the washer was flashing an error code and the door was locked. WITH ALL MY FAVORITE CLOTHES INSIDE. Arghhh. Seriously, I can't get any of my clothes out of the washer. Yes, I've tried everything but the machine is making a grinding noise and is obviously broken, so I made a call into service this morning and an appointment is set for Monday. But in the meantime I have to wear UNfavorite clothes and glare at the washer which is holding all my good stuff hostage.On a bright note, I'm alone for the weekend. The menfolk headed up to my stepson's in Jacksonville yesterday to send him off on his (SS's) new life adventure in North Carolina. I'm here on dog duty. And it's raining. Good thing I don't have to go anywhere because I don't have ANYTHING to wear. Sigh. Maybe I'll just wear my nightie all day. Hmprf.Or, maybe I should go make a new top. But then what would happen to this quilting blog? Hahaha."},
{"title": "Rainbow Runner", "date": "Tuesday, August 17, 2010", "text": "I finished the straight-line quilting on this tonight and am now waiting on my binding fabric to arrive. I tried to use all stash fabrics but I really wanted a stripe that picks up the color spectrum in the runner and I didn't have anything that worked for that. Which means I was \"forced\" to buy more fabric. Ahem. But only 1/2 yard. Of course, I had to throw in other stuff into the shopping cart to make it worth the shipping, right? But I think I found the fabrics I want to use for a window topper, so fingers crossed that the colors are what I'm expecting.I have one more of these easy scrappy runners in mind and I haven't decided yet if this one or the one still to be done is what I'll put away for my sister for Christmas. It depends on if the second one turns out like I see it in my imagination. If it does, then I think that one will go to my sister."},
{"title": "Summer Flowers in the Field", "date": "Thursday, August 12, 2010", "text": "It's done! Now all I have to do is hang it on the wall. I was calling this \"my scrappy triangle flowery wallhanging thing,\" but then I thought I'd go a bit more hoity-toity, so \"Summer Flowers in the Field\" it is. I crack myself up.I finished it last night, putting on the binding while watching Top Chef. Gawd, that show makes me want to EAT so I was glad to have something else to keep my hands busy. I'm not a hand sewer of bindings. Gimme my machine all the way, baby! ;-)  I tossed it in the washer last night and the dryer this morning so I could have that puckery goodness. I love a puckery quilt. It looks less puckery in these photos than IRL but I think that's because shrinking the pics to more web-friendly size lost some of the contrast/definition. Trust me. It's plenty puckered.This binding is one of my most successful to date, I think. Usually, I will wuss out and just use a small ZZ on the front so I'm sure the back of the binding is caught. I match thread to binding and you really can't even tell unless you're looking for it. I'm not entering quilt shows or anything.But I decided I want to master binding a quilt by machine so I forced myself to do it the right way with no shortcuts. My tips: Lots of pins and a walking foot. And this YouTube video. Notice how she's constantly pushing the seam allowance more open as she stitches in the ditch? Do that.I still had a couple of spots where I missed the back but that's because I joined some of the binding pieces straight instead of using bias seams and they made the binding more lumpy. But I was seriously eeking out the last scraps of these stripes and a bias seam would've eaten up too much of my smaller pieces. I know better, but sometimes ya gotta do what ya gotta do. It wasn't a big deal to do a second pass where I missed. It's going on the wall. Even I'll never see it.The quilting itself is nothing special. Mostly just in the ditch, but I did echo the flowers and greenery. Also on my list to master is free motion. I'm OK. But I need more practice.And, speaking of my sewing room … Oh? We weren't? Well, now we are. ;-) Here's yet ANOTHER photo of my IKEA shelves. I found some bins that work for me. They look basket-y but they're really plastic. I'll need to put labels on them or draw myself a map because with all this reorganization, I CAN'T FIND A THING! But I'm slowly getting used to where my stuff is. Oh, and those 4 bins on the bottom? Those are the ones that used to have blue/yellow lids. Krylon Fusion for plastic rocks! I also got these smaller rattan baskets. There are 4 of them but you can't see the last one since it's blocked by my cutting table. I'm going to make liners for these — first, because the baskets are kind of rough and second, to keep the green thing going for the lower half of this unit.While I'm still in quilt-mode, I'm going to try to knock out a quick table runner for my sister for Christmas. Yes, I'm in shock too. I usually never even think about Christmas until December. But I still have scraps I'm determined to use up and this will go fast. I might even make one for myself. I'm going to join in the August Create-With-Me sew-along on UCreate, here. UCreate is a great blog, BTW. Lots and LOTS of crafty ideas. Fill up your coffee cup before you click on that link. I'm just sayin'…"},
{"title": "We Interrupt This Garment Sewing Blog", "date": "Monday, August 9, 2010", "text": "… to bring you a quilting-crafty blog. Or so it seems, lately. ;-0That's OK. That's one of the things I love about sewing — there are SO MANY different things to sew that it's hard even for someone with the attention span of a gnat (me!) to get bored.So, I didn't get the quilt top finished, but it's nearly so. (Do you know how long it takes to arrange all the blocks so that there are no repeats of prints in the rows or columns and the color depth is evenly distributed? Hah!) I still need to machine appliqué the flowers and leaves and then I'm going to straight-line machine quilt this little wall hanging so the finish shouldn't be that far away. Hopefully, I'll get it done by the weekend since it's a slower work week. Fingers crossed.If I do say so myself, I like it. It's very cheery and the unexpected pop of orange and yellow in the corner makes me smile. And makes it less matchy-matchy, I think. If I were a \"real\" quilter, I would have a stash of quilting fabrics and this wallhanging wouldn't have been made with every same fabric I've been using for the last few weeks. But I did manage to dig up a few that haven't been used in the room re-do yet.Speaking of \"real\" quilters — it's no wonder quilting is so popular. The finished pieces I've been seeing on quilting blogs are so pleasant to look at, the fabrics are adorable with such a big choice, and the shops know how to do it right.Case in point, Fat Quarter Shop (NAYY):Each magazine was packaged in its own protective zippy bag, the charm packs in their own wrapper with cute FQS stickers for closures and decoration. Yes, I bought charm packs. Does this mean I'm starting a quilting stash? Hmmm. Even the pretty invoice (yes, pretty!) came inside a nice Thank You envelope. Contrast this with Fabric.com, Fabric Mart, and others who toss wadded-up fabric in a bag inside a box and throw in advertising. Hmmm. (OK, EOS has better packaging, but even that could be improved at those prices. Sorry, just my 2 cents.)So, what's with the quilty magazines? Well, I've taken a liking to them and also crafty magazines for eye-candy and entertainment reads since Threads, et al. has been boring me for quite a while. Deep down, I still like the garment sewing magazines (what few there are!), but it seems like everything is a re-hash and there's not much new and fresh within the pages.Which is completely different from the quilting and crafting magazines. On and in those, the colors are bright, the projects look fun and imaginative, the writing is entertaining, and the whole vibe is just more inviting. Even though I could do most of the crafty projects in my sleep. But I'm an experienced sewer/crafter and not the typical target audience, so I understand that most of the projects are not going to be for advanced skills. But how attractive these magazines and projects must be for new and/or young sewers. (Or … ahem! … \"old\" sewers like me with the gnat's attention span!) If you were a 20-something beginner sewer/crafter, would you pick up a magazine with a fuddy-duddy boucle Chanel jacket on the cover or would you pick up the one with Fun! Bright! Cheerful! projects with articles that are written the way you talk? I may be nearing mid-century but I'm far from ready to be a Lady Who Lunches. Pfffft. :-)So where am I going with all of this? I don't really know. LOL! I just know that I like having choices. Vive la différence!And do stick around. There will be garment sewing again eventually. That gnat thing, remember? ;-)"},
{"title": "Last Night", "date": "Friday, August 6, 2010", "text": "This is what I worked on last night while Project Runway was on. Piecing on my Featherweight means I can face the TV. I used the scraps from the bins and binder covers. You're all probably getting a little sick of seeing these fabrics all the time. I promise — once this is done, these prints will be used up. Well, mostly. I'm not using any pattern. I just measured out a triangle that would fit on the triangle-shaped scraps from the bins. I'm going to add some more blocks from the fabrics you can see at the left for variety — even I'm getting a bit tired of those same ol' fabrics — but I won't make the finished quilt much bigger than what you see here. I'm going to hang it on the wall in the sewing room and hope to get it done this weekend while my garment sewing mojo is on hiatus.Speaking of sick of looking at, here's yet ANOTHER photo of my shelves and bins, but what I'm really showing is the cool little blue dress form up top. I was out still looking for ready-made bins yesterday afternoon. I didn't find any bins that I wanted but I did find this instead at HomeGoods. Isn't it cute? I wanted something tall and sewing-related for the top of the shelves to off-set the straight row of machines and this is perfect.Have a great weekend — I'm starting mine NOW! :-)"},
{"title": "Tutorial: IKEA Expedit DIY Bins", "date": "Tuesday, August 3, 2010", "text": "Pattern: Download HERE You will need Adobe Reader/Acrobat to open the PDF. Assembly instructions and the supply list are on the last page of the pattern.Supplies:Per Bin:8 Fat Quarters or Equivalent (2 yds)Only 2 FQ will be visible so the remainder of the fabric can be scrap yardage, old/new sheets, muslin, etc. Corrugated cardboard cut into five (5) 12.75\" squaresMust be w/o creases or folds. I bought the Expedit shelves above and had enough cardboard from the packing boxes for all 8 bins. 15\" Steam-A-Seam or other fusible web strip1 Freezer baggie or 1 small piece of clear plastic/vinyl - cut to approximately 2\" x 2.5\".1 Piece of scrap paper for labelTape to hold baggie/plastic in place while sewingOther sewing/cutting supplies:Thread, scissors/rotary cutter & mat, ruler, sewing machine, iron & ironing board/matNote: If you are planning on these covers to be washable, you will need to pre-wash your fabrics before cutting, and then finish the seam allowances during construction so they don't fray in the laundry. I recommend pinking shears. You can use a serger/overlocker, but read through the instructions and visualize the entire process first so you'll know when/where to overlock.1. Assemble pattern and lay out on fabric.In the photo below, the green fabric on top is an actual Fat Quarter (18\"x22\"), the print underneath is a generous FQ and the plaid is just scrap yardage folded into 2 layers. 4 layers of fabric total. Each of these layers will be one side of the outside of the bin.2. Cut the fabric. Be sure to save those strips as shown below to use for the cuff and the handle.3. You'll have other scraps left and if you're a quilter, I'm sure you can find a use for them.4. Using the same \"house\" pattern piece, cut out 4 lining pieces. I was doing assembly-line sewing for 4 bins, so I've got 12 lining pieces here from an unloved king-sized sheet, with plenty of leftover.5. Next up is cutting out the cuff pieces (below left). The pattern is divided into 2 sections. If you're doing this on the cheap like me, you will use the shorter section for the \"public\" side of the bin and the longer piece for the sides that don't show, joining them up to form a 51\" x 4.5\" band.If you're spendy :-), don't divide the cuff pattern and use it whole.From my sheet used above for the lining pieces, I just cut random length 4.5\" strips, joined the \"public\" cuff piece and trimmed them to 52\" (52\" includes 2 half-inch seam allowances. The finished tube will be 51\" as noted above.)6. Next up are the handles. From the strips used to cut the \"public\" cuff, you should have enough left to squeak out a 7\"-7.5\" x 2.5\" strip. (See photo above.)7. Fold the long edges toward the center, using the pattern markings as a guide. Apply Steam-A-Seam to each long raw edge and seal your handle closed.8. Edgestitch along the long edges of the strip. Press the short raw ends under about 3/4\"-1\". If you're making more than one bin, note your finished handle length and use the same length for all handles if you want them all to match.9. Pin your handle 5\" - 5.5\" inches down from the top edge of the front piece, leaving about 1\" of \"give\" in the length so the handle is not flush against the front (see photo below). Stitch folded-under ends down in a square pattern to attach the handle to the front.10. Using Scotch tape or whatever tape is handy, tape the baggie/plastic centered about 1/2\" below the handle. Edgestitch the bottom and sides, as shown below, stitching through the tape. When finished, remove the tape.Note: You will have to be careful when pressing once this plastic is in place so you may want to save this step for right before you insert the cardboard sides.11. Press under the top edge of your cuff tube 1/2\" and topstitch 3/8\" down from the fold to create a finished hem. The short piece is my \"public\" cuff. The plaid is scrap. Remember, I was assembly-line sewing - the king sheet strips you saw in the above photos were used on other bins.Set cuff aside for the moment.12. As per the pattern, mark dots as shown below on the wrong sides of your 4 cover and 4 lining pieces.13. Sew 2 of the 4 cover pieces right sides together, as shown. Pivot at the side dot and be sure to stop 1/2\" from the bottom point on the dot mark. Be careful to not sew over any of the other pieces' points/seam allowances when you are at the point. You can feel them through the fabric, so just move them out of the path of the needle if necessary. It's OK to stop a little short of the point — it won't show. ;-) Also, remember that the points are on the bias and take care not to stretch the bias edges.14. Repeat so that all 4 cover pieces are joined right sides together. You will end up with a cover that looks like this on the bottom, where the 4 points come together to form an X.15. Repeat steps 13 & 14 for the 4 lining pieces.16. Clip up to but NOT INTO the stitching at all corners on both cover and lining. See photo and drawing below. Do not clip the bottom point.17. Press all seams open. Press the intersections at the point as flat as possible.18. On the cover only, press the top raw edge under 1/2\". Topstitch 3/8\" in from the top to close the hem.19. Back to the cuff tube you set aside earlier. Match the raw edge of the cuff tube to the top raw edge of the lining, right sides together. Center the \"public\" cuff section, if you have one, across one of the lining panels. You are trying to avoid a seam-to-seam match up at the corners for less bulk when assembling the bin later.20. Press the joined cuff and lining flat, with the seam allowance pressed toward the lining.21. This next part is tricky to describe and almost impossible to show intelligible photos through all the steps so follow along carefully and exactly.a. Turn the cover right side out.b. Turn the lining wrong side out.c. Place lining inside the cover so that wrong sides face each other and each piece's side seam allowances are roughly matched up across from each other. (The cuff will extend at the top.) Be sure to match your \"public\" cuff lining section with the \"public\" front face fabric of the cover.d. Reach in between the cover and lining pieces and pick one pair of seam allowances (1 from the cover, 1 from the lining) and pin them together from the snip at the corner to the hem at the top of the cover. Sew the seam allowances together outside the existing seam in the existing seam allowance. Your new stitching should be 1/16\" to 1/8\" outside of the previous sideseam stitching.In the photo below, the blue line is the existing stitching and the red line is the stitching you are doing in this step. Stitch starting about 3/4\" below the cover's hem and stitch to the snips in the corner, keeping the seam allowance raw edges aligned and flat.e. DO NOT pin more than one pair of seam allowances together at a time or you will end up with a twisted bunch of fabric you can't turn. Trust me. It is a lot easier to rearrange the cover and lining between each step of joining them together. So, when you have finished joining one pair of seam allowances, start from step 21(a) above for the next pair. Continue until all four seam allowances are joined and turn everything so the right sides are out on both cover and lining.22. At this point, your bin cover should resemble this:23. If you haven't cut your cardboard squares, do that now. I use my 60 mm rotary cutter and it's a breeze! Plus my sons think it sounds pretty cool, and I haven't noticed the cardboard dulling the blade at all.(Add your plastic label holder now if you deferred this step from above.)Slide 1 cardboard square into each of the 4 pockets between cover and lining you created in step 21. Go slow — the pockets will be snug and if you force the cardboard, you'll bend it.24. With 4 cardboard panels in place, your bin is starting to take shape and will resemble this:25. Fold the cuff over the cardboard edge and cover, to resemble this:26. Almost there!Right now, the bottom of your bin is still floppy fabric, like this:27. If you're industrious and care about unseen details, you can cover the last cardboard square with some fabric and stitching or even glue, but I know no one will ever see the bottom of these bins but me, so I just …28. … pushed the uncovered square inside as-is.Start with the square on edge against one side of the bin and then lower it like a drawbridge until it's flat across the bottom.Ta Dah!This is the back view of the above bin. You can see how easily they can be turnable-reversible  with a different print on each cover panel. These fabrics may not look like scraps, but trust me — they've all been used a lot and are definitely leftovers.These bins use more \"traditional\" scraps and old sheets. Really bad cutting on that plaid - no way that side will ever see the light of day again. ;-)If you use this tutorial to make your own bins, I'd love to see a photo!"},
{"title": "Four More", "date": "Monday, August 2, 2010", "text": "… or, How I Spent My Sunday.I was ready to cave in and BUY some bins. I even went back to IKEA, and visited Target and Walmart and scouted around online. Zilch. Nada.

The four on the left in the photo are the latest.I took photos along the way and will write up the tutorial as my next post.There's still a lot more organizing to do in here, but I'm making progress. This will be it for me for the fabric bins, I think (never say never!). I like how the 8 across the top look, but any more probably will be Way Too Much. I do want to bring some green into some of the other cubbies, though, so I've still got my thinking (and shopping) cap on."},
{"title": "Review: Hot Patterns 1111", "date": "Saturday, July 31, 2010", "text": "Pattern Description: (From the HP website) \"You’ll look effortlessly fabulous in these lovely tops, designed for drape-y fabrics like crepe, charmeuse, rayon, washed linen, crinkle viscose, georgette, or even a silk-y jersey or fluid T-shirting. Relaxed-fit pull-on Tops have a straight, tunic-style silhouette and an underbust seam. Tie-front tunic length top features a boat neckline; applied ties to shape the front, plus optional back darts. Ruffle-trimmed blouse version has an underbust drawstring, a wide-set collar and a front button fastening on the upper bodice, a curved hemline, fluted ruffle sleeves & front trim. Asymmetric front top has a side-front opening and can be worn open, or buttoned closed. Mix your neckline, sleeve and trim options for maximum fashion mileage. Wear any of these stunning styles over slim or full straight-leg pants or jeans, or even over a skinny below-the-knee pencil skirt for a gorgeously casual but elegant look.\"Pattern Sizing: Multi 6-26. I started with an 18 at the neckline based on my previous experience with Hot Patterns. It was HUGE and fell right off my shoulders.Did it look like the photo/drawing on the pattern envelope once you were done sewing with it? Kind of yes, kind of no.Were the instructions easy to follow? The instructions were sufficient for the view I made, but steps such as grading, clipping, and understitching were missing. I'm not saying they should be included, but if you're not already familiar with these techniques and when to use them, this pattern won't teach you. ;-)Overall impression of finished garment: I wanted to love this top, I really did. And I do love the line drawing. But unfortunately, I ended up with a sack with flipped out facings. The \"sack\" is my fault because I know I don't like or look good in drop-shouldered, loose-fit tops and yet that's exactly the style I sewed.The problem with the facings that don't stay put is a combination of too big of a neckline and too much weight in the seam. In some spots there are 6-7 layers with the collar, flounce, interfacing, bodice, etc. A lightweight stable woven instead of a knit should make a difference. The knit I used is heavy so it definitely exaggerated the problem.Fabric Used: A very fluid knit. I did interface the neckline facings with a non-stretch fusible, and still the facings wanted to flip outward. There's just too much weight/bulk for them to do anything else.Pattern alterations: Because the shoulder/neck width was so big on me, I ended taking a 1\" tuck down the center back of both the upper back and the facing. This helped, but the neckline was still too wide and too low.I also cut off 2.25\" from the bottom edge of the upper pieces because the underbust seam described/shown on the pattern envelope was a waist seam in real life. You can see the original seam pinned together marked in red in the photo below. Removing this length brings the seam to underbust on me. (I would test/measure this again if I were to make this top in a woven but the pattern pieces tell me I will still need to remove length even without a stretch factor.)If I were to finish this top, I would also remove about 2 inches from the bottom before hemming since it is way too long on me. I used the shortest length option on the pattern. But I would rather end up with too long that I have to trim than too short and be stuck.I was short on fabric so I cut the neckline flounces almost in half lengthwise. I can't imagine what that extra weight and length would do to the already overloaded facing seam!Conclusion: I haven't decided if I'm going to try this again with a different fabric. While I love the way it looks on the envelope, my recent track record with these boxy styles has been 0 for 2. On others, this style is fine. If you do make this, test the neckline size in muslin and don't use a heavy fabric if you're making the flouncy version. Learn from my mistakes!"},
{"title": "The Bubble Wrap Suits", "date": "Wednesday, July 28, 2010", "text": "I am SO BUSY with work this week that I've barely had time to come up for air, let alone get into the sewing room to progress on my HP top that I didn't finish over the weekend.

Whew!In the meantime, I'll leave with you this photo of my sons in their bubble wrap suits standing next to DS#1's friend (friend, not girlfriend) in her Pokemon-inspired costume.The jackets have hoods and snap closures and there's a working fly (no zip) on the pants. It was fun to collaborate with DS#1 on this idea, but I'm glad I don't have to sew bubble wrap every day.While I'm on the subject, shortly after the guys arrived at MetroCon this past Saturday morning, they called to tell me that a lady had just walked up to them and told them she knew that they were my sons and that I had made their outfits because she reads my blog.

{"title": "Hot Patterns 1111", "date": "Sunday, July 25, 2010", "text": "I'm making the ruffly version of this (shown in red, but I'm not using red) and am almost done cutting it out. I have to do some creative cutting/piecing for the big neckline flounces and then I'll be ready to start sewing. This is my fault because I'm trying to squeeze everything onto a specific leftover piece of fabric that I found while digging through the stash yesterday. If I was using a new, proper-length piece, I'd be done cutting by now. I hope this goes together as fast as I think it will.I'm not planning on leaving the sewing room much for the rest of the day/evening, except for food, drink and potty breaks (me and the dogs). Mad Men Season 4 starts tonight so I'll be watching that as I sew if I'm not done by then. Can't wait — love this show!Speaking of the sewing room … here's the \"After\" shot of the stash closet.The only Before I have is a shot taken while the sewing room was torn apart.You can see there used to be 3 big bins + stacked up outside of the left closet doors, along with few newer pieces you can't see which were traveling between my ironing board and my pattern cabinet.Every piece of fabric I own is now inside the closet, stacked on the shelves or sorted into the muslin and scrap bins on the floor below. Well, except for the 5-6 sitting on the corner of my pattern cabinet which I pulled out to pre-wash since I noticed they had never been. Yes, I know I have a lot. But I'm sure Carolyn has more. ;-) And I can stop anytime I want to.  :coughcough:… she ends up rearranging her entire fabric closet.I thought I would be sewing today. My sons left this morning for MetroCon with their bubblewrap suits (photos and an interesting tidbit coming later), DH went off to work, and I had the whole day alone.I went up to the sewing room fully intending to start on a new Hot Patterns top which arrived in the mail last week. But then I looked around at the room, which is still in makeover mode, saw the overflow bins in front of the stash closet, and decided I'd first take a few minutes to organize a little better so I could get that fabric out of the bins and into the closet. You know what's coming next, right?Mission accomplished, but not without spending the ENTIRE day and evening going through every piece of fabric in the closet. Well, it was on my To-Do list for eventually so at least it's done. And I did manage to cart out 4 bags of stuff I never should have been saving, plus I added a number of pieces to the use-for-muslins stack.Tomorrow I *will* sew, especially since seeing lots of fabric I'd forgotten about sparked the mojo Big Time. And if I buy any more fabric any time soon, shoot me."},

Today, I took some time off to sew the suits. I can't wait to get pics of them in full costume - it will be hilarious.I also can't wait to sew something for ME. Maybe this weekend?---------------------------*It may even stretch to three suits, since there's enough bubble wrap and DS is trying to get another friend of his to dress up too.**Yes, we know MetroCon is mostly Anime but DS#1 insists they will still fit right in.

{"title": "More Sewing Room Progress", "date": "Monday, July 19, 2010", "text": "I've completed 4 bins, without a trip to Joann's or a purchase of any new supplies. Yay me. LOL!Do you see that plaid on the second bin from the left? That came from Fabric.com years ago as a mistake that they told me to just keep. I had about 4 yards of it. So I used it for one front and all of the sides of the bins you don't see, and I still have enough leftovers for 2-3 more sides. I used the rest of my old pink King flat sheet for the inside linings, and pieces from the floral sheet from the prototype for the parts of the top cuff you don't see. I can get 1 face, 1 handle, and 1 cuff face from one fat quarter, which is what I used for the other 3 bins, with scraps to spare.I'll show you the ugly sides another day. For now, I just want you to bask in the pretty. Mwah. ;-)One could also make \"turnable\" bins with this scrappy method — with a different fabric combo on each side. And one can also be cheap like me and use old sheets, cheap muslin, or ugly what-was-I-thinking fabrics. (It was nice, though, to move out 3 large folds of ugly fabric from the stash. I'm actually getting to the point where I can move the overflow folds IN to the fabric closet, which is another project still to do in this makeover.)The cardboard to make the boxes was cut from the IKEA boxes. That's five 12.75\" squares per bin. The label holders are the bottoms of a big bunch of small ziplock baggies that are leftovers from my sparklies/crystal co-op days. (Anyone remember?) I just cut off the tops and stitched them on. I still have about a billion left. ;-)Only one bin is actually labeled at the moment. I'm still deciding what will go where, which is obvious by the huge disarray in the other cubbies, and which means I can't find ANYTHING right now without looking in each cubbie.I've also decided to invest in some spray paint instead of a new bin for every cubbie. First, I think it will just be \"too-too\" with all those fabric-covered bins. Second, I already have a lot of perfectly useful bins that just need a facelift to cover outdated colors and I think a mix of all types throughout the shelves will look better and be more me. Third, sometimes I do actually like to see inside the bin without taking it down. And Fourth — most importantly — I'm cheap and lazy. ;-) But I do still want to make 2 or 3 more of these fabric bins and then I will \"scatter\" them all throughout the shelves for a less uniform look.My four canvas bins like the three shown above will be spray-painted too. They are very dingy right now, but still quite functional. I'm thinking they'll take spray paint in light doses OK and hopefully they won't turn into a soggy mess. But nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?I did take lots of notes while I was making these bins and I do plan on putting together a tutorial at some point in the near future, but I think I'm going to have to use mostly drawings so that the details are easier to see and understand. So, patience please. :-)* * * * *By the way … the Viking 2000 may have taken its sweet time getting here, but it was worth the wait. After oiling, it works perfectly!"},
{"title": "She's Heeeeeeeeeeeere!", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2010", "text": "UPS overnighted (yes, I just verbed an adjective — and now a noun too!) the machine to me so it was here at 10:15 this morning. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the original box or the packaging, so I have no idea what happened to it or what UPS meant by \"repacking\" it. I'm guessing they meant putting a new label on it for overnight service. I'm not going to dwell on it since it there was a happy ending.The machine was dirty, but I knew that. It cleaned up great and has hardly any scratches at all. Just minimal normal wear & tear. It was missing its foot pedal (also expected), but the pedal for my 6010 works just fine and, frankly, it's nice NOT to have an extra pedal shuffling around. Looks like tonight I'll be playing around with all the stitches to see if everything is good. For now, it's been generously oiled and is soaking for a bit.The case looks cleaner in this photo than it actually is, and the latches don't work too well anymore, but what do you want for $26? And am I really planning on lugging this 30+ pound hunk of metal somewhere? I doubt it. With my sewing room makeover in process, the case will probably end up in the attic anyway.Also in the package was a Great Falls, Montana repair tag from 1987 attached to an old needleplate, with this note:\"Needle plate. Adjusted mach & reset needle position. Removed considerable lint. Reset tensions.\"For the grand sum of $38. Don't you just love that \"considerable lint\" comment?Lastly, with the instruction book for the machine were four additional booklets from 1924 from Iowa State College: Meal Planning, Design in Dress, Under Garments, and On the History of Art Needlework. They each have someone related to the original owner's name (per the repair tag) handwritten in the upper right corner. Thank you Anna and Dorothy E. Buchholz. (I'm guessing Dorothy is Anna's mother, but I have no idea!) These ought to be interesting bedtime reading!* * * * *Speaking of the sewing room makeover …I think I've settled on a way to be a cheapskate using my bin cover pattern. I will line them with old sheets or muslin and add a sewn-on \"cuff\" for the contrast. It's a couple more steps, but oh-so-much cheaper. If I was only making 1 or 2, I wouldn't be so thrifty, but I think I want at least 12 and that much cute fabric adds up quickly. If I wanted this to be a $200 project, I would just buy pre-made bins. ;-)So a trip to Joann's with a coupon or two is on the weekend agenda, I think. Hopefully, I can find something that's both suitable and cheap because I won't be able to move forward with any other sewing projects until this is done. Thank you OCD."},
{"title": "Anticipation …", "date": "Thursday, July 15, 2010", "text": "Remember this beauty? Yeah, me too. It was supposed to be here on July 2. Doing the math, that's almost two weeks ago. The seller quickly shipped via UPS and provided me with the tracking number. I watched the tracking info update every day for four days. Finally, it was in Jacksonville (4 hours to the north) and it remained with the July 2 delivery date. But on the morning of July 2 there was no receipt in Tampa notation in the tracking, which still showed it as in Jax. I kept checking the tracking every couple of hours, but no change. And then the calendar flipped over to July 3 and nothing. Still a July 2 delivery date. Sob! I knew something had gone horribly wrong and I was sending out death ray eyeball stares to whichever UPS worker decided they wanted MY machine. OK, just kidding on that last part. Sorta.Then we had the holiday weekend which meant the earliest the seller could file a report with UPS was on Tuesday, July 6. The tracking was then updated to show a tracer request on that date. And there it has sat. And sat. And SAT. The seller kept me updated with the non-news from UPS, so I wasn't faulting her at all. Frankly, I thought she had actually gone above and beyond for a $25 sale but I was glad she was being so proactive. I want this machine!I tried not to give up hope, but each day passing made that harder.This morning, I received a call from UPS. They asked me some address questions, but didn't really tell me anything. I decided that they were only just now *starting* the investigation. And I think I was right, because a couple of hours later the seller emailed me that the machine had been FOUND! She said that UPS will repack it and send it back on its way and that it should be here within 5 days.So the waiting continues. Cross your fingers for me."},
{"title": "Prototype", "date": "Wednesday, July 14, 2010", "text": "I still have a couple of construction tweaks to do and I want to add a handle to make pulling it out of the cubbie easier and maybe a label pocket for the front, but I'm calling the first prototype for storage boxes for the IKEA Expedit shelves a success. And no spray adhesive necessary. Channeling my inner Peter from Male Pattern Boldness, this one is covered with old bedsheets as a \"muslin.\"It fits into the cubbie perfectly, which means my measurements and the pattern are good. Whew, pretty good for a first go at it. If the contrast at the top isn't wanted, assembly can be reversed so that the flap is on the inside and in a matching print so it blends to the lining.But … each bin needs 2 yards of 44\" fabric, which means if you have your heart set on a particular print and it's not on sale, there's really no savings over just buying something pre-made. Of course, if you do have your heart set on a particular print, you'd also never find it as a pre-made bin. And if you can shop the stash, they're free. Right? ;-) Looks like I'll need to shop the online sales or head to Joann's with coupons since the stash isn't holding a bunch of bin fabric at the moment.You'd also have to figure in cardboard if you don't have any. But I saved all the boxes these shelves came in and that will be more than enough. (And since I won't have to put all of that into the trash/recycle bin, that's an added bonus.)This bin can be completely dissembled, which means it can store flat and you can wash the covers if necessary. I don't know if those two qualities will mean anything to me, but since I'm thinking of making a downloadable pattern for these, I thought it might be a plus for someone else.I think the whole thing, from cutting out fabric and cardboard to sewing seams and pressing seam allowances, took about an hour at the most. I was watching the tube as I was doing this (Deadliest Catch - RIP Phil Harris) so I'm being generous with the time estimate. The total time per box should go down if/when I'm in assembly-line mode because the cutting can be stacked when working on multiples."},
{"title": "Sewing Room Makeover - In Progress", "date": "Monday, July 12, 2010", "text": "I didn't take any real \"Before\" shots so all of these are going to show the room in \"During\" disaster mode.In this photo, you can see there is a little table with a machine on it sitting at the end of my cutting table. What you can't see is that next to this little table, there was a Sterlite 3-drawer plastic bin thingie.Both of those are now gone. You can also see the IKEA 4x2 shelf set up in the corner. DH repositioned my mirror, but I still need to re-hang the bulletin board.This is the far wall where my ironing board was set up.The ironing board is currently in limbo. But the two 4x4 units are set up and in position.This corner was a complete mess before.The bookcase holds all my sewing books, BWOFs, and some other magazines. There are also plastic bins and ugly shelves squished together.My TV was sitting on top of a piece of plywood on top of a table missing its glass insert. I had plans to refinish this table, but I hadn't gotten to it yet. The best laid plans …TV table and ugly shelves/bins gone! I've moved in a cabinet from the attic that used to be DH's grandfather's, which DH and I refinished about 20 years ago. I'm thinking of painting it and turning it into an ironing station. The TV has been moved to the top of the IKEA shelves, where I can actually see it now. The tall bookcase has been relocated to my bedroom and the sewing books will again be stored in it. My bedroom is where I read those books anyway so this will actually be more convenient and my bedroom is plenty big enough to take on the bookcase. In fact, I like it a lot in there and have decided that now (as in sometime later) I am going to make a little reading corner in front of its new home.There's still a lot of stuff to put away, rehang, and/or remove, but I'm making progress. The hardest part is deciding on new homes for the stuff. And I will still either make or buy some bins for the cubbies to make some of the utility more decorative. And curtains, which are looooong overdue.Actually, the hardest part will be when we put in new flooring someday. Also looooong overdue. Then I'll have to move everything out, which will mean emptying everything first – including the pattern cabinet. I don't look forward to that, but I'm not going to think about that until I have to.* * * * *Before I started this disaster makeover, I was digging through my pile of Stuff I Want To Do. I found these tapestry panels which I bought years ago (like before we moved into this house!) and had planned to make into deco pillows for my sister. Well, I decided it was finally time. Well, it was either that or admit defeat and toss them.These were pretty simple. Trim the tapestry panel, cut some backing fabric to size, stuff and sew up the stuffing hole. But for this one, I decided to also add some welt cording around the edge. My welt cording foot made easy work of that. Love my presser feet!Because I thought a single layer was going to be too thin, the backs are double-layered with khaki colored linen scraps.This may be the only sewing to come out of this room for a while. You know how it is when you start a room re-do — a million other little \"improvements\" sneak in and take over, and boy do I have plans! We'll see how far I get."},
{"title": "Under Construction", "date": "Saturday, July 10, 2010", "text": "We had a little family outing to IKEA tonight, all four of us. It was DH's first trip to this \"new\" IKEA, which has been open here in Tampa for just over a year now. I can't believe I hadn't dragged him there before now. Neither can he. But he actually enjoyed it. Or he's a very good actor. LOL! My sons (who are still aged 6 and 9 sometimes) wore their Heelies and zoomed all over the place, so they enjoyed it too.First, we stopped in the restaurant for dinner. I'm always impressed by the combination of the goodness and cheapness of the food. I know it's a cafeteria, but it feels more than that. It was 2-for-1 Buffalo chicken wraps tonight so DS#2 chowed down on both. Plus fries. LOL! DH and I had the chicken fingers, and DS#1 had the pasta, meatballs and marinara plus almond cake for dessert. I split chocolate cake with DS#2. Yes, he still had room for cake after those wraps!After dinner, we began our my mission for new shelving for the sewing room. I already knew I wanted Expedit shelving. I know everyone and their dog has these shelves, but there's a reason. They hold a lot of crap, look nice and don't cost a lot. Search \"IKEA Expedit\" on Flickr for some great combinations.Until I saw the shelves in person again, I wasn't sure exactly how many I really wanted. I ended up with two of the 4x4 and one of the 4x2 (cube-y things, not measurements). I had checked the website before leaving and the 4x4's were priced at the \"new lower price\" of $99 each. Except they were marked $129 in the store. A quick conference with a manager and we learned that the new catalog had just come out yesterday and the prices were raised overnight, although still not on the website when I checked upon our return or even now that it's technically two days later. But they still honored the $99 price for me, which was great. I heart IKEA.We also picked up a $7.99 floor lamp for DS#2's room, some 99¢ lint rollers and a bunch of foodstuff from the Bistro section. Yum! Cinnamon buns for breakfast and lox for lunch!Total spent: $298. I heart IKEA.So of course this means my sewing room is a HUGE disaster right now. DS#1 has built two of the units so far; one is moved into the sewing room and the other is in the hallway outside of it. The third is on the floor in my bedroom. I don't like clutter so I'll be very motivated to get this swapping done as soon as possible.I also think I might have to have to spend as much as the cost of one shelf (or more) on some bins to put in the cubbies. But that seems kind of silly to me so before I drop the cash, I'm going to try to work out \"refashioning\" all the cardboard these shelves were packed in into some DIY fabric-covered bins. Box cutter, ruler, packing tape, spray adhesive, fabric — it shouldn't be too difficult. I'll ask DH to pick up the spray adhesive at Home Depot tomorrow when he's getting a quart of paint mixed to cover the holes I'll need to patch when we he moves the mirror and some pictures. A check of the leftover paint we had and we discovered it was dried out. Florida heat kills paint in the garage."},

{"title": "Pattern Organization", "date": "Monday, July 5, 2010", "text": "Sondra asked a couple of posts ago for me to expand on my pattern organization. Her wish is my command. ;-)First, my \"analog\" version. All regular sized pattern envelopes are stored in loose leaf binders, sorted by general category such as tops, dresses, jackets, wardrobe patterns, men's, etc. I love having my \"catalogs\" to browse through while laying on my bed.Until today, those binders were the typical blue plastic type. I don't know why I bought blue except maybe that I already had one and just bought the others to match. I used up more stash scraps by making covers for those binders this afternoon, using the instructions from here, minus the tab closure thingy. (The instructions/measurement guidelines worked out perfectly so I highly recommend them.)Also on top of the cabinet is my basket of \"on deck.\" I don't always make everything that's in this basket. It's more of a \"what has caught my eye lately\" collection and it changes regularly. I also throw new patterns in here until I get them into my system. (The basket was more than overflowing with un-systemized patterns until my organization frenzy last night, which tells you how behind I was.)Finally in this mix, there's often a stack of stuff printed from the internet. Again, I don't always actually DO them, but I like to dream. ;-) The top of this cabinet is unusually clean today since I was taking photos. I stuck the Featherweight on top for more visual interest.All of my actual pattern tissues and instructions are separated from the envelopes and stored in my pattern cabinet in Pattern Keeper ziplocks I buy from Nancy's Notions. I hope to paint this pattern cabinet one day soon. I'm really tired of the boring beige. (I'm also really tired of my sewing room non-decor/layout in general so look for me to be documenting changes over the next couple of months.) I recycle the backs of papers to make pattern number sheets and file the patterns by company and then by number. There is a pocket on the outside of the pattern ziplock for this number sheet. I also stick the instructions behind the number sheet so I can quickly grab them when I want to check something.The tissue is inside the ziplock section of the bag. It's a lot easier to put tissue and tracings back inside these bigger bags than inside a pattern envelope.My oversized patterns, such as Jalie and HotPatterns, are stored flat in their own drawer in the cabinet. This part of the system needs an update, but right now it's working.Burda magazine pattern inserts are in their own drawer. I haven't subscribed to Burda WOF/BS for a while now so this drawer hasn't changed much but there are at least 5 years worth of pattern inserts here with plenty of room for more. The actual magazines, along with others such as Ottobre and Knip Mode, are stored on a shelf on my bookcase.I still have one empty drawer in the cabinet, but it's blocked anyway at the moment by the dog bed which you can sort of see below the drawer.To prevent me from buying duplicates of patterns I already own, I also keep a digital list of my patterns and magazine issues. I use ListPro for this. It will sync with a Palm or other handheld device so you can carry your list to the store if needed. This is good for keeping a running Wish List too, since as long as you sync with the desktop, you'll always have your Wish List with you. Or, you can just print it too. I'm sure there are other apps available now, but I've been using this one for a number of years and haven't felt a need to change.With ListPro, I created a custom list that separates patterns by company and then by pattern number. I can enter garment type, size info, notes, whether I've made it or not, and other info. Lately though, I really only enter the number but that and my loose leaf binders are enough for me to know what I have, and it works for me.In addition to my pattern list and the usual lists such as grocery and to-do, I also have lists for things such as directions to far-away fabric stores that I don't frequent often, measurement conversions, Superbowl stats, state capitols and facts, Presidents, and all sorts of weird stuff like that. It's fun, in an OCD kind of way. ;-)"},
{"title": "Banking the Mom Points", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2010", "text": "Happy 4th to my American readers. It was rainy here all day, which meant I could spend the day in the sewing room guilt-free. For dinner we (the menfolk) grilled steaks, salmon and broccoli. After dinner my sons lit off a few bombs fireworks in the yard in between raindrops. It was just the low-key kind of day I like.Yesterday, I finished up the string quilting table runner for my mom. A few days late for the official challenge but who's counting. And mom will certainly be surprised when the package arrives at her house in a week or so.Today I made 6 coordinating double-sided napkins and 6 coasters.You would think that I would have made a dent in the scraps stash, but I can hardly tell anything is missing. Even worse, I added to it with the purchase of the backing fabric for the runner and the napkins. Sound familar?These string blocks come together quickly so I'm thinking in the near (and far) future I'll work on additional blocks a little at a time to someday and eventually make into a more random and bigger scrappy quilt. No time limit. Just a casual plan for all those strips and larger scraps I have tucked into a bin.Next, I've got to work on organizing my newest patterns. Anything I've bought in the last 6 months is still waiting to be added to my database and binders. I was sort of holding off because I needed a third binder and always forgot to get one. But I finally remembered and now I have no more excuses. Plus, the stacks of patterns are driving me NUTS. I'll stay up late doing this while watching TV tonight and then tomorrow the sewing room will be clean and fresh for whatever is next."},

It's a Viking 2000 and pretty much a mechanical duplicate of its younger sister, my Viking 6010. But look at that lovely green metallic. How could I resist?It doesn't have a foot pedal (my 6010's will fit) and I have no idea if it even really works. But for $25.85 plus shipping, it can just sit on a shelf and look pretty and I will be OK with that. It does match the walls and will make a lovely \"accessory.\" Although I have a sneaking suspicion that it will work fine. These machines are tanks, after all, and this one looks fairly pristine.Of course, I do need to get that shelf to house and display my little growing herd.

Hah! I should have known better.Well, at least I started, right? I may even finish the piecing before the deadline, but I don't think it's looking very good for me to finish the machine quilting by then. (But maybe if Stephanie at Loft Creations is reading, she'll consider my procrastinator's plea to extend for one more weekend so I can have the holiday weekend to finish it. I wonder if she accepts bribes?)It's going to be a table runner for my mom, using scraps from various projects I've done for her in the past, plus a few other prints I've had kicking around. I plan to make 4 more blocks, trim all from 7\" to 6\", find a border/backing print locally, and also buy enough to back more 2-sided napkins I'll cut fronts from using some of the prints in the blocks. Mom keeps raving about the runner and napkins I made/sent her in December which is her way of asking me to make more.I'm not sure how much I like it so far because these aren't color/print combinations I'd normally choose for something in my house, but I think mom will like it. And I think I'll like it better once a border print is included and I re-arrange the blocks. Right now, it's a little messy — which is the point of string piecing, I suppose. But more than messy, it's looking *too* symmetrical in some places for my eyes so I need to shuffle the blocks.The piecing itself goes quickly (click on the link above for instructions), and it gave me a chance to dust off the Featherweight, which I just love for piecing (big quilt piecer that I am LOL!). And it is a great way to use up those scraps I've been accumulating. Plus I'll earn \"daughter points\" when mom receives it totally unexpected. Always good to have those in reserve."},

Then we got Dani and she liked to nibble little holes into the edges, and even in the middle. Bad dog! I patched them and decided to wait out the puppy phase beforel changing to a non-holey quilt. Then I found the same quilt again on sale (JC Penny) and bought two more. Yes, two. I'm planning for the worst.That left me two good quilts and one holey mess. I also still had the big throw pillows from our last bedding set. So, I put the two together — making new envelope shams (for ease in removing for washing) from the old quilt and stuffing them with the old pillow forms. And, voila! Pillows for Dani to nibble on. NOT! Although I think I do see a certain gleam in her eye, don't you?Maybe one of these days we'll paint this room, hang curtains and put in a floor. Sigh. Kind of depressing to look back at the old house and see how *finished* my last bedroom was vs. what an ungodly disaster the current one is. But then priorities and available time have changed a lot since then too. No one ever died or anything sleeping in an ugly bedroom, right? ;-)In the meantime, I have a dog bed duvet to stitch up from the rest of this quilt, which I'll go do right now since everything is cut, ready, and waiting and then I can really scratch this quilt remake project off my list.The \"boys\" are manning the grill for Father's Day dinner so I'm completely off kitchen duty tonight, which means more sewing room time.

Can't exactly wear it like that. ;-)But as of 10 minutes ago, I had a complete top.It was actually done about an hour ago but I kept looking at it, thinking it needed *something.* So I cut a strip, gathered it, and pinned it around the neckband to see if I liked it. I did, so I stitched it down. Raw edges, 5 minutes, done.My white capris are fresh out of the dryer and waiting. I have a number of errands to run tomorrow and it will be nice to wear something new while I'm out and about.Not much sewing going on at the moment, although I do have a top in progress using the same Butterick pattern as the Graduation Dress. I hope to get that finished tonight.Speaking of the graduation …One last mention and a link to the video DS#1 put together and uploaded to YouTube. If you click on the photo below, you should be taken right to it. (The final grad pics order hasn't arrived yet, so I \"swiped\" the proof in the meantime.)There are no photos of the family because the two that DS did take are just plain horrible of everyone, but you can hear my \"Whoop!\" when Alex's name is announced. LOL!"},
{"title": "Sigh of Relief", "date": "Monday, June 7, 2010", "text": "Graduation is over and done. Whew! It went great, despite the huge crowd (graduating class of 550+) and oppressively hot and humid weather. Summer is definitely here in West Central Florida. Ugh. ;-) I'm trying to remember freezing my arse off in January so I can appreciate this heat better.I'm not sure what we have for photos yet since DS#1 was in charge and what he took is still in his camera. Unfortunately, once we got outside with The Grad, it was far too crowded and hot to stand around and take photos so we departed fairly quickly.In other news, DS#1, the Marine-to-be, passed his ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery) today with flying colors. We've spent a lot of time studying together over the last couple of weeks and it was well worth it. Well, except for that part about revisiting high school algebra. ;-)Belinda, this photo is for you. My new orange sandals. Ta Da! They are a little fancier than my \"every day\" shoes/flip flops because of the metallic (gold) trim, but they fit into daily Florida life perfectly. And with my red hair/Autumn coloring, yellow/bronze metals are best on me, so I was happy with the gold instead of silver which is more popular lately. I think they have a slight gladiator & 1970s thing going on, but not so much as to be too young or trendy for my middle-aged self, and hopefully not too old/retiree either. ;-) Being only 1\" high and cushioned, they are very comfortable, which is usually near the top of my new shoes requirements these days. And for a bonus, they also go with at least 2-3 more tops I already own.ETA: Here's the Zappos link if you want to buy a pair in orange and/or the other color options."},
{"title": "In the Nick of Time", "date": "Friday, June 4, 2010", "text": "Looks like I won't be naked at the graduation. ;-) Here's the finished dress (B5488). And I was in bed by 1 AM (usual time for me).Overall, I'm happy with it. I'm not 100% thrilled with the repeat of the large motif down my center front but that's a fabric issue that I had no control over so I'll live with it. If *I* had been designing the fabric, I would've spread out those large flowers more. But no one asked me. ;-)It's very bright, isn't it? (That's bright orange in case your monitor is reading it as red). I'm planning to wear some orange sandals with it. That is, IF the UPS man delivers them before we leave. The tracking says they're out for delivery so fingers crossed. Yes, I procrastinated on ordering my shoes too. ;-) If they don't make it or don't fit, I'll wear either white or black sandals I already have. UPDATE 10:15 AM: They're here and they fit!I used a coordinating print for the neckband and I also added sleeve and hem bands using this same print. I didn't want the neckband to get entirely lost in the print and I think this slight contrast works well.As I mentioned earlier, for the muslin I did not make any alterations to the pattern other than blending to a larger bottom-half size. For the final dress, I tweaked the neckband by pinching out a very small \"dart\" on both the front and back pattern pieces, to tighten up the neck opening without affecting the seam where the pieces attach to the dress body. I knew this tiny alteration would stop me from fiddling with the neckline all night.After evaluating the muslin, I decided I would sew the top seam of the raglan sleeves with a smaller seam allowance near the edge to give me a little more bicep room. Instead, for the final dress I just added that little bit on in fabric when I cut the pattern. Same affect but without the need to remember to sew a different seam allowance. One less thing to remember when you're sewing to a deadline is a Good Thing. Don't ask me about forgetting to cut the back On Fold so now I have a useless and pretty much invisible CB seam. ;-)I ended up adding 6 inches in length to the bottom of the dress, some of that extra length is the 3\" hem band. I added 1-1/2\" to the sleeve pattern pieces and also added a 1-1/2\" hem band, for a total of about 2\" additional length on the sleeves after subtracting seam allowances.Here's what my sewing table looked like when I finished last night (and still looks like now). Not too bad, right? Lots of other crap I need to put away, though, that is entirely unrelated to this dress. And I see my Stars & Stripes project peeking out from under the muslin bolt on the left. Poor neglected quilt. But I have a dress to wear!"},

I've had time every afternoon and evening since to work on my dress. Have I? No. Not until today. The Last Day.I'm pretty sure I'll get it done tonight. It's cut out and I've basted the pleats. The only other \"hard\" (not really) part is the neckband (already interfaced) and after that it's just straight seams and a few hems. Even if the power goes out, I can sew by candlelight on the treadle. But why did I wait? Why do some people (me!!) enjoy working under pressure? I mean, I must, right? Since I do this all the time.But is it really procrastination if you do get the whatever done on time? Or is there another term that fits better? I don't think I ever procrastinate past a deadline and miss it. Maybe in a warped inverse sort of way, I just have excellent organizational and time management skills. Stop laughing. ;-)Just thoughts.Back up to the sewing room now."},
{"title": "I May Have a New Dress In Time After All", "date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "text": "I have finally managed to cut and sew the muslin for Butterick 5488, the dress I'm planning to sew and wear to DS#2's high school graduation on Friday. Yes, *this* Friday. Have I mentioned that I procrastinate?The Good News: It fits. The photo above is the dress straight out of the envelope. Well, sort of. I did blend from the L (16-18) to the XL (24-26) as I cut out the tissue. My \"cheater FBA,\" if you will. But no other alterations were done. As you can see, no additional FBA is needed. It fits around and over the girls great. The only \"alterations\" I will make to this pattern for the real dress is to add length to the body and to the sleeves. What you're seeing right now are the unhemmed lengths per the envelope and they are bordering on too short for my preference. Those are hardly alterations though. I may also sew with a slightly smaller seam allowance on the top sleeve seam just to give me a skootch bit more bicep room. Again, hardly an alteration since I don't have to do anything to the tissue for that.In the photo above if you look closely, you can see that I've just pinned the sideseams, and very messily at that. I actually sewed the sleeves and underarms down to about bust level and left the rest of the sideseams unsewn in case I needed more room. My ugly pin job tells me it's fine with the 5/8\" seam allowance. Which means — there is a LOT of ease in this pattern, so be warned. My butt needs the ease so it's all good for me. Your butt may, and probably does, vary. ;-)I'm thrilled because this means I should have enough time to get the real thing made by Friday afternoon — as long as my fabric shows up by Thursday (it's scheduled for delivery tomorrow, which would rock!). If not, I'll have to go to a Plan B from the closet.Now please understand, this is just a muslin in the most horrible poly knit I had kicking around in the stash. The color and that much light-colored solid does nothing for me. But I'm not planning to wear it anywhere and it will hit the trash as soon as the real dress is finished. It won't even be a nightie because the knit is way too hot and thick. Here's a better view of the front and back:The pattern has an UNshaped CB seam for the body of the dress. I left it off for my muslin and just cut on fold. I may add the seam back in for a slight \"sway back\" type adjustment, but that may be me just overthinking. I'm happy the way it is and if I leave out that seam, I won't have to worry about the print landing funky on either side of it. Hmmm. I think I've just talked myself back out of the seam. ;-) Because this dress has so much ease, I can't imagine what Butterick was thinking when they added it, which is why I left it out to begin with. Butterick should really ask me about these things first. ;-) LOL!I think this dress, shortened, will also make a cute tee. Very similar to my beloved HP Sunshine top, but a little different so that not every single top in my summer wardrobe is one of three patterns.* * * * *Thank you everyone for your supportive comments for me and my soon-to-be Marine son.

He won't actually leave for boot camp for 5-6 months, but the thought of him (1) leaving home and (2) possibly being deployed at some too-near date has me choked up — and I don't usually get choked up often. We're very proud, but I'm a basket case.This has been something he's wanted to do for a while now, but I think *my* misgivings is what kept him on the fence for so long. He did look at other branches of the military at my and DH's urging, but the Marines was always first choice.This past Tuesday, I finally relented and went to the Recruitment office with him, where we spent nearly 4 hours talking with the Recruiters and asking lots of questions.I decided I really couldn't stand in his way anymore, so I let him know that I would sincerely support whatever decision he made. Sniffle, sniffle. My baby is a full-grown man. More sniffles.My second baby, DS#2, is playing out his very last day of high school today. And I do mean \"playing,\" as he finished all of his finals yesterday and really had no reason to be there today except to goof off, be counted on the attendance rolls, and say his goodbyes.I can't believe how fast all the school years flew by for my two sons. Be thankful for every day is all I can say! And we have been. I'm sure the future holds new exciting times, but I need to get through these big changes first.* * * * *In sewing news, and I use that term lightly, not much going on. I did cut out and flat-measure the pattern. I've got an icky knit ready for the muslin. And I did make the \"sacrifice\" of buying a new piece of fabric (OK, four pieces!) that will actually be long enough for this dress. Now all I have to do is start sewing. I hope to get a jump on that this afternoon and then finish up the muslin tomorrow. Then I have to wait on the fabric, which is supposed to arrive Tuesday. Then sew like the wind so I have a dress to wear to the graduation Friday night."},
{"title": "Grumpy Monday", "date": "Monday, May 24, 2010", "text": "Yeah, I'm grumpy. I didn't do any sewing this weekend, even though I intended to. It's not like I didn't RUSH to buy patterns. It's not like I don't have a graduation to attend in less than two weeks.So, what's the problem? Hormones. And a book. The hormones will work themselves out in a day or two. As to the book — DS brought home My Sister's Keeper on Friday, a book he read for school and about which we'd had a few conversations during his read. The book had to be back today as the school is gearing down the year and collecting its property. No book, no graduation. And 450+ pages in less than 24 hours = no sewing, hence the grumpy.Interesting book. Strange, and I think disappointing, ending. I've got the movie now queued up for the DVR to record mid-week. We'll probably watch it together and compare with the book. I'm prepared to be disappointed since I always am with books to movies.The other thing I'm grumpy about is that the fabric I thought I was using for the dress? Well, I don't have enough. So I've got to find something else. I will work on it during the week, at least to get a muslin together. I might aim for a \"wearable\" muslin as a nightgown if I can decide on a fabric for that. Otherwise, just an icky knit to quickly check the fit."},

I knew there would be a sale soon enough.But back to the Ottobre tee — Basically the same gathered front tee as always, with a neckband instead of a bound neckline, and I added a couple of fabric roses to liven it up. They blend into the print in the photo, but they show nicely in real life. My coverstitch machine was happy to be back at work.

My son graduates high school early next month and I thought this would be a nice dress to wear to that (remember, we're pretty casual here in Florida) and then wear the rest of the summer. Maybe even sew/buy a cardi to wear with it in the A/C. Cute new sandals/thongs, and I'd be set. I was even going to pay full price for it so I could start this weekend. Well, not really full price since Buttericks are 50% off all the time at J's, but still …You know where this is going, right?Yeah. Joann's didn't have it, or any of the new Buttericks, or the new Butterick catalog. Sheesh, they only had one old Butterick catalog total. But there were plenty of McCall's, Vogues, Simplicities, and even a couple of Burdas.Now what am I going to do this weekend??C'mon Club BMV sale.

Until I found out that a medium has nearly SIX HUNDRED calories per serving. Yikes. Apparently the Golden Arches is taking (or giving?) nutrition lessons from Starbucks. I should've known. Actually, I strongly suspected. But I was taking a boat trip down The Nile. ;-)Off to the grocery store and home with instant coffee, low-cal non-fat spray whipped \"cream,\" and into the fridge and/or pantry for 1% milk, Splenda, caramel syrup, and ice.A trip through the food processor (because just after I poured everything into the blender, I found out it was broken - SOB!) and voila! Low-cal, low-fat Frappés!Pardon the crappy/frappé (hee hee) very yellow phone cam pic. But YUM! It tastes nearly identical to me and saves a trip to the drive-thru, not to mention about 450 calories.Approximate measures because I do this stuff by \"feel.\"1 cup 1% milk2 tsp instant coffee1 tsp caramel syrup2-3 packets Splenda (depending on desired sweetness)ice, lotsspray whipped topping (or real cream if desired)2 tsp caramel syrup (separate from first listing above)Put first 4 ingredients into blender and fill remaining space with ice. Grind away until smooth consistency, adding more ice if necessary. Pour into glass leaving about 1/2\" of space to the rim. Spray in whipped topping. Drizzle caramel over top. Yields 3-4 servings.Now I need a new blender to more finely crush the ice and I'll be set for the summer.I'm still working on the blog update, lots of stuff to move over from my website, but that was getting tedious so instead last night I finished these shorts I had started for DS#2 and then zoned in front of the tube.The facial expression is typical of a teenager just out of the shower at 6:30 AM and on his way to school. His hands rammed down in the pockets don't help show how these shorts actually fit. I also told him a navy tee would look good so he picks a green one. But, what do you want at 6:30 AM from said teenager? ;-)I did not plan the symmetry of the stripes on each body half. It just happened. But I did plan asymmetry on various other parts like the pockets, waistband, etc., because I was not going to be able to match the side cargo pockets to both sides of the legs so I went with the mismatching as a \"design feature.\" It's actually harder to *not* match sometimes.They are \"pirate shorts\" because before I hemmed them, they came way below his knee and with the stripes, raw edge, and bare feet, he decided they looked like, well, pirate shorts. The fabric is from Gorgeous Fabrics. It's denim with heavy sizing applied, but after prewashing it's actually *very* lightweight denim so these shorts may not last past summer with the wear and tear DS#2 typically inflicts upon his pants. Oh well. At least it's a sizable pile out of the stash closet since there was no way I was going to wear these stripes.With his hands still in his pockets, the back view isn't much better. They really do fit fine, just not when they're being pulled up and to the front. And yes, all these years and I still do not have a kitchen floor.This is the same pattern I used for those pants that I cut off into shorts the other day (which I still haven't taken a pic of). I've gotten good use from it, but I'd really like a different pattern for him for a change of pace. Trying to find fashionable (and I use that term loosely) patterns for teens/young adults who wear mens' sizes is even more difficult than trying to find fashionable mens' patterns at all. What is wrong with these pattern companies? Aren't they following Peter or Brian? Or me??Enough kvetching. Here's a flat view of the back:The pocket patch is a label that came as a hang-tag on some RTW. I stashed it away for just this purpose, and zig-zagged it onto the pocket.Here's one of the side cargo pockets, with double snap closure. Topstitching was done on the Viking 6010, with true Gutermann topstitching thread. IOW, heavy stuff. Since this color was only available in (expensive) small spools, I used regular sewing thread in the bobbin for economy. The stitches look a little wonky (sorry Peter) along the edge of the pleat but in real life they're fine. The photo resizing wasn't kind to all of the striping pixels.I copied a pair of RTW shorts for these \"lazy\" belt loops. They are folded under at the top edge of the waistband and left with the raw edge exposed on the lower edge, then straight-stitched back and forth a few times, going past the loop itself, to anchor each end in place. The \"deconstructed\" look sure is a timesaver. ;-)The other thing you can't see is that I added an inside drawstring, with two inside buttonholes into the waistband. Again, stolen from the RTW shorts. DS#2 likes the adjustability factor for when denim stretches during the day.All in all, a successful project. Arggg, matey!"},

{"title": "Monday Again?", "date": "Monday, May 3, 2010", "text": "I'm so not ready for it to be Monday. The weekend flew by and I didn't spend very much of it in the sewing room. We rented a chainsaw on Friday so that we'd have two for the weekend and the guys could do double-time cutting up the fallen tree. I supervised. ;-) What that really means is that I was outside supervising the dogs while the men worked.That chore is mostly done. There's still a big \"stump\" (not in the ground) that will need to get towed out, but that will be next weekend. Even though the guys wanted to do that right away, I reminded them that attaching the straps to the trunk and then to the truck won't cost us a rental fee and to use the rented chainsaw to the fullest instead of spending time on the trunk. See, I supervised. What would they do without me? LOL!Saturday night with all those logs meant a big bonfire. DS#2 had a bunch of friends over and they burned up at least half of that tree. The fire is still going. Who says green wood doesn't burn? ;-)Sunday I did spend some time in the sewing room, but it was mending a pair of DS's much-loved shorts, which really need to be tossed but instead I keep patching them up. It makes him happy and saves me buying another pair just yet.I also dug out a stand-by project. A few years ago (2006!!), I made DS#2 these jeans:He wore them a lot, until he grew taller and they were too short. I offered to cut them off into shorts but he thought they wouldn't work as shorts. Don't ask. I knew better, but I didn't argue, and set them aside. With the other pair of shorts in the sewing room to be fixed, I decided to pull out those jeans and compare waist sizing. Surprisingly, it seemed that the old jeans would still fit his waist. I measured the inseams on the shorts and cut the jeans legs off. And then, before I expended further energy and thread, I called DS into the sewing room to try on the cut-offs. He agreed that they would actually work as shorts (finally!) and was as surprised as me that they still fit around him. He's obviously grown up but not out. Wish I could say the same. Ahem. Anyway …DS also mentioned that he really likes his shorts to have side pockets. It must run in the family because I love side pockets on my capris. I looked at the cut-off leg pieces on the cutting table and decided that I could squeeze some pockets out of them. I use the sideseam topstitching as a \"design feature\" and cut the pockets so that stitching would run down the middle and line up with sideseams on the now-shorts.Apparently, they were a hit. He wore them out to dinner last night and also to school this morning. I didn't get a pic yet, but I'll make him pose when he gets home and update later.And, speaking of capris … Mine are nearly done. Have been for a week. But I wanted to run them through the washer/dryer before committing to buttons/buttonholes in the waistband because they felt a little loose and stretched out. I'm thinking they really need to be taken in at the waist (sigh) but I'm not sure if I'm up for removing and redoing all the topstitching/serging to do it properly. I may just cheat and run some elastic through the back waistband facing. I haven't tried them on again since they came out of the dryer. Maybe it will have been a miracle laundry load. Yeah, right.Next up on the list will be another pair of shorts for DS. While he was in the sewing room he spotted the striped fabric he wanted me to make shorts from a while ago and gave me The Pleading Look that I can't resist. But now that I know the pattern still fits and I won't have to trace it again, these will be an easy make. Especially now that I have a topstitching station, which worked great BTW when re-making DS's jeans into shorts. I had used actual jeans topstitching thread on those and that stuff was a PITA on my D1, but a dream on the 6010. Woot!Wow. That was chatty for a Monday, wasn't it? ;-) Have a good week everyone.

(Even if you're already linked in my sidebar, please leave a separate comment so it's easier for me to make up this new list.)I'll create a new sidebar item on my blog (near the top!) with the names of and links to these blogs and will keep it updated as I find more blogs to add.Thanks everyone!

I think I may be putting it all onto a new blog instead of my own website, but I'm still thinking on that and there just aren't enough hours in the day to get it done as quickly as I want.Also unrelated - the TNT capris are nearly done. What's left is some topstitching, a closure, and hems. (Maybe tonight?) We had whopper t-storms start up Sunday night so I needed to turn off equipment and didn't get to finish. We ended up losing power for a couple of hours, but thankfully it was bedtime and we hardly noticed. Yay for wind-up alarm clocks! We also lost a big tree, which is now horizontal in the side yard, and lots of big branches are strewn all over the rest of the property.

{"title": "Miscellaneous Thoughts", "date": "Sunday, April 25, 2010", "text": "I'm working on the altered TNT capris and hope to have them finished later tonight. In the meantime, I'm taking a little break and thought I'd share some photos and ramblings about the process.The white pattern is my TNT. The brown tissue is the CC \"jeans.\" Look at that front crotch curve. It's huge. And look at how far downward it slopes. Jeans don't look like that.If they do, you end up with socks in the crotch, like this (which really isn't showing you how truly bad it is because I have them pulled up really high):Here's the CC back pocket, over mine. Mine has 1/2\" seam allowances, the CC has 5/8\" so there's even more of a difference than first seems. Ladies with large patooties are not flattered by skinny little pockets on their backsides. It only points out how much \"space\" there is on either side of the skinny pocket. All pattern pieces need to be in scale to body wearing them — it's not one-size-fits-all.Here's the back yoke piece. Odd, isn't it? On pants with a back yoke, you wouldn't just add to the center/top of the yoke like this to get extra length to cover a larger backside. When drafting a pattern, you would add the extra length to a typical darted pants block and then create the yoke so you can have jeans that look like everyone else's, instead of this weirdness. You'd alter an existing pattern the same way too (below the yoke).So after my fuming about this stupid pattern wore off, I altered my TNT for more tummy room, which is the only place I needed to adjust it. But instead of tracing off the whole front pattern, I just traced the upper section and attached it to the TNT. This gives me a \"fold down\" piece which keeps the original pattern intact, but incorporates the new spread for tummy room. The spread also keeps the sideseams intact so they still match the back in shape/length. Genius, eh? Nah, it's just the cheap and easy way. ;-)Here's the \"herd\" in action. I can't tell you how absolutely luxurious it is to have a dedicated topstitching machine - the Viking 6010. It's as good as the dedicated coverstitch machine peeking out on the right. Once I get a new longer table/countertop so I can spread out more, it will be even more decadent. Oh, and $23 is what I ended up paying for this machine after the seller compensated for the shipping damage. That's almost free!Can't you see the family resemblance with her next to her big sisters? ;-)Here's a couple samples of the real topstitching in action (vs. the samples I showed earlier).Now back to the sewing room!"},
{"title": "Do I Ever Learn?", "date": "Saturday, April 24, 2010", "text": "The answer is, so far No!Let me explain.I wear pretty much 2 styles of pants. One, zipper fly-front jeans/capris. Two, semi- or fully elasticated pants/capris. That's it.I have TNT patterns for each of these basic shapes, which I have tweaked and/or changed now and then to incorporate a few style change-ups like a back waist yoke, different pockets, and different hem widths. I spent a good amount of time over the years getting these patterns to TNT status. They are golden.No new pants/jeans pattern has ever worked without altering the pattern to end up just like … wait for it … my TNT patterns. Some, like my recent success with the Hot Patterns Marrakesh pants, need fewer alterations to get there. But they ALL do need alterations. And they all end up as the same basic pattern.So, WHY DO I KEEP TRYING NEW PANTS PATTERNS? Grrrr. ;-)Well, part of my stubbornness is that I've gained a few pounds and my \"old\" jeans don't quite fit anymore and, hey, don't we all keep hoping that This One Will Be It - pants that fit with no alterations?  Yeah. Well. Not gonna happen. Not for this girl anyway.So, I'm punting on the Connie Crawford jeans and going back to one of my TNT patterns, tracing it and then slash/spreading to add more tummy room. Because that's really the only place that doesn't fit at the moment on my TNT jeans.Besides, the CC jeans are just plain weird and the more I tried on the muslin and thought about what to do with it, the more frustrated I was getting.First, there is a HUGE amount of ease in this pattern, so I would need to go down one, probably two sizes and start over. Seriously, I had to sew out over FOUR INCHES at the CB. That's not a \"slight\" adjustment.Next, the back yoke is strange. The \"point\" of it hits *very* low (think \"crack\" of dawn here) and it's curvy (much curvier than the line drawing), which just makes my hip fluff look curvy in the wrong way. Neither of these would be a show-stopper because I don't tuck in, but they're still issues of weirdness.Next, the front crotch curve is all wrong for me, and probably anyone else who is expecting, well, jeans from a jeans pattern. It's about 3-4\" longer (wider) than my TNT pattern, and not a jeans crotch curve at all. I want my jeans to fit snug around the hips and tummy and to help \"suck in\" the gut, not make me look like I'm carrying a load of socks down there. (If you look at the plus size model on the Butterick site with this in mind, you'll see what I mean, except on me it was even worse.)Finally, the legs are just too wide in the thigh area, which with my very full thighs tells you just how much ease there is in these. There is no way the model photograph of this pattern is from jeans sewn straight from the pattern. There is either some sneaky pinning/clamping (or Photoshopping) going on or the pattern was altered before it was sewn, to which I cry Foul!So, I'm scrapping the time I wasted spent with this pattern and will begin tracing my TNT Simp 4068 as soon as I post this. Hopefully I will stay focused and at least get to the point of having the fabric cut so I can sew all day tomorrow."},
{"title": "Review: Viking 6010 Sewing Machine", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "Price Paid: US $46 (Ebay)Features:* Built-in ZZ and triple ZZ* Embroidery Stitches (with cams)* Free Arm* Adjustable Stitch Length and Width* Adjustable Presser Foot Pressure* Non self-oiling* Reduction (Low) Gear* & More (read below)Likes:My favorites include the low gear setting, the interchangeable snap-on presser feet, and the overall familiar feeling of the machine - me being a Viking girl nearly my whole life. The best feature for me is the ability to use heavy topstitching thread both through the needle and the bobbin, for topstitching jeans and other heavy materials with perfectly matching threads and stitches.Other features are detailed below.BackgroundMy mom had (still has) a Viking 6430 that she bought new in 1971. That was the machine I learned to sew on, even though I did very little sewing until I was in my late-30s. When the sewing bug finally bit and I went new machine shopping a few years ago, I headed straight for the Vikings and wound up with a Rose and then later sold that and bought a Designer 1. The D1 is my current go-to machine.Last year, the vintage machine bug bit and I bought a Singer 66 treadle and a Featherweight. The bug has still been biting though and I thought it would be fun to find a machine like mom's. These old machines are great to sew on, wonderful to look at in my sewing room, and just plain addicting to collect.I decided to do some reading and research on the Viking 6000 series machines before plunking down any cash and learned that it was quite common for the permanently lubed, self-oiling models (from the 6030 onward) to \"freeze/seize\" since the original lubrication materials would harden if the machine had been left unused and unserviced for long periods of time. There are plenty of reconditioned series 6000 machines available that have been torn down, cleaned and relubed with more modern materials but they were probably going to be out of my price range for what I had decided I would be willing to spend. But worse, there are even more machines that look beautiful on the outside but have *not* been reconditioned and do have usage problems. I didn't want to end up with one of those.However, I also learned that the 6010/6020 models were the last two TOL (top of the line) Viking models before the self-oiling feature was introduced, which means the freezing/seizing problem would not be an issue. A 6010 or 6020 would also be a darn-close match to mom's 6430 in both features and looks. Of course, there are still potential age/wear problems with any vintage sewing machine so you do have to be careful and/or lucky when shopping. I bought the machine via Ebay and I was lucky. ;-) It did incur minor cosmetic damage during shipping, which was unfortunate because it would have been cosmetically perfect otherwise. The seller offered to take back the machine or refund me half of the purchase price. I chose the latter. So for $23 plus a reasonable shipping charge, I can definitely overlook the few blemishes. I did have to spend about an hour cleaning her up. You should have seen the huge wad of lint jammed into the bobbin area!Features DetailedAdjustable Stitch Width - up to 4 mm, with micro-reductions available between whole numbersAdjustable Stitch Length - up to 4 mm, with micro-reductions available between whole numbersAdjustable Foot Pressure - Inside the hinged side plate, there is a numbered dial for adjusting foot pressure, which means you always know where you started/ended and can easily go back to a precise setting.Instant Foot Pressure Release - In addition to the dial for adjusting foot pressure, there is also a red-tipped lever to instantly release all foot pressure.Quick Drop Feed Dogs Button - Engaging the button on the front of the machine will quickly drop the feed dogs. Releasing the button raises them again.Snap-On Presser Feet - One of my favorite Viking features. My Designer 1 feet also fit on the 6010, which is great because my 6010 did not come with all of the feet included with the machine when new. The machine will also use standard low-shank presser feet.Reduction (Low) Gear setting - A great feature, and one for which the series 6000 machines are \"famous.\" The reduction gear allows you to use the machine's full power, but at a lower speed for sewing heavy materials such as thick denim, leather, etc. I tested it with eight layers of heavy denim and various stitches. It works extremely well.Reverse - The Reverse button is located on the front of machine in the center of the stitch length knob.Built-in Stitches - Straight, zigzag, 3-step zigzagCams - Called \"stitch formers,\" the 6010 came with 4 cams (4 stitches per cam) for additional utility and decorative stitches. All series 6000 cams will work with all series 6000 machines, which means the 7 additional cams which were introduced with later models will work with the 6010 - if you can source them. Note that the cams have 3 \"prongs\" on the reverse side. If any of these prongs is cracked or missing, the cam will not work.Narrow Free Arm - Viking free arms are noted for being some of the narrowest available on home machines, which is handy for those sewing children's clothes.Thread cutter - Integrated thread cutter on the back of the presser bar.Extension Table - The included enameled metal extension table fits into the machine with a lip and retractable catch. It can be kept in place and moved upward to access the bobbin area.Oiling Points - The oiling points are clearly marked on the machine exterior and/or in the manual for the oiling points inside the side plate. No gymnastics or semi-disassembly required.Four-step Buttonhole - There is a special tension setting/mark for buttonholes, and each leg and bartack of the buttonhole is a setting on a dial so you just sequence through each as you go.Front Loading Bobbin - Metal bobbins inside a metal bobbin case are loaded at the front of the machine, behind a little door which easily flips open even with the extension table in place.Bobbin Winder - Bobbin winding is easy, with the separate spindle and winding area at the rear/side of the machine. Although not technically a \"through-the-needle\" bobbin winder, I believe one could wind a bobbin without unthreading the needle. I'll have to remember to try it! But since this machine is so easy to thread, it's not really a big deal either way.Lighting - There is a bright incandescent light on the arm of the machine with an on/off switch. The light (inside the lamp guard) can be swung downward for close-up work.On/Off Switch - There is none. You must unplug the machine to turn it off.Carrying Case - The 6010 comes with a hardshell plastic case. (My mother's 6430 comes with a \"suitcase\" which I prefer.) Unfortunately, the carrying case for my machine was damaged during shipping. I'm not too upset as I don't plan on transporting this machine.Accessory Tray - An accessory box which fits around the free arm and holds 6 bobbins, the stitchformer/cams, presser feet and other accessories/tools is standard with the 6010. My \"pre-owned\" machine did not come with its accessory case. It's easy enough to use another plastic box for the accessories.Foot pedal - Very substantial and will not easily slide around the floor.Instruction Manual - Very thorough and well-illustrated with photos and line drawings. Spiral bound. Easy to get up and going on this machine and all of its features with only the manual. Additional information on why and when to use various stitches, including extensive darning and mending instructions, zipper insertion instructions, and various accessory feet instruction. This is how manuals should be.More photos and accompanying anecdotal comments are here.Dislikes:These are NOT major dislikes, just slight annoyances because I'm quite used to a more modern, computerized machine.1. No on/off switch. This came in later models.2. The needle plate is not marked in fractions or even in millimeters. Instead, it's marked with lines and 1, 2, 3. Not very intuitive, although it's easy to measure and get used to - or, what I did, mark with a fine-point Sharpie.3. No multiple variable needle positions, but there is a left needle position so that's something.4. No needle/up down setting. This came in later series 6000 models."},
{"title": "New Fabric, Next Project & A Small Rant", "date": "Wednesday, April 21, 2010", "text": "I haven't been buying a lot of fabric lately. (Just vintage machines. LOL!) But any time Lucysfabrics.com has new rayon knit prints in \"my\" colors, I jump on them. She did, I did, and these arrived yesterday. They did not disappoint. I love them all, and right now they are waiting on top of the washer for their pre-treatment, which will be nothing more than tossing them in with other \"colors\" for a full load through the washer and dryer.The piece on the far right above is my favorite. What looks black is actually dark brown, which is my black. The turquoise and lime in the print are also two favorite colors, so all around it's a winner for me. I tried to order some more just now and either I was lucky with the last cut or it's all sold out. I hope I got it because this is the good stuff and I'd like to have it in the stash for next summer too. The print in the middle is similar colors, but the fabric on the right is a better quality knit.  (They're all good quality, but the one is excellent quality. Belinda - it's the \"dry stuff\" so you  know what I mean!)So that's what's new in the fabric department.Up next for sewing will be Butterick 5403, view B. This is a Connie Crawford jeans pattern. If you've been reading my blog for a while, you probably already know I have a love/hate thing with Connie Crawford's opinions and her patterns, which I'll get into in my small rant later in the post.While I'd love to be hopping on the Jalie 2908 jeans bandwagon, the truth is that I just don't have a Jalie 2908 body so it would be unrealistic to think it wouldn't need a ton of alterations. Of course, that didn't stop me from buying the pattern so I may still give it a go. ;-)This CC/Butterick pattern, on the other hand, is supposed to be drafted for my shape and should offer a better starting point. We'll see. I've got the tissue cut but haven't progressed more than that. The back yoke is an interesting (more curvy than usual) shape, which I want to see sewn up. The waistband is not so interesting. It's perfectly straight. Ugh. So I'm guessing I will be changing that or substituting my TNT contoured waistband. Straight waistbands don't work on my curvy high hip fluff.Now on to my rant …Connie Crawford was on PatternReview.com for a chat the other night. I didn't tune in for the live version, and instead read the transcript. Most of what was said was a repeat of info she's given in previous magazine articles, etc. But one Q&A stuck out, and confirmed what I've known all along. Connie has her own ideas of what plus-sized women *should* wear instead of what they *want* to wear. Case in point:SherrilMiller (Apr 11, 2010 8:48:03 PM):\"I'd love to see you make a fashionable dress, one with a waist. Your draft does fit me. Any fitted dresses in the future?\"Connie Crawford (Apr 11, 2010 8:48:41 PM)\"The waist seamed dress is almost impossible to give the larger ladies. Since the same design has to be for both the smaller figure and the larger figure, I am sometimes limited on what will look good on both size ranges. I always consider the plus size lady first.. This is why I use fisheye darts and princess seams so much in the collection. You can fit the waist area with both darts, side seams and fisheye darts. but the waistline on larger ladies (sometimes with an apron) varies quite a bit. and it is not an area that the ladies want to emphasize.\"Excuse me?? Why is a waist-seamed dress \"impossible\" and just exactly how does she know what I do or do not want to emphasize? Did she ask me? No! But if she had, I would have told her that I actually have a waist. Granted, it's a lot bigger than when I was 22, but it's there. And even if it wasn't, a seam will give the ILLUSION that it's there. A tent does not. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure I've seen plus-sized dresses with  \"impossible\" waist seams. I'm also pretty sure that I've bought and worn a few.  ;-)Throughout the chat, Connie repeated how she draped for four years, blah, blah on 40 plus-sized women. Forty. What is that? Like .000001% of the female plus-sized population? Yes, those 40 bodies would give her insight into different shapes, but they would not even begin to be a representative sampling of what we want for styles. What exactly makes her an expert on that? If you ask me (and I know you didn't), I would venture to guess that plus-size ladies want to wear pretty much the same things that our thinner sisters wear. In other words, FASHIONABLE clothes. Not sacks, not tents, not a sloppy baggy mess. Just regular modern-to-trendy clothes that fit us. Even Walmart knows that. Butterick and Connie do not."},

{"title": "HotPatterns 1108 Revealed", "date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "text": "I've got no more energy today except to post some pics and write a few short comments. I'll write up a proper review when I'm not as tired. I took these photos this morning, when my hair was still dripping.So, here it is. You can see better in the photo on Zillie how much more fabric there is in my shoulder area compared to my usual style of shirt. I'm probably being too hard on it. It's not a completely unflattering shirt, but it's not my best look either. I made the elasticated sleeves, which do help reign in the general baginess in the upper arms.The yellow line below denotes the shoulder seam. It's very dropped, isn't it? ;-)You can see the poof of armpit fabric better in this pic.On the bright side, I made absolutely NO fit alterations except to cut the pattern bigger heading toward the hips. There is a lot  of ease in this style so it just wasn't necessary. I did not make a true shirttail hem per the pattern because I don't like them on me, but I did curve the hem and ended up cutting off the 2 inches of \"just in case\" that I added to the hem length.It's still a very comfortable and temp-cool shirt and I got to test that out today chasing the dogs into the neighbor's yard as a cat ran by. They want to be friends with the neighbor's cats in the worst way and of course the cats know this and torment the dogs to no end. Cats are good at that. ;-)Even though I used the \"new\" 6010 for all of the construction, sans serged seam allowances, I did revert back to the D1 for the buttonholes and buttons. Ever since it came back from the sewing machine hospital, its buttonholes are things of beauty again and are back to being reliably automatic. And can you guess what was the first thing I reached for on the D1? Yep, the presser foot lift bar! In case this makes no sense to you, Designers don't have lift bars — they have a sensor that raises and lowers the foot with no hands. It's one of my favorite D1 features, but it's funny how quickly one reverts to \"old school.\" ;-)Off to watch the new season of Deadliest Catch on the DVR before heading to bed. Does anyone else watch that show? It looks like there's going to be lots of sadness this year. :-("},
{"title": "Monday Rolls Around Again", "date": "Monday, April 12, 2010", "text": "No pictures today but I should have some tomorrow.This weekend I worked on the HP Weekender Summer in the City shirt. I'm almost done, but I've lost some of my motivation. It's my fault for not really looking closely at the pattern illustration, but this shirt is very 1980s and has extremely dropped shoulders. Not really a look I planned to revisit with my 2010 body, so we'll see.Remember how I just recently said that sometimes Kimono sleeves work on me and sometimes they don't? This shirt appears to be falling into the \"Debbie Don't\" category. It has gathers at the shoulder yoke instead of sewn darts and while usually I love me some shoulder gathers, for this top those gathers mean there's a lot of fabric across my bust and into my armpit, which makes for a wider visual. I haven't made up my mind completely because the shirt isn't done yet, so the jury is still out.But even if it's not going to be a style favorite, I know I will still wear it during the summer because it's loose and flowy and will be quite comfortable during our oppressive summer heat which is now kicking into gear. When it's 95 degrees with 300% humidity, you do tend to sacrifice flattery for comfort.  ;-) But It will definitely work as an overshirt for our Artic air-conditioned restaurants where a sweater would be overkill. Well, that is if I would *ever* make the plain white tees that I've been wanting to make forEVER.I've been sewing this shirt entirely on my \"new\" Viking 6010 to get to know her and do a real test. Well \"entirely\" except for overlocking seam allowances with my serger. I squeezed the 6010 onto my sewing table next to the three permanent residents (my serger, my D1, and my CS). It's a little crowded but I pushed the serger to the back when not in use and I have more than enough room. Remember, I used to sew in a closet. :-)I'm so pleased to report the 6010 is a champ! And while I still wish it didn't happen, I'm pretty much over the surface blemishes from the shipping mishap. I've even edgestitched (evenly!) with it and a couple of my D1 feet. While I hardly ever used the left-edge topstitching foot on the D1, I've found it's perfect for edgestitching with the 6010, giving just the right amount of space between seam and stitch. I love, love that I can use my snap-on Viking feet with this machine.The motor hums along, so quiet. Much quieter than my D1, which I already thought was pretty quiet. I really can't believe I got this machine for $46. I bet the Ebay seller can't believe it either. LOL! I've bought some more bobbins which should be here this week and I'm going to keep my eyes open for some original feet, but that's not a desperate need like the bobbins since my D1 feet are working great. But I know they're out there so I'll find them at some point.Yes, AngieA., you *need* one. Bwahahahaha!"},
{"title": "New Toy = Playtime on the Viking 6010", "date": "Friday, April 9, 2010", "text": "NancyK, this is for you (and for me too!). I mentioned that I was hopeful the new/old Viking could be set up as a topstitching station. NancyK emailed me and asked if I had tried it out yet. Well, that was all the motivation I needed.I wound my one and only bobbin (gotta fix that!) with Gutermann upholstery thread. I threaded the needle with the same thread. I put in a 120 topstitching needle, pulled out a RTW jeans scrap I keep on hand for patching up my sons' jeans, and I was off!(Click on the pics for bigger versions.)Above:1 = straight stitch over 6 layers of denim, low gear2 = zz over 6 layers of denim, low gear3 = ss over 2 layers of denim, regular gear4 = three-step zz over 2 layers of denim, regular gearAbove:The backside of the stitches over 6 layers of denim. (The darker stitching on the bottom came with the jeans.)Above: The 6 layers of denim between the arrowsAbove:Buttonhole (because I knew someone would ask!). This machine has a 4-step buttonhole. I just winged it so it's a little crooked on the first leg where I started.Above:Back side of buttonholeConclusion: I'm sold! All of this stitching is with upholstery thread in the bobbin and no tension adjustments. I just threaded it up and off I went. I definitely see a topstitching station in my immediate future.* * * * *Other likes and dislikes:1. Like: The light. It's big and bright. And …… you can pull it down for when you need extra brightness. At 40-mumblemumble years old, that's more often than not these days. ;-) But isn't that cool? (Uh, the light, not my old eyes!)2. Like: The honkin' big and heavy foot pedal. I don't think this one will be sliding quite as easily under the table.3. Like: An in-your-face button for dropping the feed dogs. Now dropping the dogs isn't hard on my D1 but I do have to slide off the freearm cover thingie and if it was sitting in a table it would be even fiddlier.4. Like: A lever for instantly releasing foot pressure. No screwing something up/down. Just open the sideplate, push the red button up and in and voila, no pressure. Push it back, and you're back to where you started. There is also a numbered dial right next to the instant-off lever where you can dial foot pressure up or down. Admittedly, I hardly ever, ever adjust foot pressure on my D1 because it adjusts itself, but I still think this is a cool feature for an older machine. Why don't the newer machines have this? (I'll take pics later so you can see what I mean.)5. Dislike: No needle positions or needle up/down. No Needle up/down doesn't bother me at all. But I do miss my 25 needle positions on the D1. But that just means I'll have to topstitch a little slower instead of relying on my cheater edge feet. :-)6. Dislike: No on/off switch. My Featherweight doesn't have one either. You just yank the plug out of the machine and it's off. Well, yeah, but how much brainpower would it have taken to make a power switch? Not a big deal, but just weird.7. Like: Her smooth curved body. I know this is why I don't like Berninas — I can't look past their angular bodies (sorry Bernina owners, it's just me). I grew up with (and into!) this shape and it … er … shaped my preferences. I also love the shape of the old black Singers. These old girls and me, we have our curvy figures in common. :-)So, maybe now I'll go sew something for real. I've got the whole weekend ahead of me. Woot!!"},
{"title": "There's Good News and Bad News", "date": "Thursday, April 8, 2010", "text": "The good news is that my patterns arrived yesterday and the machine arrived today.The bad news is there was some shipping damage to the machine, which makes me sad. In the seller's photos, the paint was nearly cosmetically perfect. A little discolored from time, but no major dings.The good news is the seller has very quickly offered to settle via FedEx (it was insured) if I want to, and the better news is that the machine does work and seems to be in very good mechanical condition.The good news is that I think I'm already bonding with her so I'll probably keep it no matter what. It was only $46 after all.The bad news is she really needs some deep cleaning, but I can handle that. And she is missing most of her accessories (which I knew, but I thought at least I'd have one original presser foot instead of a generic). But all that stuff can be sourced separately later. Meredith asked if this machine takes the fancy stitch cams. It does. It came with two out of the four originals. There were 8 for the whole series of 6000 Vikings and they will all work.I said I'd take and share pics of the delivery, so here goes.So far, so good. No visible damage to the box.Still OK, but I was beginning to doubt at this point since I could hear rattling.Double-boxed and bagged, good.No padding inside the case, bad.Here you can see the machine is not properly seated in the case/cover. Uh oh.And once I got the case off, everything tumbled out just like this — with the sideplate detached and banging around.My heart sank when I saw this:and sank more with this. The damage is actually worse than it looks in the pics. It's more than just a surface scratch. :-(Besides the dings and grime, there were little pieces of plastic floating around. You can see one at the top center of the pic and another near the bottom center on the \"ledge.\"Those pieces came from the damaged case. Here's one side:And another. I don't really care about the case at all. It would be nicer if it wasn't damaged, but I don't sew with a case and I'm not planning on traveling with this machine. And the \"suitcase\" style case is what I want anyway (just like mom's!) and I can find one of those at some point.Up in the sewing room, set up, oiled, and being tested. The sideplate went back on no problem. It's meant to be removable. Just not in transit.The big glob of thread and lint I pulled out of the bobbin area.One of the seller's photos. Sigh.* * * * *Testing went well. Every stitch works. Every knob turns freely. Even the lightbulb works.More good news is that it came with the original manual, which is actually a very helpful manual. I definitely needed to refresh how to thread one of these and wind a bobbin. I love that the last few pages are photos and part numbers of the original included and optional accessories. That will be helpful for future hunts, although my current presser feet seem to fit it just fine and the Viking ankle that Gaylen sent is perfect (thanks again Gaylen!) so I can snap on/off the feet.So, while I'm very disappointed about the damage, I'm pretty sure I'm keeping it. If FedEx pays for the damage, even better, but I really don't think it's FedEx's fault and I'm not going to lie about it to get money back. I'm more inclined to ask the seller to work out something and file his claim with FedEx himself.If anyone is counting: D1, Treadle, Featherweight, Kenmore, Viking 6010, 936 serger, BLCS = 7. I call that a good start. LOL!* * * * *On another note, as I said, the patterns arrived yesterday and I've already cut out the pattern paper (not traced!) for one and hope to cut fabric tonight if I can decide which fabric. More details coming soon. It's one of the new blouse patterns, w/o the tuxedo bib, but I'm too lazy to look up the name/number. Maybe I'll sew it using the new/old Viking. I have 7 days to make up my mind per the seller's original terms. I have some reservations about this pattern but I'm withholding judgment until I'm done and can see it on me."},
{"title": "Impatient", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "So, I bought two new Hot Patterns patterns last week and … wait for it … a vintage (retro?) Viking sewing machine on Ebay.Are either of my purchases here yet? No!Am I impatient? Yes!Now to be fair, neither purchase is late. In fact, per the shipping confirmation from Hot Patterns, I expect the patterns to be in my mailbox this afternoon. (Hey Trudy and Jeremy - you know you could always hand-deliver my next order and we could do another lunch. Just sayin'.)The machine is going to take longer as it was only shipped a couple of days ago.So what machine did I buy? A Viking 6010, and for the reasonable sum of $46. In the photos, it looked to be in really good cosmetic condition. The seller says it works, but we'll see. This Viking is one of the last (if not THE last) models to *not* be permanently lubricated. In other words, it needs oiling by its owner. In other, other words, there's a really good chance it's not going to be frozen up like later vintage Viking models. Fingers crossed.And why did I buy it? Well, sentimental nostalgia. My mom bought a Viking 6430 new when I was a little girl (we're talking early 1970s here). That 6430 is what I learned to sew on. Even though I never really sewed much before my late-30s (my mom sewed, so I didn't have to-LOL), I still learned how and could if desperate! My, how my thinking has changed - now I'm desperate if I *don't* sew. Mom still has that 6430 as her only sewing machine and uses it often. The thing is a tank!So that tank is what made me a Viking girl when the sewing bug did finally hit me. (Mom is still in shock, BTW, that I sew for myself.) I was so much a Viking girl that when I finally went \"good\" machine shopping it felt almost genetic.One of the many great things about mom's 6430 is the low gear option which can be engaged when sewing over really heavy sturdy stuff. Like my dad's leather belt, that dad himself had to try when he finally gave the approval to spend so much money on a (gasp!) sewing machine. BTW, that was in the days when machine dealers still brought the machines to your house to try out. Can you imagine? But mom knew what she liked and stood firm. Besides, dad always had much more expensive hobbies so he didn't really have much of a chance anyway. LOL!I don't want to jump the gun too much before I know whether it works as expected, but I'm hopeful that it will be an improved back-up over the Kenmore since it should take all my Viking presser feet, and maybe it could be a topstitching station for when I make jeans and other heavier items. Or, it will just be a decoration. LOL! I'm already thinking I need a sturdy shelf on the wall to house and display my growing collection.Hey — maybe when it gets here I can do a Peter, but with stills not video. I'm just not ready to see myself in video on the internet yet. I'll leave that to my sons, who have YouTube on speed dial."},

And then I need a new camera with more user-friendly timer options.So anyway, back to the top. I like it. It was super easy and fast to make. Only 4 pattern pieces, since the sleeves are cut-on. The only fiddly part would've been if I had followed Simplicity's instructions for the elastic by making a casing out of the seam allowances. No, thank you. Instead, I followed Angie's lead and serged my elastic *to* the seam allowances, and then turned the whole thing downward toward the lower bodice and coverstitched it down from the right side, simulating a casing. The close-up pic I had for that came out way blurry so you'll have to take my word for it that it looks fabulous. :-)I know some people think that busty plus size girls shouldn't wear kimono style sleeves, but I say it depends. I think this one is fine on me. First, the fabric is drapey and the sleeves are not exaggerated in width; second, the neckline and modesty panel make your eyes look there and not at my sleeves; and lastly, they're just comfortable, so pfffffftt. Rules were made to be broken. ;-)Speaking of the modesty panel, I had a request in the comments from my last post to show how I would do it so I took pics along the way. And is it really a modesty panel if one is not usually very modest? I think I'm going to call it a Faux Cami Panel. ;-)I start with a rough-cut rectangle of fabric, that is both long and wide enough to cover the area that needs covering, plus extra. For this panel, I serged clear elastic to the top edge (so it wouldn't bag out when worn) and then turned it down and double topstitched it. I usually would've used my coverstitch machine for this but it was threaded brown and I hadn't yet hemmed the top so I was being lazy. At other times, I might also bind the top edge. It depends on my mood and energy level.Front:Back:Next, I put on the top and then stuck the panel piece in place. I used my washable marker to draw guidelines on the panel so I'd know how to match everything up when sewed the panel to the top. I like to do this try-on step because bazooms do make a difference in stretch and placement of the panel.I then added pins on the top to mark the height where the panel would be sewn. They are uneven in this pic because the panel slid while I was taking the photo.My marked panel piece.I sewed the panel onto the top from the right side of the top, following the top/coverstitching on the front that was already in place from turning under the neckline.This is the back view. The panel is wet to remove the marker lines.Panel trimmed and done.Voila! It's still wet so it's kind of baggy."},

All of the Sunshine tops I've made are my favorites but because this one is rayon knit, a fun print and new, it gets a few extra points over the others.Here it is belted and bloused. I made a self-fabric sash/belt on a whim for the first version and I find I actually wear it belted quite often. So I pieced together some scraps and made a quickie sash/belt for this one too.This morning I cut Simplicity 3893 (below) and did the FBA alterations. I've pretty much given up on tracing Big 3/4 patterns and just whack away at the tissue. I know my size and my alterations and (knocking wood) very rarely have to go back to the original because of an alteration screw-up.I've had this pattern for a couple of years now and even though I've kept it out of the cabinet and in the Up Next stack (basket, really), somehow it was always pushed aside. Well, its time came today.I cut the fabric and then stepped away for a while and took the dogs to the park this afternoon. After dinner I sewed the upper bodice pieces and that's where I quit, until tomorrow sometime.I don't want to wear two full layers in the summer heat so even though a camisole under this would probably be best, I'm going to cheat and just make a white modesty panel. Then I'll wear the top with the white denim capris I bought last summer, and look smashing of course.

The pants are done. The top needs a couple more hours. And, yes, sleeves. ;-)I used my scoop pocket addition for these HP Marrakesh pants again.I just don't really like sideseam pockets, although my first-make oatmeal colored linen pants have them and they fit and look fine. So I might rethink that for these pants, since I think I have to sew them at least once more for summer.As I mentioned last post, we went to the RenFaire on Saturday. It was a wonderful day weather-wise (pink noses) and fun-wise, but winter is definitely over and it was hot in the sun. Thankfully, there was also lots of shade under the big oak trees. But wearing my linen pants was a smart move. Thank you self. ;-) They were so light and airy and comfortable. And for linen, I wasn't even so much a big wrinkled mess at the end of the day. A little slouchy, yes, But this is Florida. Everyone is slouchy on Saturdays.Speaking of the RenFaire, DS#1 was called up on stage with a comedian (Johnny Phoenix) and the *both* of them together were hilarious. Tyler is a ham and Johnny loved him. JP will be back in Tampa in May at USF and asked for Tyler's contact info, so maybe Tyler will get some free tickets out of it. To give you a very small idea of the antics, here a cell phone pic from the show:Yes, red bras. Don't ask - because I couldn't explain it anyway. Just know that there were bras, a straight jacket and chains and that JP had to escape from them all in 60 seconds.I wish I had brought my camera because there were lots of sights and great costumes. I know if we go again next year, my sons will be demanding some mom-made period clothing for the occasion. And I might just comply — and even join them. It sure looked like fun!

But last weekend, I cut another pair of Hot Patterns Marrakesh pants in brown linen. And while I was at it, I also cut another Sunshine top in a bright rayon knit print. The pants are nearly done. I just have to sew down the mostly-completed waistband and then hem them. The Sunshine top will go together in a couple of hours.There will probably not be much sewing tomorrow. We're all going to the Renaissance fair as a family outing to celebrate the March birthdays (DS#1, me, DS#1's girlfriend).  I had wanted to wear my new clothes but since they're not finished yet, I'll go with Plan B. Which is the original Marrakesh pants and Sunshine top. LOL!Speaking of Hot Patterns, I caved on one of the just-released patterns and bought the Weekender Summer in the City Shirt. I already love shoulder/yoke gathers and those puffy short sleeves were the icing on the cake. While I was there, I also tossed a BoHo-De-Luxe Peasant Top into the cart.

Sorry to keep you in suspense Angie. ;-) I hope to write up a proper review at some point.Overall, I like it a lot. But I do want to make a few more tweaks. First, I want to lower the neckline opening, which means redrawing the lapel and facing pieces. On me as drafted I think it's about an inch too high. Next, the shoulders need to come in a tiny bit more. I'll just eyeball that on the pattern piece. Finally, the sleeves are too long. I like my short sleeves shorter than this. None of these changes are too complicated or time-consuming and two of the tweaks are preference things not fit issues. All in all, this pattern is a definite keeper which went together well and only needed minor fit adjustments.On another semi-sewing note, I managed to clear out my mending pile tonight so those tedious projects aren't looming over my weekend. Yay! … Although the sewing room looks like a bomb exploded so I do need to spend some time straightening up a bit so I can get it all messy again with whatever my next project is. ;-)"},
{"title": "PSPS Teaser", "date": "Monday, March 8, 2010", "text": "Here's the completed collar and a preview of the fabric. It's beige linen with brown embroidery which I bought at Joann's a couple of years ago to make a skirt. So much for that plan since yesterday the fabric told me it wanted to be this top. Usually, I pick a pattern and have an idea of the fabric I'll be using. For this one, I didn't even look at fabric until I was ready to cut the real stuff.I have some errands to do this afternoon so I don't know if I'll get it finished tonight or not. All that's left is to sew the sideseams, hem the sleeves and bottom, and buttons/buttonholes. I'm pretty sure I have brown buttons that will work. If not, it will sit until I find some.I had an Anonymous comment on my last post:\"I had to make the same adjustments when I made this shirt. I made a wearable muslin, wore it but never got back to making the final garment. I was a bit peeved about the amt of work I had to do to make it wearable. I would've been better off drafting my own.\"This confused me because I didn't make very many alterations to this pattern at all, and certainly nothing really outside my usuals. I added bust room, removed sleeve cap ease and narrowed the shoulders. Oh, and I blended to a bigger hip size (which incorporates the bigger waist/tummy size too), but I don't really even consider that a real alteration since I can easily do it as I trace/cut. So for alterations, I count 3 and that's it. And all of these were very minor changes compared to other patterns I've altered.Well, I got distracted by the Oscars and the Barbara Walters \"pre-game\" show so I haven't finished it yet. But it's coming along. This will definitely be a keeper pattern.I opted for a slight FBA after all, because I decided that the front was hiking up just a bit without it. So I added 3/8\" to the princess seams at bust level and added 1/2\" add'l length to the center front, tapering to nothing at the sides. These were quick alterations that I pretty much just eyeballed, and now they're done so I won't have to do them again for this pattern.I also had to do an \"inside-out\" full bicep adjustment on the sleeve. What I mean is that the sleeve was plenty big enough at actual bicep level, but it had waaaaay too much ease in the cap (more than 1\") so I did kind of the opposite of a full bicep adjustment to remove the excess cap ease. I'll take pics because I'm guessing you have no idea what I mean. ;-) I didn't have to adjust for square shoulders but I did narrow the shoulder length by about 3/8\".I've just sewn the collar on and am deciding to stop there for the night. I'm glad I know how to do notched collars/lapels because even with this revision of the original pattern, the HP instructions are lacking. No wonder so many others have put this collar together in \"unusual\" ways.I'll try to take some pics tomorrow."},
{"title": "PSPS Update", "date": "Sunday, March 7, 2010", "text": "(No pics cuz the camera is still up in the sewing room, but I am taking them as I go.)The PSPS (Plain & Simple Princess Shirt) muslin is cut, sewn and tried on. I cut a straight size 20 per my measurements (with a blend outward for hips) and made no adjustments in order to see what my starting point would be. And, it's quite promising. I need more bust room, but not much, so I can just adjust the princess seams without a full-on FBA. I also need more hip room (sigh, too many months sitting on my butt working on the computer). Again, more adjustments to the seams. Easy fixes.The horizontals seem to be fine though. Waist and bust levels are in the right places. The armhole size/height seems to be good, but I haven't sewn in the sleeves yet. That's next. And then I need to assess the shoulder slope, since mine are square and I didn't adjust for that pre-muslin.Onward and upward back to the sewing room. I plan to sew all afternoon and then into the evening as I watch the Academy Awards. If I don't allow myself to get too distracted, I may end up with a new top to wear tomorrow. Fingers crossed.

The wallhanging borders are sewn on, and I've spray- and pin-basted it into the \"sandwich\" ready to be quilted. I've rolled it up and set it aside and that's where it's going to stay for another 7 years a while.Life stuff and the Olympics took most of my free time and attention this weekend but I did manage to eek out and almost finish an actual garment sewing project tonight. Yes, you read that correctly - garment sewing!This is McCall's 5713, a \"Quick & Easy\" cardigan, and it really is both Quick and Easy.I made no alterations to the pattern because flat measurements told me it has a lot of ease and I was lazy. Mostly, I was lazy.I wanted something quick (and easy) that I could finish fast to just throw on around the house and yard while we have our last week or two of winter (below 60s in Fla-speak). I'm so tired of my one sweatshirt and few long-sleeved tops. We never have this much winter during winter. I do not have the clothes for endless weeks of cold.The photo is horrible and does not show the sweater knit as it looks in real life. It looks shiny in this pic and it's not at all. It's a very soft, matte olive-y green with a pretty vertical stripe knitted in. I turned the stripe sideways for the top yokes, front and back. I started from uncut tissue and (nearly) finished in a couple of hours tonight.It's quite long in both the overall length and sleeves and I'll be cutting the extra off. I quit tonight before hemming, but I'll do that tomorrow and have already threaded the coverstitch machine with green so it should only take 20 minutes or so to finish it."},

I still need to add the borders before I can start quilting it. I'm hoping to do that during the week. We'll see.Here's the Blazing Star block. It looks nice but I hated the paper piecing. Well, at least for this block because you have to leave the paper in place until it's all sewn together to stop the bias of all the triangle pieces from stretching. By the time you get to the intersection of all the points in the middle, that's a LOT of layers. So I cheated and ripped off the paper at the points before sewing them. And then spent another hour removing the rest of the paper from the finished blocks.Here's the wallhanging on my cutting table to give you an idea of its size. (And yes, the mending pile is still there. ;-) It's minus DS's jeans but only because he took them back unmended. LOL!)Here's the original Fons & Porter version, for comparison. You can see I took some liberties in block placement and colors.Here's a refresher of what the big quilt will one day (sorta) look like.And here's my progress. Only 4 more (BIG) blocks to go.This thing is killing me though. I will never, ever, EVER do a sampler quilt that has so many different blocks and techniques. Each block is a major production because you have to totally switch brain gears like you're starting a new project for each block, because … well, you are. It's not the kind of tediousness that I enjoy. Instead of just knocking it out, I found myself wasting far too much time this weekend in the time-suck that is the PR message board. So for the time-waster reason and a few other things about the board that have gotten under my skin, I've decided to take a break from participating on it for an indefinite period.I just re-read this and I sound pretty grumpy for this Monday morning, don't I? Complaining about a quilt I hate making and message boards that are ticking me off. LOL! I'm not really grumpy, I promise. I am enjoying the process with the quilt. I just never thought it would take so long and I'm impatient by nature. And since I've decided I want it done and off my to-do list forever, I can't move forward with anything else, so OK … maybe that part is making me a leeeeetle grumpy. ;-) But it's nice to see real progress, even if all these quilting posts are probably making your eyes glaze over.Have a great week!ETA: Just so it's clear - it's not the PR message board participants who are ticking me off, just some policies and other admin stuff. I enjoy a spirited discussion which includes all opinions and responses and do not become offended if someone is abrupt or disagrees with me. But because I do enjoy these discussions, I find myself losing a lot of time that I didn't necessarily want to spend on the computer. So, while I'm taking a break for a while, I'll be back arguing participating again at some point."},

I started the Stars & Stripes quilt (and wallhanging) piecing SEVEN YEARS AGO and it's really been bugging me that it's not done. Besides, I want the finished quilt - which is why I started it in the first place - and there's only one way for that to happen. Not including these eagles, I only have 6 more blocks to go on the quilt and 1 more for the wallhanging. Light at the end of the tunnel.I've been dragging my heels over these two appliqued eagle blocks for months but I finally got the pattern pieces traced, cut, and fused onto the backgrounds this weekend. Now that they're ready for machine applique stitching, they'll go much faster. I actually like that part. I'll still have one more applique block for the quilt remaining but it's got a lot fewer pieces so hopefully I won't stall on that one as long as I have on these. I just have to remember to get more fusible web.Once these two eagle blocks are done, I can assemble the wallhanging, add borders and machine quilt it. I'm not going to quilt the actual quilt myself as it will be too big for me so I'll be sending that out whenever I finish it and find a local long-arm quilter. But to get the wallhanging done will feel great and hopefully will be the motivation I need to finally finish the big quilt.As you can see in the upper left of the photo, I have a few things in the mending pile - three of my tops that need to be re-coverstitched on a hem because I stupidly caught threads on something or other, and one pair of DS's jeans that had a beltloop blow-out. No progress on any of that this weekend though. Mending is only just above cutting out applique quilt pieces in my book and I couldn't possibly do both dreaded tasks so close together. ;-) But I'll get to this pile very soon because two of my favorite tops are in it and I won't want to be without them for long.I didn't take my D1 to the repair shop yet because I was juggling vehicles with my sons and ended up just giving up mine and staying put all weekend long.

Famous last words ......It's hard to see any detail in this pic, but I pretty much straight-line quilted it by outlining all the piecing, except for the border strips where I used a curvy built-in stitch from my machine. I don't think my walking foot knew what hit it. Until now, it had never been used much.I'm going to bind the quilt with the gold fabric in the narrow border. After that, I'm taking my machine back to the repair shop. It's still squeaking. And it's breaking threads way too often - even after needle, thread, and bobbin changes. In short, it's driving me crazy, something it's never done before. It did fine with the walking foot, but once I started the curvy stitching, I was pulling my hair out. Even with the problems that were recently fixed, it always sewed perfectly. Now I'm fighting it. I was going to free-motion quilt the borders but I couldn't go more than a 2 minutes on my practice pieces without the top thread breaking. And while I'm not the best FMQer, I know it's not me - something else is definitely going on. Sigh.I'm still not completely in the mood to sew clothing, although I would like something new to wear. Which is to say, I have no idea what will be up next. I'm still feeling a bit quilty so I may work on a block or two for Stars & Stripes. It would be really nice to get that off my UFO list before Spring rolls around, and I can piece on my Featherweight while the D1 is at the hospital.Or I may just curl up in my new quilt and nap all weekend. ;-) I can't wait to see it after it's been washed and dried."},

We have a conference next weekend so everything will be down to the wire this coming week. Thankfully, I'm not attending the conference so I get my life back next weekend. However, I couldn't wait until then for some sewing therapy so I gave myself permission to start quilting the quilt and I'll do some job-work tomorrow before the football games.I started laying out the quilt sandwich on my bedroom floor but soon got very tired of crawling around down there. I'm old. I enlisted DS#2 to help me carry the layers into the sewing room and I worked on it in sections on my cutting table. Quilt basting spray is immensely helpful for this, and I also did pin it at regular intervals. I know this is supposedly not the ideal way to do this, but it worked fine for me.Finally, I was ready. Or so I thought. I originally wanted to do freehand meandering on the blocks and spent a couple of hours practicing that. I have done it before so it wasn't completely new, but I had to play with my machine to find the best settings again. The built-in free-motion stitches are rubbish.Free-motion practice went well, but once I had the quilt at the machine and started wrestling it, I knew the meandering was not going to be a wise choice for my foray into machine quilting something bigger than a table runner. I decided to opt for straight line, NOT in the ditch, quilting - following the shapes of the block pieces and attached my walking foot to give it a go.I spent a few hours wrestling it like this …… but I did finally get into a rhythm.I first tried rolling up the sides but that was actually harder to manage than just keeping it flat and moving everything around as necessary when pivoting at corners. As you can see, there is actually an extension table under there, which is a curse and a blessing. The curse part is because the quilt gets caught on the back corners of the extension table when I'm turning it. I may have to move this operation to the dining room table where I can have more tabletop behind the machine, but I'm resisting that because I don't want it on my dining room table for the next year. ;-)I now have a grand total of three quilted blocks. At this rate, I might finish in 2015.Can you tell which blocks are done? The near blue/white pinwheel, the green/plaid star above it, and the blue/pink basket on the right of the star.Oh, and while my machine was at the hospital, it developed a squeak that is driving me CRAZY. But I don't want to take it back in and be without it again so I'm hoping it works itself out. You're not supposed to oil Vikings so I don't want to start squirting into it willy-nilly. If it doesn't stop soon, I'll be forced to give it up again because this is something I can't live with, like I did with its previous problems."},

And, lastly, the needle threader works again.These are the \"bad\" buttons. A $6.00 part. Well, only two of them are bad but the whole panel is one unit as you can see.All of the parts totalled only about $40. It was the $89 in labor which was the biggest charge. But still, it's hundreds cheaper than I was expecting so I'm not complaining. Except to wonder WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG?? I'm still holding final judgment on the issue with the lights. The tech said that they kept burning out because I touched them with bare skin when installing new bulbs. But these aren't halogen lights so I think that's mostly hogwash. But I'm willing to be proven wrong, especially if it means that it's a $5.00 dual bulb replacement instead of a $xxx computer board.It was strange sewing on it last night to test things out. It's been forever since I had a working needle threader so I had to dig into the brain cells to remember what to do with it, but I remembered pretty quickly. And the first thing I reached for when I started her up was the presser foot lever. Except — Designer 1's don't have presser foot levers. The foot raises and lowers automatically when you step on the pedal. It's funny how quickly you get used to (or UNused to) things. The Featherweight and Kenmore both have presser foot levers, of course, and there I was reaching for one of them on my D1. I had to laugh at myself.Speaking of Mr. Kenny … Do you see his shiny new white ankle for snap-on feet? Well, that's courtesy of Gaylen who popped one in the mail to me and it got here in what must be record time. Washington State to Florida. Opposite ends of the country in two days. Thank you so much Gaylen! Sewing friends are the BEST! And now Kenny can use some of my favorite D1 feet.And OMG but I swear this card was as good as getting that ankle! Gaylen is definitely a dog person who knows I am too and she taped the ankle inside this great card with Chili's cousin looking right at me.My sons saw it and asked, \"How did she know?\" But Gaylen is a sewing friend and dog person. She just knows. :-)"},
{"title": "I've Been Stripping", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010", "text": "Don't you just love those really bad quilt-y puns? Stripping. I slay myself. Ahem.So, as I was saying … I added sashing and stripping to the quilt blocks. No, I don't know which is which. Anyone?Things I learned:1. I'm pretty sure these blocks were the result of a swap or other bee-type exchange because even though they tricked me into believing they were all the same exact size, um … they weren't. Other clues were that the muslin pieces are many different kinds of muslin (or plain white, I don't know), and none of the fabrics are repeated in other blocks.I had to make the decision to keep the integrity of the blocks (points, etc.) and say to heck with the sashing (stripping?) lining up 100% exactly. It's a practice quilt, after all, and I fully expect and want it to be used as a snuggle quilt while watching TV. Don't ask me why (I don't know!) but my 17-year old son always watches TV under a blanket, even if it's 98 degrees outside. Which, by the way, it is NOT. It is FREEZING. Although less freezing today than yesterday. I think we might have reached 50 today. But it was still officially freezing temps when I took the dogs out this morning so I'm counting it.2. It's really, REALLY hard to pick fabrics to coordinate with \"old lady\" colors but which themselves will help the quilt to not look so old lady. Apologies to any old ladies who may be offended. ;-) I went with a dark green, gold, and not-bright red although the red looks brighter in these photos than it is. Maybe because the whole room where it's hanging for this photo is red? I don't know. I'm now thinking it looks Christmas-y instead of old lady, but that's really only in the photos. The red is really not that red. My camera just loves to enhance any speck of red in a shot.3. Duct tape is handy when you're hanging a quilt top off french doors for a quick photo. Especially when you're home alone.4. I have NO IDEA where I'm going to lay this out to make my \"quilt sandwich\" in preparation for actually quilting the thing. The driveway comes to mind, but my grease monkey son has left, well, GREASE in the driveway so I need to figure out a way to not transfer grease onto the quilt. Then again, I may temporarily rearrange some stuff in my bedroom instead so I can lay it out in the \"sitting area.\" Said sitting area is actually dog bed area, which means heavy-duty vacuuming before any quilt is laid down there and probably shooing dogs off the quilt while I'm working on it. It will also be warmer to do it there vs. the driveway, although \"they\" are telling us it may hit 70 by Friday. Woot!5. I love LOVE my Featherweight! I won't be able to quilt on it because the harp is way too small, but that little beauty sews 1/4\" seams like magic. I love the sound it makes too. It's very hypnotic.6. I like strip quilting because it's more of a no-brainer. Intricate blocks, though I love them on finished quilts, kill me. My Stars & Stripes may never get done, although I hope I do muster up the motivation because it's going to ROCK whenever it's done. Strip quilting is relaxing. Nothing to fit onto my body. No pattern tissue to wrestle with. Pretty much just cut some straight lines and sew. Here's a straight-on shot of the quilt top. If you click on the photo to enlarge it, you should be able to see where some of the blocks don't quite line up they way they should. But once it's in use, no one will ever know. D1 Update: Still in the hospital. The $140 quote does include the Reverse, the Fix, my bobbin winder, and the needle threader. I think that's pretty much a bargin. Or bargain, if I could catch typos. Now that they have my OK to fix those things, they will also open it up and test the problem with the lights burning out. If that's an expensive fix like I'm afraid it will be, I'll continue to live without lights. There was a communication gap that seems to have been fixed now and I received at least 4 calls between yesterday and this morning. But I probably won't have it back until next week. We'll see. The repair guy doesn't make a trip to that store every day. I'm in quilt-y mode and I really need the D1 for that since it has a pretty good harp space. But I may just go ahead and start reacquainting myself with free-motion quilting on the Kenmore."},
{"title": "Detour", "date": "Saturday, January 9, 2010", "text": "No, this hasn't turned into a quilting blog. It's just that I'm not in the mood to sew clothes for me. But I don't want to finish up the last scrub top for my sister either. Part of my lost garment mojo is still not having my machine. Part is a need to clear out Stuff Taking Up Space. Yes, I'm aware of the irony of that statement vs. the lone scrub top.The good news is that my machine should be done early next week and I think it's going to cost a LOT less than I was anticipating. Fingers still crossed on that one because there was also a bit of a misunderstanding as to what they were supposed to look at. How, I don't know, since I had a big list stapled to the work ticket. But I digress … Right now I've been told it has working Reverse and Fix buttons again and supposedly the light problem is fixed, and the price quoted so far is $140. But I'm unclear whether the bobbin winder was even looked at and the saleslady at the store didn't know either, since service is done off-site. I hate that about this dealer, but I have no other good choice. However, if the total bill is going to be under $300 when I was expecting at least double that, I guess I can live with it.Anyway, back to the photo above. These are quilt blocks I've had kicking around the sewing space for years. I didn't make them. They were part of an Ebay lot of other things and I couldn't just toss them. They are completely not my colors or style. But there's still something about them that I like and the workmanship is excellent.So, off to Joann's today to buy fabric for borders between the blocks, fabric for sashing, and fabric for the backing and binding. It was so crazy in there that I totally forgot about batting so I'll have to go back for that.I was also a little crazed myself by the time I got to Joann's since my car battery died and with the men all gone this weekend, I had to deal with it myself. Not that I can't, I just prefer not to. After a couple of tries in the driveway with only clicks, it did let me finally start the car so that I could take it up to the place that sells and installs batteries. Whew! There are 4 other cars here but (1) who knows if they would've started either and (b) they are Guy Cars. 'Nuf said.And why did the battery die? Because it's FREAKIN' FREEZING here and cold kills batteries. I'm not kidding about the freezing - it was in the 20s overnight and never even reached 36 today. Oh, and guess what I saw last night during the dogs' last piddle of the night? Snow. Yes. S.N.O.W. In Valrico, Florida. WTF. No, it didn't stick, but it was sure coming down from the sky at midnight. And today while driving around, the \"rain\" was bouncing off my windshield. I'm a northern girl by birth. I know sleet when I see it.I know many of you have to deal with terrible cold all winter, but you pretty much expect it where you live, right? I live in West Central FLORIDA. I think I'm allowed to whine when it's like this for days on end. I'll be whining again next month when my electric bill hits the mailbox. Whoever's idea this is for a joke? Well, it's just not funny anymore. ;-)Off to pull the new fabrics from the dryer and start cutting strips while watching the Cowboys beat the Eagles. I'll see how far I get tonight and tomorrow before I decide to go racing back to crazy Joann's for batting.  I'm hoping the fabrics I picked will make the whole quilt more Me. But what I'd really like is a quilt that I won't cringe over if we kick it around the TV room and snuggle up in it. That's all I'm hoping to get out of this.(And yes, Donna H - I know I still have the Stars & Stripes to work on, but I need my D1 for the applique blocks, plus working on making a top/quilt out of the blocks above will help me ease into wanting to work on those applique blocks. Shoot me if I ever pick something with multiple applique blocks again.)"},
{"title": "Two and Done", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2010", "text": "Did I say I was making three scrub tops? Hahahaha! I'm bored already. I really do not like assembly-line sewing. Scrub #3 is going on hold because I want to sew for ME! I'll send the two finished scrubs off to my sister and at some point #3 will find its way to her too. Just not in the same package.So anyway, this one is View A from the same pattern, KS 3709. (Pattern #3708 is the same pattern but in non-plus sizes.) Making this view, I figured what the heck good were those princess seams if they stay hidden, so I broke it up with a print and a contrast. I like how it came out. The print was bought a short time ago specifically for this batch of scrubs. The solid contrast has been a stash resident for years. It all came together when I was looking in the stash for something else. I like when that happens, like it's made to be. Oh wait, it was. ;-)I'm especially proud of this edgestitching. Done completely on Mr. Kenmore with nothing more than my old eyes and the default foot. No guide rudders on specialty feet. I suppose I should invest in an ankle for the Kenmore that will let me use my Viking snap-on feet. Anyone know where to find one online? Until then, my foot choices for the Kenmore are dismal.I forgot to include a pic of the back of the first scrub. It's got an elastic casing to draw in the waist for more shaping. I'm still deciding whether to add it to the latest top.No word yet on my D1. I'm going to call about it tomorrow and see what's up. I really, really, really, really, REALLY!! miss my needle down and my automatic presser foot up/down, and my 25 needle positions, and ... well, just about everything. I could never use a straight-stitch only machine for garment sewing. Not now that I've sewn on the Dark Side. ;-) But, really, the Kenmore is fine and I shouldn't complain and it's actually been nice to have a Reverse again. Plus it sews nice and straight and one bobbin lasted for both tops and still has thread, but … I miss my D1 — warts and all. My menfolk are flying up north on Friday morning for a long male-bonding weekend with DH's father and brother and I'd really love to have my real machine back for my weekend alone. Since I haven't heard anything about it, I'm doubting that will happen.We've been having a preview of the menfolks' trip up north. It's been extremely cold all week and we set a record with TWENTY-SEVEN DEGREES here this morning. OMG. Did the weather not get the memo that this is Florida?? It's supposed to stay cold for many more days. I'm not planning on going anywhere. Even the dogs don't want to be out longer than it takes to do their business. They don't have winter coats, natural or man-made. Chili was actually shivering this afternoon. I was right there with him. Brrrrr."},
{"title": "Scrubalicious", "date": "Tuesday, January 5, 2010", "text": "Scrub #1 is done, thanks to Mr. Kenmore. ;-) It's hanging kind of crooked in this pic. I still have 2 more in the assembly-line, cut and waiting for a thread change on the machines.  I actually bought the main print for this top from Fabric.com a few weeks ago for me but when it arrived, it was not at all what I was expecting. I almost returned it but then I realized that it would be perfect for a scrub top. The contrast pieces are from stash.The pattern is Kwik Sew 3709 and it's a winner. I'll write a full review when I'm done, but the quick version is that it has nice shaping, great seams and flattering pocket angles, and two similar yet different views in the same pattern doubling the value. There'd probably be even more residual value if I hadn't taken the lazy way out and cut (gasp!) a Kwik Sew pattern instead of tracing it.The scrub pictured above is View B.Here's a close-up that shows the upper yoke seam and a glimpse of the princess seams.I'm making one more View B and one View A and hope to have them all done and in the mail/UPS truck by Friday. I would be further along except I goofed big-time on the center front panel. I completely missed that it was to be cut on the fold and cut 1/2 of the piece and actually sewed it — and serged it — to the side panels. Oops. Thankfully, I had more fabric. I may not be as lucky with the second one, so it's probably going to have a center front seam."},
{"title": "Tablerunner & Napkins & Kvetching", "date": "Saturday, January 2, 2010", "text": "Done! I'm sorely out of practice with the binding but some washable glue and Wonder Tape let me pretend I'm an expert. I had attached the binding to the front of the runner before the D1 died and after the meltdown I seriously contemplated tacking it on the back by hand. That lasted for about 8 stitches. I'm so NOT a good stitcher-by-hand (because I never practice, of course) and it would've taken for-freakin'-EVER.Here's the back. Or, it could be the front too since theoretically it is reversible.I'm still debating whether to toss it in the washer/dryer to create the wrinkly quilty goodness or to send it on to mom in its current state.I made four napkins. If I had been more forward-thinking when I bought the fabric, I would've bought more so I could have made more napkins. But I didn't, so I couldn't. The napkins are double-sided. Each has the same backing so they can be folded as four matching napkins or four coordinating napkins. On the napkin from the \"backing\" print, I used the wrong side for one side, which is a solid blue. Sewing with the Kenmore was an … adventure. (I think it's actually a Janome-made machine, since its model number starts with \"385.\") It's not a total bottom-of-the-line, but it's only one or two up from that. And I felt it. Even my dilapidated D1 sews circles around this machine. But hey, at least I have a backup, right? Trying to think positive. ;-)Here's the \"new\" line-up. Look how small that thing is. LOL!The things I miss most from my D1 are needle up/down, all the needle positions, automatic tension, thread cutting, and just the overall ease of the sewing experience. I had to test and adjust a lot more with the Kenmore. Some of it is because I'm just not used to sewing with it but most of it is because my D1 just does everything so beautifully without adjustment.Oh, and I miss all my D1 feet! I don't have a stitch-in-the-ditch foot for the Kenmore and I REALLY needed it for the binding. I made do with a generic adjustable edge-stitching foot, but it's not as sturdy as my Viking feet. That plastic guide thing on the right is wobbly.Another thing I miss — winding a bobbin without unthreading. And ALL MY BOBBINS. I think I have 3 bobbins for the Kenmore. What a pain. I wish I had thought to buy more when I was at Joann's yesterday.The Kenmore is good as a buttonhole station and it's a decent sewer, but it's not a *great* sewing machine. The stitch quality is acceptable but not outstanding. The Featherweight's straight stitch is much, much nicer. Even my fumbling on the treadle produces a prettier straight stitch. The D1 stitching is easily as nice as either of the vintage machines. I'm beginning to dread the edgestitching I'll need to do for my sister's scrubs. I'm not used to having to work at getting a straight, even stitch. Spoiled, I know.I did drop off the D1 yesterday at my Viking dealer, which is inside Joann's. It won't even be looked at until Monday at the earliest. Sob. But at least it's there. I'll just have to wait for the bad news."},
{"title": "Is It Contagious?", "date": "Friday, January 1, 2010", "text": "Happy New Year!Thank you all for the get well wishes! I think I'm on the mend. I got up this morning and could  breathe through both nostrils and I'm not freezing anymore.My sons were actually helpful, despite my whines in my last post — making store runs for more drugs and a load of tissues, and jumping in for odd jobs around the house to keep things going (dogs out, making a couple of dinners, etc.). DH was working very full days so he was off the hook. It's not that they aren't generally helpful in all situations, but like most men, they aren't good at \"mothering,\" which is what I was whining for in my last post. When you're the mama, it's hard to get good mothering when the resident mama is down for the count and the biological one is a thousand miles north. ;-)So, while I seem to be getting better, I must've breathed too hard on my D1 and it's now sick. I was all set to sew the binding onto my mom's table runner last night. I loaded an empty bobbin into the winder and … clack-clack-clack-crash! Ayiiiiiiiiii!I shouldn't admit this in public, but here goes. I've been sewing without a reverse or lights on my D1 for a few years. The fix stitch button also doesn't work, but I can get around that with other methods. The part that's most inconvenient is not being able to turn it OFF when I *don't* want a knot at the beginning of a seam. Reverse can had by turning the fabric 180, which has been easy enough. It does suck that I can't use some of my utility stitches without the Reverse button, but it's been so long I can't even remember which ones anymore. The lights I really don't miss. I just have a table lamp shining directly onto the bed which is more than bright enough.But not being able to wind bobbins? That's a show-stopper. And no, the Sidewinder bobbin winding thing doesn't work for Viking D1 bobbins so that's not an option even if I wanted one, which I don't.I've avoided taking the machine in for repairs all this time because at first I just couldn't bear being without a sewing machine. It used to be my only one. I didn't count my Kenmore back then but I've since dusted it off and it's now part of the herd as my buttonhole station.I've avoided the repair shop lately because, frankly, I'm pretty sure they're going to tell me I need a new motherboard and I just plain can't afford to drop hundreds and hundreds of dollars on that, after the year of $$ house repairs we've had. And after all this time, I'm just used to being without and something else always seems to take precedence in the budget. But no bobbin winding means it's time for the D1 to be hospitalized. She's going in with a list of all that's wrong and the instruction to not fix anything without giving me an estimate for each item first. I know the bobbin winder problem is not related to the motherboard and hopefully that won't be an arm and two legs. If I'm right and I need a new motherboard for the other things, unless it's a LOT cheaper than I think, I'll still have to pass on those other repairs for a while longer and continue with my workarounds for no reverse and the fix stitch. But at least I'll know how much to save towards it.On the bright side, having some of these convenience features gone from my D1 taught me that I really didn't need them to sew and made me look at vintage and mechanical machines in a new light. Which is why I have the Featherweight and the treadle and dusted off the Kenmore. Hmmm. Blessing or curse? LOL! I even dug out the manual for the Kenmore last night and realized it does a lot more than I thought it did. When I bought it, I didn't really sew. It was for mending and Boy Scout patches, and I was more interested in price than features. I'm going to try finishing mom's table runner and napkins with it this afternoon. If all goes well, I'll start on my sister's scrubs next.So, you've bound your neckline \"in the flat\" and now one shoulder seam is unfinished. What to do? (Don't cut those binding ends off just yet!)I serge my bound neckline shoulder seams like this:1. Raise the serger knife to its highest position.2. Before you put the pieces under the knife, slide the bottom layer back a smidge. The machine's differential feed will grab this bottom layer first and that slight grab will put it even with the top layer for the first stitch. (At least on my serger!) 3. Lift the front of the serger foot (with your fingertips, not with the lift lever) and put the fabric all the way under and against the knife.4. Release the tip of the foot back on top of the fabric, which is now in position against the knife. (You see a ripple here because I was juggling fabric with one hand and the camera with the other!) Grab the binding tails and gently guide them (and your shoulder seam) toward the knife as you step on the pedal and slowly start serging over \"the lump.\" 5. Press the seam toward the back and, Voila! 6. After running the serger thread tail back through the stitching, sometimes a stitch or two will show at the neckline edge. When this happens, I get out my permanent fabric markers and color those threads to match or blend. I won't tell if you won't. ;-)Most of my hems I do \"by eye,\" thus the \"lazy\" method. First, I press up a hem. With the hem pressed, I bring the item to the CS machine and place it raw edge side UP under the needles so that the left-most needle is just at the inside of the raw edge. Most of the time my edge does not line up right next to one of the guidelines because those guidelines are more regularly incremental than my \"by eye\" amount. So, out comes my handy-dandy \"hem guide.\" Yes, a little pad of Post-It notes. (Thanks to a PR member for this tip.) I butt it up next to the folded edge and press down so the whole pad is temporarily stuck in place.Then I turn the fabric over so the wrong side is facing down and I'm ready to start stitching.Voila! The underside of the hem is encased in coverstitching with no raw edges to trim. (Please pardon the stitch quality of the off-grain hastily made sample.)"},

It's a quilt-as-you kind of pattern but I nixed that part. It seemed like overkill and a good way to make mistakes. I'm not sure if I should review this pattern on Pattern Review. Do people actually read and/or reference quilt patterns?I cut and pieced it today. It's really easy, trust me. Here's the top, pinned to the batting and the backing, ready for quilting. I used my Featherweight for all the piecing, which was fun.For the quilting, all eleven straight rows of it — LOL! — I moved back to my D1 since I have a stitch in the ditch foot for it and the harp space is bigger. The quilting took all of 30 minutes, tops. I might have to make one of these for me.Before I started on this project, I scanned swatches of the fabrics and used it to make a mock-up on paper to be sure it wasn't going to look too funky. These are so not my colors and picking out the fabrics was the hardest part.Here it is quilted and trimmed and awaiting binding.

And I love it!I'll share more details later when I write up a proper review but in the meantime, here are some photos of my finished CWC knock-off Poet Blouse, on Zillie. I'm planning to wear this on Christmas Day, probably with my green knit Marrakesh pants. Or jeans. I'll try to remember to get a pic of me in it, before I spill something on myself. ;-)The fabric is cotton poplin with a bit of Lycra. It wrinkles easily, but not as easily as it would without the Lycra. I think this blouse needs a bit of the rumpled look to really embrace the \"Poet\" look, so I'm not going to fret about the wrinkles. The Lycra keeps it from going completely limp, which is a Good Thing. I interfaced the plackets, collar, stand and cuffs.Funny thing when I was sewing on the buttons — I had all 3 buttons sewn on the front and one sleeve done. When I got to the second sleeve, I realized I had completely forgotten to topstitch that cuff. That's what happens when you work in snatched batches of time. So, there I was thinking I was already done and I had to put it to the machine one more time to finish that last cuff. At least I noticed before I left the house in it.The trim is lacy elasticized rickrack I've had in the stash forever. I still have TONS of this so you'll be seeing it for years.In a couture world, the inside edges of the plackets would be turned under and clean finished. In my world, they're serged. ;-)I also trimmed the honkin' big dart with the serger so the show-through is not a honkin' big dart uptake.These are the patterns I used — McCall's 5556 for most of it, and McCall's 5673 for the 3/4 length cuffed sleeves. For M5556, I changed the shape of the bottom of the placket, added gathers below the placket, back waist darts, and left off the faced hems. I also reshaped the collar points into curves.  For the sleeve, I widened them at the bicep, which also meant widening the cuff to match. I also added a loop closure instead of the buttonhole called for in the pattern.This will probably be my last blog post before Christmas, so to all who celebrate, Merry Christmas! To all my Jewish readers, a belated Happy Hannukah! And Happy Holidays to everyone else!"},

I think my annoyance will fade once the blouse is finished.Last night and this afternoon I worked on the sleeves. The cuffs are on. I added button loops as closures to match the front loops. I'm just about ready to sew them into the armholes. After that, it will be downhill. I even made a stop at Joann's for buttons (success!) while out and about running a million and two errands. But I'm done with my errands and don't plan to venture out again until Thursday night, for our annual family Christmas Eve tour of house lights in various neighborhoods.I'm really happy with this blouse. I think it's going to be one of my most favorite things I've sewn. I just hope I don't screw up now … you know, like a big scorch mark when I'm pressing seams or some other disaster like that.

I'm a NY-er by birth, grew up in Connecticut, and had plenty of snow during those years. The big Saturday storm looks pretty in all the blog and news photos I've seen, but in my heart I know better and I'm glad to be 1,000 miles away from it. It is supposed to hit the 30s here tonight, so not only do I commiserate with my East Coast friends in spirit, I'll also be sympathizing in the flesh too. ;-)Progress continues on the CWC Poet Blouse knock-off. It's going well so far. I'm about to attach the sleeve cuffs and then insert the sleeves. And once again, I'll need buttons. I'm going to try to make do with what's in the button bin, but I really wanted prettier shank-style buttons. Though not enough to trek out to Joann's anytime soon. (Surely J's has suitable white buttons?) Maybe I have an old blouse in my closet I can pilfer from. I'm also pretty sure I'm going to have to mess with the bust darts since right now they seem too pointy. I haven't sewn up the sideseams yet or really tried it on, so maybe they're not as bad as I think. In fact, I may just go up and pin the sideseams right now and try on the darn thing before I go further with the sleeves.Angie asked about the upper back tuck-thingie I showed last post. Angie, from the pics I've seen, you have square shoulders. The fold of fabric you describe is usually due only to square shoulders, so you should first alter for those and see if that does it. I have square shoulders too, but also an erect back. Altering only for square shoulders doesn't solve all of the problem for me. I still need to remove length at the upper back for collared shirts. I'm sure I need to do it for other shirts too, but it's really only when there's a collar that it's uncomfortably obvious. I don't make (wear)  a whole lot of collared shirts, so this has been a slower realization for me than my other regular alterations. Besides being hot in the summer, the other reason I don't wear a lot of collared shirts is because the collar has always bugged me in the back. Hmm. Maybe I'm on to something. ;-)"},

So any excuse to stay away from stores today works for me and I've spent most of the day in the sewing room. (I should be sewing gifts, but I'm taking a cue from The Selfish Seamstress! - L.O.V.E. that blog!)I'm trying to stay focused on the garments I lined up in my \"on deck\" pile here and I'm doing pretty well, having made 4 so far. Not all were complete winners but at least they're off the list.Right now I'm working on copying the Coldwater Creek Poet Blouse, using the McCall's pattern below with 3/4 sleeves swiped from another McCall's pattern.After 2 FBAs (Full Bust and Full Bicep), I've made the muslin out of old sheets and tweaked it, and am now going to cut the real fabric. Per the pattern, it's much too long to be the CWC blouse so I'll be chopping off length …… and taking up excess at the back and shoulder, as shown below. For the back, it's the opposite of a round back alteration and I find I need it in most any blouse with a real collar and almost all Jalie knit top patterns, except on knit patterns I just scoop the back neckline instead. For someone who spends most of the day at the computer, I'm surprised I still have such erect posture. My mother should be proud - she \"scolded\" me to stand up straight my whole childhood.  ;-)Changing the front placket area to a squared-off bottom mostly worked, but I made the inset pieces too short and I think there's a bit too much gathering. That's what muslins are for, right? I've fixed the pattern pieces for that area and hopefully it will now work as I planned. It's zigzagged together in lieu of buttons on the muslin.I debated cutting one more muslin, but I just don't have it in me. It's not a super-fitted blouse, so I should be able to fix things as I go, if still needed. I hope I don't have to eat my words because I really want to have this blouse in my wardrobe.So that's what I've been doing today, instead of Christmas shopping. Bah Humbug. ;-)"},

{"title": "I Love This Jacket!", "date": "Friday, December 11, 2009", "text": "Do I look happy? You bet! (And a lot happier than the last photo I posted, eh?)I promised I would show a pic of me in the Hot Patterns Riviera jacket when I had buttons for it. It took seemingly forever, but I finally found buttons at Sawyer Brook. It took me two orders, though, since apparently I can't read a ruler. The big front buttons were good, but I ordered one size too small for the sleeve plackets. So I wouldn't be left with 4 \"orphans,\" I went ahead and ordered 2 more too-smalls when I put in my second order so I'd have a set of 6 if I ever need them. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it. ;-)(Note: This is not a new red jacket. It's the same and only one I made earlier, a \"ginger\" colored fleece.)The buttons are a perfect match to the fabric, but the fabric has yet to want to cooperate with my camera so the color never looks true to life in my pics. Oh well. Trust me, it's a great color and matches my gray auburn hair nicely.I changed the suggested button placement and moved the top button up above the yoke seam. I think it's more flattering on me to *not* have a more-or-less solid line of yoke+pocket flaps+button right across my bust. Staggering the buttons breaks up that line and creates more vertical interest. At least that's what my eyeballs are telling me. Your eyeballs may disagree.Here are the smaller buttons on the (faux) sleeve placket. I suppose I should've taken a photo that shows the front and sleeve buttons side-by-side so they don't look exactly the same, which they aren't. That was the hardest part of finding buttons — finding two big enough for the front and which also had smaller companions to match. Carolyn, I envy not only your button stash but your proximity to NYC to shop for more.The other reason I look so happy is that the temps dropped a bit here today and I could actually wear this because not only was it cool outside, I had somewhere to wear it to! I'm pathetic, aren't I? LOL!To complete the outfit, I'm wearing the green Hot Patterns Marrakesh pants I made for Thanksgiving. It's my HP day, because I've also started on another HP top, and will hopefully have something to show tomorrow. It's the Metropolitan Tie Me Down top and it looks like it will be another winner with few alterations. DS#2 is gone on an overnight wrestling trip. DH has to work. This means I have no mom/wife/work duties tomorrow and can hide in the sewing room as long as I want.Speaking of Hot Patterns — I'll gloat a bit and tell you all that I had my lunch date with Trudy and Jeremy a couple of weeks ago, down their way in Sarasota. It was a GREAT time! They are so much fun, with tons of energy, ideas, and jokes. Just like their YouTube videos but better. Time flew and I think we could've sat and chatted for at least three more hours. Thanks for the invite Trudy and Jeremy — I had a blast!"},
{"title": "How I Wasted 20+ Hours of My Life", "date": "Sunday, December 6, 2009", "text": "(Or, If Looks Could Kill!)I'm an 80-year old woman wearing a carpet.I even fully lined it before I decided to toss it. But at least I stopped before sewing on the sleeve bands, hemming it, or thinking about buttons.I spent far too much time working, ripping, and reworking ideas to highlight the seaming.Plain old triple-stitch topstitching with dark green thread disappeared (see princess seams in first photo above).  Double strands of off-white upholstery thread showed up slightly better, but looked like basting. Riiiiip. Raw-edge strips of self-fabric showed fine but were going to ravel away to nothing, which I decided *after* I had sewn it all on. Riiiiiip.I settled on black bias tubing couched on with a green double zigzag. While this is the best of the bunch and looks fine, I wish I hadn't bothered. In the end, nothing could save it.It's just not me. I don't wear fabric like this. Maybe that's why it had been in the stash for so long?I cut my losses and threw it out, never again to be tempted to \"save\" it.Moving on.ETA: After receiving 2 comments with suggestions for fixing it or coming back to it, please note: It's too late. It's gone. Outta here. I decided I didn't want to come back to it and I tossed it. Believe me, I know pretty well what I'll wear and what I won't. Besides, there are too many other things on my list that I want to sew. I'll never miss this jacket."},
{"title": "A Day of Pattern Morphing", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2009", "text": "Whew! I didn't think it would take this long to turn a \"simple\" Simplicity jacket into a pattern for a Coldwater Creek jacket. Granted, I took lots of breaks, but still. I worked on this most of the day today.Here's the CWC jacket:And here is Simplicity 4045, the jacket I'm using as a jumping off point:I'm sure there's a pattern out there somewhere that would need less changes, but I like a challenge and it's been a while since I did something like this. Plus, I already had the Simplicity and there's no way I was going to wait on an online order or venture out into retail-land on Black Friday.After studying both jackets, I decided I needed to change the Simplicity pattern as follows:1. Create separate neckband pieces.2. Add button plackets. The Simplicity jacket meets at Center Front and there is no allowance for buttons and/or placket.3. Create front princess seams from the bust darts, and, of course, do an FBA. The CWC jacket has armhole princess seams front and back. The Simplicity jacket has a side panel. I decided that was close enough so I'm leaving those seams as-is.4. Add a Center Back seam.Below is my pattern morph. The original Simplicity front/side combo piece is on the right. I cut out the tissue, did my FBA, and then traced the results onto a new sheet of tracing paper. The Simplicity pattern is taped back together. I figured if I was way off base, I would want as much as the original as possible to go back to. I then closed the side bust dart on my tracing and created the princess seams.I decided on a shoulder princess seam for the front instead of an armhole princess seam. I'm going for \"essence\" of the CWC jacket, not an outright clone. Shoulder princess seams are more flattering on me.After making those initial changes, I made a quick muslin from an old sheet. The neckband and plackets had not yet been completed for the muslin. I was merely testing fit and landmark placements. So far so good, although I decided I needed to (1) add another inch to the overall length, (2) move the shoulder seam backward 5/8\" as this seems to be drafted for forward shoulders, which I don't have, and (3) shorten the sleeve about 3\".Here's a shot of the panel seam. You can see there's no actual sideseam. The panel is seamed toward the back.With the fit tested, it was time to do the final fit tweaks and create the \"missing\" elements. I drew the neckband pieces and cut them from jacket body. I made the placket pieces and added seam allowances where they'd be attached. I lengthened/shortened in the places I noted. And thought I was done, until just now when I realized I forgot to cut apart the back piece for the back neckband. Oops. I'll have to do that tomorrow. My pattern brain is fried tonight.I don't think I'm going to do another muslin, but I will pin all the pattern pieces onto Zillie to be sure my thought process worked for the construction and that I'm not missing anything. I haven't done a ton of jacket linings so I'll curl up in bed tonight with some refresher info to make sure I don't forget anything with that either.Hopefully before the weekend is over, I'll have a new jacket. Now that I have the new A/C, the temps are supposed to be in the 40s (F) tonight. Figures."},
{"title": "More Marrakesh", "date": "Thursday, November 26, 2009", "text": "No, my jacket still doesn't have buttons — and obviously hates being photographed because I still can't get it to look here like it does in real life. But I think I found buttons. They should be here in the next couple of days and then I'll know if they really do match. Meanwhile, we have A/C again and so I was able to be in my sewing room for more than 15 minutes without sweating. After hemming the pants this morning, this is what I wore today, minus the jacket. Nice fall colors for Turkey Day.This is my second pair of HP Marrakesh pants, with a couple of changes.First, I left off the drawstring.Second, I substituted these sew-on curved patch pockets for the inseam side pockets. I like these much better than the in-seams.Next, I sewed the elastic into the back waistband so it doesn't \"float\". And last, I added back darts since these pants are knit and need less ease than the linen version. (The dressform has one pole for a leg so it's pretty much useless for showing any kind of actual fit.)Here's an oddity for me - my zipper, waistband facing, and fly shield actually match the pants fabric. ;-)* * * * *I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving, or Thursday as the case may be. Ours was the traditional spread as usual, and service was low-key buffet style as requested by the guys. We have one of my younger son's friends staying with us temporarily (parent troubles) so he helped put a dent in the food, and then both sons' girlfriends dropped by for pie after their own family feasts.I really enjoy my sons and their friends/sweeties and I'm glad they are still \"willing\" to spend time with their old mom. ;-) Last night we all went to a late showing of The Blind Side. Good movie, endearing characters. Even if you're not fond of American football, you will probably still like this \"feel good\" flick.* * * * *Next up in the sewing room is a Coldwater Creek-inspired jacket using this boucle sweater knit purchased from Emma One Sock eons ago. The green in the boucle is a perfect match for the pants fabric. More details in a later post."},
{"title": "This Is It", "date": "Wednesday, November 18, 2009", "text": "Not sewing related, although I'll take a minute to gripe about the lack of buttons to be had locally and even over the internet. My HP Riviera jacket wants to be done but I can't find any buttons for it. Sigh.So, Tuesday night my sons and I headed to the movie theater to see Michael Jackson's This Is It. I was \"in love\" with Michael Jackson when I was 10-12 years old. No Donny Osmond for me - it was Michael all the way! His music was everywhere during my teenage years and into my 20s. You couldn't turn on the radio or TV or go to nightclub without hearing one of his songs or seeing one of his videos. When I was 20, my best friend had a Michael Jackson party to coincide with Thriller album. (Wonder if I still have those pics somewhere?) I didn't pay a lot of attention to his personal issues over the years simply because I didn't have enough information to know all the facts and make an informed judgment, and really, in my life he's only just a voice on the radio or a face on the TV. I probably never would've seen any of his live shows. I was a fan, but not obsessed. So, this is just to say that if you liked Michael Jackson at all over the past decades and were shocked to hear of his early passing, see the movie. You'll be entertained, and most of the time you won't even realize you're watching REHEARSALS! Oh, and stay past the credits. ;-)One thing I did take away from this movie was what an awesome production this live show was going to be, and how many peoples' jobs and dreams also died with Michael Jackson. It was uplifting to know that these people got to see some sort of completion to all the hours they all put into it. Now they'll have something to show their grandkids, instead of only being able to say \"I was supposed to be ...\""},
{"title": "Hot Patterns Riviera Boulevard Cardigan Jacket", "date": "Sunday, November 15, 2009", "text": "The review and more photos are here.I finished the J. Stern jeans. Meh. I don't love them, but at least they're done. You can read the review on PR by clicking the thumbnail in the \"My Reviews\" widget in the sidebar at the right. Because they're done, it means that corner of my sewing room is now clear and my UFO guilt would allow me to move on to a new pattern. Yay!I traced the Hot Patterns Riviera Boulevard Cardigan Jacket (whew, that's a mouthful!) Saturday morning and then tried on the tracing to assess needed fit alterations. Surprisingly, the verdict was none! That's not to say that I traced one straight size and it fit out of the envelope. Instead, with knits lately I've been \"cheating.\" Instead of doing a regular slash/spread FBA, I've just been blending between sizes as I trace or cut, like this:I'll start with the size that corresponds to my upper bust measurement. For this drawing, that would be the Gray size inside the black outline. Then I move out at armhole level to the size that corresponds to my full bust. Here, it's the Blue size. And then I gradually morph downward to the size that corresponds to my hips. Here, it's the Purple size. I end up with a pattern that resembles the Gray plus Red outline.This cheating method works for me because I also usually also have to increase the bicep width in sleeves and the morphing shown above does increase the sleeve size needed. But now, instead of actually slash/spreading the sleeve, I just use a similar morph between the sleeve size that matches the Gray size I started with and I extend the underarm seams to the Blue size, like this:These \"cheaters\" are what I did for the Riviera jacket while I was tracing. I also made a square shoulder alteration (a usual for me), again while tracing. The net result is one tracing with little or no slash/spread alterations. For this jacket I did end up slicing up some of the pattern pieces to add 2\" of additional length between waist and hem, but that's a fast alteration so it almost doesn't count. ;-)As I said, I use these cheaters mostly for knits. (And before you ask, No, I don't find that the front bottom hem rides up. Your mileage may vary.) I will also sometimes use these morphs as a starting point for wovens too, because then I'll need a much smaller dart/spread when doing a traditional FBA.So the photo above is where I am now with the jacket. I expect I'll finish it this afternoon. The fabric is a recycled cotton blend fleece from Lucy's Fabrics. It's ginger-orange with colored flecks on the outside and snuggly navy fleece on the inside. Great fabric!Even though I know the girls probably don't need a pocket flap (even a faux flap such as this), one of the reasons I like this pattern is because of the unusual look of the double flaps. So, caution to the wind and I'm keeping both flaps. I'll probably stitch down the top flaps so they don't actually flap.* * * * *Still without A/C here, but the temps dropped and it's actually quite pleasant with the windows open. At night, it's even chilly. Plus, it's good to air out the house once in a while too. But I'll be calling the repairman tomorrow to set up an install date for sometime this week. I'm also getting used to my widescreen monitor and don't hate it quite as much. Things are looking up!"},

It's a major $$ replacement so it's going to be a few days before we can scrape together the money to get the work done. In the meantime, we have all the windows open, every ceiling and box fan turned on high, and I'm still sweating my butt off. At least the nights cool off a little these days. Arghhh.The same day the A/C died, we had a big power spike as the electric company workers were doing something at the power station around the corner and blew something or other which killed my monitor, which meant I had to beat feet out to Best Buy that night to buy a replacement so I could work the next day. The only monitors readily available are widescreen. I hate widescreen monitors for computing. I feel like I'm moving my mouse arm 30 extra miles a day. I'll get used to it, but it won't ever be my preference. Arghhh.I have today off for Veteran's Day and have been trying to finish my JStern jeans. But it's warmer upstairs, naturally, than down so I haven't been making much progress. I also don't love them so that's slowing me down too. But I want them done and OUT of the UFO pile so I can move on. Except what I wanted to move on to was the HP Riviera jacket, but the thought of working in this heat with the wonderful fleece I ordered from Lucy's Fabrics is making me itch. Arghhh.Have I whined enough? Well, too bad. One more. ;-)One dark night almost 2 weeks ago, I backed out of my driveway … and right into my son's girlfriend's grandfather's car. She brought over the repair estimate last night. Coupled with the pending A/C bill, I'm going to have to make an insurance claim instead of paying it outright, especially since it's about 3x what I was expecting for a slight dent on the front fender of a 1995 Toyota.

I wish I could say it was completely out but there's still enough left for another top at some point. I don't think I really want two so I may just sacrifice it for a muslin in the near future.Because the print wasn't nearly busy enough (kidding!), I also added some bronze snap heads on the neckband. I was afraid the weight would make the neckband flop down so before I committed, I pinned on a bunch of grommets to test. No flopping, so all is good. The backsides of the snaps are a bit cold on the skin when I first put it on though. Note to self: Do not wear this top while sitting in direct Florida summer sun. ;-)"},

Lest you think it's not fair, it really does put a major crimp in costume choices since most are just way too hot for kids to want to wear and they start stripping at about the 5th house of the night and any face paint drips off shortly thereafter.

{"title": "What's Up Next?", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2009", "text": "What's up next for the sewing room? Good question. I've got at least 10 new patterns twirling around in my brain right now, a couple of UFOs, and my eyes on some TNTs — like another HP Sunshine top.I cut/sewed a muslin for these HP Marrakesh drawstring pants. They will need adjustment. I bought them on a whim. It's that darn Trudy on YouTube, I tell you! She sucks me right in every time. I will have another look at them but I may end up just morphing them with a similar TNT pattern. I do like some of the details on the HP, like the pockets — which is notable since I don't usually like sideseam pockets. These should be a quick project and I need long pants since lower temps will come here one of these days months. Like as soon as high school football season ends and I don't have to sit in the bleachers and sweat. Yeah, that's how it works around here. There are prices to be paid for 362 sunny days a year. ;-)Moving along and speaking of long pants. These JStern jeans languish on my treadle table. I may not dust and vacuum as often as I could/should but I hate clutter and usually avoid it by putting things away, right away. Every time I see this pattern pretty much strewn over the treadle table, it irritates me. These have a high chance of moving to the top of the list just so I can clear out that corner. I've already fitted the pattern and just need to make a better fabric choice the next time. The unfinished too-tight first-run capris will hang until I drop 20 lbs. Which could be a while. (See comment re sitting in bleachers, and it looks like the team is going to make the playoffs)  ;-)And the new pretties. They arrived yesterday and have been calling my name ever since, with lies promises of how they'll fit right out of the envelope, make me look 20 lbs slimmer, pay off my mortgage, end world hunger, and so on.The HP Tie-Me-Down top may actually not be completely lying to me, judging on others' reviews of it on PR. This one is near the top of the list, but not *at* the top of it yet. But its day is coming soon, I know it. (I don't think it will end world hunger though.)This HP Riviera Cardigan/Jacket is fighting with the pants to be next up. Well, not fighting with the pants but with my OCD sense of *needing* to finish up UFOs before starting something new. I *want* to make this one next, but my urge to clear out the clutter will probably win and push this one to right-after-the-pants status. So, instead of sewing it right away, I ordered some fabric this morning for it. That will keep me from starting on it this weekend. Maybe.And then there's the Coldwater Creek catalogs that keep appearing in my mailbox, taunting me with their classic, comfortable, rich-looking pieces. Like this, which they call a Poet Shirt. I really *need* a white blouse, especially one that's as easy to wear as this tunic-y style. I already have the perfect fabric for it too.I bought this during a recent Club BMV sale. (Am I really saving money with Club BMV? Hahahahaha!) The sleeves will need some changing and I'll have to add gathers and reshape the placket, but all quite do-able. I don't need an outright clone, just the essence will be fine.The next CWC temptation. Gorgeous, no?And this is the pattern that \"fell\" into my cart for it. You can't really see too clearly with the print and the small drawing, but it has pintucks down the front like the CWC inspiration. I probably won't use this actual pattern for anything more than to copy the pintuck ease onto a TNT and maybe the sleeve, but who knows — it could be one of those magical patterns that will fit perfectly right out of the envelope. Oh, sorry. I must've dozed off. ;-)And still in the CWC mood, I'm sure everyone is familiar with all of their great denim-type jackets in those great fabrics they very rarely share with us in the sewing world. (I swear, if there was a CWC *fabric* catalog, I'd be bankrupt! Coldwater Creek - ARE YOU LISTENING?)For jackets, there's this new-to-me pattern:And this one:But what I really should do is pull out this one, since it's already altered with lining pieces made, and now a TNT:And I wore the HECK out of it last fall/winter, and can't wait until it's cool enough to pull it out again. (Note to self: Check Joann's Home Dec dept next time I'm in for thread.)Now moving on from CWC and toward the Lemming inspiration. There's been a sew-a-long for these type cardi patterns on PR and I seem to be moving, trance-like, toward the edge of the cliff.They look quick and easy and comfortable. Perfect for Florida \"winter.\" I don't think I'll make the really long and drapey version of either, but I will probably give one of them a go.And finally, Christmas is coming. (Bah humbug. Oh, did I say that out loud?) I haven't made my sister any new scrubs in a long time. My mother is retiring this week and moving to a new house and new state (about 12 hours closer to me, but still a long-a$$ drive) and a homemade housewarming/holiday gift is on the list too. I did order fabric for both projects, which arrived a couple of days ago. I want to try a new scrubs pattern for my sister. For mom, I ordered a quick pieced/quilt-as-you-go tablerunner pattern. I read through the pattern and it really seems like it will quick. (Famous last words.) Both of those will need to be squeezed into the next month.Whew! That's a lot of stuff. I wonder how much I'll actually get done. Stay tuned. Whatever comes out of the sewing room will end up here. And, of course, all of this is subject to change. ;-)"},

{"title": "Worn OUT (But Done)", "date": "Sunday, October 18, 2009", "text": "Did I actually say last night that I was planning to finish this skirt this morning and then start on the Sunshine top? Hahahahaha! I crack myself up. This is an easy wear, casual skirt but there is a LOT of work to get there. Nothing was particularly hard, but since I chose to use most of the details Trudy shared in her video, there are a lot more steps than just a simple elastic A-line skirt.As I mentioned yesterday, I omitted the godet flounce. Instead, I created a separate piece from the \"hole\" in the pattern, sewed that into the hole and topstitched 5 rows on each side of the joining seam. I like the visual interest at the back from the original pattern and wanted to keep some of that.Here's the pattern piece I created. All I did was trace the hole and add a seam allowance to the new piece.Here's the back view of the skirt.In a perfect world, I would either be slim enough to not think twice about cargo pockets on my hips or I would leave them off. But in my Mom World, I need pockets on most everything I wear. I also like the way they look on this skirt even if they are probably not *my* best look. But I'm not entering any fashion contests and it's not like everyone who sees me doesn't already know I have a big butt. ;-) So, Function wins over Form.The flap facing is from the contrast fabric, a linen floral print. I will probably add either Velcro or snaps to keep the flaps from flapping in the breeze. I'll see how they do after a laundering.I shamelessly copied Trudy and bound the bottom edge using bias contrast. It's really bound and not just a facing flipped outward.Here's the reverse. I did not turn under the raw edge on this side because (a) I was too lazy and it's a bias edge so raveling will be minimal, (b) I figured I'd have better luck catching it in the topstitching this way, and (c) less bulk.I made exactly one fit alteration after \"trying on\" the tracing. I made a tilted waist adjustment to the front yoke pattern as shown below. This was the easiest way to lower the front waist without affecting adjoining seams. It made the fold edge not quite straight but I ignored that little bend and just laid it on the fold and cut.I am actually going to wear this skirt with a tucked-in tee so I think a belt is in order. I'm going to cut a long strip from the denim and topstitch the heck out of it to match the topstitching on the skirt, but I'm out of topstitching juice today so I'll do that later in the week. For this pic, I just ran a strip of the denim through a spare buckle I have laying around.I'm happy with this skirt and after all the work I put into it, I had better wear it a lot. ;-) (Which I will do once the tights I ordered arrive and I decide what shoes I need. Suggestions?). Except for the pattern, it was nearly free. Both the denim and the linen have been in my stash at least 4 years, probably longer. Well, not exactly free because I think I used about 3 miles of topstitching thread.* * * * *I will make this skirt again. I really liked the \"safari\" version Trudy showed and I think overall it's a nice pattern. The sizing was good for me and the pieces all fit together properly. However, I think I'd change the \"Advanced Beginner\" rating to \"Advanced Beginner With a Good Techniques Book\" as there are a number of steps that a beginning sewer would probably struggle with sans specific directions. Specifically, the cargo pockets, invisible zipper insertion with a waist facing, the bias hem facing, and piping. Illustrated instructions are included with the pattern, but they are more general than detailed. I hope to write up a proper review for Pattern Review soon."},
{"title": "They're Here!", "date": "Saturday, October 17, 2009", "text": "My Hot Patterns order arrived on Thursday and it killed me to have them sit until the weekend. But the weekend is here and I've already got the Kyoto skirt cut out and partially sewn. Let me tell you as much as I enjoy topstitching, TEN rows at each curved seam is a LOT. But it looks good so I'm going to stitch on.I'm not sewing the back godet/flounce. I have to be realistic — I sit on my butt all day long and it would always look like a big mess. I may try it with a future version, so I'm not ruling it out. But for now, no godet.I'm hoping I can finish it up tomorrow morning and start on a tester for the Sunshine tee. Speaking of which …How many have seen this Butterick tee and wondered how it compares?I know I have. So, in addition to my Hot Patterns order I also took advantage of a recent club BMV sale and bought this pattern (among others!) just to satisfy my curiosity. They are similar, but the HP has much more gathering at the front. So much more that I question how realistic those Butterick drawings actually are. When I trace the HP, I'll lay the pieces over the Butterick tissue and take some pics so you can see the comparison yourselves.I did finish my jeans this morning and will be wearing them tomorrow since the temps have dropped from 90+ to a current 52. Brrrr. That's iceberg weather to Floridians. It's supposed to be in the 70s tomorrow and very low humidity, which is still cold enough for long pants in my world. I'm probably going to put on the \"wallpaper\" blouse too, which Zillie has been wearing since I finished it. I'll try to snag one of the menfolk to take some pics.I'm not loving the jeans though. I'm not hating them, but not loving them yet. On the first brown pair I felt then that the front pockets may be too low but then I decided they were probably OK. I'm back to not liking how low they are, especially because in denim they cause a hip bump that I can do without. I have enough bumps on my own, thank you. But since I wear tops untucked, it won't be noticeable by anyone but me. Still …I also had to take in the side- and inseams tons because I wanted more of a jeans fit/feel, not trousers. That's what took the longest for me to call these done. I kept basting the seams narrower, trying them on, not liking it and repeating. Three times I did this during the week, until I had taken in nearly two inches per seam. That means 4 inches per leg. That's a lot. And they still aren't tight. It's partially the denim I used, which has more Lycra than I prefer for jeans. Oh well, they're done. They fit. And amazingly, I finished them just as I need them for the temperature drop. That NEVER happens."},
{"title": "Weekday Sewing", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2009", "text": "Highly unusual these days, but I actually sewed on a weekday, and that's the proof above. I snuck away from work yesterday for a bit up to the sewing room where I cut out my jeans. Then, since I was on a roll and the bug was biting, I started to sew too. I had to force myself to go back to work. This work stuff really gets in the way of things. ;-)I love making jeans. I know I'm probably weird but I find all the topstitching to be very relaxing, in that mindless, lose-yourself kind of way. Good thing, because there is a LOT of topstitching to be done on these.I did add a fly front but kept the same pockets per the pattern. I knew I wouldn't want to spend the extra time to change out the pockets and I was right. I'm also adding traditional jeans back patch pockets. My rear needs something to break up the wide expanse. ;-)I would've continued working on these last night but I had to go to the grocery store. The cupboards were nearly bare, which is not a good thing in this house. Then I threw some laundry into the washer, got caught up in the football game on TV, and slowly felt all the energy drain from my body. Not the best time to be in the sewing room trying to sew straight lines. Work is a teeny bit slower this week so I'm going to try to put in some 10-20-30 minutes blocks of time to make more progress on these jeans. Of course, it's still about 900 degrees outside so I probably won't even want to wear them for another month."},
{"title": "Rambling Thoughts", "date": "Sunday, October 11, 2009", "text": "I wasn't very productive in the sewing room today in terms of output, but I did make some decisions on what I'm making next and why.However, there was a little bit of actual output as I did cut and sew a muslin for these Petite Plus jeans:Overall, they fit very well straight out of the envelope. That's not to say no alterations are necessary, but really only some of my usual ones and not all of them. So, that's good.I know they are a tapered leg pant. And ugh to that. Easy enough to change though. But as I contemplated the fit alterations I'd have to do and the lack of time during the week to do them, I decided to put the pattern away for a bit longer and, instead, revisit a Burda WOF pattern I made and reviewed almost 2 years ago. (How can it be TWO years ago already?) These …… 01/2008 #132, which are very similar to the PP jeans. The main difference is the Burdas are seamed in the front as well as the back, do not have a fly front, and have different pockets. But the best thing about the Burdas is the pattern is already altered — and they still fit (thanks to the semi-elastic waist!). Making these will be pretty much cut and sew. I say \"pretty much\" because I'm thinking of adding a fly front zip and possibly changing the front pockets. Adding the fly will be a no-brainer. The pockets will take a little more brain power. Knowing my schedule, I'll probably just wuss out and leave them as-is.So during the week, I'm hoping to get the Burda pattern cut out in some stretch denim so they're ready to sew next weekend. When those are done, I'd like to revisit the PP pattern because (1) they're really close out of the envelope and (2) I think there should be more PP reviews on Pattern Review since I've had such good luck with these patterns so far.The other reason I wasn't very productive today is because from 6:30-9:30 AM, I was glued to Youtube watching Trudy and Jeremy of Hot Patterns. I've been on/off the fence with this pattern line but Trudy is one heck of a saleswoman — and fun to watch. I ended up buying 3 Hot Patterns this morning. I expect them to be here Tuesday since Trudy and Jeremy live/work only an hour south of me. OK, just kidding T&J if by chance you're reading. Wednesday will be fine. :-)So, what got me off the fence? Actually seeing Trudy wearing some of her designs (and her wicked sense of humor!). You see, like me, Trudy is decidedly not the same body type as her pattern illustrations. She's a curvy girl and I believe her pattern size is the size she starts with and then grades up/down from there. That gives me hope that these patterns are really better for curvy women than tall stick figures. I hope I'm right. The patterns are easy sew/easy wear so hopefully they won't languish too long before I get to them, especially since the finished pieces would be perfect for my Florida lifestyle.What did I buy? (1) The Weekender Sunshine top, which I've wanted forever, (2) The Marrakesh drawstring pants which I could see myself living in, and (3) the Kyoto skirt, which is either going to look good on me or it's going to be so very wrong. LOL! There's a lot going on with that skirt, but I'm attracted to it just the same. Fingers crossed the attraction is not like a moth to a flame."},

The fabric has still got that wallpaper look going, but I think I'm OK with it for a casual weekday blouse paired with brown pants/jeans. It fits well so the morph between Butterick 5300 and Simplicity 3684 is good. I'll use the pattern with another fabric before winter is over (or maybe even starts!). It's a lazy Saturday, no shower yet and still in PJ pants so this mirror shot is the best I have to offer.I shortened the sleeves about 2 inches and I think I may have overdone it to get the same effect as the envelope.

{"title": "A Weekend of TNT", "date": "Sunday, October 4, 2009", "text": "I'm always seduced by new patterns and continuously add to my pattern stash, especially when I'm *not* sewing. But the reality is right now with my limited time and energy to sew, TNTs are what I reach for first.Friday sewing was fast and furious. Thank heaven for my TNT Ottobre Woman tees. The football t-shirts arrived on Thursday, but because I was working late on a presentation due the next day I couldn't begin making it over until Friday.Fast forward to Friday at 4:30 PM. 90 minutes before we had to leave for the game. I quickly cleared the costume-making scraps off the cutting table, cut apart the men's tee, laid out my TNT pattern, and cut. Most of the construction was done on the serger, which was still sporting the red thread from the costume-making for DS. A fast thread change, a set-in neckband because I had no time to test binding with the CS machine, a bottom hem, and I was done — with 20 minutes to spare. Why can't I sew that fast when I don't have a deadline? I didn't slow down to take a pic and the tee is now in a heap in the laundry basket, but it came out fine, trust me. ;-) I'll try to remember to post a pic after I do laundry. This will be my last football tee makeover since DS graduates this year. And in case you're interested, the Cougars won their homecoming game 21-0, and won this past Friday night too, again 21-0, which puts them at 4-1. So far, so good.Saturday morning the Ottobre patterns were still strewn about the cutting table, so I decided to make another gathered neckline version while the getting was good. This one took me at least double the time of the football tee, because I was not under a deadline. Go figure.I'm not sure what the count is now for this pattern, but it's definitely pushing 20 if not above. Nothing fancy on this one, just a pretty brown/ivory print and again, a set-in neckband instead of a binding — which is lost in this photo.Moving on to Saturday afternoon, a morph between TNT Butterick 5300 and never-used Simplicity 3684.They are both similar side bust dart, back waist dart blouse patterns. But the Simplicity has a slightly different neckline, a sewn-on placket, and different sleeve options and was the one I wanted to sew. I simply laid the Simplicity bodice pieces over the Butterick bodice pieces and, using the TNT Butterick as my guide, added tissue to the Simplicity where there was none and removed tissue where there shouldn't be any. It's hard to explain properly without pictures, but I didn't take any. Luckily, Robin has been doing the exact same thing and has more detail of the process with photos on her blog, here. Thanks Robin. :-)I cut out the blouse last night and will sew it today. It's looking a lot like wallpaper at the moment, but I'm hoping that some dark brown accents will break up the print a bit. It was actually a lot worse before I laid the fabric on the bias.I'm planning to return to jeans sewing next week because while it is still quite warm here, all of a sudden (or so it will seem), we'll start having cool days and I'll be wishing I had some new full-length jeans instead of my standard summer capris. This sit-on-my-butt-all-day-work-at-home job is great for the commute but it's made the fluff fluffier and in different places so I really need some new jeans. Or I need to diet. ;-)"},

{"title": "Alexander The Great", "date": "Monday, September 21, 2009", "text": "Tuesday's Theme is \"Time Traveler,\" to dress either as past or future. We chose past. Yes, \"we,\" since apparently I'm now the official costumer and as such I get to have a say as to the difficulty level and time commitment. LOL!Presenting … Alexander the Great (in a not-so-great pic!)For those that have been following my sewing for a few years, you might also recognize …Alexander the Gladiator from about 8 years ago, in honor of the Russell Crowe movie that my sons could quote verbatim back then, and often did.Time goes by in the blink of an eye. Where DID that little boy go? ;-)* * * * *For tomorrow's version, I started with two cheap red RTW tees. I cut the torso off one and sewed it onto the bottom of the other to make a long knit\"tunic\" onto which I then zigzagged some gold stash trim around the bottom and sleeves.The gladiator costume was originally made from a man's size pattern. Whew! But I probably used a size small back then and it was not about to go around DS' chest anymore. Luckily, the side \"seams\" were only Velcroed together. So I dug out some black Velcro and covered the hook side so it wouldn't poke DS and then made some straps out of scraps of the exact black pleather I used for the original costume. (Yes, I still had some. LOL!) These straps connect front to back horizontally under the arms. You can sort of see one on the left side of the very first pic above. I know the description of the straps is probably hard to picture. Trust me, it works great, DS can get in/out of it easily (important for football practice after school), and it won't be hard to un-do if we ever need to. We're pretty happy with how fast this went together and how good the costume still looks.I swear I'm not usually a pack rat, but some things you just know there's a good chance you'll use again. This is turning into a recycle week - old fabrics, old costumes, old tuxedos.DS#1 had a funny idea for the Time Traveler costume - he said to choose past, as in \"yesterday\" and wear the Capt Underpants costume again. Tempting! ;-)Background: This coming weekend is Homecoming at DS's school, which means that this week is Spirit Week. Each day has a \"theme\" and today's is Dress Like a Superhero. DS chose Captain Underpants.While I thought I would be sewing this weekend, I had no idea I would be sewing a \"naked suit\" and cape.The \"real\" Captain Underpants is bare except for underwear and cape but DS knew he'd already be stretching the dress code with the underwear-as-outerwear and wanted a \"naked suit\" to cover himself. We were in the mall on Friday buying him dress shoes when he declared all of this, and he went looking for such a suit at the costume store. Even if he had found one, it was going to cost at least $50, and for crappy hot polyester at that. There was no such costume to be had. I think I was relieved, even though I knew it meant I would volunteer to make one. Still, it would cost nothing but time since I already had all the materials and DS would buy the huge tighty-whities.I started with KS 3277, women's plus yoga pants, and KS 3299, men's fitted tees and a thin white cotton jersey knit. I cut out the smallest size pants (after removing the flare in the leg and omitting the waistband), sewed them up and had DS try them on. The legs were loose so I \"pinched\" about 4 inches total, dividing between inseam and outseam, to make them form-fitting, and then serged some 1/2\" elastic to the waist to hold them up. For the shirt, I raised the neckline to almost straight across so none of his chest would show.I already had the red satin from another costume and fashioned a yoke-with-tie-thing to attach to a big rectangle. Easy-peasy for that one.Next, I heated up a huge lobster pot of water,  and added teabags, with a pinch of pink and yellow dyes to make a flesh color. I fished out the teabags and tossed in the white suit, stirred for about 2 minutes and pulled it out. One run through the washer and dryer and we had the naked suit.Voila! Captain Underpants!Speaking of Homecoming, DS is sort of letting us off the hook for the dance. Instead of renting a whole tux, he's wearing my grandfather's tux from the 1950s. Yes, *my* grandfather — who gave DH the tux (plus a white dinner jacket) many years back. DH has never worn it and so all the pieces (jackets, pants, cummerbund, bowties, braces) have hung in a garment bag in my closet for years because I knew it would come in handy one day. Who can throw out a good wool tux? DS tried it on a couple of weeks ago on a whim and it fits. I had to let out the pants waist, but the length is perfect. Pretty cool that he's wearing his great-grandfather's 50-year old tux.I decided to take the rental \"savings\" and buy him a pair of black dress shoes (which is why we were at the mall in the first place), which he'll wear for his Homecoming, his girlfriend's Homecoming (different school), Senior Prom, and then Graduation. We're still renting the shirt, vest, tie, cuff links/studs — some things are just easier/cheaper to rent!"},
{"title": "And One More", "date": "Sunday, September 13, 2009", "text": "Are you tired of seeing my bras yet? I know I am, even if this one is fun to look at. But I'm giving up for a while, until I have the proper fabrics.This is made using the latest \"redraft\" which incorporates the power bar on the side. It technically fits fine but the fabric is wrong and there is absolutely no support in the lower cups. That is the only bad thing about sewing bras … there's really no such thing as a \"down and dirty\" muslin which means you really don't know what you've got until you're just about done making a whole bra.I feel like I've wasted a lot of time the last few weeks sewing bras I'm not going to wear, but I know it's not really completely wasted because I do have a good pattern now. I just need to marry it to the correct fabric. And hopefully the bra mojo will be back when the fabric arrives.So this afternoon I put away the bra supplies for a while and turned my attention to some instant gratification sewing.I traced, cut out and sewed Jalie 2804 for DS#2's girlfriend. Sorry it's just pinned on Zillie but (1) there was no way it was going to fit Zillie and (2) I wasn't going to embarrass the GF (or myself) with begging for modeled shots for my blog. ;-)I completely guessed on her size, choosing size \"R\", and made no alterations other than to listen to my inner voice and trace up a size at the hips and to scoop out the back neck as I always do for Jalie patterns. It fits her perfectly. Ah, to have that 17-year old body again. But even my 17-year old body would've needed an FBA. Hers does not. The empire seam falls exactly where it should right out of the envelope. It was nice to see first-hand that patterns as drafted do actually fit someone. ;-)I wish I did have a pic with her wearing it so you could see how nice it looks on her. The colors and style suit her very well. She's usually a very plain t-shirt kind of girl so this is a bit \"wild\" for her, but I do think she'll wear it. Either that or she's a very good actress. LOL! But as I told her, even if she never does wear it, it's OK and it won't hurt my feelings. It was fun for me to make and that's all I was after.The white modesty panel is part of the pattern and is sewn into the upper bodice. I like the elastic trim I used. It looks like it's floating in air, but there's a clear mesh area which gives that illusion.  The GF liked the faux cami, noting how much cooler it would be than to wear a real cami underneath.I think the whole thing took me 2 hours start to finish. And probably 3/4 yard of fabric. Do I sound jealous? ;-)* * * * *In football news, DS's game was first delayed and then cancelled Friday night due to a nasty t-storm that wouldn't go away. The game was rescheduled for Saturday afternoon, and they won. Yay Cougars! They're now 2-0 and first in their division."},
{"title": "Waving", "date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2009", "text": "Hey everyone, I'm still here and alive. It's just that it's the first couple weeks of high school football season and that means I'm neck deep in tee shirt sales duties, along with my regular job. Plus, I've decided that I will once again help out with the team meals on Friday afternoons. This is my younger son's last year of high school and I decided work can wait on Fridays since we'll never get this time back again. I'm very thankful that I have the luxury to decide that.Over the years, we've watched many neighbor boys and pee-wee league teammates grow up and become excellent players. We've seen many earn scholarships to top universities. We've even seen a couple of DS#1's former teammates drafted into the NFL. It's hard to believe this is my 11th year being a football mom. Even harder to believe it's my last.On the sewing front, yet another bra has been on the sewing table since last weekend waiting patiently for me to finish it. I'm really determined to get this thing right. It also helps that it's still hot as h*ll outside and there's no way I'm even starting to think about a new season for clothes so I can take my time with the bras. But I want to finish them up soon and not be caught out with nothing to wear when the temps do finally start falling — maybe by Christmas? LOL! I'm hoping to spend some quality time in the sewing room on Saturday and Sunday, of course with football on the TV!Go Cougars!"},
{"title": "From Unwearable to Wearable In One Easy Snip", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2009", "text": "This is an excerpt from The Bra Makers Manual by Beverly Johnson, which I bought on CD about 10 days ago. This little gem alone may be worth the cost of the book to me.(Hopefully you can click this and make it larger to read more easily, but Blogger has been cranky with photos for a while now so who knows!)Especially note: \"the bridge may sit in at the chest wall, but it may tip away from the body at the top.\"This is one of the RTW bras I bought in desperation. It fit pretty much everywhere except that the wires at the top center front \"tipped away from the body\" and poked outward, making an annoying and unattractive lump in the valley. I ordered 3 of these bras and as you can see on this one, the tags are still attached because I was going to return them. Zillie isn't quite filling out this one the way the real girls do.I read that blurb in The Bra Makers Manual and immediately decided to sacrifice one of the three that I bought, since I had been wearing it and wouldn't be returning it anyway. So, I sliced the bridge upward from the bottom, to apex level. With the slice, the bridge relaxed and spread, making the top of the wires lay flat against my chest wall as they should. Hallelujah!I only trimmed a little out of the slice to make a more pleasing vee shape. The rest of the spread is happening naturally.I made a tube from some organza I had on hand and from the right side zigzagged this to the backside of the slit to finish the edges and provide stability. Looking at the photo below, you can also see where I sewed across the channeling at the top to keep the wires from riding up to the top. This bra is a \"minimizer\" and the style used to spread and flatten the tissue is way too high cut and the wires were riding too high on me without that stitching. It's still too high cut, of course, but at least now across the top it's only stretchy fabric that gives and not wires that don't.With these small changes, the bra went from pretty much unwearable and uncomfortable to very acceptable. I'm probably going to keep the other bras now too and make these same changes. Until I have time to crank out some more bras from the sewing room, these will fill in nicely. I can also see this easy modification happening on some other RTW bras in the drawer, especially since I've got nothing to lose."},
{"title": "Details and Photos", "date": "Sunday, August 30, 2009", "text": "Last night I showed a preview of my latest bra, but let's go back to the beginning for this pattern (Danglez DB4).This copper-colored bra is where I had last left the pattern. Looks good, no? Except after wearing it for an extended period of time, it drooped and the girls with it. Not so much from the cups, since they did contain everything within. It was the band that was failing. It just didn't want to stay in position, no matter how tight I made it.So, back to the drawing board, as they say.During the interim, I ordered this bra.It arrived, I tried it on, I hated it. It's the next \"model\" of the bras I used to wear that fit perfectly. Once I found out that my beloved bra had been discontinued, I bought up every one I could find in my size,  which is why I'd been off the bramaking bandwagon for some time. Sadly, even those finally wore out and I was desperate. And at that point, they were so worn out that cloning a pattern from one wasn't going to be a solution either.So I kept trying on the hated new model wishing for it to fit, because it was so close. But the bridge and center front of the underwires felt like they were about to touch my chin and the straps felt way too short. As I said, I was desperate so I pushed the underwires downward into the channeling as far as they would go and sewed across the top. That solved the feeling that they were about to scrape my chin, but they still stuck out at the center front instead of laying flat.  Horrible. I certainly don't need a third bump there. And the straps - they're nice and pretty and all, but the padded area ends right as it gets to my shoulder. Clearly, whoever graded this bra up into the larger sizes did not try it on real humans. If anything, I'm *short* between shoulder and bust point and straps are never too short for me.The one fantastic thing about this bra, though, was the fit of the band. It was firm and comfortable and didn't ride up even with those short straps. So the brain kicked into gear and I decided to morph the RTW band onto the Danglez pattern and have another go.This is the original Danglez band.This is my morph of the RTW band with the Danglez pattern.And these are the two pattern pieces:The straight-across pattern is the original Danglez pattern piece. You can see how the RTW shape drastically curves downward in comparison. The reason this downward curve works so well is because that downward curve acts as a counter-balance to the weight of the heavy breast tissue in front. The other difference is that on the Danglez pattern, the greatest stretch is running around the body. This is a no-no for a bra band. You want a firm band, not one that has no resistance at all.I already knew all this but had a brain spasm or something when I was tracing the original pattern to sew because I didn't even notice the potential problems. (But it was nice to have this confirmed by Beverly Johnson in her Bra Makers Manual, which I ordered a week and a half ago and which arrived yesterday. If you have this book, it shows how to alter a straight pattern into the downward curve. More on this book in a later post.)While I was tweaking, I also decided to have one more go at the cups since I felt like the upper cup was still too wide and the straps were still not sitting exactly right. So I tried the copper bra on again and pinched and pulled. I took it off and pinned out the amount of the pinches at the center seam …… and I pinned a \"slash/overlap\" into the top cup to bring the straps further inward.These are the old and new pattern pieces. The original is on the top left. Not a huge amount of difference, but 1/4\" goes a long way in a bra pattern.I also decided I wanted a smidge more coverage near my underarm so I extended the sides of the upper and bottom-outer pieces. This is the bottom-outer piece below. The bottom-inner piece remained unchanged from the original.Then I sewed up a bra with my new pattern changes. And had a meltdown when seeing the results. Arghhh!!It technically fits fine, but there was just too much bulk at the center cup seam and the cups would not lay smooth no matter what. This is what I saw looking down. Not very pretty, is it? LOL!And then work and home intervened and I had to stay out of the sewing room for a couple of weeks. But I finally finished this latest bra yesterday and it's a winner. This time, instead of double-layer lower cups, I made them single layer and this solved the bulk problem. But there's not quite as much support so …… the last tweak I'm going to do is to add a \"powerbar\" (as Beverly Johnson calls it), which is a side panel on the outside of the cup which forces the girls more inward and center. The powerbar acts like if you took your hands to the sides of your breasts and pushed them together for mega cleavage, but less dramatic. Just a little more needed lifted, not mega cleavage. ;-)I also traced off a pattern from the RTW bra for the padded straps and lengthened them so the padding actually hits the tops of my shoulders. I improvised with what I  had here and used a layer of poly batting for the padding. I'll see how these straps come out of the wash before I decide if this was a good idea. But they look and feel pretty for now.Mirror bra shots don't always tell the whole story since arms and shoulders are lifted just to take the pic, but this bra is 97% TNT now, and I'll definitely be wearing it until I get the next one made.I've been so busy the last couple of weeks and haven't been in the sewing room much until today. But I did get version 3 of the Danglez DB4 bra pattern finished today and here's a preview. It's about 97% perfect - still one tweak left to do - but definitely quite wearable. Don't mind Zillie's lumps. She's got a stuffed bra on under this one and the stuffing has never been smooth.More details and photos sometime on Sunday, when I'm not too sleepy to write coherently."},

I just wish I had paid more attention before I sewed it together since I did/do have enough fabric left to cut lower front section. But by the time I noticed the glaring twinsy-ness of the motifs, I had already inserted flat piping in the empire seam, sewed/serged it all together, and topstitched. (Buttonhole courtesy of my vintage Singer attachment on my \"Kenmore buttonhole station.\" Love that!) As mentioned last post, I left off the collar. I really don't like collars in the summer heat/humidity. My hair gets caught up in them and it's just another layer that I fiddle with and swelter in. This top without the collar feels great on my neck!I finished the back neckline with a bias self-facing, which is caught on either end under the front-to-shoulder-seam facings.All in all, though, I'm happy with it. Good quilting cottons always feel so nice as clothing.Oh, and a note about the sleeves since my first make of this pattern was sleeveless — they fit into the armhole perfectly. No easing required, and remember — this fabric has no stretch. While I'm not complaining, this strikes me as odd since most patterns with set-in sleeves require some easing. I'm going to revisit the pattern before I put it away to see if I caused it by oversight during an alteration or if it's really supposed to be. You can't see in my photo above, but the sleeves fit great. The armhole is where I like it (on the high side), I have perfect arm mobility and the shirt doesn't raise up when I lift my arms. So there's been no sacrifice for an ease-less sleeve cap.Moving on to the bra now …"},
{"title": "Keeping Myself Accountable", "date": "Saturday, August 15, 2009", "text": "I'm just noting all this publicly to keep myself accountable this weekend. The guys are away and I plan to sew, sew, SEW!First up is to finish the second Petite Plus Shapely Shirt that I cut out last weekend and have worked on here and there since then. This one is from a quilting cotton, no Lycra. It's an Amy Butler print, so it may be a little too cutesy to wear in public. But for hanging around the house and out in the yard with the dogs, it should be very comfortable. I'm leaving off the collar to increase the comfort-in-humidity factor. But I am adding sleeves because my shoulders freeze inside in the A/C as my desk is right under a vent. The only things left to finish are inserting the second sleeve, hemming, and buttonholes/buttons. I plan to finish this in the morning.After that, I want to work on a new bra. I finally ordered 4 different sets of underwires from Bramakers.com which came during the week and I now have 2 keeper sets. They are actually the same basic size, just different lengths for different style bras. The size charts you can print out from the site are extremely helpful. I want to tweak the fit of the last bra, made from the Danglez pattern. I hope to have at least a new \"muslin\" finished by Saturday evening. If that goes well, then I want to make a final version before the weekend is over.Somewhere in all of this I do need to spend about 3-4 hours catching up on some work. It's been a frazzled week and I have a graphics project I haven't been able to concentrate on due to all of the other interruptions. I want this off my plate so it stops nagging at me.I don't think that leaves time for any other projects, but if a miracle occurs, then I'll pull out the J. Stern jeans pattern and work on that again. Actually, I don't need to really pull it out as I've never put it or the non-fitting capris away. Out of sight is out of mind around here and I didn't want to forget about them.So, what's on your to-do lists for the weekend?"},

And, no, I don't name these things. ;-)They came out OK, not perfect in a couple spots but close enough. These are some of the most fiddly blocks I've done in a long time, or even ever. My personality is much more suited to fast strip quilting blocks, which is what I'll be doing to use up the leftovers if/whenever I finish these two Stars & Stripes projects. I will probably machine-quilt the wall hanging myself, but I'm already giving serious thought to paying for a long-arm quilter to quilt the big one.So, here's where I am now. Only 2 blocks left for the wall hanging! I'm beginning to think I may get these both done by the end of the year.I'm \"forcing\" myself to work on the applique eagle blocks next. The sewing part won't be hard. It's cutting out all those pieces — times two — that is making my eyes cross. For these, I'll be moving from the Featherweight to the D1 so I can use the buttonhole stitch on my D1 like I did for the previous appliqued blocks. I have to say, though, I'm really enjoying the simplicity and sturdiness of the little Featherweight and I'm glad it's part of the herd.As for the rest of the weekend, my mind is a jumble and I haven't decided what to start. Analysis paralysis. Sigh."},
{"title": "Another \"New\" Gadget", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2009", "text": "If you've read my coverstitch tips, you'll already know that this stack of Post-Its has been my \"hem guide\" of choice on my coverstitch machine. That is, until now …I knew I wanted a seam guide attachment for my Featherweight, since its original needle plate has no guidemarks. (Yes, I know I can buy another \"original\" with the marks and I will — just haven't yet.) The FW came with many attachments. Unfortunately, the seam guide wasn't one of them. So I bided my time on Ebay and bought a reasonably priced lot of sewing machine parts which not only included the Singer seam guide but a Greist version too. (And some other weird stuff I have no idea about. One day I'll post pics of those things too.)This is the Singer seam guide on the Featherweight:And here is the new resting spot for the Greist seam guide, on my coverstitch machine.The stack of Post-Its works fine, until it gets accidentally knocked loose. And it does have to be \"renewed\" every so often by peeling off the old back sheet which has picked up lint and threads, etc. and lost its sticky. Eventually, I could go through tons of these things, which makes the Greist seam guide \"greener\" both in terms of not wasting sheets of Post-Its and it being rescued from a landfill. Nice side benefits for a nifty old gadget, eh?Here's a blurry photo of them side-by-side. The main difference is that the Greist version has an ugly brown plastic capped screw which rides permanently in the groove. At some point, I may ask my husband to snip it off so I can sub a prettier silver screw. For now, I'm dealing with it. Brown may be one of my favorite colors — but for clothing, not on sewing machine attachments.So now you're wondering where to get one, right? Well, the first place to look is Ebay. Search on \"seam guide\" or \"sewing machine attachments\" or \"sewing machine parts\" or even \"Singer attachments.\" Of course, once you have the Singer name involved, especially the \"Featherweight\" label, the price may go up. These things are plentiful though and come branded by Singer, Greist, Elna, Kenmore and more. So be patient and you should be able to pick one up for under $10. You might even get it with a bunch of other interesting stuff like I did.I tried to find a current version, but I wasn't having much luck with anything at a reasonable price. I did find this, which looks interesting. I have no idea about the website it's on though."},
{"title": "Buttonholer Winners & Tips", "date": "Monday, July 27, 2009", "text": "You know how when you're watching a show on TV and during one of the commercial breaks a news preview comes on with a teaser about how a giant gorilla is barreling down your street at this very moment and then cuts off with \"Details at 11?\" Then you tune into the news at 11 to find out What Is Going On?? and the story you tuned in to see isn't shown until about 11:28? Well, that's what I'm doing with the winners of the buttonholer contest. They are below, but you'll have to watch nearly all of the newscast before it's announced. Hee hee hee ...!!* * * * *So, yesterday I was finishing up my Shapely Shirt by stitching the buttonholes with my Singer buttonholer attachment. I decided to take some pics along the way to illustrate some tips I want to share.But before I forget, make sure to visit EmilyKate's blog and watch her buttonholer attachment tutorial, here. You won't need any instructions at all after watching. (Great info, EmilyKate!).OK, here we go …If you're like me, one of the first things you'll wonder about after getting this thing hooked up to your machine is, \"How the heck do I align everything so all my buttonholes start and end the same distance from the edge?\" Well, it's easy enough to do, but not so easy to describe in words. Hopefully, I'll do OK.First, mark your starting dots along the fabric edge. (One dot for each buttonhole.) My mark is in red below, with the needle stuck through it.Notice that the back grabber foot thing around the needle is NOT centered to the needle. That's OK. It's normal. It will hardly ever be centered when you start, and yes, the position will likely be different each time.Instead of trying to center things, what you need to do is become familiar with all the steps the needle takes as the attachment moves around to sew the buttonhole. To do that, raise your needle and start turning the white knob shown below. If it turns without clicking, turn it in the other direction. You need to hear those clicks and also see the attachment moving around. Each click is one movement.Move it around for a couple passes until you can anticipate when it's nearing the starting point … which is one click past the center white line at the back of the black foot, circled below. It's a very subtle right-swing motion, so look for it. Missed it? OK, go around again. THAT is where you will start each buttonhole. (Pay no attention to my needle out of the red mark or the thread coming from it. I had started and then decided to take this pic, so I raised the needle and moved things around so I'd be able to get a shot of that white line.) Practice on some scraps before you dive right into a real project. It's better to practice than to need to rip out buttonhole stitches. ;-)Once you start, don't try to guide the fabric. The buttonholer takes it and moves it in all sorts of directions. This is what is supposed to happen. Let it.Here is the backside of the first real buttonholes sewn with my attachment. I used a washaway stablizer underneath the fabric when stitching the buttonholes because this fabric is cotton/Lycra and it likes to pucker if you sew a buttonhole without the stabilizer. (I tested it first before diving in, which is how I learned this!) We interrupt this fascinating blog post to bring you this announcement:  The numbers 6 and 43 were randomly generated, in that order. That means Dawn (7/22/09 7:55 PM) wins first prize, and The Slapdash Sewist (7/24/09 8:13 PM) wins second prize. Congrats ladies. Email me your addresses to djc @ cedesign.com and I'll get this in the mail to you soon. Remember, you only have 48 hours before I move to the next names below yours. Dawn, I wish I could fit in the box with the attachment — I've always wanted to visit Alaska. ;-)Here are my buttonhole cutting tools. One is a tube of Fray Block that I dab onto the buttonholes before cutting them. (I also dab this on the thread knots of the buttons for extra insurance.) The other items are my buttonhole chisel and mini self-healing mat that came with the chisel. The chisel is the best tool for cutting open a buttonhole. It's easy to position so that no threads are cut and if you're paying even a little bit of attention, it's pretty difficult to slice through the end of a buttonhole.The buttonhole after being cut open. Beautiful, isn't it? ;-)"},

{"title": "Singer Buttonholer, Part Deux", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2009", "text": "I was planning to try it eventually, but a note on the PatternReview message boards this morning motivated me to hook up a buttonholer to my Viking D1 to see how we fared. Here are the results:The red side is the front. The khaki is the back. That's 2 layers of cotton plus two layers of medium weight denim, just for kicks.When I first posted about my new-to-me Singer buttonholer, I had just the one. Since then, I've bid on and won a few Ebay auctions for groups of cheap miscellanous sewing stuff.  As a result, I now have three — yes three!! — of these things. Two are in great shape as is, and one needs a bit of cleaning up. But it still works just fine. It's what made those buttonholes above.I first tried the attachment I've had set up on my Kenmore but the \"claw\" was just a smidge too narrow to fit over my Viking's needle screw. On a whim, I tried the other buttonholer … and it fit. The claw is circled in the photo below. You can also see the dust and dirt on this buttonholer.The screw that comes with these Singer buttonholers is too big for the hole in my Viking presser foot bar, but since I already have the Viking ankle screw I just used that instead. Not really any brain effort involved there. The Viking screw is circled in the photo below and works perfectly.Below are the two buttonholers claw-to-claw. The bigger (and dirtier) claw is to the left. You can see that there's hardly any difference. I'm certain you could easily use needlenose pliers to spread the claw a smidge if needed. Since my experiment and photos this morning, the 3rd buttonholer arrived in today's mail and it has the bigger claw spread too, so maybe my narrower claw is the fluke and not the other way around. I just don't know.My \"keeper\" is the buttonholer on top in the photo below. The \"dirty\" buttonholer is on the bottom. The paint is a little scratched, but the rest of it will clean up just fine with a few Q-tips and some sewing machine oil.The \"dirty\" one arrived in the dark box below, with extra templates in a black pouch. I think it's an older version than the one in the green box. Anyone?"},
{"title": "Notes from the Weekend", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2009", "text": "Finally, there was some actual productive garment sewing this weekend. Not as much as I had planned, but some is better than none. But before that happened, I kind of got cornered to do some mending first.My younger son's girlfriend's purse needed its shoulder strap reattached. They came into my sewing room and asked if they could borrow some purple thread and a needle. I asked for what, and GF showed me the strap on the purse. Which was gold and red cotton, by the way, so why purple I have no idea. Anyway, I said that I could just sew it on the machine and it would be stronger. GF smiled and handed the purse over.When I had it in my hands, I noticed that the other strap was messily handstitched (also in purple!) and I ended up ripping that out and pressing and then sewing both straps on, sandwiched between the lining and the purse fabric.The lining was another story. It was shredded near the top and the bottom was completely gone. Anything small that she'd drop into the purse would need a fishing expedition to find it up inside the lining. So, I also fused some interfacing to the back side of the lining so it would be stable again and then sewed it back to the bag at the bottom. Much better.Finally, the outside front of the purse is covered in rows of ribbons, one of which had come apart from the next, creating another \"hole\" that needed attention. I just topstitched that back down, catching the lining as I sewed, but who cared at that point.By the time I was done, I had nearly resewn the whole purse, but the GF was thrilled and this favorite purse will now last at least another few months. Mending might be tedious, but it is sure satisfying to save something from the trash bin (and, of course, to be a hero in GF's eyes!).So here's how far I got with my next Jalie 2806 top. I'll sew the sleeves on tonight and finish it up, as the guys have BBQ duty for dinner.Saturday was spent in the sewing room playing with my new toys, around some household chores. I finished three more blocks (2 Liberty/Twisted Sister and 1 more of the Life blocks). The Twisted Sister blocks are for the full quilt. The other is for the wallhanging that I started at the same time as the quilt, figuring \"as long as I'm doing one, I might as well do two.\" Yeah, OK, who the heck thought THAT was a good idea? LOL! As you can see, the applique block for it so far remains undone too."},
{"title": "Stars & Stripes & A Featherweight Tale", "date": "Saturday, July 18, 2009", "text": "I started this quilt top 6 years ago.  I'm not a big quilter, but I do like them. I saw this sampler on the Fons & Porter TV show when it was a new design and I really liked it. So I ordered the book and spent the next few weeks buying a huge bunch of red, white & blue (and gold and off-white) fat quarters. I was making good progress. Then life happened and I put it away, always meaning to get back to it.Over the last week or so, I've been reacquainting myself with the instructions and the blocks I still need to complete. The applique blocks are really what are supposed to be up next, but I procrastinated on those six years ago and I deferred again this week. Instead, I chose the Life Block to work on, and finished those last night. I goofed on the assembly of one, but oh well, it's a sampler. This block will just be a sample of a mistake. LOL!To give you an idea of the size of the finished quilt, the finished size of these Life Blocks are 10\" and they are some of the smaller blocks that make up the whole. Most of the remaining blocks are 20\" or bigger. I want to work on this slowly and without self-imposed pressure over the next couple of months, to finish the remaining 9 blocks. Hopefully posting here on the blog will keep me motivated to do that. (In the photo from the book above, the yellow blocks represent those I've finished.)I've been practicing on my treadle but I still don't feel confident enough on it to sew an even 1/4\" seam allowance, so I used the \"new baby\" — a 1949 Featherweight I picked up locally a couple of weeks ago. You saw a preview of her in my last post. For these blocks, a little stack of Post-Its was my seam guide. The needle plate has no markings, and I may decide to \"fix\" that by buying one with the marks. Or, I may just stock up on more Post-Its.You can't really see in these photos taken last night, but all of the decals are intact and bright, including around the edge of the extension which aren't showing at all here. Yes, there is some regular and expected wear on this machine, but overall it's in good condition. And it's adorable! I'm not planning on reselling it, so I don't care that it's not one of the gleaming and perfect $600+ variety FWs I've seen for sale online.  Truthfully, when I was sewing on it last night and using my awl to guide the joins of the blocks, I was glad that it was already scratched. I think I wouldn't be as comfortable sewing on a near-perfect Featherweight.How I got her is kind of funny, kind of sad. I had answered a Craig's List ad for another machine entirely. The seller was just one town over, about 3 miles away, so I figured I'd go look at it for fun (again with my son for \"protection\"). When I got there, we chatted a little. He's a nice older gentleman. I mentioned to him that I had recently bought a treadle, have seemed to have caught the collecting bug, and that I'd fallen in love with FWs (thank you DonnaH and Cidell!) and one day I'd really like to find one of those. His eyes kind of lit up as he led us to his \"workshop\" out in the garage. He's a widower and told me that he still had his wife's FW that he had planned to spiff up for her one day, but that his arthritis had really slowed down his tinkering and now none of his kids seemed to really care about the machine anyway so it had just been sitting. He asked me if I wanted it instead. OMG! So, I came home with a very dusty, but working, Featherweight, plus a few extra parts — for $50.I didn't take a lot of Before pics but here are some of the \"highlights.\"This was the area around the motor. It's a spiderweb with the spider's previous \"dinner\" in the middle, or it's a moth's cocoon. I didn't really examine it too closely. Ick.The web, and this tape on the needle plate were the worst.The rest was really just simple washing and dusting. Plus oiling and lubricating.The seller told me that the machine had come with the striated coverplate shown on it here, but that he had also acquired a scroll plate at one point. So, now I have both. I'll probably sell the scroll plate on Ebay, because I don't need two and I like the simple plate in contrast to all the scrollwork on my treadle. I also think it goes with the FW's Art Deco style decals better.Among other \"extra parts,\" the machine came with two foot pedals. One a working Mercury clamshell and the other is the original Singer Bakelite pushbutton pedal. The Singer pedal needs rewiring and will probably be another Ebay listing mostly because I like the clamshell better, not because I couldn't rewire the pushbutton pedal.Finally, it also came with its case and some attachments, but I forgot to take pics of those. The case was very dirty and stinky, but I've wiped it out and it looks pretty good for its age, and it's sturdy.  Some of the attachments are familiar to me - like the ruffler and zipper foot. Others I've never seen in real life before. I'll do a separate post on those one day soon.For now, I'm going to try to \"whip up\" a TNT top on my neglected D1 and serger. Probably another Jalie, or maybe another of the Simplicity tops that I said I should put away but actually still want to make. I'll see what calls the loudest when I'm up in the sewing room.Have a good Saturday!"},

Oh rats, you just did, didn't you? ;-)As you can see I've moved in the treadle. I've also got the \"newest addition\" sitting on the cutting table at the moment. It needs a home too, but that might be just a clear-off space on the shelf under the table. I'm still playing with it for now so it can remain out while we get to know each other.The treadle corner used to have stacked Sterlite cabinet-drawers. (Click here to see a Before pic.) Those have now been dispersed to other places in the room, temporarily. I wanted a full view of the treadle whenever I walked into the room because it's just so darn pretty and this was the best spot to keep everything workable for me. It's a  good set-up, and Belinda's Victorian-esque heart pillow hanging above the treadle is a perfect accent for it. (It's not centered at the moment because, remember, those Sterlite cabinets used to be there.)I've never liked all the wasted space underneath a typical ironing board. And now that I've got some storage containers in limbo in other parts of the room, it's just screaming at me to come up with a better arrangement. I have drafted my two sons and the younger's girlfriend who loves to build things for making an ironing board \"station\" for me. It's summer, they're bored, and a simple project will give them something productive to do as well as provide me with something I've wanted. I'll work up some plans/measurements tonight and send them off for supplies in the morning.(Piled on the end of the ironing board are the capris that don't fit.)I still can't believe how my machinery has multiplied exponentially in just a few weeks. I've now got 4 working sewing machines, a serger, and a coverstitch machine. I'm out of room in here so I'm trying really hard to stop looking at Craig's List. As much. ;-)  It's fun though. These old machines really make a beautiful stitch. After finishing the ironing station plans, I'm going to work on a quilt block tonight (probably just reacquainting myself with where I am and the correct pieces needed) and stay away from clothes until the weekend.

{"title": "Resurrected", "date": "Sunday, July 5, 2009", "text": "This is my old Kenmore mechanical. It's about 15-17 years old. I bought it before I started really sewing, for occasional mending. Later it was also used for sewing on Cub Scout patches and making some curtains and valances in our previous house. It's not quite near the bottom of the line, but it's close. I don't even know what model it is, that's how NOT into sewing I was then. The only thing I wanted in a machine back in those days was a free arm. Compared to the treadle, though, this Kenmore is feature-rich and sparkling new. LOL! Today I pulled it out again and gave it a new assignment.You see, last week the Singer buttonholer I bought on Ebay arrived. I wanted it for the treadle just to play around with, but I soon found out I couldn't attach it to the treadle until I got a side-clamping presser bar and traded that out for the original back-clamping bar currently in place. (New side-clamping bar is on its way, so it won't be long.)Being the impatient soul that I am, I thought about hooking it up to my D1 just so I could try it out. But I decided against that in case something went horribly wrong or if it ended up scratching the bed of the machine. That would be too costly a playtime. Then I spied the Kenmore in the corner sitting in the banker's box my son's girlfriend used to transport it when she borrowed it a few months ago. The perfect sacrificial lamb, if you will. ;-)And here it is, hanging on for its (new) life.It arrived in this green plastic box, all pieces intact and looking nearly new. There's also an add-on set of templates. I think there's more templates than the 9 I now own, but again, I'm not sure. Anyone?? And while you're answering, could you also tell me if there's really any difference between the Singer and Greist buttonholers?I have no idea how old it is but the instruction book has a copyright date of 1948 if that means anything. Looking at the manual, I'm thinking that timeframe is close if not completely accurate.Here are my first tests. They got progressively better as I adjusted the stitch width (on the buttonholer itself). The one in the lower right corner is the best, I think.What fun this little device is. My D1 has an automatic buttonhole wheelie attachment thing (Perfectly Balanced Buttonholes or something like that) and generally makes nice buttonholes, but truthfully this little Singer attachment is easier to get absolutely identical no-fuss buttonholes from. Singer buttonholers are plentiful on Ebay and sell for well under $10. If you have a low-shank machine and dread buttonholes even a little bit - or just want to play with a new toy … Go Buy One Now. You won't be sorry. Did I mention that I love to enable pass around the joy? You only need a straight stitch for these little gadgets as they move the fabric and not the needle to make the satin stitches.Here was my experimental \"buttonhole station.\" Notice the foot pedal on the table. I was pedaling with my hand, just because I wanted everything within finger's reach. The Kenmore won't live on the cutting table and in fact isn't on it anymore. But it's on a little table I have next to the cutting table, with the buttonholer still attached, and within easy reach for when I'll pull it back onto the cutting table tomorrow to make a buttonhole in the waistband of my new capris. Oh, and the fabric with the test buttonholes above? That's the fabric for the new capris.Not more than a year ago, I wondered what the attraction was for sewers who collect old machines. Why would I want an OLD machine that doesn't do anything? My D1 is TOL, computerized with embroidery, and just about sews for me. I still don't know the answer to my question except to say that I seem to have caught the bug. There is definitely something fun about bringing a dirty old machine back to life, and there is a sense of connection to days and sewers past.On that note, another machine followed me home last week. Again, courtesy of Craig's List. I've forced myself to leave it in the garage until next week so I can actually sew something before I'm engrossed again in a tune-up and restoration. Here's a preview. Donna, I'm blaming you. ;-)"},
{"title": "Muslin Afternoon", "date": "Saturday, June 27, 2009", "text": "I'm back to the J Stern jeans pattern. Bet you thought I forgot about it, eh? But the twist for today's muslin is that it was completely sewn on …This!Talk about slow-going. LOL! First, there are no seam allowance marks on the needle plate so I had to eyeball it. (I will be adding some marks with a Sharpie, I think. I can always remove them with alcohol.) Next, I had to coordinate my foot motion with my fabric-moving motion. Like trying to pat your head and rub your belly *and* chew gum. Plus I broke the thread 3 times and I'm having a hard time seeing the needle hole to re-thread since the needle is positioned for threading left to right instead of front to back and my eyes ain't what they used to be. A new bright table lamp is high on the shopping list. (Aircraft landing lights anyone??)So, speaking of the treadle …As you can see by the pic above, its new red belt is in place, along with a new red felt pad for under the thread spool. Could we be any more color-coordinated? (Said in my best Chandler Bing voice, of course.)My new bobbins and winder tire arrived yesterday and I actually treadled a bobbin. That contraption sure makes a nicely wound bobbin. It even has an \"auto stop\" feature, so that you can't overfill it. Cool!Back to the jeans … I added about 2 inches to the rise and took in the CB seam by changing the back crotch angle. I did that adjustment after comparing the pattern to a new pair of Levi's RTW capris I bought last week that fit great. Yeah, I had to give in and buy some pants because my available sewing time hasn't been allowing me to sew all my own clothes anymore. I was thinking I'd just get something to tide me over, and was pleasantly surprised at the good fit of not just one pair, but two! I also compared other key measurement points between the pattern and the RTW capris and made some slight adjustments to flatten the hip curve and widen the inside leg width a smidge. I laid my muslin over my RTWs and they seem to be a good match. I'm not going to model the muslin because I can't close them. LOL! The RTWs are stretch denim and the muslin isn't. I'm going to just go ahead and cut real fabric next and hope for the best."},
{"title": "So, What to Treadle?", "date": "Wednesday, June 24, 2009", "text": "I know I'm not going to be ready to sew clothes on my new baby for some time. Plus, I'd still want to use my serger and/or coverstitch machine and they (and all my other sewing stuff) are in the other room. While I can see changing machines during a project, I can't see me going back and forth between *rooms* no matter how close they are to each other.But, I do want to use my machine for something \"real\" now that it's clickety-clacking along so nicely. (What a lovely rhythmic sound it makes!) What more appropriate than a quilt, right? I'm not a quilter, really, but I did start two ambitious Fons & Porter quilt projects SIX YEARS AGO (OMG, where did that time go??) and then life took over and I never made myself go back to them.I saw the \"Stars and Stripes\" projects on the F&P show and really liked them. I still love the look of the finished quilt and wall hanging and I've already got all the fabrics, with many pieces even cut out and waiting. So, that's what I'll be doing on weeknights when I'm too tired to sew clothing but still want to sew. I can vegetate in my bedroom with the DVR but instead of doing nothing else, I can sit at my treadle and make some progress on getting these two quilting projects done, little by little.I'll have to sort out what I have and revisit the book/instructions, but I can do that while I'm waiting for my new bobbins and winder wheel.To see what the finished versions should like and the rest of the blocks I completed in 2003, click here."},
{"title": "I Came, I Saw, I Treadled", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2009", "text": "Or … What Would I Do Without Donna?The new belt for the treadle came yesterday. Yesterday! I ordered it from California on what? Friday? Anyway … it came. DS#1 and I installed it. That was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I'll take a photo later, but it's a red leather belt to match my Red Eye treadle. How cool is that?So, I was all set to SEW! Well, without a needle at first to try things out. I sat down and it felt like I was on the stairstepper. OMG! Both sons were trying it out with me and we all actually got good treadle rhythms going but the needlebar was only moving about a millimeter. At best. Ack!DonnaH to the rescue. Again. You see, I really don't have any experience with anything other than my current Designer 1, a 1990's Sears Kenmore, and the machine my mom had (still has) while I was growing up, another Viking. I just don't know much about oiling old machines. Especially 93-year old machines. DonnaH advised oil, and plenty of it.Donna was right. Turns out I was much too stingy with the introductory cocktails. She was quite thirsty after all those years in a drought (the machine, not Donna!). More oil, gentle urging to spin and work in the new oil, and soon she was zipping along as good as 93 years ago. Truly amazing. Thanks Donna!So, I'm thinking, \"*Now* I can sew, right?\" Wrong.  … uh, the flat part of the needle must not face backwards like I'm used to. Back downstairs to the computer to check the online manual. Flat side faces right.Back upstairs and FINALLY, I sewed with my new baby! Woo hoo.Ok, it's not much, but my 5th try is a fairly straight line with uniform stitches. I adjusted tension and stitch length —  without help this time thankyouverymuch! LOL!Here are the results:1 - My first attempt and all I could do was 1 stitch forward, 2 backward, etc.2 - Getting better but tension is still off and those stitches are huge. Still a backward burp in the middle.3, 4 - Smoother, especially after I got going. Stitch length still too long.5. Near perfection. Got to work on how to actually start without going backward.The reverse.1 - Not enough to tell anything yet.2 - The thread was tangled in the take-up and I didn't notice until it broke. Oops.3,4 - Better5 - Very nice!I wonder how old this bobbin thread is? There's really no telling. But until my new bobbins and winder tire arrive, I'm stuck with whatever was left on it since I can't wind any more bobbins yet."},
{"title": "Night and Day", "date": "Monday, June 22, 2009", "text": "On the PR message boards, I joked that halfway into the cleaning process the machine was not yet showing a Night and Day difference, more like Night and Mid-Afternoon. Last night, she reached Night and Day status.I still need to get further into the bobbin winding area, which will require some disassembly (and a new rubber wheel). But my fingers and hands are sore and I needed to clean up the 2-day mess I had going in kitchen so that will wait for another weekend.Here are some more comparison shots …Front After:Front Before:Back After. Notice the area near the side plate (on the far right in photo), where the decal is not even faintly visible in the Before pic. I almost missed this decal, it was so covered in gunk.Back Before. And yes, Dani does have to be right in the middle in both shots. ;-)Side After:Side Before:Before starting the cleaning process, I noticed that it looked like someone had taped something around the neck of the machine, over the Singer logos. DonnaH explained to me that it was very common for women to wrap fabric around this area to use as a pincushion, with the resulting bunch of tiny scratches being called \"pin rash.\" While I was able to get most of the tape (or whatever) residue off, I could not get it all without damaging the decals further. It's just evidence that at some point in her life, this machine was used as more than a side table. I mentioned this little bit of trivia to DH — whose father is holding my MIL's treadle in his basement for me to have one day — and he confirmed that yep, his mother did the same thing. Funny. But I couldn't imagine sticking pins into my Designer 1. Then again, I also can't imagine it lasting 93 years. I wonder if the original owner of this machine had any idea hers would still be sought after almost a hundred years later."},

{"title": "New To Me", "date": "Saturday, June 20, 2009", "text": "Look what I brought home from Craigslist yesterday! She's a 1916 Singer 66-1 Redeye treadle in the original cabinet. She needs a new belt, a new side-clamping presser bar (she's got her original back-clamping bar at the moment) - both of which have already been ordered - and she needs a lot of cleaning up. But after 93 years, I think I would need some cleaning up too.The cabinet is in near mint condition. No significant blemishes at all. These pics below are the seller's, which show the cabinet better than mine.All of this for the amazing bargain price of $60 and a car ride into South Tampa. The machine has been in the seller's family since it was new. No one has actually sewn on it for years and years (attested to by the rusty needle still in place!), and it has spent the last 40 years or so being just a side table. The sellers were downsizing and she had to go. Their loss, my gain.This is my first antique sewing machine. I don't think I'm going to go nuts with collecting (although you should never say never!), but I've thought for a long time that these old treadles are quite interesting and beautiful and have wanted to grab a bargain on one for years. I think $60 qualifies.The cabinet will live in my bedroom for now. Our bedroom takes up half of the upper floor so it's pretty big and there's plenty of room for this (and about 6 more!) without blinking. The machine head is already out of the cabinet and back downstairs in my kitchen at the moment, as I start the spiffing-up process. After working on just one coverplate (not finished yet), I can see this will not be instant gratification.DonnaH has already been a great help to me in dating the machine and pointing me to sellers of parts. Donna has quite an impressive collection of her own, as you'll see when you follow the link to her blog, here.Here are some more \"Before\" pics of mine. One day in the near future, I hope to have her ready for the \"After\" shots and for actually sewing. Treadling ought to be an adventure!"},
{"title": "Happy Ending", "date": "Monday, June 15, 2009", "text": "This has nothing to do with sewing but I want to share it anyway.Last night, DH and I decided to go out for dinner to a local Chinese buffet-style restaurant. Both DS's and their girlfriends joined us. We were all set for a fun dinner with our largish group. We all piled into the car and headed out.As we were making our way to the highway, we traveled up one of the through streets in surburbia-land and were slowed down by other cars ahead of us dodging something in the middle of our lane. When it was our turn to dodge, we saw exactly what the roadblock was — a big yellow lab Old Yeller kind of dog laying on his side, head away from us, and his \"buddy\" standing next to him. Oh no!! There was NO WAY we could just drive on and not look back … and WHAT were those other people who did just that thinking anyway? Not to mention the creep who had hit him and kept going.We stopped the car and turned on the hazard flashers. The \"buddy\" dog had already taken off down the road and we couldn't get him. From the car, we could immediately see the dog on the road was still alive as his paws were moving slightly. DH and I got out to investigate. DH walked around to the dog's head and all looked fine there. There were some bloody wounds on the dog's front foreleg, but his legs all looked to be in normal position. There was a collar about 10 feet away (I don't even want to think about how that happened), but there were no tags on it.I called 911 and asked that they send an Animal Control unit to pick up the dog and another officer to direct traffic, which was starting to get a little out of hand with all the rubberneckers and us \"parked\" in the middle of the road. I really wanted to put the dog in our car and take him to an emergency vet but I was afraid of hurting him worse by the movement and effort it would take to get this big guy into the back of our car. An older couple came out from their yard and stood with us next to the dog, telling us they had just heard a loud THUMP! and were out to investigate. We all were talking sweet nothings to the dog to keep him calm and the good boy started wagging his tail. Poor guy. While we were waiting for Animal Control to show up, another man stopped his pick-up truck on the side of the road, got out and started walking to the group next to the injured dog. (I was trying to direct traffic at this point, since it was badly needed.) It turned out this man is a vet!! A brand new one, who had just opened his office nearby not even 3 months ago. The vet said he would load the dog into his truck and take him back to his office to check him out. Another man had also stopped at this point and joined us. He volunteered to leave his car so he could go with the vet to keep the dog calm and as comfortable as possible during the ride. Fearing internal injuries (the dog was still laying flat on its side with no effort to get up after the 15 or so minutes we had been there), we all thought that at the very least, this dog could be helped to go peacefully with a trained vet instead of just dying on the road, scared and in pain, with cars zooming past. We quickly made a makeshift \"gurney\" with a tarp so we could lift the dog in one motion into the vet's truck.Before the vet and other kind stranger left with the dog, I jotted down the vet's name and number, introduced myself and told him I'd call him in the morning. We called 911 back and updated the operator on the situation, and then got back into the car and went on our way, sad for the dog but happy that fate had sent the vet past us when we needed him.We went to dinner and after we got back home, I had already decided that IF the dog had made it through the night and the vet needed a foster volunteer, I would take him in. My sons kidded me, of course, knowing that we might end up with dog #4, and a big one at that. I fell asleep thinking about the dog.This morning, I called the vet's office. The dog was OK!! They had cleaned and stitched up his external leg wounds but had found no internal injuries. His owner had found out what had happened and picked him up last night, so the big guy didn't even have to spend a night away in a strange place. (The dog had gotten out of their yard and they were out looking for him when all this was taking place.)I even got a call from the Sheriff's Department this morning, following up to see what had happened to the dog.I love a happy ending! And I know which new local vet is going to get three new poochie patients, who are due for their vaccines this month."},

{"title": "Sneak Peak", "date": "Thursday, June 4, 2009", "text": "The dress is coming along, but I should've made a muslin. ;-)1. The bodice is too wide across my shoulders.2. My slicing and dicing to copy the inspiration isn't lining up the way I planned — for two reasons. First, I realized too late that the inspiration has a higher back yoke than what I drew, and second, where I had planned for the upper front and back to meet at the sideseams doesn't. Oops.Problem #1 I can fix with blunt force by making a CB seam through the neckband and bodice, tapering to nothing by the skirt section. It will be a PITA to rip and restitch, but it can be done. And while the CB seam wouldn't have to exist if I made a muslin, I can live with it. Especially since I'll never see it while I'm wearing it!Problem #2 I can't really fix mostly because I'm out of this fabric. Since it's a sideseam, it's not going to be glaringly obvious. I'm also thinking I can do some \"creative\" topstitching to make it look like it's a design element. We'll see on that one. I'm still thinking about it.So overall this will be a wearable muslin. Very wearable, just not as near-perfect as I had hoped for. But it's not like I'm going to be meeting the Queen in this  dress or pointing out any errors in real life, so I'm fine with it. I'm sure no one (besides all of you out there in blogdom) will even notice the fixes and after a week or two in the Magic Wardrobe, they probably won't even bother me anymore.But if I make it again, I definitely know what NOT to do. ;-)"},
{"title": "Mojo, Inspiration, Diving In & Giveaway", "date": "Monday, June 1, 2009", "text": "So, no, I haven't done another thing with the J Stern jeans yet. The mojo for them seems to be fleeting at the moment. I still want to work out the alterations and make them, but I've had something else nagging at me that just would not shut up.Backing up a bit …About a month ago, curiosity made me order the Palmer/Pletsch Full Busted DVD. It promptly arrived a week later. And sat. And sat. Well, because I could not motivate myself to work on the jeans this weekend (but I did at least finish the \"chore\" sewing of two valances for the bath and a \"body\" pillowcase for DS!), I decided to finally plop it into the DVD player and have a look. It's another winner from Palmer/Pletsch. (More below.)While I did not personally learn anything new from the DVD, it did motivate me to start working on a knock-off of a dress I've had in a still-open browser window for at least 5 weeks now. (No, I don't turn off the computer.) Every few days, I remember it's there and look at it again. And wish it was in my closet. Click here to look at it on the website.It's a pretty simple but non-frumpy denim A-line dress, and I can see myself living in it over the summer. Especially on the 4th of July with some cute new white or red flip-flops.So, I've silenced the screaming mojo and have begun making one. I'm using this pattern (B5131), which I searched for, found, and ordered right after I first saw the dress:Watching Marta Alto in the video motivated me to actually try tissue fitting the pattern instead of muslining it. Foolish? Maybe. Especially since I am a strong proponent of muslins and I usually think pattern tissue is evil. But fabric is cheap, my time is limited, and the worst thing that could happen is that the dress becomes the muslin/prototype. Right? ;-)The pattern is a pretty good match, isn't it? Slice and dice a couple of seams here and there, morph the sleeve into a slight puff, pin the tissue, try it on, and it's good to go. Or in theory anyway. But that's what I'm doing. Fabric is cut and I've started sewing it up.Wish me luck!================================So, back to the DVD (and the Giveaway). It's very basic at the beginning and most, if not all, of that info is covered in the book and the original companion video (FFRP Basics), which is understandable or else the DVD wouldn't stand on its own. But the rest, the \"meat\" of it, is new to P/P. Highlights include Marta Alto demonstrating FBAs on twist tops, empire seams, strapless tops, princess seams, a jacket, the \"Y Dart,\" 3 live models of all sizes, and I'm sure more that I'm now forgetting. Marta's style is very homey, a bit grandmotherly but in a good way. But she's direct, a good teacher who knows her stuff, and if you have any reservations about doing FBAs, you WILL learn from this video.However, since as I mentioned above, I personally didn't learn any new tricks and I have a tendency to never watch a DVD twice, I've decided to offer this up as a giveaway so someone else can benefit from the great info. Just leave a comment on this blog entry telling me to enter you into the drawing. I'll find one of those random number generator thingies and next Monday I'll \"draw\" a number to match up with the order in which comments are posted. I'll ship this anywhere, but please note it's in U.S. DVD format, so you've got to have a player that can play it or it won't do you much good. Unless you need a shiny plastic coaster with a hole in the middle. ;-)"},
{"title": "And Yet Another", "date": "Monday, May 25, 2009", "text": "All Simplicity 4122. Two wovens, two knits. I love them all, but I think it might be time to put this pattern away for a while so my entire summer tops wardrobe is not this one pattern, as I do still wear the first two from last summer.For this one, I left off the front button closure and just cut the front pieces on the fold. I decided to change this one up a little more and added a \"faux\" tie to the center front. I like this change as it gives the neckline a slightly vee shape, making it not quite so obvious it's the same exact pattern as the other three tops above.No further progress on the jeans. I really thought I'd have a long sewing weekend, but we ended up doing other things. Saturday, I had to hang around in limbo waiting for people to show up to look at the boys' old beds I had listed on Craig's List. If they hadn't been sold, they were on their way to Goodwill because I was so tired of them taking up 1/2 of the garage. Around that, we were picking up all the tree debris in the yard from the storms (still raining but at least it's back to the normal Florida pattern of sunny with afternoon t-storms).Yesterday I took the bed proceeds and bought a new gas grill with my sons in tow. They picked it out, telling me that they should have the final say since THEY would be doing the cooking. I noted this for posterity and then agreed. After bringing it home and setting it up, we then went to the grocery store and picked up some great NY Strip steaks, some fresh squash, and potatoes and had a DELICIOUS grilled meal. DS#2's girlfriend joined us and brought a dozen cupcakes for dessert. She knows DS's sweet tooth well because there exactly TWO left when I woke up this morning.Today, though, I was determined to sew and finish something, which is why I chose another Simp 4122. I may get back into the sewing room after dinner (grilled lime chicken) and work on the jeans pattern. If not, it's still been a very relaxing and enjoyable weekend. I didn't work a lick since Friday."},
{"title": "Rain Rain Go AWAY!", "date": "Thursday, May 21, 2009", "text": "Where is this place called The Sunshine State? It's been raining here for almost a week. And by rain, I mean ALL DAY POURING CATS AND DOGS. It *never* rains here more than a few hours at a time. Even during a Hurricane. The forecast for the next 5 days? Rain. And more rain. Seriously, I haven't seen this much rain day after day, night after night, in the 20 years we've lived here. It's making me crabby and sleepy. I haven't seen sunshine in days.The dogs are going stir crazy because we've only made mad dashes outside to \"take care of business\" but they have no interest in staying outside anyway. They think they do when we head to the door but then they step one foot out and run for cover. I feel the same way. And I have a football game to go to tomorrow night. Ugh. At least I bought a new huge umbrella the other week because it was in school colors and I know where it is. (Dripping wet in my garage.)OK, I feel (a little) better now. We really do need the rain because we've been in a record drought for years, but the upside of a drought is the great weather every day. I'm missing that.So, needless to say I haven't made one iota of progress in the sewing room. All I want to do is take naps. If only I could. But I did sew the waistband onto the J Stern Women's Jeans pattern after dinner tonight and that helps the muslin a little. I still will have to add to the crotch length and remove leg length, but I'm optimistic that I'll work out these and my usual fit issues and end up with some nice jeans. It's going to be slow going though so don't expect instant gratification. ;-)Here's a quick but terrible pic, with one knee forward. You can see my actual knee level marked by the red line and the pattern knee level in black on the muslin. You can see that I'm standing on at least 4 inches of extra length. And you can also see the tummy bulging over the wide elastic holding up the muslin. Feel free to ignore that.Here's the only other movement in the sewing room this week - my fabrics from Fabricmart arrived yesterday. Left to right: poly/Lycra matte jersey, rayon/Lycra jersey, stretch poplin, ITY jersey, stretch cotton. It's nearly summer so my heart is leaning toward aquas and greens as it seems to do around this time each year.A number of people commented asking for more information on \"wearable\" poly knits. I wish I had the answer, but it's a crap shoot for me. And it really depends on your own tolerances too. Many people can't wear poly knits ever. I can usually tell what will work for me by the feel but since I can't feel the fabric when buying online, I do end up with some winter-only fabrics. The print on the left above is one for winter. It just feels warm and heavy when I pick it up. The print second from the right feels lighter and drapier, like it will work for summer. The ITY knits seem to be mostly the \"good\" polys. I've had the most luck with them.Truthfully, though, *anything* is torture to wear here in West Central Florida in August when the humidity is a steady 150% and you start dripping the moment you set one toe outside. Cottons do breathe better but they stay wet and icky. The good polys wick the moisture away from the skin and the evaporation process is actually slightly cooling, as if anything is cool here in August. ;-) My favorite summer knit fabric is a high quality rayon/Lycra knit. They feel cool to the touch, breathe, and wear like iron through multiple washings. I tend to buy some of all that I find in the colors/prints I like."},
{"title": "J Stern Women's Jeans: First Impression", "date": "Sunday, May 17, 2009", "text": "Just a few sentences about my initial impression of the J Stern jeans after my first muslin. I have mixed feelings, which I always get when something doesn't fit me right out of the envelope. Which means I feel this way about 99.99% of the things I make. ;-)1. They are definitely shaped like modern jeans. I am not. I do not have thin legs. I added an additional 1/2\" to inseam and outseam before cutting my muslin and the first try does fit my leg width. (This is actually a good sign for me, especially since I had serious doubts when looking at the pattern pieces.)2. They are very low-rise. I am not. I added about 1.5\" to the rise of these jeans, front and back, before cutting out and they are still very low. I didn't sew on the waistband yet and that will help some. But I will definitely need more crotch length for these to feel comfortable. 3. They are designed for very long legs. I am not. The pattern knee hits about 3-4\" below my knee and I'm drowning in the overall leg length. And I'm NOT that short (about 5'5.5\") nor are my legs proportionately short.On the bright side, all of these issues are fairly simple to fix and the pattern is marked very well both for body landmarks and lengthen/shorten lines. The pieces all fit together exactly right and the instructions seem thorough and even friendly. I do admit to not reading them completely yet because I can sew jeans in my sleep. I will make these adjustments in spurts during the week and will cut and sew another muslin. At that point, I'll be ready to evaluate my usual fit issues which are being masked by the various lengths being wrong for me."},
{"title": "Hello Mojo", "date": "Saturday, May 16, 2009", "text": "The mojo was back with a vengeance today, and all I can say is it's about time!First up was clearing the mending and UFO's off the sewing table, and by clearing I mean actually doing the work. Two pairs of DS's shorts needed pocket repair. One on the front inside pocket bag. The other, to re-attach a back cargo pocket which had come unsewn down one side. (Sometimes I think I would like to be a fly on the wall at school to see exactly WHAT he does to his clothes.) Last was to *finally* hem the CJ wrap top I almost finished weeks ago.With a clear conscience and clear table, I was free to sew the Jalie 2806 I had cut out last night. Get out your sunglasses, this print is not dull. ;-)I bought this fabric on a whim a few months ago with a bunch of other prints. I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, especially with all that black in it and me not wearing black. The next worry was where all the circular designs would land. I had only bought 1.5 yds so there wasn't much wiggle room and I had to just lay down the pattern, cut, and hope for the best.I'm quite pleased with this top and the fabric now that it's done, except I think I need a pair of white capris to wear with it. The motifs are not smack on the boobs or the butt. Whew! The fabric is one of the \"good\" polys — great drape and feels comfortable even during the 90+ degree days we're now stuck with for the next 6 months.This is the view of this pattern with the foldover neckline gathers. It's my 3rd time making it (4th if you count my PJ top/muslin) and it won't be the last.Pardon Zillie's rear end. The photographer (me!) didn't notice the fabric was hung up until the card was out of the camera and into the card reader. Oops.The mojo was still in high gear after finishing that top, so I thought I'd get out my TNT Ottobre gathered neckline pattern and make that again. Except as I was starting to put away the Jalie, it occurred to me that the Jalie was also a gathered neckline tee and, well, what the heck, let's try it.This fabric is much more Florida-friendly cotton/Lycra jersey. Very nice stuff from The Fabric Fairy.This top is a keeper too, but I still prefer the Ottobre tee. The Jalie is much more gathered and looser all the way down the front. But since I've made at least 10 Ottobres, a little change isn't a bad thing, especially since I know I'll be making many more of the Ottobres for years to come. On this top, I bound the neckline and the sleeve hems with a brown knit from the stash.Before the mojo starting begging for mercy, I got out my new J Stern jeans pattern and pressed the tissue so it's ready to cut and muslin in the morning. If it works for me and I can find some white denim, it will be the white capris I now want for the bright top above.This last shot is just to show that I have actually hemmed this top. I think it hung on Zillie for a month with threads dangling. For some reason, I just could never make myself sew the hems until today. Weird, because I have been wanting to wear it and the coverstitch machine was already set up with the correct brown threads and needle positions. Mojo is odd that way and there's just no fighting the direction it takes.So now I have three new tops to pick from tomorrow for my exciting outing to the grocery store."},

But I needed a little internet break. ;-)(ETA photo on Zillie)I forced my mojo back because I wanted a new top to wear while my mom was here. As I was wearing a previous make of Simp 4122, I decided I'd sew another one but using a knit. I cut this out and started sewing it a few days ago. All that was left was to sew the sideseam, hem the sleeves and bottom, and do something for a closure.My mom and I decided last night we'd go shopping and to lunch today, so a mad dash to the sewing room this morning to finish the top. Forty minutes later it was all done, but with a couple of shortcuts. I hemmed the sleeves but ran elastic through the hem allowance to gather up the bottom. Then I overlapped and sewed the front plackets shut and sewed on 2 white buttons at the neckline, no buttonholes. The fabric is rayon/Lycra knit and is *so* comfortable. I love this top!It's View D below, but with a lowered/widened neckline and the sleeve hems from View B.More knits arrived in the mail yesterday and the mojo is definitely back because I can't wait to make more new tops."},

The dyes I used I purchased a long time ago from Elan when they still had a website. They are powder \"jacquard\" dyes which seem similar to the Acid dyes Dharma sells. You only have to add vinegar to the hot water/dye bath. I did this in a stainless steel pot. Most bra fabrics are nylon, which dye very well (and very fast). Polyester won't dye at all at home. If you don't know what color you want when you're done, sew with nylon thread (YLI makes some) so the thread will dye too. That's about the extent of my dye knowledge."},

It seems \"poofier\" than any of my other bras but I won't be able to know for sure until I try this on. I'll be able to sew out the excess if needed.

Right now, it's white with copper stretch lace. But I'm sewing with nylon thread and plan to dip the whole thing in dye when I'm done (and if it fits, of course).I took this pic to emphasize that when you are sewing a bra, you should be very careful with your pieces. Keep them laid out on the table as they will be sewn. You'd be surprised at how easy it is to mix up a left and right piece. I learned this the hard way a few years ago.That's my helpful hint for this evening. LOL!I plan to get up tomorrow morning and work on this some more. I'll post again when I have progress to show."},
{"title": "We Knew There'd Be Alterations", "date": "Saturday, April 25, 2009", "text": "But that's why I'm sewing my own bra, right? To get one that fits *me* (and the girls). Really, though, this one is pretty darn good for a first go. I'm thrilled.Here's the ugly muslin. Yes, those are fish. No, I have no idea what I was thinking. I hope I was thinking to use this for a muslin but it's been so long since I bought it, I can't swear to that.I sewed this tester just as you see here – simple straight stitching, no seam or edge finishing. I did not use channeling, wires, edge elastic, or even powernet. This muslin was just to test the fit of the cups and to get a starting point. I did use some strap elastic and real hooks, though. Safety pinned bras are just too hard to get in and out of. Trust me, I know.Because there's absolutely no support in this muslin, I tried it on over an existing bra to see if:1. Do the cups contain all they need to contain? Yes. The bottom of the cup is perfect. The top edge goes high enough.2. Are the seams hitting in the correct spots? Yes. The diagonal intersects the apex.3. Does the band go all around me? Yes. It's a bit big right now, but powernet instead of Lycra fish will fix that.4. Does the center panel lay against the breastbone? Yes. It's hard to tell over the RTW bra because the RTW is not as good in this area anymore since its wires are misshapen from age and wear.5. Are the straps in a good place. No.As you can see, there's only one area that needs adjustment. At least at this stage. I may change my mind after sewing the next bra, which will be a \"real\" bra with all the support-y things I left off of this muslin.Here's what it looks like on me. That white stripe down the center is just the odd fabric.And with the seams drawn in:Using the bra I was wearing underneath as a guide, I used a narrow strip of yellow duct tape to \"draw\" a line where these pieces should end on me. I actually just happened to have this duct tape in my sewing room. Serendipity!I haven't given it much thought yet, but I believe I'm just going to lay my pattern tracings over this edge, mark the adjustments, and trace two new pieces. I suppose this would be a \"narrow shoulder adjustment\" in a bra. ;-)As I mentioned, I did sew on strapping elastic and hooks. But I used a zigzag and contrast thread so it would be easy to rip and use over. That's a little tip in case you didn't recognize it. ;-) I'll leave this test assembled for now, at least until the next one is sewn.Next, I'm going to hop in the shower, take the dogs for a walk and then get back at this while the Mojo is still strong."},
{"title": "Weekend Sewing", "date": "Friday, April 24, 2009", "text": "OK, the panties are done so now it's time to get busy on the upper half. I've sewn my own bras before but for the last couple of years, I've been doing OK with finding RTW that fits. Until it was discontinued. And my supply of every last one in my size that I could find finally gave out.An old PatternReview.com thread on plus-size bramaking was recently revived and Heather posted some photos of a Danglez bra she's working on. Together with seeing that and Sigrid's beautiful Sewy bras over the last year or so, I was duly enabled. Off to ElingeriA.com to buy some European bra patterns, all of which are different enough from the few American patterns available that I just had to try them.The ElingeriA website is both German/English (look for the little flags in the upper right corner) and Michaela, the owner, is very helpful if you need assistance choosing sizes, etc. Note that Paypal doesn't always work when checking out so if you run into that problem, choose bank draft and leave a note for Michaela to send a Paypal invoice and she will take care of you within 24 hours.I ordered my patterns last Saturday the 18th and they were in my mailbox today — from Germany! Here's what I bought:After dinner, I traced the Danglez DB4 (first one above) and added the seam allowances. The instructions for these patterns are in German only and have no illustrations so if you don't know how to sew a bra (or read German), you'll need a reference. Correction:  The Sewy is well-illustrated. The Danglez are not. But Michaela does have an English instruction PDF for the Sewy bra on her website and those instructions transfer pretty well to the Danglez patterns too. However, specific basic techniques applicable to all bra sewing are not fully covered so bramaking beginners may still need a reference. The cheapest instructions would probably be a Kwik Sew pattern. More expensive references include Making Beautiful Bras and The Bramakers Manual. I have the former and the latter is on my wishlist. But because I don't really *need* it, it's still on the wishlist and not on my bookshelf. Although I did just get my first tax refund in about 15 years direct-deposited into my checking account today ... hmmmm .... ;-)After the pattern work, I went ahead and cut out a \"muslin\" using some very bright fabric I bought years ago for bras. I'll sew it \"down and dirty\" and will not expect a wearable bra out of this. I just want to know how it fits and for that, I need to sew the whole thing.I'll start sewing in the morning. It's been a long week and I may pass out over the sewing machine if I try to do any more on it tonight.A note for Marie-Claude: While you're correct that this is a Dutch pattern company, this is the German version of that pattern (I bought it from a German site). I believe the Danglez patterns do also have English instructions and, of course, Dutch, if you buy directly from their website."},

But it was a Royal Pain going through my coverstitch machine.So I fused black knit interfacing to the back of the strip and it immediately behaved.So, back to wrestling with the top.Can you see what I did?How about now?It's not the most elegant of fixes but it's really hard to see unless you're looking for it. And, most importantly, it worked. Which means now I can wear it and after I do the hems tomorrow, I can also move on to something else.

I ended up with 11, not 10, new pairs of panties.My panty drawer runneth over. ;-) Between new and existing, I now have enough to go at least 2 weeks without running out of clean pairs. I even tossed about 8 pairs that had seen better days. (Why is a single panty called a pair anyway??)The elastic is still warped out from all the stitching and stretching during construction but one run through the laundry and it will shrink back down. Here's a new pair on the left compared to an existing pair on the right. The only difference in pattern sizing is that I added an inch at the top of the waist for the latest batch so they'd sit higher on me and right under my pants/skirts waistbands. The elastic shrinks up quite a bit, doesn't it?The last step of Project Panty was to roll the big bunches of lingerie elastic onto some cardboard cards so it stays untangled and fits neatly in the drawer.I took pics of how I attach the elastic and I'll put those up as a little tutorial in a day or so since there were a couple of requests. But right now, I'm kind of tired of looking at lingerie elastic. ;-)ETA: I just did the math. The only part of this project that I'm counting as an expense is the elastic. All of the fabric is scraps from existing projects that would've hit the trash bin if not for panties, so it was free. 21.39 yds of elastic at 45¢/yd = $9.63, or 88¢ per pair. This is truly the one thing I do save money sewing myself, and the fit is priceless."},
{"title": "Under Where? Under There!", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2009", "text": "(Angie and Carolyn, the pattern is Kwik Sew 2908. I really like this pattern in general but if you decide to buy this one and make it, please read my review on PR as I have made a few key changes which involve some pattern alterations and construction changes.)I've had no sewing time this week until this afternoon and tonight so the panties are still in progress. I hope to finish them all tomorrow. Above are 10 pairs with crotch pieces and lining sewn, trimmed and turned. I got a wild hair this afternoon and cut 2 more pairs. My panty drawer will be overflowing! And I still have a lot of big scraps for future pairs.After I do the burrito thing (see my review link above for a link to the KS Beautiful Lingerie book instructions) to enclose all seams, I quickly zigzag the sides of the crotch to hold the two layers in place. I find this fast extra step really helps when applying the elastic in this area as there are no layers shifting. The extra thread is not even noticeable and most of it usually gets trimmed away anyway. For the natural (breathable) fabrics, I'm using self-fabric for the crotch lining. For the synthetic fabrics, I'm using white cotton interlock.Tomorrow morning I'll start applying the elastic. That's 10 waists and 20 leg openings, or 30 applications. I'm NOT looking forward to that part, but it goes a lot faster once I get started and am in the groove. The elastic below came from Sew Sassy, which has a great selection, great prices, and fast delivery.*  *  *  *  *The new car has over 500 more miles on it since I brought it home a week ago and I've only been 4 places.

Maybe it is \"your\" car.Kristy, you left a comment asking what about the dog hair from Chili in my fabric closet. I have three dogs. Dog hair is a fact of life around here. That's what vacuums and lint rollers are for, right? Besides, I'm a big softie when it comes to my poochies so they pretty much have run of the house, including bins of fleece in the fabric closet.

There's a critter in the closet. (See stepstool on the left.)Not just any critter, though. It's Chili! He found the bin of fleece scraps in the corner and has made himself a nest. He stuck his head out because he thought he might be in Big Trouble, but all I did was laugh and point him back into the corner, where he promptly settled in for a nap.While Chili was napping, I cut out panties from scraps (with NASCAR vrooming on the tube in the background).And stared some more at the CJ crossover top still in progress. I like the top. I like the fabric. But there's not enough give in the fabric and so I don't like it on me. Sigh. This will be a sausage casing wadder until I drop 10-20. And at the rate of things around here, that ain't happening anytime soon.In other news, I bought a new-to-me car this week. It's an orange Chrysler Pacifica. I've never had an orange car before but it's one of my colors, so why not. It matches my hair. LOL! I sure hope Chrysler is still around in 6 months, but my warranty is serviceable anywhere in the country, so I won't worry about that aspect.

I turned 47 (gasp!) yesterday and I'm feeling every one of those years lately. We'll see how much I actually accomplish, but I want to cut/sew the PJ pants to match the top above, cut/sew an out-of-the-house version of this top, cut/sew underwear, and rework some tab-top curtains into valances (last on the list both literally and figuratively).The top above obviously is done. I ended up not turning up a hem. It's a PJ top after all so it really doesn't matter. But this pattern is short on me, even though I added a generous 1-1/2\" to the length when cutting. I didn't want to be constantly tugging it down so I just serged the bottom edge. It looks lettuced but it won't after it goes through the washer/dryer once. Other than the length, I'm very happy with it. It's a nicely drafted pattern that went together well, fits great with only a couple small and expected adjustments, and is a little bit different from what I've been making lately. Although I *was* hooked on wrap tops a couple of years ago, they've all now aged (or sized) out of my wardrobe and this will be the only one. I want to get a public version sewn by next Friday, when I'll be taking out my peeps (my assistants) for a casual dinner.Tonight, I'm going to cut and sew/serge some no-sideseam PJ pants to wear with this top. Those are very fast to do and I should be wearing them to bed tonight.As mentioned, also on weekend agenda is new underwear. There's been a lively discussion on PR about making your own panties. Great timing for me because I'd already been thinking it was time for another batch and had ordered my elastics, etc. since my elastic supply was getting thin. Whether or not a sew-along is actually started, *I* will be sewing them. I may not finish them this weekend because assembly-line sewing is not my favorite thing to do, but I will definitely get them started. If I bring a DVD player into the sewing room, I might even get some done.Just typing this all out I can already see I won't be getting to re-working the curtains.

I think I mentioned that my voice had been missing too? Well, it was gone a total of 4 weeks, almost to the day. Unbelievable! But it's back now, although sometimes still a little croaky at the end of the day. One of the weirdest things ever for me. Someone else's voice, or none at all, coming out of my mouth.Anyway, today I felt extremely rested and back to my old self. But I still had  no idea what sewing project I wanted to start next. As I was scrolling through the Review Gallery on Pattern Review, I came across PattiB's review of the Christine Jonson Princess Wrap top, which caused the sewing mojo to start stirring. Thanks Patti!I've had this pattern in my stash for at least 2 years. Probably closer to 3. Belinda reviewed hers in May 06 (what happened to your pics Belinda??) and I bought the pattern soon after that, I think. So, yes, almost 3 years now. I shouldn't have waited so long.I cut a straight XL, although I did add length as I cut (and think I still will add more) and made my usual square shoulder adjustment. I also added width to the sleeves because I only wish I had Michelle Obama's arms! I think the top is going to be another winner.My \"muslin\" is a 100% cotton baby rib knit. I think I've had this fabric at least 3 years too. It's Baby Lulu fabric bought from a coop. Very soft and comfy - perfect for a PJ top. Not so perfect to wear out of the house as cotton rib tends to grow widthwise and progressively shrink lengthwise. But to test the pattern and possibly get a new PJ top - a good match in my book.I like how the wrap is gathered on one side into the princess seam. Nice asymmetry, great camouflage.Since this IS 100% cotton rib, after all, I serged clear elastic to the neckline to counteract its natural inclination to droop. I then just turned and coverstitched the edge. Because of the construction order, this top would be also be a great candidate for binding the neckline on the CS machine. I may try that on the next one from better fabric.So, after dinner I'll sew in the sleeves, stitch up the sideseams (they are pinned in the photo above), and hem it. Maybe I'll even have enough time to whip up some coordinating no-sideseam PJ pants. That's probably pushing it, so they may have to wait for 10-20-30 minute sewing during the week."},

The photos just do not do any justice to the embellishment though. I used 4 colors of crystals — aquamarine, yellow, red, and orange — which match the colors in the fabric. I applied them in a sunburst/vee pattern.The blurry shot seems to show the most sparkle, but it's still not it. Squint and imagine they are catching the light and sparkling. ;-)I spent the afternoon straightening up my sewing room. I had muslins, new patterns and pattern tissue strewn all about and I *hate* the disorder. So, I labeled the muslins and hung them up behind the door (because I'm not done with them yet), recorded the new patterns on my master list, filed the envelopes in my binders, and filed the actual patterns in the pattern cabinet. And, I folded up and put all the \"old\" pattern tissue away. I still need to vacuum the machines and floor, but tomorrow is another day.I was hoping during all my time organizing that something would jump out at me to make next, but I'm blocked.

I forgot to take my own advice from the previous makes and take in the center front. So now I'm contemplating ripping out the front seam and sewing it again. Well, at least ripping the coverstitching. I'll probably just serge off the original serged edges.

I really think I need to move them further toward the sideseams. You can't see them in the photo but trust me. They are not centered under the apex and they should be. I suppose ripping and resewing a couple of darts I should've pin-tested anyway is a small price to pay for not needing an FBA with this pattern.The sleeves are also only just OK. They're fine now, but I'm still flashing back to setting them into the armholes. For the next version, I need to remove some cap ease. These were a BEAR and shouldn't have been. One commenter said she had a problem with them too. But I think the problem I had was probably self-inflicted, since I cut down the sleeve pattern and the armhole separately and didn't walk the seams to test them together. But hey, no shoulder width adjustment necessary which is a first in the Big 3/4 for me.All in all, though, I'm generally very happy with this pattern and my new blouse. The only thing I don't like and can't change is the paisley placement. Oh well, it could've been worse.I'm not sure if I'm going to get to finish it before Sunday. Tomorrow night I have a work dinner meeting and Friday night and Saturday all-day, a conference. I'm finally going to be able to wear some of those office clothes I made last April. And the weather is cooperating by cooling off, so I might even dig out some of the pantyhose too. But we'll see on that. LOL!"},

DS#2's girlfriend made them and brought them over for all of us. And at midnight, there's even still some left! I wouldn't let anyone eat one until I snapped a photo. They were just so pretty.* * * * *So, I have actually been sewing a bit, still working on Butterick 5300. I cut and sewed a muslin and decided I was good to go on the bodice. The wrinkle you see below is a bad pin job - look at the bottom edge of the blouse!The sleeves were still an unknown until the muslin. The finished bicep width is printed on the sleeve pattern pieces. My pattern armholes were size 1x but my actual bicep width plus ease falls between the 1x and 2x measurements. I also had made that tuck across the bodice mentioned last post and so I scooped the bottom of the armhole to compensate and cut the size 2x sleeve to give it a try.In the pic below, the sleeve on your right is the 2x with no adjustment. Way too much cap ease. That's a big pleat at the top making it stand up.The sleeve on the left is the 2x but I didn't force all the ease into the cap and instead let about 1/2\" of each underarm seam fall into the seam allowance. In other words, what I ended up with was this morphed sleeve below. I also shortened it considerably because I hate those \"long\" short sleeves that scream frumpy to me.While I was taking pics of pattern pieces, I also snapped this one to show the difference between the A/B/C cup piece (left) and the D/DD cup piece (right). Oh, and those are Dani's nose and toes at the top of the pic. ;-)I still haven't found the fabric I really want so I pulled a second choice from the stash. Here's where I am as of tonight.When tracing the pattern, I overcompensated at the hips so it's flaring out too much. I already sewed the front waist darts all the way to the hem and I'll sew deeper sideseam allowances. I think I'm also going to purposely lose the vents at the bottom. I don't need them. I also still need to sew the back waist darts.I made the view with the back yoke since it was different, and added piping because after sewing the yoke on the first time, it got lost and what's the point of a yoke if it can't be seen. But I think on the next version, I'm going to lengthen it. It looks a little short and out of proportion, don't you think? But that's a style choice and an easy fix, so I won't blame the pattern for this one. Much.I also decided to pipe the collar. You can't really see it in the full-length pic above, but it does actually show up in real life.I'm going to finish this tomorrow. There's no more football to distract me. (Sob!) Both sons will be with their girlfriends I'm sure, and DH is out of town. It will just be me and the dogs, and the sewing machines."},
{"title": "A Weekend of Good Sewing & Crappy Photos", "date": "Sunday, January 25, 2009", "text": "First, how disgusting sad is THIS?Next, Crappy Photo #1.I just cannot get the colors to photograph well. Both fabrics (yes, there are two) are chocolate brown. The collar, sleeves, and pants are solid. The torso front/back are patterned.The pants are yet another make of my TNT. The jacket is Simplicity 5352, which I made once before, 4 years ago. I went back to PatternReview.com and re-read my review after I had made this second version. Sewing must be like labor — you forget all the really bad pain. Or so I've heard — I had 2 C-sections myself and have never been in labor! If I had re-read the review before I started, I might not have made it again. But we had a cold snap the last couple of weeks and I had been wearing the first version a lot. Obviously, I got over whatever I didn't like about it 4 years ago. The only changes I made for this one was to add cuffs to the sleeves so I can push them up. I'm right there with you on those TNTs, Carolyn, especially now that my days are not my own anymore.Really, this outfit is not much of a leap from my PJs, but at least it's NOT my PJs. I shouldn't admit this, but the UPS and FedEx guys come here nearly every day and guess what I'm still wearing? Yep. My PJs. Working from home is really bad that way. Especially when there is no one around to see you when you take the dogs out for a walk around the yard. Oh, this is pitiful. I must resolve to get into the shower before starting work. Crappy Photo #2 and #3:No, the blouse is still a wadder but I hadn't taken it off Zillie yet and it matched, so it got a little use as a prop.The browns are a little better in these pics, but they do actually match in real life so something is still off.All fabrics and notions from stash. But I'm running low on brown serger thread now.* * * * *Moving on to the next project of the weekend …I read in the Winter issue of Sewing Today about this pattern (B5300) and its separate pattern pieces for larger busts. I was curious. So, when I renewed my Club BMV membership last week when all BMV patterns were on sale for $3.29, I bought it (and, ahem, a few others). Yes, I know how much I've dissed Connie Crawford patterns in the past. I still have gripes for 99.99% of them. But this one? Run out and buy it NOW if you're fluffy and well-endowed in the boobage department. Buy two.Below is the tracing on me. The only alterations I made to it were:1. Square shoulders as I traced (always for me)2. Blend to next size at hips as I traced (unfortunately, another always for me)3. 1/2\" tuck in the upper chest (a usual for me). I'll lower the armhole the same amount and then still use the same sleeve, which I'm pretty sure will not have to be altered. IOW, the armhole is not already too low/big.What I did NOT alter:1. No FBA. This pattern has separate pieces for A-B-C cup and D-DD cup (that's 2 sizes, not 5). The \"mound\" in the photo above is the D-DD bust cup.2. No shoulder width reduction. The shoulder seam/sleeve cap is not hanging down my arm. I may need to slice a 1/8\"-1/4\" off after I see it in fabric, but that's nothing. This pattern is actually cognizant of the fact that most women's shoulders do not morph to 6-7 inches wide when they gain weight.3. Dart height. Right on the money out of the envelope. Well, after the tuck. But even without the tuck, it was pretty darn close.I do have a couple of complaints about this pattern but it's the instruction sheets, not the pattern itself. There is no layout that shows the mini line drawings of the pattern pieces. You know how that is usually right below the different views on the first page of the instruction sheets? Nope. That is driving me CRAZY! I love studying those drawings in bed at night.Instead of those missing drawings, there are the same boilerplate instructions for alterations that I've seen in all CC's Butterick patterns. And most of them don't even apply to this top. The boilerplate tells you how to alter princess seams for a larger bust, but nary a word on darted tops. There is also no information to help you choose the appropriate bust cup size. Personally, I didn't need this, but I'm sure many others would. That's a huge omission IMO.Oh, wait. There is one pattern element I will gripe about. Back neck facings for the collared views. Grrrrr. Enough said.And the last bad thing about this pattern? I HAVE NO FABRIC ON HAND TO USE FOR IT! Arghhhhh!! My stash is full of knits, bottomweights, and solids. I want a pretty light-stretch blouse print. Maybe I can find something online (with browns) and get it here by next weekend. I'm sure a drive to Joann's would be a waste of time, although I do need more muslin. And brown serger thread.In case you missed the obvious from this post, I'm starting to get my life back a little. I have not worked the last few weekends. I've filed all the household paperwork that was piled up on my desk, made some good headway into the to-do list that has been sorely neglected, and I've sewed.Pretty soon I'll be back in full swing. I can't wait!"},

His team did make it to the playoffs, but lost in the first round. We blame the weather. It was incredibly cold, even by northern standards. Around 45 degrees with a strong wind. Wind Chill Factor is not usually a term heard in Central Florida, but OMG ... we were miserable, and sorely underdressed. Thankfully, we were able to borrow an extra blanket from people we knew and were slightly more comfortable. The boys on the field had no such luxuries and it showed. The final score was 14-7, so it was close and a nail-biter the whole time.Anyway, DS got his Varsity letter tonight and Santa is bringing the letterman jacket to go with it. I wore my Turkey Pants to the banquet and actually thought to snap a pic when we got home. The jacket is the one from Burda WOF that I blogged about last year and the blouse is the re-drafted Ottobre Woman \"vintage blouse\" I made for my (now unneeded) office wardrobe. Sorry, I'm too lazy to link to the older posts. I still love this jacket and I was even glad it was cold enough to wear it tonight.Wrestling season is up next."},
{"title": "TNT, or is it?", "date": "Monday, December 1, 2008", "text": "Today, TNT means not Tried-N-True, but Tried-N-Trash. I'm glad I used an unloved fabric for a muslin before committing to it.The drawing of View C (tie front) looks cute, doesn't it? I thought so. But I didn't read the fine print mentioning that the neck edge was unfinished. With Views A and B, you can always add a binding for a finished edge. Not so easy with View C. Yes, it can be done if I round the corners of the ties and then bind everything all the way around, but I don't know if I want to be bothered. I'm just not feeling the love for this top right now. I'll let it sit on Zillie for a couple of days before I make a final decision.It came out incredibly long. Like 8 inches or so. Easily fixed if I do decide to try it again.Here's a close-up of the neckline. I didn't do the topstitching around the raw edges per the pattern, but it wouldn't make any difference. Raw edge is still raw edge.Here's the neckline with the \"ties\" hanging. They aren't really ties though. Instead, the tails are slipped through a loop (also raw-edged) that's sewn into the yoke seam and just pulled into a tie-like shape.Here's the top on me. The fit needs a little adjustment. The sleeves are too tight and I would prefer a little bit more ease throughout. But overall, not bad. Especially since I did not make any adjustments besides to blend between sizes. That's right. No FBA. The darts are even in the right place.I also eliminated the CB seam for both speed and style. If possible (and it was with this), I prefer tees to be cut on the fold in the back.I could fix this one into a PJ top if I rip the sideseams and overarm seams and sew them at 1/4\" instead of 5/8\" in the places that need more ease. I'm not sure if I'm going to be bothered though. But I might ... I don't have very many long-sleeved PJ tops and the temps are going to drop again at the end of the week. (Uh oh. It's the next morning and I'm already mellowing.)Oh, one more thing I don't like about this pattern — it takes 2.5 yards of 60\" fabric. The top front piece has the sleeve front attached and has to be laid out in such a way that it sucks up way too much fabric. The short-sleeve version would be much more economic."},

Besides, since I don't wear tops tucked in, no one but us knows they're pull-on jeans anyway. And you won't tell, right? ;-)They look boring laying here on the cutting table, and I guess they *are* boring. But I'm boring. So these are perfect for most of my days.

Pitiful, I know, especially for an ex-New Englander who grew up with two-foot snowfalls regularly. So as the thermometer plunged to the 50s and even 40s, my need for longer sleeves rose. (As did my need for thick socks and another blanket for my bed!) Enter another Jalie 2806.Nothing technically new to add since my first post on this pattern, but it's definitely become one of my favorite patterns of 2008. I did get a little creative with the bindings. I could've gone for solid brown, or even self-fabric, but I really wanted a bit of color contrast too.Both fabrics are from Fabric.com. This, below, is the print used for the binding. A little fussy cutting and the yellow/brown print takes on a whole new look.I'm pretty darn happy with this one. I love the splash of yellow, and the browns of both fabrics are a near-perfect match."},

For him, that is.So he got another make of Simplicity 4287. But this time, I overlapped the seamed front sections before cutting for 1-piece fronts. Easy to do since there's no bust shaping in those seams.(Shame on Simplicity for taking this one out of the catalog. I really think they could've lost one of the myriad scoop-neck tunic clones instead and no one would've been the wiser.)And the result … ignore the goofy smile. The print is moire-like, it almost moves on its own. Very cool to a 16-year old. He's worn it every week since I finished it. I think it's a hit. And I love using knits for this pattern. He looks a little nicer with a collared shirt but there's nothing added to the ironing pile after it goes through the laundry.Back:"},
{"title": "Two Years Later", "date": "Sunday, November 23, 2008", "text": "No, it hasn't been THAT long since I last posted. ;-)I've been wanting to make View A of this jacket (Kwik Sew 3369) for at least two years now, but I never seemed to get started. Well the planets somehow aligned and slowly but surely I've finally got the jacket out of the fabric stage and into the closet. And not a moment too soon as the temps plummeted a couple of weeks ago.Of course, I couldn't just make it as is. No, that would be too easy and too fast, right? Instead, I decided I needed to add a lining and also a pocket to one of the front panel seams. The problem with adding a lining is that the front placket/facing for this jacket is supposed to be one piece, folded over. That meant tracing the original pattern and making new pattern pieces because, of course, I wanted to make it still more difficult and use a contrast fabric, which meant it couldn't fold over.It took me more than a week to trace this pattern and make those changes, working in stolen bits of time. (Remind me again that I like my paycheck because I really miss sewing all day long and I'm so behind on life in general.) But I finally finished tracing and editing the pattern and was able to cut a muslin. I had first traced the pattern pretty much as-is — just a little blending between sizes at bust level and the seaming changes already mentioned — because KS Plus patterns are already cut for fuller busts and I didn't think this jacket would be extremely fitted, judging by the photo and other KS patterns I've made.I was right. The muslin was hanging off me. Except at my butt, of course. ;-) All these months sitting on it while working hasn't improved that situation. Out came the pins to hold in the tucks and this is what I ended up with:I tucked a full inch out of the front and back yokes (faster than tucking the panels and it will make the pocket flaps not hit right at bust level) and across the sleeve. KS patterns are always too low in the armhole on me and their Plus patterns are twice as bad. I also tucked 1/4\" out of the center front edge so the jacket will hang vertical when open instead of swinging outward and I narrowed the shoulders about an inch. Here are all the tucks close-up:I transferred those changes to the pattern pieces, plus added to the back seams at butt level, and cut the real fabric, which is a canvas-like home dec fabric (from Joann's of all places!). The piece of white muslin sticking out in the pic below shows where I added the pocket to the front panel seam. I can't possibly have a jacket without pockets and the upper pockets are faux on my jacket since I don't need a pocket bag in that location, both utility-wise and flattery-wise. The poor jacket sat like this for a week, taunting me, until I could steal some more sewing time.But I finally did manage to finish it and I've been wearing it like crazy. And I think I need another one!Front view (see the pocket?):Back view:Close up (with more of Carolyn's buttons):Lining (wonderful solid rayon bargain from Fabric.com):Modeled:"},

Why I'm Glad I Have An Embroidery Machine and Software, Even Though I Don't Use It Much- - - - - - - - - -Apparently the football coach sent home order forms during summer workouts. Equally as apparent — none of them made it to our house. Typical teenage brain fade, I suppose.The coach decided this year that instead of wearing game jerseys on game days during school hours, he'd have all the players buy \"kits\" of various game day paraphernalia. (I'm sure there were some profits that made it into the football slush fund too!)  DS wasn't really paying close attention. He knew he didn't want or need the cleats or the shorts or most of the other things in the kit. And by the time he realized he actually *did* want and need the polo shirt (read: the coach expected him to be wearing it), it was too late.Last week, we bought a navy polo shirt so he could at least look similar to his teammates. He tried to describe the embroidery on the official shirt, but we just weren't connecting with the description. I told him I needed to actually see one. So, last night he brought home his friend's shirt and then expected me to perform digitizing magic today so he'd have a \"real\" shirt tomorrow.Abracadabra!I only use my digitizing software about 3 times a year so I always end up fumbling around before I remember what I'm doing. But a couple of hours later, I actually had a workable design. And even though I really didn't have the extra time, I forced myself to also make a couple of tests. I'm glad I did, because a few adjustments were then made and the final stitch-out is nearly perfect. (See, \"muslins\" are necessary for all types of \"sewing!\")My tests:The friend's original shirt:DS' new knock-off:It's pretty darn close, DS is happy, and there's no way a bunch of teenage boys and/or football coaches will ever notice the differences.

Nothing like waiting until the last minute, but at least I was done in plenty of time. And once again, I'm SO glad I sew.Before:After:I cut apart the man's 2X tee, laid my handy-dandy 1 billion times TNT Ottobre tee over the pieces and cut. A quick stitching of one shoulder seam, then running the neckline through the binder on the CS machine, then the other shoulder seam, sleeves, sideseams and hem, and I was D-O-N-E. I didn't even have to hem the sleeves since I cut them to keep the original hem stitching in place.On the job front — I got a gigantic raise today (I'm now salaried) and I'm on Cloud 9. I will also be hiring and training 1 or 2 assistants in the next month to help with the workload so mine will decrease overall, keeping the parts I like best and delegating the other parts to my new assistants. What this really means is that I'll have more time for sewing, and my non-work life in general.I've missed my blog and my sewing room terribly, but come the end of the day the last thing I want to be doing is staring at the computer screen some more so I've been vegging in front of  DVR'd shows. I've become a huge fan of Mad Men. Survivor, Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice and other fav shows are back with new episodes, and of course Sundays are spent watching football all day long. What I need to do is slow down for a minute and get a DVR for the TV in my sewing room so I can \"watch\" the recordings while I cut and/or sew. I really do prefer to multi-task and not just veg out with the tube.Except for the \"waste\" of the office wardrobe now gathering dust, this job has been a real blessing. The work is tedious but I actually like it. The hours are whatever I want them to be, the pay was good before and is now outstanding, and the commute is non-existent. I never have to spend gas money to get to work or wonder what my pups are tearing up in the house.Speaking of the pups, the weather has been cooling down enough to be bearable and we've all been spending more time outside during breaks in my day. Chili thinks his job is to hunt and catch all the lizards in the immediate vicinity and he's seriously not fulfilled unless he catches at least 1 a day. He plays with them for a while and then Dani comes along and eats them. \"Tastes like chicken!\" she says. ;-)Our kitty Gizmo left us last month. He was close to 18 years old so he had a good run. It's still strange that he's not following me and the dogs around when we're outside like he always did. But he was getting incredibly weak and fragile at the end and I know it was just his time.I'm hoping to squeeze in a trip to Joann's tomorrow around other errands. I'm nearly out of white and brown thread, for both sewing machine and serger. I can't believe it. I always have tons of the basics. I wonder if there will be anything else that catches my eye. I've been so busy I haven't even really had time to buy fabric. I know!I also hope to have something new from the sewing room to show off next week. Fingers crossed!Have a great weekend!"},

Grrr.The telephone company had to run brand new lines from the street to our house, which is more than 1,000 feet of line. Apparently the construction workers have been doing this all week up and down my road but the bright side of their incompetence is at least they now have a direct line to who to call to get it fixed fast and the technician was at my house within an hour. No internet gave me a chance to catch up on some non-crucial paperwork for work but it also put me a day behind on the more important stuff, which meant working Saturday too.The telephone company still has to come back out and bury the new line and the construction company owes me a new mailbox since they totalled that too. More fun stuff to deal with tomorrow.But I did finally get into the sewing room this afternoon. I putzed around with the Vogue Betzina jeans pattern, comparing it to a TNT BWOF pattern and sorting out pieces from the Vogue pattern that I want to morph onto the BWOF pattern. But then I decided I really wanted to actually finish something so I rolled those patterns up, stuck them on a shelf on my cutting table, and decided to return to them later in the week.Unfortunately, I didn't actually finish this top either. I couldn't let well enough alone and had to make design changes to my TNT pattern (BWOF 05-2006-111) by adding the pieced-in waistband front and back, and then I fought with neck binding for probably an hour. The binding strip kept wanting to curl off the edge of the neckline and also twist as it fed into the binder. I really needed 3 hands for this one, but settled for 2 hands and a mouth. It was quite a sight to see, I'm sure, but I did finally get it done evenly and to my satisfaction. I really didn't want to have to settle for \"almost\" so I kept re-doing it.I haven't pressed the waistband so it's looking very puckery in this pic, the sleeves aren't in yet, and the sideseams are just pinned to Zillie. But I'll do all of that in the morning, plus hems, and then it will be done. This is one of my favorite patterns and I've been meaning to make it again all summer long. Today being the official last day of summer means nothing here in Florida. It will still be summer for at least 2 more months, although thankfully the humidity is starting to subside a little.BTW, the crotch towels were a big hit, although DS' team still lost the game. The comments some of you left just cracked me up. But then how often do you get to comment on crotch towels? ;-)Have a good week!

{"title": "This Is All I Got", "date": "Friday, September 19, 2008", "text": "Yep. That's my most recent sewing. Pathetic, isn't it?DS#2 is the Center for the high school football team. When he plays wearing the hot game day jersey, he gets sweaty hands. (When I watch from the stands, I have hot flashes but I think that's something different!) He had cut up a school towel to make what we've … er … affectionately dubbed \"crotch towels.\" In other words, small towels he can stick down the front of his pants so a flap hangs out over his crotch and he can wipe his hands dry before he snaps the ball. That worked OK for Week 1. Until they went through the school laundry and, well, you know what happened to a bunch of rough-cut, unfinished towel pieces. I'm just glad it wasn't MY washer. Although in a way, as taxpayers, I guess it was.So last night, he took himself up to Walmart and bought a pack of cheap white terry face cloths, 18 to the pack. Tonight I rotary cut them in half to make 36 \"crotch towels,\" and then serge-finished the 36 raw edges. Voila. The extent of my sewing. You can't stand the excitement, can you? ;-) But at least it was useful sewing and it made DS happy.In other sewing room news …The Vogue Betzina jeans made it muslin #2 during the week. And that's as far as I'm taking them. This thinner leg View just is not cut for my shape, which I really knew before I started. But I wanted to try them just to try them, and I did that so I'm OK with them not working out. I've got other jeans patterns that are TNT and I'm not going to waste any more time on these. Instead, I'll morph the features of the pattern that I like onto a tracing of the TNT. But that won't be my next project.Here's the modified pattern for those wanting a peek.I slashed down the middle of each leg and across the upper thigh and spread the tissue very much like you'd do a full-bicep alteration. I did this because I just wanted to add thigh room without changing the pattern too much. But instead of moving the tissue evenly, I moved the inner halves toward the inseams, since I always need more fabric toward the inner thighs anyway. For the front piece, I slashed all the way up through the waist so I wouldn't have to skew the CF/fly area. For the back, I left a hinge at the waist, and I also added a wedge to the CB because (a) I needed more crotch length and (b) my rear isn't as flat as this pattern is drafted for so the increase in that angle would probably work.In general, those alterations were OK. But the pattern still needs work. If I were to continue with it, I'd need to take in about 2 inches at CB waist and at least 1\" per sideseam at hip level as a result of slashing/spreading the front piece all the way up and the sideseams beings too curvy for me. (I always think it's strange that I have to de-curve most pants patterns to fit my curvy self.) I'd also have to shorten the leg length about 3 inches.Between working, football, and football tee shirts, I've been SO busy the last few weeks that I can barely breathe. I know that I owe some emails, and they're coming, but I haven't even called my own mother in 2 weeks so don't take it personally. It's great working from home but the one major drawback is you don't leave the office every day. I sit down to check on one thing and before I know it, 2 more hours have disappeared. That's 2 SEWING HOURS! I haven't really read PatternReview in weeks, and I'm falling so behind on blogs. Sigh. But I'm promising myself lots of sewing time this weekend. Even if I resort to fast tee shirts.My boss is promising relief (and a raise!). We really need to hire another person but none of us has been able to slow down enough to be able to train that person. Typical Catch-22.But I do have my priorities and *did* keep up with Project Runway Australia (thanks Belinda!) and while I'm happy with its outcome, I'm sad it's over. I really liked the Aussie version so much better than the whiners on the current US run. I'm about ready to toss Kenley and her obnoxious nasal tone out a window. Anyody want to help push? ;-)"},
{"title": "There's Potential", "date": "Wednesday, September 10, 2008", "text": "The first muslin of the Sandra Betzina jeans pattern is done. Sorry, I won't be posting the pics I took. They are just too awful. Imagine 7 AM, white muslin, dark undies, PJ top with no bra, bed head. And well. No. LOL!But the jeans themselves aren't horrible. They don't fit out of the envelope, but that's no surprise. However, where they don't fit is exactly what I expected after seeing the pattern pieces.These jeans are narrow in the thighs, especially down near the knees. I am not. They are also for a more flat-tushied shape, which I've never been.Backtracking a moment … there are actually two completely different patterns in the envelope. One is for full-length jeans and the other is for capris. The full-length jeans are narrow through the leg. The capris are much fuller. Even though I knew the capris would probably fit my thighs better, I tried the jeans anyway because I wanted to, well, try them.But they're actually not as bad on me as other jeans patterns made straight from the pattern so I'm encouraged. They fit me a lot like many RTW jeans. Jeans that I would never buy. But these are better than RTW for one important reason — I can fix them before they're made.So that's what I'll do. I need more thigh/knee room, I need to add crotch length to go over the backside and I need to take in the CB. I'll make another muslin after those changes and evaluate again. I'm not saying that these changes will make the jeans perfect for me, but I'm not ready to toss 'em aside just yet either. Besides, cutting and sewing muslins is mindless sewing and I need some of that right now."},
{"title": "Yawn", "date": "Monday, September 8, 2008", "text": "It's Monday and I'm tired already. As you can see since I'm showing a photo of the same tee, no sewing has been happening here. But I did at least finish this one, and here's how it looks on me.I should've been quite productive at sewing over the weekend because my internet went down Friday night and stayed down until Sunday afternoon, meaning I couldn't do any paying work or email or anything. (Don't ask me how I feel about Verizon right now.) I kept thinking I should go up to the sewing room and do something, anything. But I didn't. And then Sunday was spent in front of the tube soaking up the gloriousness that is the start of the new NFL season. During the last game of the night, we all enjoyed slow-cooked Memphis dry rub ribs that DS#1 bought and prepared for everyone. Since he didn't home from work until 4 PM, the slow-cooking didn't start until about 5, which means we didn't eat until about 9 PM. But it was worth the wait, and he was so proud of himself for planning it all out and executing.Oh, speaking of football … Friday night was DS#2's first real game of the season (last week's game was pre-season) and he made his debut as the starting Varsity center. They won! Woo hoo! It was a great night to be outside too, which is unusual for September around here. The humidity was way down, all the hurricanes traveling around gave us nice breezes, and I didn't notice even one mosquito. (I was finally wearing one of the new capris too!)OK, where was I? Oh yes ... the lack of sewing mojo. Between football games, I was thinking about why I didn't want to sew and decided it's two-fold. First, since I'm working from home and not leaving the house too much during the week, I don't really *need* anything so there's nothing that *has* to be made. And second, my stash is boring me. Well, not really boring, just not inspiring me. But I don't really need to buy any more fabric right now, so that's not really the answer either. Besides, the usual fabric sources are boring me right now too. (See, it's not like I didn't try.)Last night before dozing off, I decided to bypass the fabric stash and instead browse my pattern stash. A few recent purchases I had forgotten jumped out at me, so that's the direction I'm heading. Except for the time-being I'm only going to concentrate on muslins so I don't have to make any fabric decisions from the non-inspirational stash. If the muslins work, then hopefully my fabrics will call to me again. And if not, well, at least I'll have worked with patterns I've been wanting to try.Up first will be the Sandra Betzina's latest jeans pattern (Vogue 1034). After that, I'm eying Butterick 5223."},
{"title": "Finally Some Sewing", "date": "Tuesday, September 2, 2008", "text": "The capris are done. Should've taken me  a day. Ended up taking over 2 weeks. Sigh. I didn't get either pair finished to wear to DS' football game this past Friday night, but at least they're done now and I still have months of \"summer\" for wearing them. They are simple, pull-on pants that ordinarily would not have taken so long to finish but I worked a lot the last couple of weeks and by the time I was ready in the evenings to let the Sewing Mojo take over, the Mojo was too tired to see straight, nevermind topstitch straight. I was racing Friday morning to try to get one pair done, but it just wasn't meant to be so I stopped hurrying and went with wearing \"old\" clothes.Speaking of \"old\" clothes … This is my previous pair of denim capris. My Go-To pair that I love so much. They were dark crosshatched denim and until I laid them next to the new pair, I thought they still were.  Wow. What a difference. The two fabrics aren't identical, but they are very similar. I expect by this time next year, the new pair will look like the old pair and the old pair will be for at-home only. Seeing them together made me realize how lucky I am that I can sew up another nearly identical pair to replace the favorites. You can almost never go back to a store to get an identical replacement for a favorite garment.While the Mojo was still on overdrive, I cut out another version of my Coldwater Creek knockoff. I had hoped to finish it this morning but my coverstitch machine ran out of looper thread and I needed to get to work. So, here it is without hems, but it will be finished today come hell or high water. Oops. Not a very good expression to be using with all the hurricanes swirling around lately. (I'm so thankful that Gustav was not on nearly the same scale or path as Katrina.)Here's a close-up of the knot. Someone (excuse me for being too lazy to go look back at who) suggested that after serging the \"knot\" around the \"hole\", the knot could be turned inside-out to hide the serging. I experimented with that and you are right. Just be sure to first sew the knot wrong side out so when you flip it, the right sides shows and the seam down the center back doesn't. I didn't actually do it for this one because I had already sewn the knot with the right side out. I know this is probably confusing if you haven't actually tried this top, but when you're doing it, it will make sense. Really.There is nothing on the on-deck pile at the moment, which is highly unusual for me and it made me feel a little shocked and almost sad when I just typed that out. I must rectify that immediately!"},

Last I heard, there's another storm brewing so the fun never stops. Still no sewing. Work is keeping me SO BUSY! But it's a good busy, with good pay, even if it keeps me out of the sewing room a bit longer. And on top of everything else, it's football team tee shirt season again, which means collecting money, sorting orders, etc., etc. There is light at the end of the tunnel, which is not an oncoming train, so I hope to get those darn capris finished by the end of the week to wear to DS's first game of the season.It's just been one of those weeks, for 2 weeks in a row. ;-)"},

Oh yeah, before that I had to re-thread the serger and sewing machine so that counts as \"sewing\" time too.Back downstairs to take out meat for tonight's dinner and to add the ingredients for Foccacia dough into the bread machine.Soon, it will be time to start the paying work.I get a lot of stuff done when I get up early.

It's the middle of August and I've sewn only ONE pair of capris for summer, and they are not a favorite. I need some more go-to capris for every day. These 2 are going to be very simple pull-ons from my TNT Simplicity pattern that I've made lots of times before, but that's what I want/need for my stay-at-home/work days. Both are denim.

{"title": "Gimme Some Skin", "date": "Wednesday, August 13, 2008", "text": "Yet another use for my TNT Ottobre tee.I've been wanting a cover for Zillie for a long time, but I just never seemed to get a round tuit. Well, I found my tuit tonight. I'm so glad Zillie's bra, cami, and shoulder pads will never have to peek out again.I laid out my Ottobre pattern onto some Power Dry (recognize it Mary Beth?) and then chalked on some cut-on sleeves and a high neck and cut out the two pieces. Then I serged the sides and shoulder seams and put it on Zillie wrong side out. I pinned in some darts to eliminate all the ease in the tee and sewed them on the sewing machine. The darts aren't exactly even or straight, but I don't care. I wasn't going for perfection and these are doing their job just fine. The whole process took about 30 minutes start to finish, with the Olympics on in the background.Now all that's left is to take off the white tee Zillie is still wearing underneath this cover and to figure out what to do for the hem. I'm thinking a drawstring or elastic so the bottom cups under Zillie's bottom, but I may just let it hang free. I might close the sleeves too, but probably not. At least not until they get in the way of something. And I can see she needs a bit more shoulder padding to equal my square shoulders. But I'll need to find another tuit before I do anything.The one thing this really enforced is how easy it would be to pin fit myself if I had a true body double. Pinning those darts on a statuary figure was like child's play compared to the contortions and trials I go through to pin fit on my own body. I think I might see a duct tape double in my future, if I can get past the reality shock. I'll need a lot of spare tuits for that.Oh, and thanks everyone for all the nice comments on my Coldwater Creek rip-off knock-off."},
{"title": "Copying Coldwater Creek Knotted Keyhole Top", "date": "Sunday, August 10, 2008", "text": "The original Coldwater Creek top:My copy:Close-up:I started with the gathered front tee bodice from Ottobre Woman (02/2007). The gathered front is an important detail for the knock-off. If you don't have a pattern like this, use any tee pattern and angle/slide the top edge back from the fold about 1-1/2\" to create the gathering space in the fabric. (Thanks to Belinda for that great pattern hint!) The pattern as traced from the magazine on the left. My \"huge\" change, on the right.As you can see, all that's been changed is to cut out a U shape from the front.I used my coverstitch machine and 3/8\" (A) binder to bind the U cutout. If you don't have a CS machine and/or binder, you can use your favorite binding technique. (I'm too lazy to look for links for tutorials of other binding methods so you're on your own for that.)Next, bring both top edges of the U together and zigzag down between them for about 1\", catching each side in the ZZ so they are attached flush to each other. The right side is shown below. The ZZ will be covered so don't worry about thread color or neatness.Trim excess binding. Don't trim until now or you won't have a \"handle\" to hold on to for the ZZ'ing above.Bind the neckline edge.From a scrap, cut a strip about 4\" x 6\" Length is not critical here and the width is however wide you want the knot to be, plus seam allowances. I always wing it on details like this. With right sides together, join the long edges (I ran it through the serger), turn right side out and press so that the seam is in the center of what will be the back side of the knot.Wrap the tube around the top of the U you sewed together. The reason you want to start with the tube long is so that you have something to hold on to while you sew or serge across. I serged across to make the initial knot and then used my sewing machine to zigzag closer to the neckline binding without catching the neckline. Reposition the knot so this seam is at the back/wrong side of the tee.Pin the knot in place so it doesn't move and fold back one side. Arrange the gathers evenly and then stitch through the tee, catching the back of the knot. This will hold the knot in place so it doesn't turn and expose the seaming from the step above. Repeat for the other side of the knot. Unfold the sides of the knot you moved out of the way to stitch.The back side of the knot after tacking it in place.The front of the knot. Now finish the top as any other tee and you're done.The top on me. Sorry, but the brown is too dark to see any details. Hopefully you get the general idea.

{"title": "Jalie 2806", "date": "Saturday, August 9, 2008", "text": "Looking at these pics, the makeshift dickey/cover I made for Zillie so the contrast binding of the shirt would show looks eerily like real skin. Weird. But anyway …The top is done, and an explanation for securing the foldover by machine is below.I added the hem band to this one because …… I made a skirt to wear with it.It's my TNT Kwik Sew 3287, with a sewn-in contrast band added. I'll take some pics of me wearing these in a day or so. Today is so not a photo day.I was doodling with ideas to try to work in the solid brown contrast, because I wanted to break up the print and tie in to the neckline binding on the top. The others were just too much.Here's my pattern pieces with the back neckline reshaped, which I also blended into the front neckline.So, here's how I did the neckline. First, I bound the neckline with my coverstitch machine. I clipped a bit further than the Jalie instructions because I wanted to be sure the foldover would be clear of the machine foot when I was stitching the binding. It left a little \"hole\" which is OK because it's about to be covered up. The wrong side of the fabric you see below is the foldover moved out of the way to take this pic, with a piece of paper under it for contrast.Here's the foldover with the basting stitches in place and pulled to create the gathers. Once I had the gathers drawn up, I overcast the end of the foldover with my serger to hold the bottom edges together, which makes them easier to catch in the stitching that comes next. I then pinned the foldover in place on the neckline. (By the way, I placed the gathering stitches more toward the end of the foldover than the Jalie instructions show. If you follow the Jalie illustrations, they will show at the neck edge but I wanted to leave the stitches in place to hold the gathers so I moved them.)It's now folded over to the wrong side and held by pins.Here, the foldover is moved a bit so you can see the pins. Note that the pins do NOT go through the foldover at all. The back side of the foldover is pinned to the \"middle\" layer only.To secure the foldover by machine, push the foldover out of the way and sew from the vertical CF stitch line out to the edge of the foldover. My stitching is about 7/8\" long …… and  is highlighted in red below.Push the foldover out of the way in the other direction and sew this side, as shown in red.This is what it looks like from the wrong side. The foldover is NOT sewn all the way across. The red lines show the two separate stitch lines. They almost meet, but not quite.You can also see that my coverstitching doesn't cover the edge of the binding on the back side. The knit I used likes to curl and I find it behaves better if I have the binder set so the bottom is a bit wider than the top.TGIF!! I sure do miss my days when every day is a Saturday and all mine. LOL! But the paychecks that come every week help make up for that.I managed to get the grocery shopping done during the week which means I do not have to go anywhere over the weekend and I can hide in my sewing room with the Olympics on the TV and sew, sew, sew. (And football pre-season games have started. Yaaahooo!! The regular season is so close I can almost taste it.)I cut out a \"good fabric\" version of Jalie 2806 tonight after fixing the back neck on the pattern, and even sewed a little of it. Very little. My batteries were dying and I had already made one stupid, but thankfully easily fixable, mistake. I knew it was time to put it away for the night and start again in the morning.DS#1 went to an audition this evening for a seasonal job at Busch Gardens for their Halloween \"HalloScream\" nights and he was hired! He has loved dressing up in costumes since he was about 18 months old so he should adore getting paid for it. He'll be a zombie or some such and get to sneak up on and scare park visitors with a fake chainsaw. I think the \"costume\" is one of the reasons he wants to be a firefighter. (He starts school for that in a few months.) He's been hanging out at the volunteer fire department right down the road and loves how they take breaks up at Starbucks with their fireman gear on, even if they haven't actually been out on a call. Oh, and he rates driving the trucks pretty high too. Boys will always be boys! LOL!Off to bed. Stay tuned for photos of the new Jalie top tomorrow."},
{"title": "More on Jalie 2806", "date": "Wednesday, August 6, 2008", "text": "Here's the muslin, after a night of sleeping in it. My camera is hating photographing this color for whatever reason and it looks red. It's really more magenta, very close to the pink color in the PJ pants. But that's neither here nor there — let's talk about the actual top.It's very long and I've tugged it up on my hips so it's not hanging as I'd really prefer, making it look baggy and messy. But overall, the fit is very good. The only place I need to adjust for the next, and non-PJ, version is to lower the back neckline. I had this same problem with the Sweetheart top and after thinking about it a few minutes, I realized that I've had this problem with most (or even all?) Jalie tops that I've made. Does Jalie draft for a rounded back, which I do not have? I don't know. But I have to guess yes, because I don't have this problem with other pattern companies or even RTW.I made no alterations to the pattern except to blend between sizes as I traced. I started with a straight CC (16) for the neck, shoulders and armhole height and moved out at the sideseam edge of the armhole to the EE, and then stayed with the EE all the way down. Oh wait, I did make one actual alteration, but I did this before I cut out my tracing. I altered the shoulders for my square shoulders by 3/8\" and raised the bottom of the armhole the same amount.Although there is a slight dart in the form of a wrinkle trying to form at the bust, I'm not going to do an FBA. This is a tee shirt and it's perfectly normal for a tee shirt to have these folds without a sewn dart. Yes, I could make an FBA and transfer it to that gathered foldover. But frankly, there's already enough gathers/ease there and I don't want to increase the bulk.Before I went to bed, I had finished the top and figured out what I was going to do to change the construction methods I didn't like. I'm happy to report there will be no handsewing on the final top. And there already isn't any on this one, as I secured the foldover by machine and then ripped out the hand stitches. I'll take photos as I'm making the next version and hopefully they'll turn out and I can make up a quick tutorial.Jalie tees need a few more slight adjustments compared to my still-favorite Ottobre tees, but nothing complicated and so I think Jalies are now my #2 favorite for knit tops. One of these days, I'm going to try one of their patterns for woven."},

Who could blame them? Hanging out with your cool older brother and going out to all sorts of places is much more fun that being at home with the parents. They're in bed already, at barely after 11 PM. But before he disappeared for the night, I did manage to grab some modeled shots of the latest shirt.Here's the back. It seems to be a tiny bit snug across his backside, but it could be the way he's standing, which is basically the \"Mom, hurry up!\" pose. I'll make a note to check it again for next time.And since we're doing mug shots, I'll include a profile too.The other action in the sewing room tonight is the start of a muslin for Jalie 2806. I'm not loving the neckband/binding. Because it's not really a binding, it doesn't sandwich the neckline and is too floppy when the fold-over section crosses it. I've already decided that I'll trim off the seam allowances and bind the neckline \"properly\" with my coverstitch machine. But I'll have to change up the construction order a bit so that the fold-over section doesn't get caught up. I'm also not especially thrilled with handstitching required to tack down the fold-over on the wrong side. It seems kind of \"happy hands at home\" to me. I think there's got to be a better way, so I'll contemplate that while I sleep. ;-)I haven't tried it on yet. I'm going to go sew in the sleeves and then the sideseams before I go to bed.

{"title": "My Model Is Out of Town", "date": "Saturday, August 2, 2008", "text": "But he gets another new shirt as a surprise upon his return, and then I'll get a couple of photos of him wearing it.In the meantime Zillie is standing in. She's bra-less but still has a womanly figure that this man's shirt just doesn't quite fit. But the general idea is there if you ignore Zillie's hips and the shirt straining across her bust.For this version, I traced some of the pattern pieces so I could split the two-piece front into three pieces for a contrast section in the middle of each front. I did the pattern work during a lunch break a few days ago. Then I cut in spurts over the next couple of days and finally sewed the shirt last night.Another pattern change was to cut the back yoke in two pieces so I could chevron the stripes.The striped fabric is an olive green nylon (I think) knit and the thin black stripes are sheer, like a burn-out effect. I didn't use interfacing anywhere because it would show through. I knew this would make the buttonholes tricky but I used a water soluble stabilizer top and bottom and they didn't fight me too much. I had to make horizontal buttonholes, though, because of that sheer stripe even though I would've preferred them to be vertical. But I wasn't going to chance buttonholes running next to that sheer stripe. The wide black stripe is more of the same black from the last make of this shirt, a cotton/poly blend knit.Here's the shirt laid out flat. Both wide black stripes do actually curve like the left side is doing in this photo, but I guess I smooshed the right side in a bit more when I was laying it out on my table.Besides incorporating extra hip room for DS per the previous shirt, the final alteration I made was to change the collar, using Nancy Zieman's Express Collar method. This way, there is no seam at the front of the collar, which I think looks better for a knit. I did this for the last shirt too, but I forgot to mention it in my review.Here's the diagram from Sewing Express:And my altered pattern piece:Usually, the CB seam will be on the undercollar but because I wanted the stripes to lay diagonally on the collar points, I flipped it over and put the seam to the outside, as you can see in the photo of the back of the shirt above.I've used this collar method before and am wondering why I don't use it more often. It means there's only one pattern piece (and interfacing) to cut, on the fold, and it really makes collars go faster.I can't wait to see this on DS. I think the green will look great with his shocking red hair. But I'll have to wait as he won't be back home until Monday.Both of my sons drove up to Jacksonville, FL to spend the weekend with their 26-year old half-brother (DH's son from marriage #1) and to be \"stage crew\" for his band's show tonight.

They are the only boys between our two blended families and they have a strong bond. We're so \"blended\" that my DS#2 and my stepson's sister share the same birthday. And his mother and I have birthdays only 1 day apart, but she's older. Nyah, nyah. LOL!There won't be anymore sewing for me for a few days as I have some icky paperwork to catch up on.

(Still the same at-home job, but it's expanding.) It was a casual meeting and the first time we've actually all met in real life. But any opportunity to dress up a little more than my usual capris/tees home uniform is an opportunity I'm going to run with.The photo was taken after I got back home, which is why I'm a wrinkled mess. It was humid and raining, then add a round trip in the car plus a couple of hours of just sitting and you get a wrinkled linen skirt that is also kind of shifted off to one side after getting out of the car. Oops. I didn't catch that until I saw the photos.The skirt is the same Butterick 4877 that I made a couple of weeks ago. The green of the linen matches perfectly with the lighter green of the fabric. The photo does no justice to the in-real-life great color match.I love this Jalie pattern! Do you think it would be too much if I had, say, 10 of them in my wardrobe? ;)"},
{"title": "Down and Dirty Stashbusting", "date": "Sunday, July 20, 2008", "text": "Making PJs is very gratifying. It's fast sewing that doesn't have to be perfect since they are just pajamas, I get to use up older stash, and I can stretch out the laundering of my stuff a bit longer. (I think the latter is my favorite!)Both of these tops are the gathered front tees from the 02/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman. (So Belinda, who's ahead now in the count?) The pants are no-sideseam, Kwik Sew 2779. The green pair is not new. But I needed a short-sleeved top for them since the top I made when I made those pants is long-sleeved and too hot for summer in Florida. You would think with the A/C running 24/7 it wouldn't matter, but it does. My body knows when it's 40 degrees or 150 degrees outside, even if the inside temp remains constant.I haven't really fit this pants pattern because I just don't care if my PJs have a baggy bum or crotch wrinkles. The pants fit well enough and they're always made from knits, which stretches when you sleep in it anyway. The only \"alteration\" I've done is to reduce the CF length for my tilted waist so I don't have to pull them up to my armpits in the morning. ;-)Both tops are a longer length than I'd wear out of the house because I like more coverage when I'm sleeping. I don't like my shirt hems in my armpits either. I made the yellow top with extra ease because it's a really cheap knit that I just know is going to continue to shrink.I cut these out one evening last week, so it was all construction today. The fun stuff. But I was a little *too* quick on the draw when I cut up the scraps to use as household rags. Seems I forgot to cut a binding strip for this one. Oops.Oh well. I just dug out some plain white interlock and threaded up with lime green thread and called it an embellishment. PJs, remember? Who cares!I used my coverstitch binder for both necklines and also for the sleeves on the yellow top. I had to wipe off the cobwebs, though, since it seems like forever since I used any of my binders.And voila! Dirt cheap pajamas that took less than an afternoon to sew, and which look a whole lot prettier than sleeping in a ratty old tee shirt. The only problem with pretty PJs is that one may not feel highly motivated to change out of them in any big hurry in the morning. Ahem.Next on my agenda is to have a look at Jalie 2806, which arrived here Friday. I'm going to compare the sizing to both the recent Jalie Sweetheart top and to my ever-TNT Ottobre tee before deciding on sizing and/or alterations. I want to make the gathered fold-over neckline, a style that's been popping up all over RTW and which I've wanted to make since I saw one in a Burda WOF from over a year ago (too lazy too look up exact issue). I need to do it soon before it pops OUT of style.But I think right now I need a nap. That's what Sunday afternoons are for, right?"},

Fuchsia is not one of my best colors so I didn't want to frame my face with it.I can't wait to go somewhere tomorrow so I can wear it. ;-)I bought 4 yds of this print, because I wasn't sure how wide the fabric was between the contrast bands and borders and my luck would be that it would sell out if I bought too little. Turns out I used less than one yard plus some of the border for this top and the fabric has been restocked. I'm thinking I'll make a skirt to wear with the top as a 2-piece dress. I did that with another print and an Onion top and I wear them a lot together.  Very comfortable, and different from my usual capris and tees summer uniform."},

It's been a busy week with actual overtime for my at-home job and I'm being lazy. I can't remember the last time I was *paid* for overtime. LOL!But once the work week was over today, I was up in the sewing room. Well, OK, after dinner really. I cut out another Jalie Sweetheart top, using the soon-to-be infamous \"Bold Boho Chic Jersey.\" You know the one. Gigi made a Cosmo dress from it, Summerset made a top *and* a tankini, Karen made a tee, Cidell made a maxi dress, and EricaB just came home with some from her NY trip. Though the print is extremely distinctive, all of these pretty garments look different because of each sewer's unique cutting layout and patterns used. That's a pretty cool fabric (and sewers!) that can do that.I'll be sewing tomorrow, after a run to the grocery store. We're the Old Mother Hubbard family here right now and the boys are starting to melt away. ;-) Yeah, right.I also cut out some new Ottobre PJ tops during the week, and I have fabric out to cut coordinating PJ pants. Those will be quick projects, but will have to wait until after the Jalie top is done. Right now it's off to fold the laundry load that I forgot about.

{"title": "The Carcass", "date": "Saturday, July 12, 2008", "text": "I knew yesterday that the dress was never going to work on me. Yes, there were all sorts of things I could've done to make it a more visually appealing dress, and many of you made suggestions that I had already thought about. (Lighting it on fire crossed my mind too!) But instead of fighting with it, I decided to cut my losses and move on. Literally.Presenting the Cosmo dress skirt section, a/k/a Jalie 2794:It's sitting artificially high on Zillie. The neckline is lower cut than it appears here. I'm still debating whether to add the center front shirring, but I thought I'd sleep on it first.It was so nice to dust off my coverstitch machine. It was still threaded with lime green thread from hemming my slinky items last month. Poor baby, all neglected. It's also nice to finally have a new tee to wear tomorrow.I had one section of border remaining from this fabric and I used it for the binding and a bottom band. The bottom band was needed because I turned the skirt sections on the bias and by doing so there wasn't enough length to cut whole pieces of the tee front or back. I like the band and while it provides a bit of contrast, it's not so blatant that it screams, \"Look at my butt.\" ;-)I'll try the Cosmo dress one more time, with another fabric and with the crossover bodice. I still like the style of the dress. The problem wasn't the pattern but that this particular print wasn't the best match for a full dress on my curvy, plus body. Live and learn. Then cut it up and make a tee shirt.What a difference a day makes. Today I hate the dress. It just isn't very flattering on me. From the neckline shape, to the print, to the handkerchief sleeves, to the multi-color waistband. Nope.The neckband is still not attached, the sideseams are only basted and the length is about 3 feet too long. And those ties go on forEVER. I'll stop at this point and put it away for a while to see how I feel later, but at this point I'm not optimistic that the Magic Wardrobe can save this one. And besides, I'm kind of sick of sewing clothes I can't wear around the house. I want to sew tee shirts and capris and cotton skirts. I'm toying with the idea of trying to work the neckline into a vee to see if I like that better, but right now I'm not highly motivated. I do know that I probably should've made the wrap version instead.A few readers posed questions in the comments about using Power Dry for the waistband \"interfacing.\" I didn't use a fusible because I needed to sew the fashion fabric waist piece to the skirt while still being able to see through it so I could sew perfectly along the top stripe of the border print. A fusible would've made the back side of the waistband opaque. After sewing that seam I made another pass and sewed the Power Dry layer separately, stitching just inside the \"real\" stitching. I used Power Dry because it was handy, and like one commenter, I have a *ton* of it. On the bright side, I can tell the extra layer really makes a positive difference in how the dress fits and hangs at the waist. Oh, and the fiddly stitching is perfect. Figures. ;-)In other news, I was offered the job I interviewed for the Monday before last but I'm going to turn it down. I'll stay with the boring and tedious (but great time- and gas-saving commute) at-home job for the summer and set out once more for the real world in late August or so when vacations are winding down and  hiring will pick up again. Which means all my new clothes will just gather dust. Meh. Or maybe job hunting will be like boyfriends. When you stop looking, Mr. Right appears. LOL!"},

Slower than I want, but I haven't spent much time in the sewing room the last couple of evenings.The sideseams are only pinned at this point. I still have to sew the tie, and it has to be perfectly straight for it to match up with the waist inset. It's not the thing to do at the end of the evening so I'll work on that tomorrow.I did manage to squeak out the upper back bodice on the bias, but I didn't cut it as straight as I could've. At least it's in the back where I'll never see it. (And, yes, I did cut a bunch off the skirt length but the weight of the knit is dragging it back down.)I also decided to reinforce the waist inset, after looking at my similar RTW dress and discovering its waistband was double-layer. I was already thinking it could use some stabilization so it doesn't wind up at my hips by the end of the day. I used Power Dry instead of self-fabric not because of any magical properties it might have, but because I think I might just have enough scraps left of the dress fabric for a tee and I didn't want to ruin the chances for that by cutting two more waist pieces.Parting Shot (Summerset really ought to trademark this): My sewing companion Dani. She's really become \"Mama's pooch\" (as they all are!) and spends lots of one-on-one time with me in the sewing room. Of course, she's usually stealing things out of the trash basket to cart off and shred, but sometimes she justs hangs out and keeps me company. Tonight was hang-out time."},
{"title": "Final Audition", "date": "Tuesday, July 8, 2008", "text": "The fabric cutting is almost complete, which means tomorrow I get to SEW!As I was deciding how to use all the various prints/borders of the fabric, I had pretty much settled on cutting the upper bodice on the bias so the print would run diagonally. But to be sure before making a fatal mistake, I put Zillie to work auditioning both choices.My instincts were right. The bias bodice (on the left) looks so much better. With the bodice on the bias, the print is broken up in a subtle manner, instead of reading like wallpaper. ;-) There is turquoise in the print that matches the turquoise in the waist and neck sections, but it's not showing up very well in these photos. Maybe you can get a better idea of the colors from this close-up.I hope I have enough fabric to also cut the back upper bodice on the bias, but first I need to cut the sleeves before I'll know."},
{"title": "Fit Tweaks", "date": "Monday, July 7, 2008", "text": "Here's the complete muslin. I know it's not flattering on Zillie. But this is icky poly knit, with a slight sheen, some horizontal striping, and without any contrast to break up the solid blue. The fabric I have in mind for the real dress will look so much better than this stuff. Trust me.So getting past the fabric, the final tweaks to this pattern are:1. A slight FBA. I've changed my mind on this and have decided that I could use about 1/2\" more length in the upper bodice, as well as moving the dart point out as I mentioned yesterday.2. Scooping out the back neckline.3. Moving the shoulder seam backward a smidge, less than 3/8\". I'm one of the few women who sits at a computer a lot but does not have forward shoulders. I credit my mother, who always nagged me to stand up straight when I was a kid. I have great posture now. LOL!4. Raising the neckline another 3/4\" - 1\". I'll cut it at 1\" higher and then evaluate. I'm already thinking a vee neckline would be nice for the next version, but I'll stay true to the pattern for the first go.5. Cutting off at least 5\" from the pattern length. This muslin is 4\" shorter than the actual pattern because this is all the length I had in this fugly knit. And still, it's nearly to my ankles. (I'm about 5'5\".)And that's it. The skirt is cut from the size 18 pieces, but the front was already widened the same 1/2\" as the FBA before I cut these pieces. Other than that, no alterations and it fits great.Oh wait. I did widen the sleeve pattern before cutting the muslin yesterday, which is a typical alteration for me. But I did nothing to the armhole or shoulder length, and both are great on me. I like high armholes and these are high, but not too high or too tight.The alterations are done and next will be the real stuff. Cutting the fabric to use the print as I want will take twice as long as the actual sewing. Hopefully, I'll squeeze in some time tomorrow to start cutting."},
{"title": "The Heat Is On", "date": "Sunday, July 6, 2008", "text": "This is a muslin for my first HotPatterns pattern, the Deco Vibe Cosmopolitan Dress. A wonderfully nice PatternReview.com member gifted this pattern to me and since the huge envelope was taking up so much room in my to-make pile, I decided it was time to give it a go and regain that space.I traced a straight 18, which (according to the size chart) is near to my actual measurements but definitely smaller. I decided on the 18 after comparing the pattern to my TNT Ottobre tee pattern. The 18 was closest in the bodice to that. The skirt will definitely not fit me in an 18, so I'll need to make a partial test skirt to add onto this bodice to check how much more width I'll need and where/how to morph that onto the waistband pieces. Note to self: Check length of skirt too, to avoid wasting fabric.The bodice fits pretty well, but I do have some quiggles. First, obviously is the hoochie neckline. And this is already after raising it over an inch while tracing the pattern. (Is anyone actually wearing the original neckline, because every reviewer has mentioned raising it. And if so, were they arrested?)The bust space and dart height seems to be sufficient for the DD girls (amazing!), but the dart ends right at the bust point. Ouch! I'll have to back that off and redraw the dart.The shoulders and back neckline are wonky. I believe these are a direct result of the Wild Ginger software used to create these patterns. I recognize the awful back neck curve that I always have to redraw when I draft my own patterns with WG software. I don't have a particularly strange neck or curve in the back, and you can see how high it is on the dressform's standard neck. It's a software glitch, which IMO should've been corrected.The shoulder angles themselves don't match. The front is more sloped than the back. For me, this meant only altering the front piece for my square shoulders since the back shoulder angle was already \"squared.\" This worked, except the entire shoulder point is too far forward for me so I'll be moving the corrected seam backward about 3/8\". With that and correcting the back neck curve, I will eliminate the chokehold effect.I'm not sure how much more time I'll have to work on this today as household errands are calling, but I'll update here with progress as it happens."},

It's OK, but just OK. The problem is the fabric more than anything. It's shifty and limp and fought me the whole time just like if it were bias cut.The hem isn't crooked. It's that darn shifty fabric. It even looks like it's bias cut, with the diagonal-ish print. I think it needs something at the point of the V for the eye to rest on.

It's horrible, data-entry type stuff, but it pays very well and it's from home so the commute is great. But after 8 hours of working with huge spreadsheets and figures, I'm cross-eyed and don't have much brain power left for sewing. Still, I have found some time during the week to start a new top.I've been working, in dribs and drabs, on Vogue 8118 (now OOP). I'm going to make it with the short flutter sleeves and the tie neckline, omitting the back tie.So far, I've managed to do the pattern alterations and make a muslin. Here's the upper front bodice, altered. The yellow lines below are the normal slash/spread FBA. I had originally entertained the thought of being lazy and leaving the side dart but once I filled it in and folded it into place, I realized that it was going to overlap the empire seam. Oops. So I decided to close that dart and rotate it into the underbust pleats where it belongs. The green lines below are my slash lines to move the rotated dart into the pleats. (Click on the photos for a bigger, clear version.)Here's the final pattern piece with the side dart rotated into the underbust pleats.The lower front is cut on the fold so I just added tissue to the CF the same width that I spread for the FBA above (1-5/8\").I also added waist/hip width to the back piece and made a 1/2\" swayback tuck. I didn't do anything to the sleeves, since measuring told me that this flutter style would be more than roomy enough for my large biceps.Then I cut the muslin to test the changes and it's pretty good. I still need to make my usual square shoulder adjustment, but I needed a reference point for where my shoulders hit in the raglan sleeves so I decided to make that adjustment after I could mark a spot on the muslin. That adjustment will also move the empire seam down the 3/8\" additional that I still need right under the breast.Other reviewers on PR have noted that this neckline is low. I'm on the fence, but I'm going to leave it as is because I don't think it's too low on me (even with the SA gone) and the tie will provide additional coverage/camouflage. If I regret it, well, I'll just tie a really big bow.I'm not usually a fan of flutter sleeves, but the intended fabric is drapey and sheer and the sleeves will hang less stiffly than in this muslin. Plus, the sleeve doesn't go around the whole armhole which means it will be cooler to wear with the underarm open the way it is. Sleeveless, but not really.I'm going to cut the real fabric today and hopefully get it sewn. It's a pretty easy top, so it should go fast.* * * * *I'm waiting to hear about the Monday interview job. The interview went well and I've been told I am a very strong candidate, but now I'm not sure if I want it (for a few reasons). Sigh. But I won't make a final decision about it unless/until it's offered to me. There's also a good possibility that the from-home temp job could be permanent if I'm interested. But am I? (And if I am, what happens to my new wardrobe?) This job-hunting stuff is draining. But at least I'm making some money during the slow summer hiring season so it could be worse."},

I actually feel productive for today.The fabric is not really me for wearing, but it makes a pretty good ironing board cover and the green in it actually matches the walls. Even if I had been able to find a cover in the stores, it still would've been some hideous color or print that wouldn't match my sewing room so this is a win-win all around. (What is it with those hideous prints anyway?) I started by \"re-purposing\" this big Husqvarna ironing pad I've had forever but never used. I think it came with my sewing machine or some accessory kit I bought. I can't remember. It has a solid heat resistant side that I laid over my ironing board and traced onto from underneath with a Sharpie. I forgot to take a \"Before pic, so this is \"After\" I cut out my tracing. Obviously. ;-)Here's the heat resistant side.  After I cut it out, I separated the heat resistant layer from the padding to use as my pattern.I folded it in half and cut around it with a rotary cutter and arm, adding about a 1.5\" seam allowance as I cut.I serged 1/4\" elastic around the edge of my new cover with my serger's elasticator foot. Yes, Cidell, this is a perfect use for that foot — thank you very much! The serger thread left in the machine from the last project even coordinated.And voila! I was done. I put the padding layers onto the board on top of the old covers and pads and then put the new cover over all of that. I always keep adding on top. The more padding, the better. LOL!I have enough of this fabric for at least two more covers and my \"custom\" pattern is now on stand-by.

Shield your eyes from the shocking white underbelly. ;-)My first version of this Butterick 4877 skirt was from a stretch woven. This green fabric has no stretch, but the skirt still fits 100% with no additional alterations. This pattern is definitely and officially now a keeper. For the next one, I'm going to combine the bottom pieces of this view (godets & panels) to make a flounce instead. I'm not especially thrilled with how the godets stick out so much and I think a flounce will look smoother and more even. But don't think I won't be wearing this skirt. The sticky-outy godets don't bug me that much.I did remember to sew some twill tape to the facing seam allowance so it won't stretch out during the day. (I need to go back and add twill tape to the first brown version because the waist did grow a little as the day went on.) I decided to zigzag it on so it would stay as flat as possible when it fights my stomach. Ahem.This is what the inside of the skirt waist looks like. Not exactly what you'd see in RTW, but this ain't no RTW … it's custom! LOL!Because I've had such good luck with Butterick patterns lately, I succumbed to the Club BMV one-day sale and ordered a couple more: 4819 for the button-down shirt from Annette's review, and 5223 because I just loved Toya's version of it. I also bought V8489, mostly just to look at. Ordering through the mail during these sales is cheaper than gas. But then pretty much anything is cheaper than gas these days. Yikes.The next project is to do something about this:That's my ironing board. Yeah, pretty bad, huh? I'd been putting off making a new cover thinking I could find one to buy. Hah. I've bought and returned 3 that don't quite fit and the rips keep growing. It's time to just buckle down and do it. I've picked out a \"what was I thinking?\" denim print from the stash and will make the new cover before I go to bed tonight. Cidell says it takes 30 minutes.I'm kind of dragging today. Yesterday, we finally had the yard sale I've been putting off forever. I hate doing yard sales but we had so much stuff that was \"too good\" to just throw out and it's been piling up.  I was organizing stuff all week, then up late Friday night getting it laid out and ready, and up early yesterday to bring it all out and run the sale. DH parked his big pick-up truck down at the beginning of our driveway, blocking the driveway and with a sign on it stating our starting time. And the (expletive deleted) early-birds actually DROVE AROUND IT and continued on to the house! I was so irritated at that. I was already tired, it was 400 percent humidity outside, and these people drove on our yard trying to \"beat the crowd?\" Did they think they'd be welcome with a big smile? Hah! They obviously don't know me in the morning. LOL!But at least that's done, I've got some bonus cash, my garage is cleared out,  and DS can park his Mustang in it again. And my skirt is done. ;-)"},

I'm glad you all seem to enjoy my ramblings too.I'm still working on the skirt but I thought I'd show you how it looks so far. Both the jacket and skirt were basically just thrown on Zillie so ignore wrinkles, crookedness, etc. This is the best I do at 12:43 a.m. Plus, Zillie doesn't have my lower half curves and so can't even begin to fill out the skirt at the waist and hips.Thank you for all the wonderful comments on the jacket. I think this is one of my favorite makes ever. I found out today that I have a 2nd interview on Monday at a casual dress office and I'm thinking of wearing this outfit for that. I really want to wear this jacket somewhere! Of course, wearing this outfit on Monday does kind of depend on me actually finishing the skirt.Tomorrow is yet another interview with the full pantyhose regalia. I don't know how much sewing time I'll be able to squeeze in when I get home. The skirt still needs the waistband facing and to be hemmed.Speaking of comments … I know I'm really behind on answering questions.

{"title": "Techniques: Perfect Curved Patch Pockets", "date": "Friday, June 20, 2008", "text": "Pressing the curves on a curved patch pocket can be a pain and since I like doing things the easy way, here's what I do.1. Use the pocket pattern to cut 1 piece of lightweight fusible interfacing per pocket. I used Palmer/Pletch's Sheer.2. Measure the top turn-down allowance of the pocket and trim this from the interfacing. My turn-down is 1\", so I trimmed 1\" from the top of the interfacing.3. Overcast/serge the top of the pocket.4. Pin the interfacing to the pocket with the fusible side OUT.5. Sewing the two together, starting and ending the same distance from the top of the interfacing as the top turn-down allowance. My turn-down is 1\", so I started and finished 1\" from the top of the interfacing (the interfacing, not the pocket). The red dots in the photo below show my starting and ending points.6. Fold the interfacing down and out of the way. Fold the top edge of the pocket right sides together. Stitch as shown by the red lines below, being careful not to catch the interfacing.This is what the pocket looks like at this point.7. Trim seam allowances close to stitching, with pinking shears. Using pinking shears will notch the curves in the same step as trimming the seam allowances.8. Turn the pocket right side out. Use a point turner to turn out the top corners and use your fingers to \"wiggle\" the seams open and shape the pocket around the curves.9. Once you are happy with the shape, press the pocket from the front (fabric) side. Remember, it will be permanent since you will be fusible the interfacing in place, so make sure you have it shaped the way you want it to be.10. I fuse a strip of Steam-a-Seam under the top edge of the pocket to keep it from bagging out, especially helpful for this stretch woven. This step is optional.11. Admire your perfect curved patch pocket, topstitch the top edge in place (not shown here), and then attach the pocket to your garment.(Obviously, this will work for non-curved pockets too.)I haven't had much sewing room time this week so the jacket still languishes. I hope to get it finished this evening.I've had a number of questions about how the collar/lapels are sewn. I just used the method from Butterick's instruction sheet, shown below. Since the jacket isn't lined, this method works perfectly fine. I'm not too experienced with lining jackets yet, but does anyone (Belinda? Marji?) know why this wouldn't work for bagging a lining as well? Sewing the notched lapels and collar pieces was certainly a lot less fiddly than making two separate units of collar pieces.Click on the pics to enlarge them for clarity.This is the inside of the jacket, with the shoulder pads attached. BTW, the instructions are wrong about attaching the shoulder pads. They instruct to attach the pads to the seam allowances, which would be all fine and well, if the facing weren't sewn into the armhole seam (which was done a few steps before the pads). Obviously, a boilerplate instruction dropped in without proofing the method. I hand-sewed the pads along the shoulder seam of the facing only. I'll note this in my review, whenever I finish the jacket and write one.And before you ask, this is one of the shoulder pads. It's a raglan style, 1/2\" thick. Raglan pads work best for me because it gently curves/smooths the end of my already square shoulders. (It's sitting on a piece of linen that will be a skirt to coordinate with the jacket.)Next post in a few minutes will be a separate entry for a little patch pocket tutorial."},
{"title": "Stopping Point", "date": "Tuesday, June 17, 2008", "text": "The jacket is mostly done. I need to hem the bottom and sleeves, attach the patch pockets on the front, and add buttons. I also never did make it to Joann's this weekend for shoulder pads so I still need to pick up some of those too. For now, I just slipped in my \"try on\" shoulder pads. They aren't washable or covered, which is why I need to buy others.I added an inch to the length of the jacket before I cut it out. The longer length you see below is not turned up, so that extra inch plus the original 1-1/4\" hem allowance is still there. In the bottom pics, I've folded up about 3 inches, which would be about 1\" shorter than the original pattern. I think the ideal length is going to be somewhere in between these two. Or, in other words, the original length of the pattern. (I'm also not wearing a good bra, so the girls are not hoisted up to where I originally fit the pattern and darts.)I think I'm going to go with the neutral buttons below. I don't have anything else in my button box that I like better and I don't think fancier buttons need to compete with the print.Slow progress, but progress. Although the alterations were simple, I just kept dragging my feet around other weekend activities. Now that the pattern is altered, a muslin tested, and everything is cut out, the mojo is back and I'm moving along.Here's the front pattern piece. As you can hopefully see, the FBA is not huge — only about 3/4\". I did have to move the entire dart down about 3/4\" though. Even with the 1/2\" shoulder pads per the pattern, the dart was still pointing to my chin. ;-)I started with the 18 for chest and did NOT have to narrow the shoulders, which is unusual since that's a very regular alteration for me.  I did scoop the armhole just a bit but that's more personal comfort preference than anything.When I picked this pattern, one of the reasons I liked it was because of the way the underbust fit snugly and flattered the  model. Yeah, I know they use clips, pins, etc., but I decided I could get the same look with \"S\" darts (see Threads #107). It took a few tries with pinning, basting, and marking, but I think I've got it now. The waist darts end closer to the apex than  \"normal,\" but I've seen plenty of patterns and RTW tops that do the same thing so I'm fine with that. Plus the dart seam tends to get lost it the print when it's on me anyway.Speaking of the print … I actually managed to catch myself before making an ugly mistake. Usually, I cut back pieces that have a CB seam from doubled fabric, like you would for an On the Fold layout. But when you have a print that is anything but subtle, you'll more likely than not get an unpleasing visual between the halves. Like this:However, if you cut the two pieces single layer, you can decide where to divide the motifs. Luckily I had enough fabric to cut one more back piece (and before I sewed anything), making the entire back look much better. Don't you agree?I'll continue working on this today and maybe I'll have a finished jacket to show you tomorrow. Although not if the dogs have anything to say about it. ;-)"},
{"title": "Butterick Jacket", "date": "Saturday, June 14, 2008", "text": "No new pics, because the camera wasn't upstairs when I was trying on the muslin and, well, it's a lazy Saturday, right?To refresh, the pattern I'm using is this one, Butterick 4818:If you like it, buy it. It's going to be a winner. I do have some alterations to do, but nothing out of the ordinary. I need a slight FBA, maybe 5/8 - 1\". Hey, that's slight for me. But I think this pattern is drafted for a large C or D cup and I could probably get away without an FBA but doing the FBA will make it perfect, especially since I plan on wearing this jacket by itself and closed. I will have to move the bust point down, which means re-marking the waist dart too. Not a big deal, but Butterick should draft in this size range for less perky girls IMO.Other alterations needed:  Tuck out waist length in the back, let out CB seam over the derriere, re-mark back waist darts, add to hips at sideseams, and square shoulder (done when I cut it out). None of these are unexpected and they won't take long. I haven't done the sleeve yet, but I'm sure I'll need to expand it at the bicep as usual, but not too much as the flat measurement is close.I'll be using this floral fabric that I showed you in an earlier post:Also on the weekend agenda is some shoe shopping. Shoes/sandals that I can wear without pantyhose, once I have a job. If you've seen any on Zappos or another free shipping internet source that aren't too high or too expensive, feel free to offer suggestions. I'd rather do the online thing, but I haven't seen any that fit the bill yet.Oh, and I need to get some shoulder pads for the jacket. I noticed that Joann's actually had a TON of shoulder pads the last time I was there. Hopefully, there hasn't been a mad rush on them."},
{"title": "Blouses Done", "date": "Friday, June 13, 2008", "text": "The short-sleeved ivory Ottobre blouse finally has buttons.Here it is as part of an ensemble. You'd think by looking at this pic that I had actually turned the dress into a skirt, but …… no. It's still a badly fitting dress (trust me, it's worse than it looks here). Even though I've been putting it on/off over my head, today it finally dawned on me that it has a back zipper. Which will have to be dealt with if I do turn it into a skirt. Sigh. And look at that flip-flop tan on my feet already. I'm going to have to sit outside barefoot this weekend to get rid of those lines. LOL!This is what I'd rather be wearing instead of heels and those torturous pantyhose. And, in fact, I'm wearing it right now. Very comfortable and perfect for a hot and humid day. Well, except for when Dani jumped up on me and planted a nice dark mud spot on my leg.I really like the top and I'm glad to have something else to wear with the coral capris. The other version of this top matches the capris *too* well (think Giant Pumpkin), so I wear that one with denim or khaki capris or a skirt.I started pattern work on a Butterick jacket. Hopefully, I'll finish alterations and a muslin tonight and be ready to cut and sew tomorrow, around the dog park and other errands. I think having to squeeze all of my boring \"duties\" into the weekends is what is going to suck most about going to work. Plus, I hate crowds and that's all there is at the stores on weekends.

Is it a sign? LOL!The interview went very well. The job would be OK, I really liked the boss-person and I'm sure she liked me too. I *don't* like the commute, however, so if I am offered the job, I'll need to think hard about it. But I can see lunch breaks maybe making up for that. ;-)So, after the interview, of course I had to stop in and browse buy. Each of these was only $2.95 per yard. The two prints are sheer poly and will be short-sleeved blouses of some sort. The solid in the middle is a taupe?/olive?/brown? poly/cotton gabardine and will coordinate with everything I've made/bought recently. It has a wonderful hand and feels like it will last a long time. I bought 7 yards, enough for a jacket, pants and a skirt. (Stop smirking Carolyn!) This particular Hancock's is not the one I usually went to, before Hancock's closed all but this last store in the Tampa area. The woman cutting the fabrics actually sews and was talking garment sewing while she cut. How refreshing, especially compared to that meh Joann's that's more local to me. Maybe I'd even get a sewing buddy with a new job. LOL!I sewed this top yesterday. It's another make of Simplicity 4122, but I lowered the neckline/yoke so it would be cooler (temperature-wise) to wear. I think I'll be able to wear this one in an office, at least on casual Fridays if nothing else.To change the neckline, I just measured an equal distance down from the pattern neckline all around and cut away, after first photocopying the pattern pieces.Tonight will be a button sewing session, for this top and my Ottobre blouse. I'm using these buttons from Carolyn for the Simplicity top. They're clear with white speckles, and have a dimple in the middle. I think they're perfect. Thank you again dear Carolyn!Regarding all the comments to save the \"clown\" top. Thank you, but, um, no. LOL! I actually like ruffles and this style is OK, just not with this particular fabric. I look down and all I see is a bright splash of ruffle. It just doesn't work for me with this fabric. I'd never like wearing it. Yes, I could remove the ruffle and bind the neckline but this has been a UFO for a few years now and I'm just not motivated to do anything with it. Plus, the fabric is pure poly and unlike some of the nice polyesters available these days, this one just feels suffocating even when it's still on the hanger. I'll hem it and donate it. One day.I was doing a little tidying up in the sewing room and ran across these UFOs again. I've been planning to deal with them in one way or another but I had wanted to take pics first to show how really bad they are. I finally had the camera in hand at the right time and now we can all get a good giggle. (Remember to click on the photos for the bigger versions so you can see all the ugliness in full detail.)First up, a now-OOP Butterick (too lazy to dig out the pattern number) from years and years ago, when I first started sewing and knew nothing about fitting or FBAs.Look at the shoulder points falling off of mine! The  bust dart is about 2 inches too low for me, the  armholes are too big, and it's just a sack all over. That's because I picked the size using my full bust measurement, before I knew better. This fits me exactly like a RTW plus size blouse would.But look at how perfectly executed that wing collar is, inset square seam join and all. It's pure linen and a beautiful color for me too. Sniff. I'll never wear this one, obviously, but I've kept it around because all it needs is buttons and the sleeves hemmed and it will either fit my sister (who is much more broad-shouldered than me and is 6 feet tall, and used to RTW), or it will go to Goodwill. I still have the pattern but I'm pretty sure I didn't trace it so I really ought to get rid of that too. I wish I had a replacement for that collar.Next, Silhouette #600. Now that years have passed, my memory has faded about exactly what went wrong with this one. I sort of remember that all I did was my usual square shoulders alteration and choosing the D bust cup bodice piece but whatever went wrong, it was horrible and unfixable. And I wasted wonderful rayon fabric that I'm still not over. I can't say for sure that it was the pattern and not me, especially because the 4 reviews of this pattern on PatternReview all rave about it, but I do know that Silhouette patterns have completely symmetrical sleeve caps and they just do NOT work for me in a blouse. I did re-sell the pattern so all I lost was some time and that great piece of rayon.Judy Jetson shoulders:Last up, a McCall's top (again, too lazy to go look it up). It fits perfectly, so that's not the problem. But it's a clown top. Literally. All that's missing is a red ball nose. The combination of the bright colors and that very ruffled neckline is Just Not Right. I should hem the bottom and sleeves and donate it. To the Ringling Museum just down the road in Sarasota. ;-)DS#2 is on his way to football camp, which leaves me the rest of today and most of tomorrow for sewing. I've got a 5:30 PM interview tomorrow, but I'm not optimistic for a number of reasons. Not about getting the job, but because there's a good chance I will and I don't think I want it. Isn't that always how it works? ;-) But I'm going to try to keep an open mind until I hear the details and actually meet the principals, and hope that I'm pleasantly surprised. I also have a second interview on Monday for one of the jobs I *do* know I'd like."},
{"title": "A New Week", "date": "Monday, June 9, 2008", "text": "Thank you everyone for the nice comments on the Diana capris. Unfortunately, I hated them more and more as the day went on. They just don't feel good. I wadded them up and tossed them into the laundry bin in a fit of disgust. LOL!This morning, I put on a pair of my TNT capris (the embroidered coral pair) that I still love now as much as when I finished them. Then I dug out the new capris and tried them on again. After some pinching, pulling, and pinning, I'm optimistic I can at least get them comfortable even if perfect fit is beyond this pair. But it means ripping out a lot of stitching and topstitching, then taking in the CB seam and waistband, and restitching/topstitching. But I will do it because I want these to feel good so I'll actually wear them. And somewhere I hear my mother laughing because it used to be her \"job\" to do this for any pair of RTW jeans bought for me as a teenager. Even in my thin days I always had a very curvy shape and if pants fit my butt, they were huge at my waist.For those that asked, my TNT pattern is the OOP Simplicity 4068, pictured here. Yes, I know I should stick with that pattern and I mostly do. But sometimes I'm seduced and I just want to try a different pattern because, well, you never know. And the tee is from last summer, coincidentally also from that same issue of Diana but copied with my patternmaking software.I purposely don't have anything job-related scheduled for the next few days as I need to get DS#2 ready for football camp (laundry, shopping, packing). But I'm also going to spend some of that time sewing. I'm going to cut out a pair of TNT capris and maybe sew them, fix the Diana capris, and rework the neckline of Simp 4122 to be much lower and definitely sew that.Now if you'd like to see some beautifully fitting and flattering jeans, check out MaryBeth's latest, here. Love them! … And hate them, because I'm again tempted to veer outside the TNT pattern and I actually do already have this pattern in my stash. ;-) But if I give in to temptation, this time I *will* do a muslin."},

And I *do* mean the whole front! ;-)ETA: DS#2 took this for me after we got back from the dog park. They look better without my belly sticking out (although my hair is a windblown and sweaty mess). But they still aren't hanging as nicely as my TNT capris, so I'll be going back to that pattern yet again. These are just too pegged at the bottom. Kind of mom-jeans-capris. LOL!Back (I did leave off the belt carriers):Side pocket:Hem bands:Back yoke (which is actually even, etc. - just a bad camera angle here).Fly and facing. The button looks dark but it's shiny silver and matches the side pocket button.Inside pocket, where you can see I goofed and sewed the facing wrong side out.Next up is to sew buttons and buttonholes onto my ivory Ottobre blouse so I can wear the darn thing.

{"title": "TGIS!", "date": "Saturday, June 7, 2008", "text": "(Thank God It's Saturday!)Whew! What a week. No, no job yet (but I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a couple of possibilities.) Just a lot of running around and a lot of wearing pantyhose when it's 95 degrees outside, with summer humidity levels starting to kick in. That alone wears me out. LOL!The Diana capris stalled because I had it in my frazzled brain that I needed a D ring for the side pocket before I could make much progress. Why I was thinking that, I have no idea since the front pockets, fly, back yoke, and all the topstitching of same needed to be done before I could even think about the attaching the side pocket. Plus, I had to sew the actual pocket and flap, and topstitch them. IOW, at least half the construction. Then I thought I had a D ring around here somewhere but I couldn't find it, which meant a trip to Joann's, which I didn't feel like making after a long day out in pantyhose. It turned into a vicious cycle until last night when I finally made it to Joann's for the D ring, and a suitable button.Of course, while at Joann's I sat down at the pattern books and looked through them too because as we all know, when we're not sewing, we're buying sewing stuff.Here's the result of my shopping trip and a couple of pics of the capris in process.The Pocket. This is going to be a PITN to attach straight because the pintucks make it 3D and poofy. I'm hoping some Wonder Tape and/or glue helps with that.This is the back yoke, which is pieced. Another feature of these capris that I like.The D rings and buttons, both silver.Butterick 4818. This is the same model that Butterick used for the 4877 skirt I just made which fits so well and that pretty face and curvy-curves suckered me in for this jacket. ;-) But I do like the  pattern, especially the short-sleeved version for summer. (BTW, if you like that skirt pattern, it's probably time to buy it since it was pushed to the small pictures section at the back of the Plus patterns.)Butterick 5052. This is a Connie Crawford pattern, which I swore I wouldn't buy any more of. But I've always liked the vest in this one and so I decided to cave in and give it a try. But I'm already again not liking the CC pattern line because (1) the construction sheet is missing the line drawings of the pattern pieces and (2) mentions that there are different pattern pieces for the different envelope sizes and without the line drawings I can't see those differences. Plus, not that I care about the skirt, but the stylized drawing of the wrap skirt does not match the actual pattern.(I hope that Butterick doesn't get rid of all of their other Plus patterns in favor of CC patterns because all of the new additions are horrible, shapeless sacks.)McCall's 5395. Another  jacket with an option for short sleeves. I like the deep vee front, princess lines and two-piece long sleeves.McCall's 5665. Generally a muu-muu tent-y thing but something about the shorter view in the lower right tells me this will probably be very comfortable for summer weekends here during the Florida summers.I also had some more McCall's and Simplicities in hand, but decided against them for now. So I did show a bit of restraint. ;-)=======================Side Note: A few of you have asked where to find the Diana pattern magazine. The one I'm using is German and I bought it last year on Ebay from the seller Stoff-Art. Diana doesn't have an English version, although I think there's a French version with a different name that's escaping me at the moment."},

It was her birthday this week and *I* got the gift — a whole box full of buttons and even some very cool Riri zippers! Thank you so much, Carolyn, and a Happy Belated Birthday! Your thoughtfulness is very much appreciated!This photo doesn't show many details but there are lots of very pretty (and different from what I can find locally) buttons.I'll be using these below right away to finish my latest Ottobre blouse. I had wanted square buttons but didn't have enough in my stash. Carolyn sent an SOS for me to NOT go to Joann's to look for buttons since she knew I had a package on the way, and she was right! These are just what I had in mind (and she didn't even know I was thinking of square buttons).As promised last week, here are some pics from the Diana #23 magazine I'm using for the current capris-in-progress. This is the cover:And these are the capris:It was this pocket that suckered me in. I love side pockets on capris and this one with the pintucks and loop was all it took. I've actually had this page folded open and on my dresser for OVER A YEAR so I wouldn't forget to make them, but other projects always seemed to sneak in ahead.I also like the bands at the hems, and the shaped belt carriers (which I'm still debating whether I'll actually add since I don't wear tops tucked in and they won't actually show to anyone but me). Even the fabric I'm using is very similar.I've graded up and altered the pattern and have it cut out and ready to sew. But other activities have kept me out of the sewing room so they haven't progressed from that point.

I know.I will return to it, but what I really want to be sewing is new capris and a new top of some sort. You know, my old familiar casual sewing that's been neglected for all those dress-up clothes.I'm in the process of tracing a pair of capris from a Diana Mode magazine. The pattern doesn't go up to Big Bootay size so I'm going to be grading it. I also will be scratching my head as I try to figure out the pieces I need to cut from measurements only (hem cuffs, pocket tabs, etc.), as the magazine is in German and I don't speak/read any. I'll take a pic of the pattern photo later. I just didn't feel like going up/down, up/down to get the camera and then take the pics. Lazy. (Which explains the Big Bootay.)The interview this morning was ho-hum. Well, the interview was OK, but the place was drab and dreary. If I have to do this work stuff, it ain't gonna be in a dreary atmosphere. ;-)  But nothing ventured, nothing gained and I have more interviews lined up so I'm not going to worry about this one.

Sadly, none of its siblings are very much better these days and even sadder, this style has been discontinued. I had already bought a bunch more after I first fell in love, fearing their discontinuation. And now it's happened.  Sigh. Stupid, stupid, stupid bra manufacturers. Grrrr.  You know, I think this is something that men will just never be able to relate to. It's not like their whole self-image would change if, say, their favorite jock strap was discontinued. Are there even any more than two jock strap manufacturers and styles anyway?? But I digress …As you may recall, I did actually do some bra shopping over the past few weeks. While I found a few contenders, none of them are THIS bra. And so they sit, unworn and with tags still attached, in the bag on my dresser. I dread going through the bra trying-on process yet again so I've decided to try to clone this one. I've already got all the supplies I need, so what the heck. (And if it works, I'll be ahead $80 after I return those from my dresser top.)As you can see, it's a relatively simple underwire with a diagonal cup seam. Since it's not a seamless cup (which don't do well on me anyway), taking it apart will yield flat pieces that I can trace off for a pattern.I've taken apart half of the bra and will use the other half to check construction as I sew. The next step is to trace these pieces onto pattern paper, mark the direction of stretch for each, and then cut out my first trial.Sewing bras isn't hard. The frustrating part is that you pretty much have to finish the whole thing before you can try it on for an accurate fit (or not). No such thing as a fast and ugly bra muslin. So that's what is on my agenda today.Once I get the bra done, I'm going to move on to a new pair of summer capris. After all those work clothes, I think my heart is longing for some new casual wear. LOL! But, seriously, my best friend and her family are coming to Florida next week and I'd like to have something new to hang around in.I've got two interviews (Thursday and Friday) with two more for early next week. I'm using all my time around those for sewing, while I can. Although I'll have to carve out some housework time too now that I know we'll be having company next week.

I've been in and out of the sewing room all day … sew a couple of seams, go flit about the house. Sew another seam, play with the dogs. And so on.I will say one thing about this pattern, Who the HECK wrote the instructions?? While technically you will end up with a skirt that looks like the envelope, you might also end up with a few less hairs too. Well, not really, because none of the steps are hard no matter what method, but some of Butterick's are just plain bass-ackwards.For example, the bottom section which is pleated. The instructions tell you to sew the sideseams together and *then* baste and press in the pleats. Why?? When it's so much easier to do the pleats when the two sections are still flat.And the part I just finished … where the facing meets the center back zipper — which, BTW, I changed to an invisible zipper and am wondering why it wasn't an invisible zipper to begein with. I understand that some people actually *like* hand sewing and I have no problem with that. But hand sewing the facing to the zipper seam allowance is not the most efficient method, especially if you're in my camp of hand-sewing haters. ;-)  And why waste hand sewing time in an area that is so inconsequential?I'm not really grumpy today, although this post seems like it, doesn't it? ;-) I'm just scratching my head over the convoluted instructions and venting to other sewers. The skirt is actually coming together rather nicely and a quick try-on before I committed to permanent sideseams tells me the fit is going to be nice.The skirt will be done before the day is over. And if the lighting cooperates, I'll get a photo. But right now, I've got to take the dogs out. Again. LOL!"},

But once again, I'm stalled at the buttons and need to make a trip to Joann's for those before I can finish it.The fabric is really soft rayon with a woven-in micro stripe. It wrinkles as soon as you breathe on it, so I'm not sure how practical this will be for schlepping to/from work. I'll try some spray starch on it when I'm done and see if that helps.For this one, I detoured from the Ottobre instructions and sewed the collar down at the back neckline \"in the ditch\" instead of ……covering it with a bias strip per the instructions, which I did for the first blouse below. Oh, and these colors are actually pretty accurate for once.I've started sewing the brown skirt and will finish that up by tomorrow since it should go together pretty quickly. A quick look at the instructions has told me I'll be winging this one since Butterick's order and methods leave a lot to be desired.That's all I have for now. My days have been filled with sending out resumes and fielding telephone calls, around the sewing. No plans for the holiday weekend, except sleeping in and maybe a trip to the dog beach on Sunday."},
{"title": "Testing Day", "date": "Wednesday, May 21, 2008", "text": "The knit for Simplicity 3506 is now a muslin/wadder, which isn't breaking my heart or anything. What you see here was to be the lining. I goofed when cutting so both lining and outer layer are trashed. I think I like the style overall, but it needs some tweaking. It's generally just too wide at the shoulders/neckline. I decided to let it percolate in my brain while I worked on the Butterick 4877 skirt instead.For the skirt, I first made a muslin with no pattern alterations to see what was what. Two pieces to cut out and sew went very quickly. I left off the facings and bottom pleated section from the trials. The first muslin told me I'd need my usual fixes.The back pattern piece is on the left, the front is on the right. The waist circumference fits perfectly but I needed to shorten the overall CF length for my tilted waist. If I just cut the pattern off at the top, I'd have to redo the darts and then adjust the facings to match. Instead, I slashed and overlapped below the darts and below where the facing will end (you can see the overlap just under the \"3\"). For the back, I had to do the opposite and spread the pattern to go over the extra caboose terrain (you can see that alteration under the \"1\"). I also decided that I wanted the upper section to be longer so it wouldn't cut me at mid-thigh and so I added 1\" to both front and back at the lengthen lines. (That addition looks uneven in this photo but it isn't.)I made a second muslin and I think it fits perfectly now. I'm waiting for the new brown fabric to dry so I can cut out the skirt.Speaking of the fabric, I think I'm going to pass on buying more since I don't need another brown jacket at the moment. I hope I don't kick myself later. ;-)"},
{"title": "Open Mouth/Wallet, Insert Foot", "date": "Tuesday, May 20, 2008", "text": "So, the mystery of what fabric actually is the EOS fabric is solved. It's what I thought all along — the brown jacket fabric. Which means, yes, the Joann's fabric I bought yesterday is NOT an exact match. The color is off. I guess I should've checked that before getting excited last night and sharing the \"news.\" Sigh.So, now what do I do?? Go back and buy enough to make a jacket that will match the intended skirt (but which I won't sew for a while) and have two brown jackets? Or just sew the skirt and again forget about a suit for a while? Or go back and buy enough for another jacket *and* pants, to have three coordinating pieces? (Carolyn, you don't get a vote!   :grin:)So, onto less brain taxing stuff. The RTW jackets (sets, actually) that I just bought. I'm almost embarrassed to say where I bought them, but what the heck. Sears!! Yes, Sears. I never shop for clothes at Sears but I dashed in there to buy vacuum bags and on the way to appliances, walked right past these two jackets which were out on the aisle. I loved the colors and when I looked at the price tags, I *really* loved the colors. LOL! They were marked down to $30 each.  I tried them on right there and then, and they fit! And they're washable. And they go with things I already have. So, I'm over the Sears factor.Number 1, a green jacket with coordinating lined skirt. I love the green and I love the print too. My colors. (I see you nodding your head, Belinda.) The skirt is elastic-waisted, but it's already cut with a tilted waist. How great is that? I'm half-tempted to cut out the lining — which matches the jacket exactly — to make a cami and just wear the skirt with a slip. I won't. But I'm tempted.The jacket can also be worn with these paisley pieces. As usual lately, the colors in my pics are not true, so trust me on this.I would like to change out the buttons, though. They are black and I think they are wrong for this jacket and the combos. I'd like to find some that are greenish or at least not black. The only other thing I could find wrong with the jacket is the huge thread hanging out from under the collar.Number 2 is this jacket/lined dress combination. I'm not thrilled with the dress, but the jacket is worth tossing the dress for. These buttons are brown, and will be staying. The dress is OK, but the print doesn't feel like \"me,\" if you know what I mean. Maybe I'd like it better as a skirt. The darker color in the print is brown, and the whole outfit is more coral than how pink it looks here. The other problem with the dress is that it's sleeveless and the princess-seamed bust and armhole hangs down too low. I could probably just take it up at the shoulder seams, if I decide to keep it as a dress I'd wear.The jacket also matches this skirt perfectly, and the dark in this skirt print is also brown. Gah! I wish my camera and lighting would cooperate this week. But it's been cloudy outside and that makes the light in my sewing room wonky when color-matching.Love the pockets! Mostly because they are actually (lined!) pockets, but also for the cute embellishment. Just a bias tube of jacket fabric threaded through a little ring which matches the buttons.The loops hang free between pocket attachment stitching and a few stitches to hold the ring in place.I really need to snoop shop with my camera and a firm resolve to not buy anything. I see lots of easy details like this in RTW that I always forget about later. Switching gears again … On the cutting table is a fast top from Simplicity 3506:I adjusted it this morning and have cut the fabrics. Plural. I'm making a lined knit shell. It will either be a wearable muslin or a wadder.I have a few more days to keep working on the wardrobe. Interviews have been scheduled for next week. Gulp. (And I do have pantyhose now.)"},
{"title": "Suitably Confused No More", "date": "Monday, May 19, 2008", "text": "As I told Carolyn, one of the main reasons I haven't made a suit is because I didn't have enough of either jacket fabric to make a matching skirt. Well, I was in Joann's about an hour ago to pick up more muslin, some serger thread, and to trade a washaway marker I bought last week for one that actually works (grrrr, how frustrating!), and I looked through the fabric as I always do but didn't see anything new. Still, for whatever reason, today I really looked at the brown suiting fabric that's been there for months and like a lightning bolt had hit me between the eyes, I realized that THIS is my brown jacket fabric! I thought my fabric was the brown RPL that I bought from Emma One Sock a couple of years ago, but apparently I was wrong. (And now, besides feeling foolish — but thankful it wasn't real lightning — I'm wondering which stash entry actually is the EOS fabric.) I've had this skirt pattern near the top of the queue for a while (Butterick 4877), and I think it will become the skirt for my suit.  View D, the  skirt on the real model … who has actual hips and looks quite beautiful, I might add.Whether I actually will wear it as a suit is still to be decided, but it will be nice to have that option if I need it. Right Carolyn?  ;-) Oh, and a brown skirt will go nicely with the 2 new RTW jackets I bought over the weekend. Ahem."},
{"title": "This Is All I Have", "date": "Sunday, May 18, 2008", "text": "I thought I'd be able to take a few quick pics before heading out but that turned out to be a disaster. I kept tripping over the tripod and then cutting half of myself out of the frame and I forgot to turn off the flash on any of the shots where my eyes aren't looking in two different directions and, well, this is the best of the lot.At least the colors are better in this one, even if my hair is still soaking wet and my mirror looks horrible.This one, the colors are back to being off again (and I look half dead).And guess what a stupid thing I did this morning? Sewed the buttonholes/buttons on the wrong sides of the blouse, even though I do know better. I just didn't doublecheck myself. Arghhh. It's only a problem when I try to button/unbutton it and feel completely uncoordinated. But still."},
{"title": "Blouse Progress", "date": "Saturday, May 17, 2008", "text": "I love the collar of this blouse so I'm glad I decided to morph the Ottobre pieces with my PMB pieces and not just toss the whole Ottobre pattern. Of course since the blouse isn't done yet, it still needs a good pressing and the collar will look better than it does in this photo, but the shape is very nice on me. If I do say so myself. ;-) Collars give me fits in PMB. I never know what settings to use to get what I want without experimenting.The fabric has been in my stash for a loooooong time. I really thought it was polyester. My first clue that it wasn't was that this fabric holds a crease like no one's business. Polyester doesn't do that. A burn test confirmed that it's not synthetic at all (no hard, melted, plastic-y remains). I believe it's rayon or mostly rayon, which could mean trouble in the future because I didn't pre-wash it thinking it was poly. But I have steamed and pressed the heck out of it along the way and everything is still lining up without any obvious shrinkage, so I'll keep my fingers crossed and the blouse out of the dryer.Anyway … the fabric is very drapey. And the sleeves have gathered caps. Um, not by design, but I didn't test the Ottobre sleeve very well with my PMB armscye and it ended up with more cap length than I could gracefully ease. And hey, gathered sleeves are in so why not?But then I tried it on and the sleeve caps immediately drooped. Rats! So I put on my Mother of Invention cap and fashioned (read: completely made up) a sleeve head out of some horsehair canvas I have in the interfacing stash. It does the trick perfectly, providing soft support so it doesn't look like I've got a Working Girl leftover or linebacker shoulders. Hopefully it will launder OK. (Note to self: test this before throwing blouse in washer.)The blouse is done except for the bottom hem and buttons, but at least this time I already have buttons. They do really match the blouse but were uncooperative for photo/color matching today.Here's a shot of the blouse with the skirt. Again, colors are off. The lighter color in the paisleys matches the skirt perfectly, although the skirt color isn't really this color either.It's a very fitted blouse and does evoke the feminine look I was hoping for when I picked the original Ottobre pattern to begin with. I think it will be a great classic shape so I'll be keeping this morphed pattern. And one of these days I'll re-pad Zillie to match my curves, so my clothes don't hang like sacks on her in my photos."},
{"title": "Wadder", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2008", "text": "I worked on fitting this Ottobre blouse yesterday and finally threw in the towel. Usually Ottobre patterns are drafted beautifully, but something is seriously wrong with this pattern. I wrote up a review for it on PR, here, as warning to others, and the details are in that review. But in a nutshell the problems are (1) darts are in the wrong place for larger sizes and (2) the division between front and back pieces is completely unbalanced.Now that I'm looking again at the line drawing for the pattern pieces, I can see the problem with the front/back division, but the bust and front waist darts as printed on the pattern sheet are in reality positioned nothing like shown here. Instead, they are essentially in the armpit and do not even come close to the bust.I tried to fix the Ottobre pattern. Three times. The Ottobre blouse is a very simple design and it should not take a lot of work to make it fit. Once I stepped away, it was obvious that it would be faster to just print a pattern from PMB and morph the collar and sleeve details I liked from the Ottobre design. So, that's what I did. And it was faster. A lot faster. And a much better fit.Here's the progress so far. I've sewn the bust and shoulder darts and shoulder seams, and then I basted the sideseams to try it on. What a difference between this and my Ottobre muslin. What a lot of wasted time yesterday."},
{"title": "P.S.", "date": "Wednesday, May 14, 2008", "text": "Adding on to my earlier post today …Here's the lime slinky cardigan:I don't think I'll ever wear all 3 pieces together. That's a LOT of lime green slinky! But Zillie was already wearing the skirt so a triple dose is what I photographed.This is the print for the Ottobre blouse:Tammy/Izzie left a comment earlier about the weird dart placement for this blouse, and boy was she right. I had just finished altering the pattern when I came back downstairs and read her note. It's good to know that it wasn't just me scratching my head. But I've moved the dart (along with doing an FBA), and I think things will be OK now. I'll decide about waist darts after I've got a muslin sewn. I never match up with printed waist darts anyway so that won't be anything new.And, finally for you Sherril, a pic of the inside of the tie blouse.Clairee asked about sewing with this fabric since she has some too. I used the serger  and CS machine for everything and just let the pleats fall where they wanted. On vertical seams (since I cut it crossgrain), the pleats were flat. On the only horizontal seam, the skirt hem, the did sort of stretch out a bit which is why the hem has a slight lettuce/flutter look to it.I've been sending resumes out and now I play the wait game. While I'm waiting for the calls to pour in (getting up off floor now), I'm still sewing.I finished a cardigan from the lime slinky, which takes care of the last of that fabric. I I used Jalie 2566, which I've made before. I'll take a pic of it later. I forgot to bring my camera upstairs. (I'll also try to remember to take a pic of the inside of the tie blouse neckline for you, Sherril.)I just finished tracing a blouse pattern from the 05/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman. This one:I have a blouse-y print fabric to use, which coordinates with the RTW khaki-colored trumpet skirt. But first, I'm sure I'll have to do some alterations, so a muslin will be the next sewing I do.* * * * *Also, completely off the track for my usual blog entries, but if you believe in prayers or just good thoughts, please send some along to the Pollock family in Brandon, Florida. Forrest Pollock is the pastor for the church we attend. We don't attend often anymore but that's not the point today. Rev. Pollock and his 13-year old son were killed early Monday morning when the small airplane Rev. Pollock was flying crashed in North Carolina while he was on his way to a church conference. He leaves behind a wife and five other children. The days ahead will be a very hard time for his family, and for the entire congregation."},
{"title": "A Few Words on the Tie Front", "date": "Monday, May 12, 2008", "text": "A few of you asked in the comments for more details about the tie front top. It will be hard to show you without photos and I didn't take any along the way. But I'll try to explain it with just words.I cut two strips selvedge-t0-selvedge, each 3\" wide. I then sewed them with RS together at one short end and pinned the strip together with the seam allowance open. I didn't press with an iron only due to the pleats in the fabric. If there had been no pleating, I would've pressed the SA open.Next, I folded the long strip in half lengthwise, WS together. (Again, I would've pressed it if this wasn't pleated fabric.) I placed the joining seam of the strip at the CB of the top. I then pinned the strip around the neckline, stretching it as I went around so that the neckband would not flop over when finished. I don't have an exact method for this. I just do it by feel. It's between a 2/3 and 3/4 ratio of neckband to neckline.I stopped pinning about 1\" before the vee of the neckline.I turned the unpinned tie strip sections (one for each side of the neckline) RS together and sewed them together along the bottom and long sides, stopping about 1\" before where they'd meet the neckline. I sewed along the bottom edge diagonally so the ties would end in a point. I trimmed the corner seam allowances and used a tube turner to turn these parts of the ties RS out. I did it this way (with the neckband already pinned in place) because I was doing this \"on the fly,\" not taking the time to take measurements, etc. I know one could do this in a less haphazard manner, but I was winging it.Next, I clipped the vee of the neckline just up to the seam allowance. If you feel more comfortable with stay-stitching in this area, you should do that *before* you pin the tie to the neckline. I didn't staystitch.I sewed the tie onto the neckline as I had it pinned, stretching as I sewed so that neckline and tie met up flat. (Remember, I left ease in the neckline when I was pinning.)I stopped 1\" before the vee on either side. You don't sew all the way to the point of the vee because you need some room for the knot you'll make when tying the ties.The last step was to \"finger press\" the seam allowance toward the bodice and coverstitch around. (You can edgestitch with a single or double needle if you do not have a CS machine.) The seam allowances at the point were also \"finger pressed\" down and coverstitched. I just opened and sorta slid/folded the vee until it was in a straight line going under the foot as I used my CS machine, because you can't really pivot with twin needles. (Very much like you see here.)The end result is that there is about 1\" of the tie section below the vee of the neckline that isn't sewn together. This is OK because (1) it's a knit and does't ravel, and (2) tying the strips into a bow takes up that length and hides the opening. If this was a woven, I'd use Steam-a-Seam to close the opening.* * * * *From recent comments:Mrs. Moos mentioned finding lime slinky at Joann's. Just thought I'd mention that mine came from Nancy's Notions and it's still in stock. Along with a bunch of other colors.Carolyn was still plugging a navy or black suit. I don't wear either color. I *would* wear a brown suit but they're hard to find in RTW and I just don't have the fabric right now to make one. Really, if I had had enough of the either jacket fabric to make a skirt, I'd have a suit. But I didn't, so I'm going to just dazzle them with my well-coordinated outfits, resume/skills, and shining personality. LOL! Yeah, you can wipe off the keyboard now. But seriously, if this was NYC or Washington, D.C., I'd be more diligent about a suit. But it's Tampa, Florida. We're a bit less uptight here. ;-) Even on interviews. In fact, I'm guessing I'll actually be overdressed compared to most other interviewees."},

But don't let that stop YOU! Best wishes for a wonderful day with your own moms and/or kids.* * * * *Yesterday I worked on a couple of pieces to coordinate with items already made. First up is my \"Inspired by Carolyn\" top. She's been sewing a few tie-neck shells and after seeing the first one, I was hooked and knew I'd be stealing borrowing the idea.After sewing the skirt, I had just enough of the paisley print left to eek out a simple top. I used my TNT Ottobre Woman tee pattern, #5, the one with the the shaped vee neckband. Instead of using the neckband/facing, I cut two 3\" strips selvedge-to-selvedge (yes, the pleats really run horizontally) and seamed them together at what would be the center back, and attached the tie to the neckband. There's a few more steps than that, of course, but the end result is a pretty top that's as comfortable as a tee without looking like it *is* a tee.I left the bottom and sleeve edges unfinished. This fabric is a knit — with no stretch — and doesn't ravel. Hemming this stuff makes for a wavy edge (see the skirt) and while I love it for the skirt, I didn't want that for the top. It's a good thing too, because I didn't have enough fabric left to cut with a bottom hem allowance anyway.Next up was another fast BWOF skirt (04/2008 #131) from the same lime slinky as the BWOF shirred-neckline top.On the horizon will be a jacket from this fabric. I don't know what or when yet, and this won't be an interview jacket, but I'd like to have it for summer. The fabric goes with various greens and corals which are already clothes in my closet and to-be-made clothes waiting in the stash.Speaking of Carolyn (Hi Carolyn!), she asked in a recent comment if I had at least one suit (i.e., matching top and bottom) for interviews. I don't. And I won't, because I just haven't been stashing fabric in long enough lengths for an entire suit. I could probably buy something (and have to alter it!) but I don't think it's necessary. Looking professional, yes. Looking like a banker, not here in Florida. Unless you're a banker. I do have plans to make a solid brown skirt to wear with the taupe jacket; however, it won't match the brown jacket, so more conservative but still no suit. I wish I had more of either fabric. From now on, I'll know to buy twice as much. LOL!"},
{"title": "Tents Are for Camping", "date": "Friday, May 9, 2008", "text": "This is the white shirt I bought at Walmart a couple of weeks ago. I liked the fabric, the fit not so much. But it's actually pretty well made for a Walmart shirt so I brought it home to think about.I never buy clothes thinking I can \"fix\" them, but I decided to just go ahead and fix this one today so I would actually wear it. I need a plain white shirt. Yes, I could make it myself but I don't have any white shirt fabric in the stash (really!) and, like I mentioned, I like *this* fabric. It's a very soft stretch cotton with a subtle woven-in stripe. It took a couple of hours, but that's still faster than making one from scratch. It turned out pretty well, so I'm glad I broke my own rule.I put the shirt on and evaluated the changes I'd need. When I first brought it home I thought it fit (not great, but OK) in the shoulders and all I'd have to do was shorten sleeves and hem. I should've known better. No RTW fitted shirt ever fits me in the shoulder if it fits across my bust and butt. And the armhole is always too low. This one was no exception. Why I didn't see that at first, I don't know. But I'm stubborn so I couldn't let that stop me. ;-)I started pinning. I made a tuck at the shoulder seam on the shoulder side, making no changes to the sleeve. I ripped out the top part of the armhole seam and pinned the sleeve further into the armhole to see how it was going to fit. It seemed like it was going to work great. So I basted it and tried it on again. The shoulders were still too wide. I ripped the first basting and tried it again deeper. This time, it looked good so I went ahead and marked a cutting line and then cut a big wedge out of the armhole.This is what was cut out of the top 2/3 of the armhole. I could start ranting about RTW and pattern manufacturers  and linebacker shoulders for women whose bones have not grown since high school. But I'll save that since I know I'd be preaching to the choir.This is the sleeve pinned into the new armhole. I made no changes to the sleeve cap and sewed on its original stitching line. I pinned starting at each end and working my way to the middle in case I ended up with extra fabric to ease in, but I didn't.Next it was time to deal with the droopy armhole. The sleeve circumference was also too big so I just sewed a deeper underarm and side seam, tapering to nothing at waist level. Doing this was like sewing the sleeve in flat and then sewing up the sideseam last, which is how the shirt was originally constructed. If it had been a set-in sleeve, I might have re-set it properly. Or maybe not. This is a Walmart shirt after all. ;-)After serging the armhole and sideseams, I hemmed the sleeves shorter. If you look carefully at the photo above, you should be able to see that the original hem is not really a hem. It's a facing, topstitched and edgestitched. I didn't want to rip all that stitching so I was lazy and just turned the facing up once and then edgestitched and topstitched that.Then the bottom hem. I cut off 1-1/2\" and then pressed up a narrow double fold hem and topstitched that. The last thing was to sew two more waist darts in the back. I figured I might as well do all the tweaks at this point, since I was on a roll. They look horrible here but Zillie has no butt. I do. The back fits me so much better with the darts. What you can't see are the original two waist darts. They are set very close to the sideseam. Why they are there, I have no idea. But I left them. With all the seaming and darts (there are 2 waist darts in the front too), what's another couple of darts.So here it is again, Before …… and After.ETA:  I forgot the best part. This sticker was on the front of the shirt when it was hanging on the rack.Um, I think not. Unless you have a sewing machine. ;-)"},

{"title": "Jacket #2", "date": "Tuesday, May 6, 2008", "text": "The jacket is done. The only thing left is to cut open my buttonholes and give the whole thing a good pressing. Right now the jacket is pinned together, crooked, and left over right.Something didn't turn out right with the collar. I don't know yet whether it was me or the pattern. It's supposed to meet closer together, but it doesn't. I used a straight size 18 neckhole and collar pieces with no changes (well, except to divide the undercollar in 2, add a seam allowance, and cut the pieces on the bias). The two neck edges should've fit together as designed but they didn't, which I didn't notice until it was too late.And while the look of the collar on the envelope was one of my favorite things about this jacket, what I ended up with doesn't look bad and in reality, I'll probably wear it more like this anyway:So, I won't stress about it, and I'll make a note for next time. At least I remembered to hand sew on the top button so there is no thread showing on the wrong side. Thankfully the brain was in gear today.Here's the lining. My first *fully* lined jacket, sleeves and everything. All done by machine. The fiddly bit at the join of the facing and collar went much, much smoother this time. And now this blue fabric is out of the stash. It's definitely one of those \"What was I thinking?\" pieces. I bought it about 5-6 years ago, back when I first started sewing. It's been taking up stash space for a long time.While at Joann's for buttons this morning, I flipped through the Butterick pattern catalog to look at two of the suggestions for copying my RTW dress (5206 and 4976), and instead came home with 5001.All similar patterns I've looked at will need some sort of modification, but I think B5001 will need the least changes. The Hot Patterns Deco Vibe Cosmopolitan dress was tempting after seeing all the various makes of it on PatternReview and blogs, but I decided against that one too.My actual dress is very similar to B5001, with the shirred outer wrap.As you can see by the pattern pieces, cutting a separate contrast waistband from the skirt pieces will be easy. And this pattern is already a plus size pattern so it should start with a little extra room in the bust area. I'm hoping the knit I use will account for the remainder needed. We'll see. Making this dress isn't near the top of the list yet, so it will be a while since I'll soon be sewing around a job.Parting Shot: What my sewing table looks like after I finish a project. Those are various muslins wadded up in the foreground. Two for the dress I'll get back to and one for the latest jacket, and probably another I'm forgetting. Time to straighten up and begin the next project."},
{"title": "Jacket Update", "date": "Monday, May 5, 2008", "text": "There has been progress, but I didn't finish yesterday like I was hoping. Maybe by tonight, since all that's left is to sew on the collar, the sleeve cuffs, and sew in the lining. And press the heck out of it. ;-) Oh, and buttons. Hmmm. Here we go again with the buttons.I had originally thought that I wouldn't line this jacket but realized I wouldn't save any time because I'd have to draft a back neck facing and redraft the front facings to join up with it. And I had already cut the front facings. So, lined it will be. That's the lining fabric sticking out of the pocket. It's basically blue and I don't wear much blue, but I'm trying to use up stash.I wasted a lot of time yesterday. I had originally thought that I wanted to topstitch all of the seams. So, after I had the collar put together, I topstitched around the edge. I hated it. The fabric has a definite texture and the topstitching sunk into it kind of funky looking, like a 5-year old had sewn it. Plus, the brown I used was too dark. Another would be too light. And so I just gave up and ripped it out. Which turned out to be a good thing because I realized as I was sewing the pockets that it would be a nightmare to topstitch down that seam.Speaking of the pockets … I'm undecided about them. They will, of course, stay in this jacket but I'm thinking I'll eliminate them for the next one. If I put my hands in them, which I'll most definitely do since they're there, I feel like I'm wearing a muff. And it's not like I'm going to store much more than a stick of gum or something in them. But at least these don't detract from the overall look of the jacket.The sleeves have been giving me the most trouble. And before I realized it, I forgot I was going to evaluate them before committing and I pinked the seam allowances. Sheesh. Can we say dunderheaded mistake? I didn't trim off much, but enough to make it a pain to evaluate my changes against the original seam allowances without really studying things. At least I remembered to not cut out the sleeve cuff until I had the sleeve width finalized. (Why does the brain let you remember some important points and totally space out on others?)So I've spent the morning trying to get the sleeves right. The shoulder point was too far out and puffed up, making me look like a Working Girl reject. I must've tried 10 different pinnings and bastings and have finally settled on what I think is the best of the bunch. It's not perfect, and I'm still trying to make a decision on whether a very thin shoulder pad is in order or not. (I'm leaning towards adding it.) If I didn't have square shoulders, I wouldn't think twice about a small shoulder pad since they do smooth things out underneath nicely. But do I need even 1/4\" more shoulder?? Arghhhhh!Now I have to transfer those alterations over to the lining sleeves and my pattern. And hopefully continue on to completion without further incident. Yeah. Right."},
{"title": "Photos of the Loot", "date": "Saturday, May 3, 2008", "text": "(Crappy photography in front of spotty mirror with messy background. Could it get any better?)I want 10 of these dresses. No, 20. At the very least, I want a pattern. I *need* a pattern! Any suggestions? The waist \"tie\" is really cool. It doesn't actually go around me. There is a sewn-in contrast band at the waist, front and back. The tie is a drape in the front only and it's secured with a belt slider thingie which you can sort of see near the hand that's on my hip. The colors are dark brown and ivory, in case you were wondering about my \"I don't wear black\" comment from earlier.I'll also take 10 of these skirts in various colors. I wish. I kept looking inside of it at the store to be sure it wasn't lined. The linen is that substantial and soft. It's been on a rack at the store for who knows how long and then wadded up in a bag as I shopped and this is how it came out of the bag. Not bad at all for a linen skirt that hasn't seen an iron since the factory. Check out the shoes. This is one of the pairs from Zappos that I already showed you.This is the invisible zipper/pocket/tab combo at the sideseam of the skirt. My stomach skin is the same color as the skirt. LOL!Shoes bought today. Yes, one more pair of brown. I'm definitely going to have to decide soon.Side angle.Purse #1.Purse #2. I've never had a green purse before but this will look great with everything on my immediate sewing list.And I want to mention this shirt I bought the other day at Walmart. If I keep it, I'll need to shorten the sleeves and the overall length. But look at the buttons. There's a double set at bust level (behind a hidden button placket). It's supposed to stop the bust gap. It seems to work on me, but either of the buttons is pretty much at my bust level. I just thought it was interesting.This morning I got my hair cut and then returned home to drag DH to the mall to keep me company. Everyone in the entire Tampa Bay area must've been at this mall today because OMG it was crowded. Of course, I can't remember the last time I went to the mall on a Saturday on purpose so maybe this is normal.Today's haul:3 bras2 pairs of shoes (still thinking about them)2 purses1 wrap dress1 linen tulip skirt1 resolution to stick to Zappos1 wish I could sew fasterI started off trying on bras and either I'm starting with the hot flashes or the A/C was turned off in the dressing rooms. I gave up in the middle because I just couldn't deal with trying to wrangle the girls into a multitude of bras while the sweat was starting to roll down my face. Ugh. It was Buy 2 Get 1 Free day in the bra department, so I guessed my best with the same brand I'm wearing now and I'll try them on again later tonight. And, of course, my pretty new styled haircut drooped big time after that fiasco. :-(Next, it was a look through the dresses at JCP. (I'm kicking myself because I forgot to look for that jacket I still want to make.) Everything was on SALE! and it was a disaster zone, but I managed to find 3 dresses and a similar jacket to try on to at least see how the styles looked on me. I ended up buying the wrap (top only) dress, which I'll have to hem. I liked the jacket but the color was meh so I left it. A quick look through the shoe department and the two pairs that I liked were not available in my size.Then we left Penneys and wandered through the mall where every store is basically the same and aimed for teens and 20-somethings, so I didn't waste my time in any of them. I did go into Lane Bryant (plus size store for non-US readers) and it was horrible. Absolutely nothing for career wear, nothing in colors I like, and nothing that didn't feel like it would fall apart in a month. I was in and out in 5 minutes. LB just does not sell clothing that is flattering to plus size women. I never find anything in there that I like, so I'm not sure why I keep going in.After that it was Macy's. More of the same and meager plus size selections. It seemed like everything was black, or red. I don't wear black. Or red. No shoes that I even wanted to try on. They were all strappy, too high a heel, or athletic wear.More wandering. A trip to the restroom, and then onto Dillard's. Dillard's is my favorite store in the mall. The saleswomen are always nice, helpful, and not *too* in your face, IYKWIM, and the \"women's\" department has a good selection of clothes for my age group. (Question: Why are plus-sized females \"women\" and others are \"ladies\"??) If you knew how much I complain about stores and lack of service in general, you'd understand that when I say Dillard's is good, it must be EXTREMELY good. ;-)I found a great Kaspar skirt that will become a staple. It's a khaki colored linen trumpet skirt, with a contoured waistband, side zip, side tabs, and pockets. And it fits perfectly. I always find something at Dillard's. I also found 2 purses and 2 pairs of shoes, both on sale. I hate changing purses so to find two that could be actual contenders was a real accomplishment. LOL! I also tried on a pretty green jacket which technically fit, but the bust darts pointed about 1.5 inches below my actual bust, and this was while wearing one of my OLD bras! I can't imagine whose boobs this jacket designed for?? The shoulders fit very well, though, which is usually a problem area for me with RTW. But I'd never be able to see past those darts so it stayed behind.Then it was out the door and back home. I'll take pics of my loot later, after I've recovered. All in all, it wasn't too painful. But I like my own things better, and I forgot to get pantyhose."},
{"title": "I'm Out of Muslin Again", "date": "Friday, May 2, 2008", "text": "… so it's a good thing I don't need to sew another one for this jacket.I'm quite pleased with the muslin. The remaining tweaks I can make on the tissue and won't need another muslin.As I mentioned, last night I made initial alterations onto the pattern tissue. There are twelve vertical seam allowances on this jacket. That's a lot of opportunities to spread around the additional needed width without changing the look of the jacket.I started with a straight 18 and left that sizing alone until waist and hip levels, where I added 1/12 of the difference between my actual measurements and the pattern envelope measurements, which was basically just a tapered addition down the seamline. Because most of these pieces adjoin with another, I only had to make the adjustment to one side and then simply trace that (with my rotary cutter) onto the adjoining seam. This literal shortcut not only saved time but it also meant the seams should match perfectly. Which they did. Whew! ;-)I also used the size 18 sleeve so it would fit right into the armscye, even though I knew it would never fit my arm. Before cutting the muslin, I had added width to the tissue at the center raglan seam and also adjusted for my square shoulders, but I still couldn't get the muslin up my arm comfortably and the armhole was too tight. So I ripped out the sleeve seams (as you can see by my arm in the right of the photo) and sewed shallower seams for the sleeve on your left. I'll note these new seam allowances on the pattern and also cut with a little extra over the bicep so I can adjust in the real fabric if necessary. I've decided to forego the shoulder pads this pattern calls for as my square shoulders in a raglan sleeve already look padded.The final observation about this muslin is that I did NOT do an FBA. The seaming is a little off from my actual apex (where I've drawn a blue line on the muslin) so I'll move the seam and let it out just a little at bust level because while I don't think I need a full-blown FBA, I do need a smidge more width across the bust.These are the intended fabrics for the next outfit:The jacket will be from the taupey-brown fabric on top, a skirt will be made from the paisley print, and a tee-type top from the lime slinky (I'm thinking the gathered neck BWOF tee). The skirt fabric matches both jacket fabrics, and I also plan to make a skirt from the slinky for a 2-piece dress which will then go with other fabrics I have planned for more pieces. So, in a way, I'm doing a SWAP, but only because I tend to buy in color families anyway. But if I get all these pieces done by next weekend as I'm planning, I'll also have a mini-wardrobe I can enter in the PR Contest since I didn't cut the real Jalie top until yesterday morning (May 1, the contest start date). I had originally planned to enter with casual summer pieces, so it will be a nice bonus to be able to enter the contest from a completely different angle since I thought I'd have to drop out before ever starting.Now off to get ready to cut real fabric. And then a trip to Joann's tonight is in order because I really am out of muslin now.Thanks everyone for the nice comments about the Jalie top. I love the fabric and the loose cotton weave will be very comfortable in the Florida heat and humidity. Someone recently asked in a comment: Since offices are air-conditioned, why is the heat still a factor? Well, until you've been here in the summer, you just don't know. As soon as you step outside for any length of time, even 2 minutes, the heat/humidity gets you, and gets you BAD! I'd rather not start my day in the car sopping wet with sweat until the A/C cools down, if I can help it. But sometimes it's so humid, you just can't help it. I'm also hoping that we can conserve on gas and that DH and I can carpool in the mornings and then I'll take public transport home, so that's more outside time. And I'm sure I'll also head outside some days during lunch. On summer days, I'd rather not be clad in polyester from head to toe.Today I'll cut a muslin for the PR jacket. I made initial pattern alterations last night. This jacket is supposed to be lined, but in the interest of time and heat (see above), I'm thinking of omitting the lining and some of the interfacing. No firm decisions yet, though. I'll see how the muslin looks before I decide if this jacket should be more structured with that extra tailoring.Over the weekend, I hope to make good progress on the jacket and also head to mall to find a couple of new bras, some pantyhose, and do some more shoe shopping. I'm also going to look for some clothes since I'm just not sewing fast enough. I have a Wednesday hair appointment and I'll give myself all of next week to continue sewing what I can. After that, I'll be ready to submit my resume and begin interviewing. I haven't wanted to start the process yet because I haven't had the wardrobe for more than one day of interviews and/or actual job. And you know how Murphy's Law works."},
{"title": "May Day! May Day!", "date": "Thursday, May 1, 2008", "text": "Sorry. I couldn't resist using this title for today's post. Nothing's on fire or anything. ;-)The Jalie top is done. It's not perfect, but done is what matters right now. I'll tweak again on the next version and then it will be perfect. But this one is pretty good.I used the pattern pieces from yesterday's Muslin #2. I shortened the bolero piece two sizes at the shoulder end, shortened the back shoulder one size, scooped the back neckline about two sizes's worth of depth, raised the neckline about an inch in the middle, and narrowed the shoulders about three or four sizes. The shoulders are still a bit too wide and the armhole needs to come up some more. But I'm not unhappy with it at all. Besides, it will be worn under a jacket anyway so none of that will show until I remove the jacket.(Regarding the comments yesterday about cleavage in the workplace. If someone else wants to bare it, that's their thing. And I have seen plenty of what some people think is office wear these days. But for me, I don't care what's in or out. I'm just not going to be wearing tops that show more than I want to show.) The fabric is an ivory cotton summer weight sweater knit. (Say that 3 times fast!) I like the texture it adds to the outfit. That is, the 6 inches of it that shows. ;-)Here's the outfit so far. Still no buttons on the jacket. I'm thinking of just 2 buttons — at the top — so when I button it, the jacket stays semi-swung open, with a diagonal line and the Jalie top showing at the bottom. (Like it looks here.) If there are only 2 buttons and 2 buttonholes, no one will think anything of it since they'll assume it was bought that way. I'm not asking for opinions on this, BTW, so don't try to change my mind. ;-)I've cut out the pattern pieces for Simp 2897, the new plus size jacket in the Project Runway line. I'm hoping to get the alterations started after dinner, and around Survivor and Grey's Anatomy. DS#2 doesn't have school tomorrow so I can stay up late and sleep in. (Won't get to do that much once I start working.)"},
{"title": "Second Jalie 2794 Trial", "date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2008", "text": "This is the first trial from this morning with the blend of sizes. Keep in mind that the bust gathers aren't spread out as wide as they should be and the binding in that area isn't sewn down which is why it's flipping up. Overall, not terrible. It's a bit tight in this almost unstretchy knit, but I was expecting that; my intended fabric has much more give and less recovery.This is a straight EE, except that I did alter for square shoulders on this one. And then promptly pinned it out for the photos, which is why you see pleats on my shoulders.The neckline is way too low, exposing cleavage not appropriate for an office setting. And this is without the center front shirring. Also, like the first trial, the back neck is much too high.The shoulder/upper chest is also too wide (and boy do I have a redneck tan!). I've pinned out some width at the armscye. I think the armhole is also a little too low.You can't tell that there is any easing from the center front piece onto the \"bolero yoke\" piece. That's because there isn't much at all in this size. Odd. I see a little dart trying to form from the armhole. I don't feel like doing an FBA on this pattern. After all, it's not a fitted blouse and I'm tired of muslins for today.Somewhere between these two trials is the answer and now I need to decide which one to work with. I think if I can get the bolero yoke sized correctly, the rest will fall into place. Except the neckline will probably still need to be raised.This is a horrible poly knit that has almost no stretch, especially since I cut it on the cross-grain to keep the striping vertical on the slim chance that this might be wearable for someone. It's technically wearable for me, but there are a few issues aside from the icky fabric so this one will go to the donation pile.I blended between sizes as I traced the pattern, which was a bit hard to judge given the odd shapes of the pattern pieces. But I used my TNT Ottobre tee as a basis to make some sizing judgments and it was definitely looking like I should blend. I'm still really curious, though, about how a non-blended size would work on me since the larger sizes seem so incredible LONG compared to the others. I have more of this fabric to use up so I might just do an experiement. There are not too many pieces to trace and the sewing goes fairly quickly.As for the blending … The shoulder width and armhole height is a Z, blended into the EE for body width. The overall length of the top is Z. The separate \"bolero\" piece is a blend between Z and EE. The sleeve is FF and fit perfectly into my blended armhole, although the overarm length of the cap sleeve is too short for my arms.The fit is mostly OK. It's a little snug, but I expected that because of the fabric choice. The gathering at the bust needs to be spread out more. I used the marks on the pattern pieces but with my blend between sizes, I should've adjusted the spacing of those marks too. I need to put it on again and decide if the bolero pieces need adjustment. They feel weird but a lot of that is because they are just a weird piece that I'm not used to.The shoulder width on me is pretty good, although it looks wonky on Zillie. That's just a combination of the fabric and my haphazard arrangment on Zillie. Poor Zillie. She wears mostly ugly versions of my clothes. ;-) I didn't adjust for my square shoulders, but that's because I was unsure as I was tracing which end was going to be up on that bolero piece. Now that I know, I'll do the adjustment.The back neck sits waaaaaaay to high for me. I'm going to scoop that out.As other reviewers have mentioned, the length of the binding pieces seems to be off. The front binding piece is definitely too long. The back was too, for me, but I didn't pin/mark or anything. I just started at one end and stretched it a little as I applied it. (Oh, and Belinda, you could definitely use a CS binder with this top. But as you mentioned on the PR boards, you'd have to add onto the pattern's edges to make up for lost width of the Jalie binding so it's just as quick to do it the \"old-fashioned\" way.)The one puzzling thing about the long binding piece was that it wasn't clear how long to cut it. The pattern has a \"Cut on Fold\" mark but it's in the middle of the strip, not on one end. (Did that confuse anyone else who's made this?) I guessed and cut it NOT on the fold. I got it wrong and my first strip was only half as long as it should've been. Oops.I'm going to go back to the sewing room now,  fiddle with this top some more and decide how I'm going to proceed."},
{"title": "A Couple More Thoughts on the Dress", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2008", "text": "I agree with everyone who said that the full gathers aren't the best look for a full bust. But I am still going to make the dress when I decide on a fabric. I might even use a knit since then I wouldn't need as big an FBA and it would be nice and drapey. But anyway ... I know, I know. ;-) That's one of the reasons for the muslin — to see how to adapt the pattern to not only fit my body but to *flatter* it too. I'd never wear this style dress on its own because I need some waist definition. But the right outer layer will do that. A short-sleeved summer sweater or a less structured jacket would work.Other progress today: I started and finished the skirt (KS 3287). Praise be for TNTs! ;-) I lengthened it 2\" and it's going to be great with the jacket. And the shoes. ;-) Let me say again how much I love the 1/4\" downturn feller on my coverstitch machine. The poly fabric zipped right through for a narrow hem with not even so much as one slippery whimper.Speaking of the jacket … a little more progress on getting it done. After sewing in and ripping out the (very thin) shoulder pads 3 times because I couldn't decide whether I wanted them or not, I ripped them out for good. The jacket isn't really drafted for shoulder pads and I didn't make an allowance for them. While they technically fit in because they're thin, I just didn't like the bulk. After that, I serged the armhole seam allowances which means my decision (and the lining) is final and there's no going back. LOL! Now if I could only motivate myself to do the buttonholes and get this thing finished. I'm still mulling over whether I want 2, 3, or 4 buttons. Why are all these decisions so paralyzing?Then I traced Jalie 2794, the knit sweetheart neckline top. I'm going to try it in a summer sweater knit (without the front shirring) to complete the skirt/jacket outfit. But I'll do a quick test in an icky knit first. Hopefully, I'll get to that after dinner. It's nice to finally see a whole outfit coming together. You'll get to see it when it's complete.This dress is on hold for the moment. I finished the pattern alterations and made a muslin yesterday (two actually) and I think the fit/style is OK. But there are other problems. First, I'm going to want to make the dress longer than the pattern's length and the layout will now exceed my 2 yds of fabric (by only about 6 inches!), and second, I'm not thrilled with how it looks under the brown jacket. With the gathers under the yoke, I think it's too puffy for this fitted jacket. I'm also thinking of rotating some of the bust dart *back* to the side and just sewing a dart so that there's not quite so much gathering. In muslin, it looks like a nightgown, doesn't it? ;-)So, I'm moving on to Plan B and making a skirt from the lining leftovers from one of my TNT Kwik Sew skirt patterns. I think. I also have another untried skirt pattern that's a good candidate.I'll return to the dress with another fabric, after a look through the stash or some shopping if the stash is uncooperative."},
{"title": "New Patterns & Answers to Comments", "date": "Monday, April 28, 2008", "text": "The results of my \"spree\" at Joann's on Friday night:Simp 3506 - Looks like a fast & comfortable dress and top to whip up. The jacket is too shapeless for me though. The pants will never fit in the size range I bought.Simp 2923 - Princess lines and raglan sleeves. I like the combination.Simp 4045 - This is the jacket (brown, bottom left) that I'm thinking of morphing into that JCP inspiration jacket, although it won't be an exact morph since this doesn't have raglan sleeves. I'm thinking more \"essence of inspiration.\" I'll have to create a separate neck yoke since what you see on the jacket is just topstitching. I'll never make the skirts because they are too full for me, but the dress and top are cute. But that dress doen't fit the model very well, does it?Simp 3631 - Or I could use this one that was recommended by Belinda and Carolyn. I do have the issue of Sew Stylish that shows narrowing the sleeve so I should be all set, right? ;-)Simp 3678 - Likely that I'll never make this but you never know. I like all of the dresses and think the sleeveless jumper would be especially cute under a jacket.New Look 6632 - I thought the angle of the jacket would be a flattering diagonal line for me. Sort of trendy but at the same time, not. I'd make the shorter version, but a bit longer than shown. If I make it at all.New Look 6788 - I like the dress. The square neckline of the jacket might be a bit too fuddy-duddy. I bought this and then saw Carolyn's dress and was doubly inspired. Of course if I made this dress, I'd have to wear a jacket and never take it off. If Joann's had had two coordinating linen/blends, they would've come home with me too. But Joann's usually disappoints and was no exception that night.And two which aren't on the website yet:Simp 2899 - Another raglan sleeve/princess seams combination. I'm definitely making the jacket on the left. But I wouldn't wear it buttoned all the way up, if at all.Simp 2896 - The dress I'm currently in the process of altering to use with the leftover lining fabric. The blouse is very much like my recent coral blouse but with a little bit lower neckline. I'll definitely morph them as that coral blouse is my newest favorite and I'm going to wear it out soon if I don't have another. If I have enough fabric, I might add sleeves to the dress so I have the option of taking off the jacket. (Sleeveless and me in an office don't mix.)* * * * *Answers to some comments:Carolyn asked, \"Are you going to make a few other pieces - skirt, pants another top so that you can mix and match all of the pieces for interviews?\"I'm definitely making more pieces. Whether they all mix and match, probably not. I tend to sew as \"outfits\" and not a SWAP. And I'll be filling in with RTW because there's no way I can sew an entire office wardrobe in a matter of weeks. And, yes, I already thought about the 2nd interview scenario. ;-)Nancy K asked, (About buttons) \"There are some good places online. Have you tried any?\"I haven't yet. The problem is I don't *know* I need buttons until I know what the fabric will be and I'm well into the project and then I'm too impatient. I have a hard time picking out buttons for garments which don't yet exist. Not a problem with fabric, just with buttons. Which is why I don't have a good button stash.CandyO asked, \"This is your first lined jacket? Wow. That makes me feel a little better about my own abilities, since I just assumed you were awesome at all things sewing. ... Is that the McCall's Nanette Lepore knockoff?\"You're funny! I am most definitely NOT \"awesome at all things sewing.\" Yes, this is my first lined jacket. And even with this, I haven't lined the sleeves so I still have that hump to jump at some later point. There just hasn't been much need for a lined jacket in my SAHM world. I know there's plenty of other sewing related things/skills I haven't done/mastered yet. That's one of the things I love/hate about sewing ... so much to learn and stay challenged, so much to screw up on. LOL!And sort of. The jacket is actually KS 3368, with the waistbands and sleeves inspired by that McCall's pattern.Myrna asked, \"I know who Belinda is but who is Carolyn? Does she have a blog I'd like to read.\"Carolyn is DiaryofASewingFanatic. I bet you already follow her blog and didn't realize they were one and the same."},
{"title": "Too Many Learning Experiences", "date": "Sunday, April 27, 2008", "text": "Here's the jacket as of now. The only thing left to do is buttonholes & buttons and to attach the lining at the armholes. The fabric you see underneath is the lining and will also be a dress. The camera/light isn't cooperating so the colors are off. But then nothing seemed to be cooperating with this jacket so I'm not surprised.Here's the back view.And this is the lining. The colors are more accurate in this photo but the browns do match in real life.This is what the jacket looked like last night. At first glance you might not notice what is actually a glaring mistake. Look at the belt bands at the waist. They are not level. By a lot! I didn't notice this until I saw this photo. At that point, I was hoping the jacket was just sitting lopsided on Zillie. It wasn't. Arghhh. I had measured carefully and even used white thread to mark each location. But obviously I messed up somewhere.This revelation came upon the heels of fighting for over two hours with the place where the lining joins the facing. I was sewing this spot all by machine (as per Jackets for Real People) so the join would be neat. It's actually a pretty good method but since this is my first lined jacket, I had to experiment and learn as I went. But I wasn't learning fast enough for my own satisfaction. LOL! It would've been faster to sew by hand but I'm stubborn (and severely opposed to my own handsewing!).(The extra seam you see is the princess seam from the front. Next time I'll redraw the facing to space that out more. I think it looks weird and it made it harder to get the lining/facing seams aligned correctly.)So, back to the waistbands. As you can see, they are sewn into the princess seams and stitched down to the jacket body. The princess seam allowances were also trimmed and edgestitched. And the lining was attached at that point, although not yet at the armholes, thankfully, which saved me even more frustration. I had to rip out the band and one section of an edgestitched princess seam before I could reposition the band. And then I had to fidget with the lining underneath while sewing so I didn't catch it while re-stitching the band back on. Stupid mistake. Repeat after me: Measure twice, sew once. Measure twice, sew once. ;-)My last frustration yesterday was that the lining kept falling out at the back of the jacket so it could be seen, even though I had anchored it at all the seams. I tried handsewing (yes!) it down but an inch of that told me it wasn't going to be invisible. This fabric does not hide stitches even a little bit. At which point, I threw my hands in the air and ended up anchoring the jacket hem from the inside with a fusible.Thankfully Belinda was near her computer as I was cursing this jacket and lent me a shoulder to whimper on, gave me a great pep talk and good advice. Of course, if she were actually here instead of virtually so, she would've shown me step-by-step and I wouldn't have made any mistakes. LOL! But with all these \"learning experiences\" I created for myself, I'm actually feeling a lot more confident for my next lined jacket. In 10 years. ;-)Now for buttons. This is what I bought. The pickin's at Joann's are slim and this is what I thought were the best of the bunch. The buttons on the left have a slight bronze metallic sheen to them. The buttons on the right are \"coconut\" and are more speckled. I'm leaning toward the buttons on the left. Opinions?We're off to the dog park. After that, I'm hoping to start working on a dress pattern, leaving the jacket buttons for tomorrow when I don't hate the jacket so much. ;-)"},
{"title": "I Got Nothing", "date": "Saturday, April 26, 2008", "text": "Did I sew yesterday? Is the lining in? Um … about 2 seams, and no. It just turned into a day of errands and then DS#1 wanted to take me and his brother out for a late lunch so how could I refuse that? My last errand of the evening was to Joann's to grab that Simplicity 3631 pattern while it was on sale (and, ahem, 9 others), some thread, and to look at buttons. I'll be soliciting button opinions a little later.I'm quite happy with some of my new patterns (I'll list them later) — at least in theory right now. We'll see how they work with my actual and not theoretical body. I was pleasantly surprised to see lots in the new counter book that aren't on the website yet and I bought a few of them. I have to say that going back to work is going to be very bad for my stash. I'm looking at a whole new world of fabric and patterns. Things that never even caught my eye before. Uh oh.Oh, and speaking of the pattern counter books … I was so frustrated with them last night since I'm used to looking at patterns on the internet. The books really should show front and back line drawings on the pattern page, as well as fabric requirements (knit vs. woven) and even maybe yardage. What a pain to have to pull a pattern and then open the info sheet just to see the line drawings because even the envelopes sometimes don't have clear representations of both front and back views.And finally an observation about the Project Runway line. I *hate* the way they're doing yardage requirements and not labeling the different views A, B, C, etc. First, the yardage requirements have you add up X for this bodice plus Y for that sleeve plus Z for this collar. And they do not add up correctly. I *know* that a simple dress won't take 3 yds of fabric. Sheesh. But would someone else who is new to sewing? Or will they end up with way more fabric and cash outlay than necessary? I say no, and yes.But it's the lack of labels for the different options that made me the craziest. I like to look at the drawings for the pattern pieces and match them up to the different views. You know, the list under the pattern drawings that shows piece #12 is View A sleeve. That sort of thing. Except with these PR patterns, it's piece #12 is for \"bodice with round collar and two buttons.\" Arghhh. I have to then study the line drawings to figure out which one actually IS the one that has a bodice with a round collar and two buttons. And then I have to do it *each time* because there's no way my brain remembers such a description for each and every view when I'm flipping back and forth between line drawings and pattern pieces. It reminded of the puzzles in Highlights magazine from the dentist office waiting rooms of my childhood — Which One Of These Is Different? That was my favorite feature in the magazine. On a pattern sheet, not so much.I understand the general concept of what Simplicity is doing with the PR patterns. They want the sewer to feel more free to make choices, to *not* be stuck in a box thinking they have to make View A and cannot interchange the sleeves for View B. I think that's a good thing. But I know there's got to be a better way to do that.Today I will finish the jacket while I dream of using one of my new patterns. I just have to decide which one."},
{"title": "Finally Some Progress", "date": "Thursday, April 24, 2008", "text": "The jacket is coming along, although it looks like a mess in this pic. Look at that stray thread front and center — how did I not see that? And it's kinda just flung on Zillie for a quick photo session so it's hanging rather lopsided. Oh well. You can get the general idea. The fabric is brown RPL, some good stuff from Emma One Sock that had been aging in the stash for a while. The side belt pieces are hanging down because I haven't yet attached the back belt piece to them. I played with the placement of the belt on my muslin and decided to put it a bit lower than the McCall's pattern shows because I think it's more flattering to me from the rear view. A higher belt makes me look short-waisted and all derrière. Well, more so than I actually am. Tomorrow the lining goes in. I've decided not to line the sleeves, for a couple of reasons. First, I think it will be too hot. If the sleeves are unlined, at least they will breathe a bit even if the rest of the jacket doesn't. Second, I have exactly 2 yards left of the lining fabric if I don't cut sleeves, which means I can use it for a skirt or dress or something else that will go with this jacket. If I cut sleeves, I will essentially be left with a really big scrap. So I'll be lining just the jacket body and then overlocking the armsyce seam allowances. Sure, I could bind them and it would look pretty but I need to get this done and move on. I'll save the couture-type elements for another project. Thanks for all the opinions about pantyhose. I think I'm in the majority with my thinking that they should be worn with pumps. Now to find a brand/size that I can live with. I seriously have not bought pantyhose in at least 10 years so I'm sure the options have changed. A few of you asked where I bought the shoes. They are both from Zappos, and were under $70 per pair, which I thought was pretty reasonable. While I absolutely love how both of them look, I'm undecided about how they feel. I need to put them on and walk around the house for a while, but I can't sew with heels so I haven't done that yet."},
{"title": "Muslins and Mail", "date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2008", "text": "Finally, I'm ready to cut real fabric. Whew! I feel like I've accomplished nothing these last 3 days. I kept fighting the urge to just toss it all and run to the mall. But I stayed motivated because I know I'd never find what I have in my head and that whatever I did find wouldn't fit as well as I'm used to when I make it myself. I still don't have a thing to wear yet so the mall may still see me, but at least I'm feeling more optimistic.I said yesterday that this KS 3368 jacket was a \"near TNT.\" By that I meant I knew from my first trial of it there were still things to tweak. Fortunately, I had the finished jacket to try on to evaluate the tweaks. Unfortunately, I started seeing every little thing. Those tweaks took up my entire morning, but at least they're done now.For the first jacket, I did not do an FBA. And because that fabric is a stretch denim and the pattern was drafted for a C/D cup, it really didn't need one. The fabric I'm planning to use for this second version is also a stretch woven but I want to line it with a non-stretch woven so a small FBA was in order. I also had to narrow the shoulders some more and move the shoulder seam toward the back. Nothing too complicated, but it meant a muslin (my third this week!) to be sure. My final change was to morph the sleeve from View C of McCall's 5329.I'm also contemplating adding the \"belt\" pieces per the McCall's pattern and you can seem them pinned on the muslin in the pic above. I think I like them. They'd be from the same fabric as the jacket so it won't be a contrast, just a subtle design element.Now, moving on to another topic which I mentioned this week …Do you remember seeing this on Belinda's blog?Well *I* took that pic above. Which means that *I* am the proud and grateful recipient of a wonderful birthday surprise from Down Under. She's a sneaky girl, that Belinda! Posting about her beautiful creation all the while knowing it was already on its way to Florida. Thank you SO MUCH Belinda!! It's now hanging up in my sewing room in a spot where I can see it from my sewing machine. I'd show a full-wall view except my sewing room is a complete disaster zone right now. ;-)Also in the package were more goodies. First, a great birthday card (inside it reads \"We're vintage\"). It's actually 3-D, so that little hanger you see is real. Belinda always find the neatest cards. I think this one will eventually get framed and added to my collage grouping in the sewing room.Next, a package of Burda tracing paper. I always wondered what that paper was that Belinda sometimes posts with her pattern tracings. It has a matte and a shiny side so it's always been very distinguishable to me. Now I know. I think I may just go ahead and use it on the KS jacket pattern, since it looks like a roadmap after the first and now latest alterations.Also in the package was a flyer from Spotlight (like our Joann's), a flyer from a local fabric/sewing store with a list of their classes, demonstrations, and new fabrics. I've been pea green with envy about this store, Frou Frou, ever since I first learned about it. Belinda is so lucky to be in Melbourne with all those wonderful fabric sources in the same city. She also stuck in swatches (we trade back and forth) of some of her latest projects. The eyelet fabric she used for her prize-winning blouse is spectacular! (Actually, all of her fabrics are … see comments above about envy and Melbourne stores. Ahem.) It's so fun to have such a kind and generous sewing friend from the other side of the world. The only downside is that she IS on the other side of the world. Or I am. ;-) But the internet and the mail makes her seem a little bit closer.* * * * *And last for today, my new shoes, which arrived yesterday.I love them both so I may end up keeping them both even though I ordered two pairs of brown shoes thinking I'd send back at least one.So, ladies, if pantyhose are passé, which I kinda know they are, just what do YOU wear with dresses/skirts and shoes like these? There's no way I'll go bare-legged to an interview. And even though I do go bare-legged all summer long and won't have a problem with that later if it's acceptable wear for wherever I end up, I still can't imagine either of these shoes with bare feet. Do you just live in flats and flip-flops all summer?"},

I think I'm going to end up buying Simplicity 3631 just so I don't have to experiment anymore with removing sleeve ease in a raglan sleeve, something which is new to me and I just simply don't have the time or motivation to work through right now. I need to sew!In the meantime, I'm going to start on Kwik Sew 3368, which is a nearly TNT for me. And, if you squint, you can see that it's very similar to McCall's 5329.Stay tuned. My schizophrenic sewing self is bound to finish something soon.Belinda and Carolyn mentioned Simplicity 3631 in the comments yesterday. And darn if it isn't really, really close to what I'm after. But it isn't in my pattern stash and I wanted to start working on the jacket. Patient I am not. So I decided that the pattern I did have, Simplicity 3874, would work and save me a trip to Joann's. Plus, I do want to make the S3874 jacket per the pattern at some point and my fit alterations will transfer for that future project.So, here's the first muslin.The major fit alterations are done and now I'm just tweaking for style elements. After those are done, I'll revisit fit and then finesse the shape some more — things like adding a curved center back seam and raising the armholes a little. I know that this basic silhouette on my full-bust would be too sack-like as is and I will de-sack it. ;-)The side on your right was sewn really ugly just to get an idea of how much gathering/ease I'm working with and to see if my altered pattern pieces both fit together and fit me (they do). The left side has the front pleats closer to final position, although I still need to tweak that a bit. The neckband looks caved in on Zillie, but her chest is much more hollow than mine and on me the neckline looks pretty close to exactly like the JCP inspiration jacket. I'm happy with that.This is one of the sleeves with the 2.75\" of gathering pleated out. Tomorrow, I'm going to morph another raglan sleeve with no gathering. I also pleated out the gathering at the back and will remove that width from the pattern piece. The length of the sleeves will not be as shown in the muslin. I just picked an arbitrary length for this muslin. I'm thinking the final sleeves will be 3/4 length with a wing flounce. I'll test that on the next muslin.Tomorrow I hope to finish the alterations and a final muslin. And, I hope to have time to write a post about a special package I received in the mail from the other side of the planet.In the meantime, I'm really getting into the new wardrobe thing. I ordered two pairs of pointy-toed heels from Zappos today. ;-)"},
{"title": "Jacket Morphing Thoughts", "date": "Sunday, April 20, 2008", "text": "First, thank you all for the good wishes. I'm actually feeling a little excited about the prospect of working in an office again, and not just complete dread. The \"get out of the house and talk to other adults\" aspect is very attractive, as are the new clothing opportunities. And, of course, the paycheck and benefits! But the reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. :grin: I'll still have my evenings and weekends and so of course I will continue sewing and blogging, but I just won't be doing each on a daily basis.So, with that said, I need some office clothes and I really, really want to limit the ill-fitting RTW purchases if I can help it. I have a couple of weeks to get some interview outfits ready. Remember, this is Florida so we're always a bit more casual here. I'm sure that actual office attire will not be super dressy, but I won't feel right going on an interview unless I'm wearing a jacket and coordinated skirt or dress.While snoop shopping online, I found this jacket at JC Penney. I like it because it is fashionable without being too trendy for my 46-year old self, and it will last a couple of seasons here in fashion-slow Florida.If it came in a color I liked, I'd probably buy it. But it doesn't. So, the next option is to try to duplicate it (and change out those miniscule buttons!).I have both of these patterns as contenders:The first one (Simp 4122) I've already made and fitted, as my coral gauze blouse (which I wear a LOT now!). The second one (Simp 3874) is untested.So now I'm trying to decide if it would be easier to redraft the neckline on 4122, which will also involve moving the yoke off the shoulder line a bit, or should I start with 3874, fit it completely from scratch, attach the bands so they aren't separate pieces and then add the center front extensions. Either one will also involve removing most of the gathers from the sleeves and changing the sleeves to something else. I'm not really fond of the sleeves in the JCP jacket, nor do I love the sleeves in 3874. It's going to be hot here. I want short sleeves of some sort.(As I type all of that out, I'm thinking it will be easier to start with 3874 and use 4122 as a comparison.)Also on the radar is McCall's 5329.After we get back from the dog park, I'll be a pattern-cutting, muslin-ing fool."},

This downward spiraling economy of our sucks big time, doesn't it? Even more than the thought of donning pantyhose again. So, for the moment, the blog is on hold while I think about and prepare for what I need for dreaded interviews and then the office environment, and whether I'll be sewing or buying.

{"title": "Slip Fabric", "date": "Monday, April 7, 2008", "text": "Just a very quick entry today as I'm doing icky household chores and I don't want to break my rhythm. Yeah, right. Who am I kidding! ;-)Anyway, a lot of the comments about the slip asked about the fabric. I'm sorry, but it's not some miracle fabric or anything of the sort and it's also long sold out. It's a nylon/lycra blend which has more body than what you usually think of and see for tricot lingerie. It's cool to the touch like nylon usually is and I don't worry about any heat factor because it's a slip and an updraft is always happening. ;-)I bought it from Fabric.com (along with about 4 other colors) a couple of years ago. The link to the fabric still works so you can read about it here.And for those who asked … I wore the coral tee with the skirt on Saturday night.The vacuum awaits. :-("},
{"title": "From Zero to Two", "date": "Saturday, April 5, 2008", "text": "I don't know why it took me so long to make a top to match this skirt, but now I have two, I can actually wear the skirt, and I won't feel guilty anymore for not returning and not wearing it.This tee is just the plain ol' Ottobre gathered neckline tee. But since I really don't like \"plain,\" I had to liven it up a little bit. I used some transfers I bought from ShopOnion when I bought a pattern. (Unfortunately, Maria is sold out of this particular design now or I'd buy more.)I know some of you (Hi Sondra!) didn't think the lavender fabric matched the skirt, but it really does. It just doesn't photograph that way. This photo is pretty close, though. Some of the petals in the skirt are the same lavender color as the tee fabric.So, the only thing left to do about this skirt is to make a pattern from it since that's why I originally bought it. But I'm not going to hurry on that project since I'm ready to wear it instead of looking at it. In fact, I'm going to wear it out tonight for a casual dinner with some friends. It will be the first skirt I wear in a long time that I didn't make myself. (But I could've. LOL!) I also made the half slip I mentioned last post. From tracing the one pattern piece to finished took less than an hour. Lingerie is definitely one thing that actually saves money when you sew it yourself, and now my undies won't show through the skirt tonight. ;-)The main objective for this slip was to be quick about it, so I did the whole thing on my sewing machine and serger because I didn't want to stop and rethread my coverstitch machine for elastic and the hem. I used plush picot lingerie elastic for the waist, narrow zigzagged it on and then turned and triple-zigzagged from the front.Then I used a blindhem stitch to create picot edge hem, and called it done.Stash to the rescue again!You knew I was going to make the coral top, right? But I couldn't just zip through an easy Ottobre tee. Noooooo! I had to get inspired. ;-)I saw this green RTW tee in this thread on Pattern Review.In that thread, Jaeng shared sketches showing what she'd do to recreate that tee from a TNT pattern. I decided to turn what should have been a fast coral tee into a \"project\" and make my interpretation of the RTW tee and Jaeng's sketch.I started with the Rose (I think that's pattern #5) tee from Ottobre Woman 02/2007 since it is TNT and has a nicely shaped vee neckline and neckband.I spread my pattern a little more since I wanted deeper pleats spaced farther apart, which would be stitched down.Overall, I'm happy with this first attempt. If I make another, I think I'll spread the pattern at the hem end a little too when making the pleats so they \"flow\" nicer to the bottom. It's not as billowy on me as it looks on Zillie since she doesn't have my tummy.I had to cut this fabric (cotton/Lycra) on the crossgrain since it has striations that run selvege to selvege and I wanted them to be vertical. The fabric has 4-way stretch so it worked out fine.I did cut out the lavender/lilac tee when I was cutting the coral fabric and it's mostly done. So everyone that voted for both, you convinced me. ;-) This one is straight from the Ottobre gathered front pattern. I'll sew in the sleeves and hem it tomorrow.And then will I start the denim capris? No! I've decided I need one more sidetrack — a slip to wear under some of my summer skirts so I can avoid show-through. But after that, denim capris are next. I think. ;-)"},
{"title": "Another One?", "date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2008", "text": "The print is a skirt I bought at Walmart (of all places!) approximately two summers ago, meaning to copy it and then return it. Well, I never made it that far and so it has sat in the closet in its orphaned state, tags still attached, because I had no tops to match it. It may be a cheapie from Walmart, but I love the fabric and the way it swishes, and I *will* make a pattern from it one of these days.I had thought my next project would be some denim capris (since I wear them a lot during the summer) but once I pulled out that skirt again, I just couldn't get past doing something about giving it a coordinate. But that means one more coral top. The last one isn't the right style IMO to wear with this skirt, even if it's the right color.The other possibility is to use the lavender in the photo on the right. It matches too. But, then that top will be an orphan except for jeans and this skirt. Another coral top will actually go with more in the current and soon-to-be wardrobe. Decisions, decisions.I'm also still deciding what pattern to use. I want it to be fairly brainless, so it's either going to be an Ottobre tee, a morph from an Ottobre tee, or another BWOF shirred neckline tee.Being such a (potentially) simple top, I thought I'd have it done today but I can't get started. I keep walking by the fabrics, looking at them, and changing my mind back and forth. Hmmm. Maybe I should just make tees from *both* fabrics."},

No different than any other day, really, except that the humidity level is rising and the longer you're I'm outside in it, the soggier you areI am when you I get back home so that what started at 80-ish ends up feeling like 95. Did I hear some of you have had another round of snow? Wanna trade? ;-)I'm glad I decided to take pics of the new blouse *before* I went outside, even though my hair is still wet from the shower. At least the blouse was still dry then. But it was actually very cool and light feeling in the humidity … just what I had imagined and wanted, so I'm pleased with that.I've been meaning to comment on one of the pattern pieces for this blouse. This one, for the ELASTIC in the sleeves. It's bad enough that there has to be an actual pattern piece instead of a length notation on the construction sheets (not that I'd follow that either), but …… to say you need to cut two?I know what they meant, and no, I don't usually cut out these pieces, but this one just cracked me up."},
{"title": "New Blouse To Wear Tomorrow", "date": "Sunday, March 30, 2008", "text": "Now that the alterations have been done, this is definitely a blouse I can cut and sew in an afternoon, which is great because I want to make it again in a less … er … vibrant color. I'll take a pic of me wearing it tomorrow, but for now here it is on Zillie.I thought I'd be stalled again at the buttons but can you believe this match?? There they were, just waiting in the button bin, and plentiful in number too. Yeah, they're shank buttons that I had to sew on by (gasp!) hand, but I managed to trudge through it. ;-)Here's the final back pattern piece which was changed to sew with a CB seam. The red line is the old CB cut-on-fold line. I kept the width at the top since I wanted to keep the same density of gathering. Instead of adding two waist darts as I was first contemplating, I scooped out the center back at waist level, which is where the extra fabric really needed to be removed. This worked out well. I also removed most of the extra width added at the sideseam area and some more width was removed at CB because my new seam line is 1/2\" in from the original CB. With these changes, the \"essence\" of the blouse is intact but the tent effect is greatly reduced (it's still a loose-fitting blouse, so there is some \"tent\" but in a good way, if you know what I mean!). The last tweak was to lower the front and back armholes about 1/4\" because one last try-on of the muslin told me I should do that (and the muslin was right).Speaking of the armholes and sleeves, the Simplicity instructions said to sew the sleeves in the round and insert them very early on in the construction, before any of the gathering. This is just plain stupid (it's a raglan sleeve on a very casual blouse!) and a royal pain when gathering all the un-flat pieces to the yoke. Instead, I did everything flat and then sewed the sideseams and underarm seams last.There were a couple of comments with questions related to this blouse so I'll answer them now while I'm thinking about it.OP Gal: \"I'm always confused, though, as to what the term \"overfitting\" means.\"For this blouse, it meant that I didn't want to end up with a fitted blouse when I was making a loose, very casual top. I had to accept that there would be some fullness/tenting. For other garments, I think overfitting means taking alterations to the extreme so that it's no longer comfortable to wear and/or flattering. It's better to have fabric skim lumps/bumps instead of accentuate them, and that can happen when fitting becomes overfitting. At least that's my take.Laceflower: \"I too need to do the FBA but patterns never mark the bust point any more. How do you begin with out this needed landmark?\"I either hold the tissue up to me and mark my actual bust point or I'll just guess my best. For me, it's usually obvious where the general vicinity of the apex is on patterns that aren't marked. If I guess wrong, the muslin will let me know. I really am just a fly/sew by the seat of my pants kinda girl. ;-)Cathy: \"I have a question re the alteration on the front side seam. You split the pattern there and spread inserting the needed room. Am I accomplishing the same thing by just adding that measurement to the outer edge of the pattern or am I missing some part of the idea?\"By sliding the seam allowance out like I did, the sideseams of both pieces will still match up perfectly when I'm sewing them. It's like altering a pattern with NO seam allowances and then adding them later. Alterations really need to be done within the body of the pattern, not the seam allowances."},

Along with laundry, grocery shopping, and cleaning bathrooms.This fabric is a bear to photograph. I think I've adjusted it to a pretty close match to the real thing, although it's still looking a tad brighter in the photo than in real life. (You should've seen the neon orange of the original pic!) But what you can't really see are the mini clear sequins sewn into the embroidery at regular intervals. These presented no problem at all when cutting or sewing as they're soft and thin enough that a needle pierces them without a moment's hesistation.At this point, I still have to sew the inside yoke facing down, sew the sideseams/underarms and bottom hem, run elastic in the sleeves, and do the buttons/holes. As soon as I'm finished typing here, I'm going back to the sewing room to finish it.Yesterday, I made a couple more alterations before cutting the real fabric. First, I decided to go with a shaped CB seam and forego the waist darts. I'll take a pic of the altered pattern piece when I'm photographing the finished blouse.I also went ahead and \"altered\" the yoke to make it more narrow in the shoulders. This was not rocket surgery! ;-) All I did was to substitute the size 16 pattern for the front piece, keeping the 18 length and my square shoulder adjustment. The size 16 is on top in the pic below.The back yoke piece had all the sizes so all I had to do with it was trim it to the size 16 width along the bottom edge.I had a big DUH! moment on that one.

It's not something I'd go to meet the Queen in. But really, how often is she going to come knocking anyway?I over-estimated on what I added for extra tushie/tummy room, so it's hanging *very* A-line at the moment. I experimented with pinning a waist dart in the front (seen on the right side in the above pic), and what I think I'll actually end up doing is adding a couple of waist darts in the back instead. I pinned those and it made the front hang better (with no darts), since most of the extra width is coming from the back.I think some shaping is definitely needed if you have any hips at all. The model on the envelope is pretty straight-up and down. I'm not. But I don't want to ruin the comfort factor by overfitting either. Hopefully, I'll be able to strike the correct balance.I'm also going to redistribute the gathering in the front. Using the pattern marks after doing the FBA, it's too full close to my armpit.Below is the front pattern piece laid on my incredibly thread-laden floor. ;-) I started with the size 18. The red lines are a standard spread/slash FBA, with the underarm dart rotated to the neckline gathers. The yellow lines are the extra 2.5\" of length added to the pattern before starting the FBA. The green lines are the extra hip room added at the sideseam by cutting at the seam line and moving the seam allowance outward.This is the back pattern piece. Like above, yellow is the additional length added. The green lines are more width added. I only really needed about 75% of what I added. Oh, and I just remembered I made a swayback tuck, but I forgot to mark that in this pic.These are the yoke pieces. I added 3/8\" for my square shoulders at the outside pattern shoulder by slashing at the seamline and spreading the seam allowance.I think the shoulders are still technically a bit too wide but I'm going to live with it. I really don't want to even think about messing with the yoke.Now it's off for a walk before Chili pokes a hole in my knee."},
{"title": "Thinking About a Mini Wardrobe", "date": "Thursday, March 27, 2008", "text": "First, thank you everyone for the birthday wishes yesterday via comments, email, and PMs on Pattern Review! I turned 46, which means I'm now downhill to 50. Of course, the alternative is much worse, right? ;-) I don't really mind the numbers at all. I just don't like the speed at which everything is flying by. I still remember when a year felt like forever. But it's been forever since it felt like that.We were very low-key at my request. I've got way too much stuff already so I requested no real gifts. My sons made dinner (and since it was Wednesday, it was quesadillas on their menu), then they cleaned up afterward. They also started my day with a big bouquet of spring flowers and funny cards and DH brought home a sinful chocolate birthday cake, which I now have to stare at the rest of today. I wonder how long I can last. After dinner, we planted ourselves in front of the tube and watched a Bon Jovi Unplugged concert. (I wish I had JBJ's aging secret—He looks better now than he ever did!) The guys even stuck around while I watched Top Chef, which they'd only do if it was my birthday or something. ;-)Next up on the sewing front is possibly a Mini Wardrobe inspired by the PatternReview contest starting April 1.** I'm not sure if I'll actually get it done in a month so I can enter, but I'll let it be my motivation to churn out some easy-sew, easy-care summer clothes. Today I'm working on Simplicity 4122. I've made the alterations and am about to cut a muslin.If the muslin works, I may even sew one over the weekend which I won't enter in the contest. It's a very fast top so I can always make a second during the contest timeframe, right? The gathers over the bust are a concern and the real reason for a muslin, so I can see if I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy's older sister. I hope I do like it, though, because it looks so cool and airy and just what I'd want to wear for Florida summers.I think I'm going to stick with the peach/coral & brown theme for a while, with some plain white thrown in as a basic, and that palette will be what I concentrate on for the Mini Wardrobe. I bought this stretch poplin to maybe be a skirt to go with the peach blouse and it arrived the other day.In real life the coral is probably too bright for the blouse, but it will certainly work with other stash items for the Mini Wardrobe. I've got lots of fabrics and patterns swirling in my head as possibilities right now so I thought I'd just jump in with the pattern above and see where it leads, instead of succumbing to analysis paralysis.**Well, scratch all that. I just re-read the dates over on PR and the Mini Wardrobe contest starts May 1. Oops. But I can't wait until May since our Summer will be here before then, so I'm going to do my own and not worry about a contest yet."},

As I mentioned in the review, the wind was really howling when I was taking these photos (which was a comedy in itself, try to snap pics between gusts) and the back view shows how it plastered the blouse against my butt. There is actually plenty of ease back there but you'd never know it by this pic.The Jalie skirt was originally reviewed, here. My expression here looks rather odd, but at least it's a modeled pic, right? And no, Carolyn, I don't have a brown cardigan. But I'm thinking I should since it would blend into my wardrobe rather nicely.Click on any of the photos to see larger versions.* * * * *Now to answer some questions from recent comments.Nancy K, (re the Jalie skirt above): \"This is view D?\"Yes, view D. The skirt with the 8 gores and non-godet flounce.Laceflower (re the Burda blouse): \"Debbie, you feeling OK? This is the tamest fabric I've seen you purchase.\"LOL! Well, sometimes I do need some boring solid colors in the wardrobe. They can't all be wild prints.Anna Szabo (re the Burda blouse): \"Great blouse and I love the fabric I have a question. We appear to have similar shapes. I know you wrote me before that you draft up to the desired size using a similar increment that is used between the sizes of the existing pattern. I got the impression that you also used software to draft your pattern. I do not have the software but would like to do this shirt in my size. 16-18 in the big 4 patterns. Do you think this is possible without the software?\"Thank you! Yes, it's very possible to make this without software and without the pattern. You'll need a fitted blouse that has a side dart and you'll need to be willing to chop up a pattern and make a couple of muslins. The previous posts, here and here, show how to morph a regular fitted blouse into the shapes of the Burda pattern.Nancy K: \"I just looked at your jeans fly front zipper tutorial which is really excellent. How about a tutorial on that great waistband?\"When I make my next pair of jeans/capris, I'll try to remember to take photos. I'm not sure that it's tutorial-worthy though. ;-) Is there something specific you have a question about?Alison: \"… I believe you only want to baste one of them (the one that gets topstitched). This is because the placket is slipped in between the folded-in placket and the blouse and is caught in the topstitching. Now this can't be done if it's already been basted shut (Luckily I'm lazy and only basted one side).\"I did finally figure out what Burda meant, but thank you. I wanted to point out to you, though, that when Burda instructions state to \"baste,\" they usually mean with pins. So, if you keep that in mind, you won't have a problem with something being unmoveable because it's been stitch-basted.Joanne: \"I copied a rtw blouse, got the \"V\" neckline perfect, but my sleeve doesn't fit my armhole, so I'll need to make another sleeve, that's my problem. Can you tell me how to draft a sleeve that will fit into an existing armhole?\"I've never drafted a sleeve from scratch in my life. But what I would do is to use a sleeve and armhole that I know work for me and then copy them onto the new pattern. Just substitute the good armhole by tracing over it onto the new pattern and then use the sleeve that goes with it. I'm all about doing things the easy way. ;-) HTHNancy K: \"Thought you might be interested to know how your old posts are a great resource. I am making a welt pocket in pants and I referred back to this post to see where you put yours and what you used for stabilizer.\"Thank you Nancy. I'm glad to know that what I write is helpful down the road.Ann's Fashion Studio: \"What pattern do you use for the boys boxers? They look great.\"Thank you! I used a now-OOP Simplicity pattern, Simp 8150. I'm sure there must be a replacement pattern available or you can probably find this one on ebay.Becky W (re the Button foot): \"Looks way more functional than my Janome button sewing on foot. Mine does not have the elevation of the button on the garment. I end up getting the button in place and using a sharp pointed wooden skewer (spelling?) from the kitchen to give something to stitch over to give some thread shank to the button. Any ideas for a comperable generic?\"I wish I could be helpful on this but I tend to buy most feet directly from my Viking dealer. I do have some generics, but this isn't one of them. Maybe this one will work?"},
{"title": "Oh Sure!", "date": "Monday, March 24, 2008", "text": "Yep. As soon as I chop off the sleeves, the weather forecast is for cold tonight and tomorrow. And by cold, I mean sub-70. ;-) It's supposed to drop to the 40s tonight, so that's cold even outside of Florida. Back to 80s by the end of the week, though. I now love this shirt again with its new short sleeves so I can wait on the weather.I finished the skirt this morning. I ran out of steam last night and decided to read one of my Adele Margolis books instead. How to Make Clothes That Fit and Flatter: Step-by-Step Instructions for Women Who Like to Sew. Lots of fun and interesting information about styling so far. Oh, and girdles. LOL! It was written in 1969 after all. I'll write more about the book another day.The Burda blouse is out of the wash and ready to be ironed. I'll do that later and try to snap some modeled pics this afternoon. Right now I've got to go clean up the remains of an empty serger cone that Dani snatched out of the trash basket and chewed into shreds. She is such a thief in my sewing room, and so I have to be really careful about what's in her reach. I kinda knew she'd go for the cone and I'd clean it up later. Since there's no real harm, I let her have some fun. Better that than another pillow. ;-)"},
{"title": "Before I Forget", "date": "Sunday, March 23, 2008", "text": "I had meant to show this comparison earlier but then I started working on muslins and the pattern pieces were scattered all over. The white paper on the bottom is my PMB-ified pattern, the sheer pieces are the tracing (w/o seam allowances) of the size 42 from BWOF after I did that \"mock\" FBA on it, last month. They really aren't too far off in general shape. My pattern is wider, of course, because I am. I see now that I should've copied the angle from the bib section instead of guessing, but my second guess turned out very close so it's all good.Thank you everyone for the nice comments about the blouse! It was fun having you along on the project, encouraging and motivating me. It will be nice to have this addition to my summer wardrobe.Speaking of which … I've already moved on and have cut out a new summer skirt. I'll sew it up after dinner and will then have something to wear with the blouse when I take pics. It's my TNT Jalie 2681.I'm using the same fabric I used for this Onion top.But … I hacked off the long sleeves of that Onion top today. I wore it exactly twice over the winter because of those darn sleeves. The wrist/cuff area fits fine at my wrists, but it's too snug to push up my arms, which is what I usually do with long sleeves since our \"winters\" are not exactly frigid most days. I love the fabric and I hated to see it mocking me hanging in the closet, so it will now be a spring/summer top. And it will match the skirt, if I want a 2-piece dress look. I'll hold judgment on that until I see how they look together.I eeked the skirt out of every last inch of that fabric. All 8 gores and 1 flounce piece were cut without a problem, but I had to chop the second flounce in the middle and add a seam. I'll make that the back flounce and no one, especially me, will ever notice it."},

I need to wash it, though, to remove the marks and basting glue before I can give it a good pressing. Once that is done, I'll take a pic of me wearing it and write up my entry for the contest. (I think this will be the first PR contest for which I actually enter something!)Overall, I like it and it fits very well. Yay muslins! But as Cidell mentioned in her blog today (BTW, awesome blouse Cidell!), it takes some getting re-used to wearing a blouse made from non-stretch fabric, as this one is. I feel very prim and proper. LOL!I ended up using peach (yes, the fabric is really peach, not pink) buttons from stash, which are actually and amazingly the same shade of peach, just darker. When I auditioned them last night, I wasn't thrilled. But they started looking much better the more it poured rain outside and now they've actually grown on me so I may just end up keeping them. That, and who the heck wants to remove six buttons only to sew on six more?So, what should I be asking Carolyn to shop for in NYC for me? ;-)The blouse is coming along. If the sewing continues to go well, I'll have it done this afternoon. Well, except for buttons which I have yet to buy. I'll bring a swatch of the fabric to the store with me, but I'm already thinking that I'll end up with very basic white-ish buttons because, again, the fabric is telling me to keep it simple. I'm also thinking of covering one button to see how that looks.The next thing to do is to decide how long I want the blouse to be so I can incorporate the button placket/facing into the hem at the center front corners. Then it's on to the collar and stand.Ah, the button placket … See anything weird going on there?This is something I'd never point out in real life, but since you're all sewing with me, I'll come clean. ;-)In hindsight I obviously wasn't thinking too clearly when I originally decided to cut the plackets on the bias, thinking how nice the stripes would look on the diagonal. Well, that was a good thought, except when the button placket is to be attached to bib sections that are already on the bias. With the placket and the bib on the bias, the whole front would look lopsided since the diagonals would chevron off-center. Oops. And double oops because by first cutting two plackets on the bias, I really limited what I had left for usable scraps.Luckily, I had enough to cut one placket on the lengthwise grain and since only the outermost placket will be the visual focus (and the store was closed), I decided I could get away without buying more fabric. So I have one straight and one on the bias. We'll call it a Design Feature, and move on."},
{"title": "Letting the Fabric Speak", "date": "Friday, March 21, 2008", "text": "I started sewing the blouse yesterday, and this is my fabric (ETA: bought at Joann's last weekend). I stalled last night as I was contemplating the topstitching. I thought I wanted a thread that really stood out. But no matter what I tried, it just didn't look right. The darker tones were looking like they were trying too hard to be topstitching and contrasting in a bad way with the woven stripes of the fabric.I decided to go with the lighter thread (the one at the top) to match the fabric. It won't stand out, but it doesn't need to. The stripes are enough. And, hey, it means no thread changes as I sew which is definitely A Good Thing. ;-)Hopefully construction will continue smoothly and I'll finish the blouse over the weekend, with enough time to enter it into the Fitted Blouse Contest on PatternReview.com."},
{"title": "Nope, Not Yet", "date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2008", "text": "All I've done today for the blouse is to press the fabric and give myself a headache trying to figure out what Burda means for the half-hidden button placket instructions. I think BWOF would be the perfect pattern magazine if a native English-speaker wrote the instructions for the English language version. I assume the other language translations are just as bad?? I don't mind the short instructions but it's really hard to put my head around a term that just isn't what we usually say in English, which tells me it's more of a literal translation than vernacular. Oh well. All I really needed to do was re-read Christina's review where one photo is as good as 10,000 Burda words. And after all that, I've decided I'm not going to use that half-hidden placket anyway. It's too bulky. What a waste of a headache. LOL! So I tossed my experiment fabric pieces and took the dogs for a walk. It's over 80 degrees today, sunny and breezy. There aren't too many days left before the weather turns unbearably hot and humid so I had to get out and enjoy it while it's here. I noticed a lot of new baby goats in the big pasture but I didn't bring carrots today so we kept walking. Spring has definitely sprung.I did mend DS#2's jeans, caught up on the ironing pile, and cleaned up from the muslins so the sewing room is now tidy and guilt-free and I'm ready to start on the blouse. I think I really just needed one day away from it to re-energize."},
{"title": "Final Muslin", "date": "Tuesday, March 18, 2008", "text": "Muslin #3, and the last one for this top. I'm ready to cut bait and fish. Er, I mean cut fabric and sew. ;-)I traced the BWOF collar and stand for the size 42 and they fit the neckline (and my neck) perfectly without any alteration so that was easy enough. I also went ahead and cut the back with a center seam, which I've decided I like and I'm keeping for the final. I eased the back shoulder darts to the front piece and I'll stick with that method for the final since the dart is only 1/2\" wide total. The last thing to tweak is those stupid back waist darts. I'll see if DH is willing to pin them for me as the last step for final blouse. Well, I know he'd be willing. It will be a matter of whether he's good at it or not. LOL!Making muslins delays having the final garment to wear but once I start, I find that I actually enjoy sewing them in an oddball sort of relaxing way. Cutting out goes quickly, there's no interfacing to mess with and the sewing is fast and ugly. And then the end result is progress you can actually track. I guess that explains why it was really no big deal to cut and sew three separate muslins for this blouse. Plus the knowledge that I can now just cut and sew the real blouse without interruption. (Carolyn, I'll send along this final muslin with the pattern. I'm pretty sure my shoulders are squarer than yours but at least it will give you a jumping off point.) The real fabric is in the dryer. Fingers crossed that it doesn't come out in one big unwieldy pile of wrinkles."},
{"title": "Not Reinventing the Wheel", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2008", "text": "The sleeve on your left is the \"new\" sleeve. But it's not really new, since I traced the actual Burda sleeve from the 01/2008 issue. Because this is a gathered sleeve, I figured I'd have some leeway in my adjustment \"techniques.\" I measured my sleeveband and then noted the measurement for the largest size Burda sleeveband (size 42) and calculated the difference (4.25\"). I slashed my tracing straight down the middle, parallel to the grainline, and spread it that amount. Voila! Done. Oh wait, I also added another 1/2\" to the bottom when I cut the muslin because to my eye it looked a wee bit too short for me.But the proof is in the pudding, right? So I cut out one sleeve and sewed it to the other armhole of yesterday's muslin.I think this will do just fine. Still puffed, but so much less so. And it fits great. If only all sleeve alterations were so easy.The problem stems from PMB's default puffed sleeve, which I just clicked buttons to produce and cut out as is, planning to try it and see and if that didn't work, move on to morphing the actual Burda sleeve. You can see the whopping difference in the two sleeve patterns below and why the PMB sleeve was completely overwhelming. But I had to try it just to know.Yesterday I also sewed a sway back tuck into the muslin which made a huge improvement. Still need to move those darts though.This morning I've made what I hope are the final tweaks to the pattern:1. If you look at the photo above with me wearing the new sleeve, you can see vertical folds. (Ignore the diagonal fold as it's an anomoly from the too-long collar.) I really shouldn't have extended the shoulders, at least not on a puffed sleeve blouse where (I learned today) it's actually better to reduce the shoulder width a little and let the room of the puff compensate. Live (make muslins) and learn. So I trimmed the front shoulder, tapering to nothing going into the bottom of the armhole and darted the back (since I actually like back shoulder darts).2. I incorporated the swayback tuck into the back pattern piece and I'm now debating whether to cut it with a CB seam, mostly because the original Burda pattern has a CB seam and I'm trying to copy it as closely as possible.3. I traced the Burda collar and stand pieces and morphed my PMB pieces to match, as well as shortening the PMB pieces overall since yesterday's muslin told me they were too long.I'm going to cut one more muslin because I'd rather be safe than sorry, and it really doesn't take very long to sew ugly. ;-) I especially need to test the altered collar and stand since it would be a major drag to get almost done with the real blouse and then be fiddling with those. (Note to self: get that fabric in the washer!)Parting shot: All of the odd bobbins I've used up sewing muslins, with 2 more still in the machine."},
{"title": "Another Crumb for Carolyn", "date": "Sunday, March 16, 2008", "text": "The stars aligned yesterday and I was finally able to make it to Joann's, with a coupon, and return with a full bolt of muslin. (I also left with a cut of fabric, which may be what I use for this blouse but I want to see how it washes first.)So, Carolyn, here's the next crumb: Muslin #2. Yes, I'm wearing my PJs. ;-)There are still some issues. The main problem is the sleeve. The sleeve band at the bottom is too tight (it's ripped open in the photo of me wearing it) and I'm not liking the super-puffiness of the sleeve. It's too tight because the sleeve itself drafted wonky and I had to sew out about an inch to make the seams match, so I'll just correct the problem and it will be fine. But I know I'll be removing some of that puff which will mean at least one more sleeve trial, but I haven't decided if I want to keep it a semi-puffy sleeve or just go for a regular sleeve. Right now I'm leaning toward keeping it semi-puffy because I like the look (regardless of whether it's *my* best look).Other issues: The new collar band and collar drafted too long for this neckline so I'm going to have to cut them down. Not a big deal. It also looks like I need a bit more bust room but part of the problem is the too-tight sleeve so I'll revisit that after a new sleeve is in place. The back is so-so. I need to move the waist darts and sew them deeper at my waist.On the bright side, I like the new angle of the bib seam. ;-)None of this is really major — just some tweaking left to do, so I'm still encouraged. I'm going to set it aside for today, though, while we do some family things to celebrate DS#1's 19th birthday.* * * * *Donna, you asked if I cut my PMB pattern pieces out exactly and then lay them on the fabric so that when I cut the fabric, I'm not cutting onto paper. Yes, that's what I do. The paper is too thick to stay flat and stable if I cut it and fabric at the same time."},
{"title": "Continuing On With Fitting the Blouse", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2008", "text": "(Click on the graphic above to see it in more detail. My latest changes are in pink.)I still have not made it to Joann's for more muslin. I was actually out the door and in the car yesterday when I realized that I didn't have a current coupon. I used them last weekend on thread, the same trip when I forgot to buy the muslin. I'm not buying a full bolt of muslin at full price, so I'll have to wait until the next flyer shows up in the mailbox. For all I know, it may already be there since I didn't check the mail yesterday afternoon.In the meantime, I tried on the sewn muslin again and started evaluating. I decided the reason the shoulder seams were hitting me weird is because the whole back wasn't laying properly. And that's because my butt got even bigger since the last time I drafted a blouse with the software. Depressing but true, and so something that had to be dealt with. If not immediately on the body, at least on the pattern. ;-)I slashed the muslin straight up the back waist darts. Now that the fabric had enough ease to go over the curves, everything was much better. So I added 1-1/4\" to the back sideseam of my pattern. I think (hope?) this is a bit too much, but I can sew it out, if necessary, at the darts and sideseams after muslin #2 is made.Another change I made was to the front bib seam. I added 5/8\" to the center piece at the \"princess\" seam and removed the same from the outside piece, in order to create a wider angle in the seam.The last changes were to lower the front and back necklines small amounts but which necessitated new collar pieces, and to extend the shoulders 1/4\" (because Belinda convinced me that a slightly extended shoulder seam feels better to wear during my usual mom/wife daily activities).Only the pink pieces needed to be printed again and that's what I did. Another 12 pages now waiting to be taped together, which will only take a few minutes once I get into the sewing room.Hopefully I'll only need one more muslin. And hopefully, I'll get it done over the weekend so I can work on the real blouse."},
{"title": "Cooking, and Other Stuff", "date": "Thursday, March 13, 2008", "text": "Wednesdays are usually quesadilla night here, so sayeth DS#2. Last night I took pics during the process.First, the ingredients:Southwest Chicken Quesadillas(I tend not to really measure when I make these, so the amounts are best estimates. If you like less spicy, use less chili powder, chipotle, etc. You really can't go wrong with just winging it.)3-4 boneless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces1 green bell pepper, deseeded and chopped1 large onion, sliced medium thin2 tbl chili powder2 tbl powdered chipotle pepper1-2 tsp salt1/2 - 1 tsp black pepper1-2 tbl dried cilantro (or sub fresh if you have it, I didn't last night)one 16 oz can tomatoes (I usually buy \"chili\" tomatoes)one-half* 16 oz can yellow corn (drained)one-half* 16 oz can black beans (drained and rinsed)1 small can green chiles2-4 cups shredded cheese (I use a \"fiesta\" pre-mix)10-15 10\" flour tortillascooking sprayOptional: sour cream, jalapenos, and Kraft Spicy Ranch dressing for garnishments*I store the other half of the can contents in plastic containers in the fridge and use them the next week.Spray large skillet with cooking spray and cook chicken on medium heat until pink is gone. Drain. Add all of the remaining ingredients, except cheese, tortillas, and spray, and continue cooking until bell peppers and onions are soft.Place tortillas in a stack and spray one side of each with cooking spray. Using a second skillet, lay one tortilla spray side down. Add a small handful of cheese to one half and then a scoop of the chicken mixture. Fold over and cook at medium heat until brown on the bottom, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and brown the other side.I usually do two at once. I add the second to the pan after the first has been flipped once, which makes it easier for timing and for flipping a weird shape. ;-)The rest is DS's job. He uses a pizza cutter and slices each quesadilla into 3 sections. And then arranges them all on a serving platter, as in the first photo above. As you can see, we make lots. But DS likes them for his lunch so some go for that the next day and the rest get eaten over the weekend. Cheaper than prepackaged microwave meals, and much tastier!=============================Sqeamish Alert!Instead of quesadillas, Chili had other plans: Fresh lizard (apologies to Geico!).=============================And, finally, one reason it's been fairly quiet around here. DS#1 (2d from right) and his band left \"on tour\" last Friday. They've been through North Florida, Alabama, and are now in Nashville, Tennessee. They'll be gone another 3-4 days. DS promised that he'd call every day and so far he has. They're having a ball! Oh to be 18 (19 this weekend) again, without a care in the world!=============================Now I'm off to Joann's to pick up muslin."},
{"title": "Update", "date": "Wednesday, March 12, 2008", "text": "I've tried on the blouse muslin with the proper undergarments. It has some problems. It fits great across and under the bust but there's something wonky with the shoulder seam. It's much too far forward for me, so I will have to investigate that. The back neckline is also bad. But that's my own fault for forgetting to scoop it out. PMB doesn't make nice back necklines IMO. Finally, the front seaming is a little bit off compared to the actual pattern makes I've seen so I will adjust that. (Have you seen Laura's review today?? OMG - it's gorgeous!) These changes will mean a new print-out and definitely a trip to Joann's since I squeezed the first trial out of my last remaining muslin.All of this to come later as I'm being poked in the knee by Chili who is reminding me that we're late for our midday walk. He keeps better time than my wristwatch and never lets me forget it. Did I ever mention that when he wants something he pokes at my leg with his nose like he's tapping on my shoulder? It is the most adorable thing, except when you're trying to type a quick blog entry.Oh, and Lisa, yes … DS was wearing a pair of the brown/orange/red boxers I made and everyone had quite a view. Thankfully this happened in 7th period so he didn't have to walk around the entire day with his behind sticking out. Although he really didn't seem to mind it one bit. ;-)Boy, this looks terrible in the photo, even for a muslin. But the neckline seam allowance is still on the top so it was really hard to get it onto Zillie. And apparently my pinning-evenly skills were sorely lacking this morning. (Speaking of Zillie, I really need to spend an hour with her getting her back to matching me. As she is right now, she really only matches me in the bust.)While my bust is low thanks to gravity, the black dots are not marking the bust points. Those were my quick marks for pivot points when sewing the pieces together. The underbust seaming really is symetrical and would be in the photos if I had taken more time to smooth things out before pinning. Oh well. I'm not going for perfection here. It's really just to let you all know that I am actually making some progress on this. ;-)I haven't actually officially tried it on me yet. I went to my sewing room before hitting the shower the morning and so the girls aren't properly supported yet. I did quickly put it on over my PJs and the circumferences seem to be OK, so fingers crossed that it won't need too much tweaking overall once I'm wearing a bra. (That's TMI, isn't it?)  But my general impression is that it's going to work. For the heck of it, I timed myself from pattern sheets fresh off the printer (fresh meaning 4 days ago!), through taping them together, cutting them out, and then cutting the muslin. I know that one concern about pattern software is \"taping all those sheets together.\"I had a total of 21 sheets of letter-size paper (similar to A4 for non-U.S. readers). It took me 8 minutes to align and tape the sheets together to form my complete pattern pieces. Yes, 8 minutes. It takes me longer than that to unfold and press pattern tissue and then wrestle what I'm not using back into the envelope. Here's what the layout looks like before it prints. The yellow shows the pages that I've selected to print so I don't end up printing blank pages which would have nothing on them but a footer and alignment marks.After taping the pattern together, it took another 5 minutes to cut out the individual pieces with a rotary cutter. Then another 10-15 to cut out the muslin. And finally, about 30 minutes to sew it all together, including changing my threads to use up non-matching, nearly-empty bobbins and pressing seams as I went. So, about an hour from print to muslin. Yes, I have practice because I've been taping sheets together for a while now. But it never has taken that long or been a major drag. I still haven't sewn a sleeve or the collar area, which I intend to do, but that won't take very long either since it's just a muslin and it doesn't have to be pretty.Carolyn, of course you can have a copy of this pattern. But keep in mind what you'll be getting! It will be worse than a BWOF pattern. There are no notches on my \"custom\" pieces and some of the curves I drew I just smoothed/trued when I cut instead of fighting with the limited curve drawing tools in the software. Which means they will look rough on paper.Parting shot: Remember DS's jeans that I patched the other day, except for the back pocket per his request? Well, this is how they came home yesterday. Ahem. Maybe sometimes mother does know best?? ;-)"},
{"title": "Could Be a Blouse", "date": "Sunday, March 9, 2008", "text": "I started doodling this BWOF blouse almost a month ago. I finally opened the file again and finished it this morning. It's printing as I type. I'm hoping to get the pattern taped together and a muslin cut today, but losing that hour last night feels more like I lost four and I'm already behind on my day so I'll have to keep my fingers crossed that it will actually happen. I'll also need to reshape the collar to match the magazine pattern but I can do that manually at some point before I cut real fabric.To refresh your memory, the blouse is this one, #108 from the 01/2008 issue of Burda WOF:Here's the progression of my pattern. More details are in the February 14 post linked above.I went to Joann's yesterday to pick up some thread. It's been a long time since I've been there alone or without anyone waiting in the car outside. I got my thread and then I wandered over to the pattern books to see if any Simplicity patterns caught my eye since they were still on sale. I ended up with these four:I'll probably never make the Project Runway pattern (3530) but I wanted to look at the short sleeve pattern pieces since they caught my eye. 3684 is a multi-cup size bibbed-front blouse which may be Plan B if the self-draft above doesn't work out. 3874 has a cute jacket that looks like a fast sew to make a casual cover-up for the blast of A/C in stores and restaurants here during summer. And, finally, 4122 will make a perfect dog walking top. It's probably not going to be my most flattering style and if not, I won't be wearing it where I'll run into lots of people. But it looks so airy and cool that I'll trade fashion for comfort when it's 95 degrees and 400 percent humidity. The donkeys, goats and horses won't care what I'm wearing, especially if I bring carrots.I also looked around at the fabric while I was there. It wasn't for lack of trying, but I came home with nothing. There wasn't one single bolt of anything that I wanted. In fact, there were lots of empty spaces on the shelves so maybe I missed all the good stuff. Yeah. Right. ;-) That's OK. I have plenty of fabric to keep me busy. Except I totally forgot one reason I went, which was to buy a bolt of muslin. ARghhhh. I really don't feel like going back today so I'll drag out something ugly to use in the interim and maybe try to make it to J's during the week when it's less busy.Another blouse pattern on my radar is this McCall's 5522 I bought a month ago. I'm not sure if I'll make this actual pattern or morph my TNT self-drafted pattern so that it has the underbust gathers. For now, the pattern envelope will just be eye candy and a visual reminder of what I hope to make."},
{"title": "Not a Blouse", "date": "Thursday, March 6, 2008", "text": "This is not a blouse. It's the now-repaired crotch of DS#2's jeans. You'll probably notice the pocket is not repaired. That was upon request. Teenagers!These also are not a blouse. Three are more mom-made knit boxers for DS and the striped pair is RTW, now repaired and once again ready for action. When he wears the jeans above, the boxers will peek out of the pocket hole. I think I'm supposed to be happy about that. ;-)Adding a sideseam to the boxer pattern changed my order of construction a little bit but I think I actually prefer it. For one thing, I can sew the fly area while the pieces are still flat — always a plus. For another, it's so much more fabric-efficient. Timewise, it's probably about even between the two. The no-sideseams are faster to cut out but a little more fiddly to sew, and vice versa.So, as you've probably figured out by now, I've made absolutely zero progress on any sort of blouse for me. Maybe tomorrow. But at least I've cleared off the sewing table."},

But the mailbox hasn't noticed. Friday, the latest Threads arrived and yesterday was a bonanza of Stitches, Burda WOF and Ottobre Woman.This issue of Threads is one of the best in a while IMO. The articles are more in-depth and not just 2-pagers with lots of white space. I loved the two costuming articles even though costuming is not one of my true interests. And how cool to find out that the Cirque de Soleil's production offices are nearly local to me. There's also a jeans article from Sandra Betzina which, of course, caught my eye. It was interesting to read how her process differs from mine (construction order, mainly). And I like anything Kenneth King writes so another welcome article there.Australian Stitches, on the other hand, seems to be going in the other direction. I'm sad about that because I've really enjoyed not just another sewing magazine but one with an international flavor. Aussie girls … I know you're a few issues ahead of this one, can I hope for better things to come?Both the Ottobre and Burda magazines have patterns I'm putting on my (neverending) list. Pattern Review is running a fitted blouse contest this month so maybe I'll pick something from one of these and actually get it made before the deadline. Or maybe it will be another pattern. But I really do need and want to make some summer blouses and I'm hoping to get my act together this week and make some progress.While I'm waiting for the magic spark, I do have 3 more pairs of boxers for DS cut out and I'll work on those this afternoon. I traced the no-sideseam pattern so I could add sideseams. That took all of 10 minutes, and now the big scraps from the first round of boxers have been used efficiently and are not going back to the stash closet.Oh, before I forget again, I'll answer some comments:\"May I ask what brand of bread machine you use and if you would recommend it/buy it again?\" I have a Black & Decker, but it's at least 8 years old. I know it must've been updated since then so I don't know how the quality compares these days. But I'd definitely buy my same machine again, if I could.\"You'd think I'd know what you mean by \"cook the chicken\", but I'm wondering if you saute/fry it? bake it? nuke it?\" I just stir-fry it with a bit of cooking spray in the frypan.\"Can you tell me where you got the midget sunflower seeds?\" They were part of the \"Artisan\" mix from King Arthur flour.\"What program do you use to outline your work on the computer?

{"title": "Pizza Shop", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2008", "text": "DS#1's favorite pizza topping is BBQ chicken. (He could eat chicken every night of the week, but that's another story.) Over the weekend we somehow ended up talking about BBQ chicken pizza and so I decided that I'd try making pizza dough in the bread machine and we'd have pizza for Monday night's dinner.When we order pizza, the boys usually go through one themselves and I figured I'd need to make at least two pizzas. Until I read the recipe, I thought one batch of dough would be enough for two large pizzas. I was wrong. I'd have to make the dough twice.I started making the dough yesterday morning, timing it so that the second batch would be ready when it was actually time to make the pizzas. While the first batch of dough was processing, I went ahead and cooked the chicken, added BBQ sauce, and then put it in a covered bowl to sit in the fridge for a few hours and marinate.Here are the two pizzas assembled and ready to go in the oven.DS anticipating the tasty goodness. (His words!)One finished pizza and the accompanying salad.It turned out great and tasted wonderful. The pizza was so filling that we could've gotten by with just one. But now DS and I have pizza leftovers for lunch today, so that's fine with us.There's nothing really fancy about this recipe since I used some ready-made products and the dough recipe from my bread machine manual, but here it is:BBQ Chicken Pizza & Bread Machine Pizza DoughDough:1 Cup Beer or Water (I used water, we were out of beer)1 tbsp. Shortening (I used olive oil)1 tbsp. Sugar1 tsp. Salt3 Cups White Bread Flour1-1/4 tsp. Yeast2 tbsp. Cornmeal1. Put all ingredients except for cornmeal into bread pan in the order listed.2. Process on Dough setting.3. Remove dough to a lightly floured surface. If necessary (it wasn't), knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle.4. Grease pans (two 12-inch, one 14-inch or one 15x10 inch) and sprinkle with cornmeal. (I used pizza stones so I didn't grease them but I did use the cornmeal.)5. Roll out dough and place on pan/stone. (We used a combination of \"pizza shop dough handling\" and a floured rolling pin.) 5. Top each pizza with sauce, toppings, cheese, etc. Bake at 425 for 15-25 minutes, or until done. Pizza is done when edges of crust are golden and cheese is bubbly.Yield: 1 large or 2 medium pizzasTopping (for 2 large pizzas):3 boneless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces2/3 bottle BBQ sauce1-1/2 jars of pizza sauce (about 2-3 cups)1 green pepper, chopped into small pieces1/2 onion, sliced thinhandful of fresh cilantroshredded cheese (4-6 cups) (I combined mozzarella, parmesan, cheddar and jack)Cook chicken on stove until done. Add enough BBQ sauce to coat plus a little extra. Cook for a few more minutes until the BBQ sauce is absorbed. Remove from heat and set aside.Pour 1-1/2 jars of pizza sauce into a bowl. Add 1/2 - 1 cup of BBQ sauce (amount is per your preference). Mix and then using a ladle, spoon over pizza crust and spread to within 1/2\" of crust edge.Sprinkle on cheese. Add BBQ chicken, onion slices, and green peppers. Add cilantro leaves over everything. (We like cilantro so we probably used more than average.)=================Is it lunchtime yet? ;-)"},
{"title": "I Love My Button Foot", "date": "Sunday, February 24, 2008", "text": "I'm the first to admit I have a serious addiction to presser feet. I own 99% of the feet Viking makes for my machine and a few others Viking doesn't make. I'm sure I'll have them all one of these days. Most of the feet work wonderfully. Many I can't live without anymore and some others mostly collect dust, and yet I still can't bear to part with them. The button sewing-on foot is one of the gems.Before Viking came out with this foot I would still sew buttons on by machine, using the hump-jumper thingie and a piece of tape. It was fiddly and I'm not really sure if it was actually easier or faster than sewing them by hand but at least it wasn't sewing on by hand! ;-)The Viking foot comes with this little button grabbing tool. You squeeze it slightly and insert the prongs into the holes in the button. The tool expands a bit and the button is \"stuck\" on it until you squeeze the tool again to release it. This removes all the fiddly-ness from placing the buttons into the foot and in position over the fabric.The foot itself has a \"shelf\" where you rest the button. When the presser foot is in the full down position, the button is sandwiched securely between the two layers of the foot. There is also a finger that can be moved in and out for creating thread shanks of varying height.Here's the grabber tool still holding the button after I've put the button into the foot. I leave the tool in place until I put the foot down.Here the foot is down and I'm ready to stitch. Pardon all the lint on my machine. It was cleaning day today and the machines all got a thorough going over, but not until after this photo was taken.My machine has a specific button sewing stitch, which is basically a zigzag stitch set for the width between most button thread holes. I say \"most\" although I've not yet had a button for which this stitch wasn't perfect so maybe I should amend that to \"all.\" It's a handy stitch and coupled with this foot, it's the answer for sewers like me who prefer not to sew on buttons by hand.If you have a Viking, you must get this foot! If you don't have a Viking, other brands do have a similar foot and there are generics, but I don't think any of those come with the little grabber tool. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about that.)You've now been enabled. Again. ;-)"},
{"title": "More Boxers, With a Little Tutorial", "date": "Saturday, February 23, 2008", "text": "Two more pair for DS. The paisley is fairly sedate, especially when compared to the floral. But DS has a wild streak and he won't mind wearing purple/fucshia floral boxers. In fact, he'll probably make sure they stick out of his pants a little. ;-)Taly asked to see the pattern piece so here that is. You can see the add-on I made to the fly area so that I could construct like the RTW pair. The extension is 2 inches wide.As I mentioned last post, my construction differs from the pattern instructions. On the L pattern piece only (the one where the fly overlap will end up on top), cut off 1\" of that extra 2\" that was added to the fly opening. Turn it under 1\" and press a crease. I use a pressing cloth so I don't melt the fabric!On the R piece, fold the extension under 1\" and press, and then fold it under again another inch and press. (Only fold the R piece twice.)Once both sides were pressed, I used a glue stick to hold the folds in place since the fabric is slippery.On the R piece only, stitch the extension in place 1\" from the edge, catching the fold. You can do this from the back side.Here's the back side of the R piece after the stitching.Next, press up your leg hems. It will be helpful to have this crease already in place later. Then unfold the hem and sew/serge the inseam edges together, separately for each piece of course, so that you end up with two \"tubes.\"Turn one \"tube\" right side out and the other wrong side out. Slip the right-side-out piece inside the other so that right sides are touching. Align the crotch curve edges and the outside edges of the pressed-under fly extensions. Starting at the bottom of the fly extensions, sew/serge in one motion all the way up to the waist edge, as shown below. (Keep in mind this photo shows the boxers flat. You will only be sewing/serging along the edge.)Next, separate the fly opening and fold over the top extension (L piece) once so that the fly opening lays flat at the bottom. (The extension will pretty much want to do this fold itself.) Stitch the L piece extension, ending approximately 2\" above the fly extension bottom edge (which is underneath).Close the fly so the L side is over the R and pin in place, or you can use my hi-tech method of taping in place. (I like the tape better because some knits will run/ladder if you pierce them in the wrong place with a pin.)Now finish stitching the L fly extension, starting where you left off and curving into the Center Front seam. Continue up along the CF and then cross over back to where you started. This will anchor the bottom edges of the fly extensions in place.While the CF is still taped, I sew the button in place, stitching through both layers of the fly. DS doesn't actually use the fly opening so he's OK with a buttonhole-less button.Hem the leg. Since the crease has already been set, all I have to do is move to my CS machine and stitch.I didn't take photos of the elastic application (sorry!), but I changed that up too. The Simplicity instructions have you fold down a casing and thread the elastic through. I don't like that method because the elastic always twists later on. (The RTW boxers were not done that way either.) Instead, I sewed the elastic into a circle and then quarter-marked the elastic and the waist. Then I put the elastic next to the wrong side of the waist and serged the raw edge of the waist and the elastic together, stretching the elastic to fit the waist between my quarter marks. (This is a stop-and-go process as you stretch, serge, readjust, stretch, serge, readjust, etc.)After the elastic was attached, I folded down the waist/elastic once, toward the inside, and coverstitched it into place while stretching the fabric/elastic flat. The last step is to stitch along the top edge of the waist, about 1/4\" from the edge. I did that on my sewing machine. The RTW has a chainstitch there, but I didn't feel like unthreading/un-needling and then rethreading/re-needling my CS machine.These boxers with the one pattern piece are extremely fast to cut and sew. But … I'm going to have to make a copy of this pattern adding a sideseam because I have big \"scraps\" of the fabrics left over which are enough to make more boxers from, but only if I have separate pattern pieces for each body quadrant. If I had bought the fabric specifically to make these boxers, I would've bought less and wouldn't have big leftover pieces to use. But since I didn't, there's too much for just one pair of boxers and too little for anything else unless I make sideseams in the pattern.02/28/08:  Edited just to see if Bloglines now picks up both feeds for this post."},
{"title": "Drop Trou", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2008", "text": "DS#2 has been bugging me for weeks to buy him new boxers. The problem is I haven't been able to find more of what he wants, which are silky *knit* boxers. Silk, yes. Cotton knit, yes. But not silky (tricot) knit. They were everywhere a couple of years ago. But now? Nuthin.This morning I wandered into my sewing room — where I haven't been all week — to put away some fabric I had prewashed and to repair the boxers he does have. It suddenly dawned on me that I have some tricot! (Duh!) Soon, I had pulled out some prints and solids that would work for his boxers and had dug out a pattern.The pattern is Simplicity 8150, which is long OOP. The boxers pattern has a grand total of one piece (no sideseams) and was even already cut out. I thought that might be a problem since the last time I used it was for St. Patrick's Day themed boxers years ago when the boys were a lot younger. But I laid one pair of the RTW boxers on it and by using 1/4\" seams, it was going to be pretty good match. Yay!!I spent about 30 minutes studying the construction of the RTW around the fly opening because after reading the pattern instructions, I knew I'd have to change things up. I added onto the fly facings so I could fold them over double per the RTW and cut out the fabric. First I mended the RTW and then I finished up some other errands in and out of the house. It was about 4:30 PM when I got back into the sewing room to sew the new pair. I had just finished them when DS walked in from football practice. He loves the funky print (which is not as pink as it looks in this photo) and they fit him exactly like the RTW. Yay! Success and relief that I can stop tearing my hair out looking for more in the stores and instead start whipping 'em up in an hour now that I have the construction worked out.And it was very nice to be back in the sewing room again."},
{"title": "Digital Sewing", "date": "Thursday, February 14, 2008", "text": "This blouse from the 01/2008 issue of Burda WOF was recently the topic of an alterations query on Pattern Review. Even before that, though, it had caught my eye.There is more than one way to do most things and thus the advice for how to make a Full Bust Alteration (FBA) was varied. Some advocated treating the seams as princess lines and doing a \"FFRP* Princess FBA.\" Others (me!) thought it would be less tedious to do the regular ol' FFRP FBA and then rotate the horizontal dart to the shoulder with the existing dart.I had a spare hour the other night and decided to give it a whirl. The largest size of this pattern (42) is still too small for me so I'll never actually sew this version to try it out. But pinning on Zillie and holding it up to my actual bust both pre- and post-alteration told me it would work fine.There are 3 pieces which make up the front bodice. Each is outlined in a different color in these photos. The black outlines show my slash/spread alterations.I gave up drawing the outlines on the photos before I had finished the one which shows rotating the dart. Whoops. I still have the pics so maybe I'll finish the \"series\" just to be complete.In the meantime, today I doodled with my patternmaking software while eating lunch. I took a plain old side bust dart blouse and drew in the style lines. Then I rotated the side dart to the shoulder, which is the part missing from the pics above.I need to reshape the bib portion a little better, but you get the idea. I'm not sure if this will actually ever be a blouse for me but I do think it will at least make it to the muslin stage before I make a final decision.Happy Valentine's Day!===================*FFRP = Fit For Real People by Palmer/Pletsch"},

The party will be outside around a bonfire. DS#1 and I went to the grocery store (where I had just done the week's shopping yesterday!) and bought the food and drink stuff.In about 20 minutes I'm going to start making 6 big pans of brownies and assembling sandwiches on long loaves of bread to be cut up for finger sandwiches on a platter. The rest of the party snacks will be S'mores, Cokes, bottled water & hot cocoa. And whatever chips/dip the kids bring themselves.The Tiki lamps are in place down the driveway and around the firepit.

{"title": "It's a Wrap", "date": "Friday, February 8, 2008", "text": "The top is finished. You can read the full review on PatternReview.com, here.I did use Rose's trick of sewing the ties in half so they would stop rolling out to the wrong side. This worked great so thanks again! (BTW Rose, are you MasoumaRose on PR?)Below are two photos showing the after-the-fact elastic insertion. I threaded it through the end of the hem straight through to the other side. I used safety pins to hold it in place while I tried it on and then anchored it at the two areas between the red circles. I pulled the tails out at the sides and cut them off so the only elastic left is between those two points. (Just for kicks, I also pinned the stretched elastic at the armhole seams to simulate how the elastic would behave if I followed the pattern instructions. It definitely pulled the armholes inward in an odd way so I'm glad I didn't have to be stuck with only that option.)The top on me:Two questions from the comments regarding this top:From Sherril: \"I was worried about those ties not working on me since I have such a short waist. Do you think they would work better if they were just shortened and tied in the back, not wrapped around to the front?\"Personally, I don't like anything tied in the back after a certain age … say 10. ;-) To me, it says either \"little girl\" or \"maternity.\" So, my answer is no. I think you should tie in front, but also lengthen the overall length of the top to give the illusion of more torso/waist. And you'll probably want to use Rose's idea too. Just my 2 cents.From Nancy K: \"Did you do an fba on this? It is not clear.\"Yes, and No. ;-) No, because I was using my TNT Ottobre tee pattern pieces which already have a full bust allowance incorporated via easing extra front length into the back sideseam. But Yes, because I did add extra length (~1.5\") to the crossover pieces to compensate for the extra length a full bust needs for coverage."},

Uh, nope!On me, the tweaking still to be done becomes more apparent.First, the camisole panel. Because I knew I did not want elastic running armpit to armpit, I purposely did not insert any into the top edge yet, intending to judge how much and where after it was on me. It will be very easy to thread some narrow elastic into the coverstitched top hem and stitch it into place behind the wrap panels so that it will never be seen by the world (except you, of course, when I show it later!). Once that is done, it will snug up against my chest and sit high enough for modesty's sake.Next, I still need to hem the sleeves and bottom.Lastly, the ties are still making me crazy. They do NOT want to stay right-side out. Rose, you had a FABULOUS idea, and I'm going to try it out, tenkyewvellymuch. In case you missed it in yesterday's comments, Rose said that she ended up folding the ties in half and sewing them shut. I'm going to try that by basting first so I can see where to start the fold. The ties are definitely wide enough — and my high hip fluff starts rounding out early enough — for this to work out well, I think.As you can see by the rear view, the ties want to make themselves narrower anyway as they try to squeeze into what space there is back there.Overall, though, I like it and I think it's actually flattering, which is something I was wondering about since most of the reviews on PR are shown on thinner ladies.See! I told you these ties are crazy! ;-)P.S. Angie, don't wait. Put this top into your SWAP! I think you'll look great in it! But, no pressure, right? ;-)"},
{"title": "Twistie-Turnie", "date": "Wednesday, February 6, 2008", "text": "I think the actual sewing and fitting are going OK, but those ties are going to drive me NUTS! I'm already thinking of just cutting them off and inserting the ends into the sideseams. They are heavy, long, and they do not stay all the way right-side out when tied around Zillie's or my waist. This pattern really should be made with a 2-sided knit. Since the sideseams aren't yet sewn and the cami isn't in place, I'll withhold final judgment. But I'll be basting the sideseams to give myself an easy out if I do end up cutting off the ties. And let me say right now how glad I am to have downturn fellers for my coverstitch machine. Otherwise, I'd still be sewing the narrow hems on those ties.Unrelated … my denim order from Fabric.com arrived yesterday. It's not the same fabric/color as the Best Jeans Ever. In the photo below, the top denim is the 10 oz Indigo  but it has a lot of white and reads much lighter than I expected. The middle is the 12 oz Navy. The bottom is what I cut off The Jeans prior to hemming.I'm still deciding whether or not I'm going to keep these. I've never returned anything to Fabric.com but since I have another order of what I think is The Actual Denim arriving soon and denim takes up a lot of shelf space, I may just do that with this. On the other hand, one of these cuts would probably work pretty well for DS. They're good denims and will be tons better after prewashing, but do I really need them?

{"title": "Jumping on the Bandwagon", "date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2008", "text": "… but bringing my own drummer. Or something like that.Pattern 116 from the 01/2008 issue of Burda WOF is turning into a popular top over at Pattern Review. And since I do love crossovers, I figured what the heck, I'll join in too. But this time I decided to pull out the TNT Ottobre patterns *before* making the leap of faith.Here's the Burda line drawing:And the Ottobre 02/2007 line drawing:Quite similar, no? Yes.The main differences between the two are (1) Burda has a built-in camisole panel and Ottobre uses a full tank front panel; and (2) Burda's crossover morphs into wide wraparound ties while the Ottobre top extends the binding into the wraparound ties. This looked like a very easy morph to me.Below is the crossover pattern piece. My Ottobre tracing is in black; the Burda tracing is in red. (Click the photos for larger versions.) These were surprisingly close. I say \"surprisingly\" because I'm still remembering how wonky that shirred top armhole from the Plus issue is/was. I used the WOF pattern as the base and then morphed my shoulder angle, armhole curve, and sideseam width from the Ottobre pattern. I also added 1.5\" to the length because I think the girls are going to need it. I gradually decreased the added length as I moved across the pattern piece, so that the tie sections remain the same width as the original pattern.Next was the cami section. I made another tracing of the Ottobre plain front tee and then laid that over the Burda cami pattern, aligning the armholes and center fronts. You can see the original lines of the Burda pattern in red. I'll cut off the upper bodice section of the Ottobre pattern to make this piece mimic the Burda pattern.This is the bottom of the cami piece. I'm keeping the length per the Ottobre pattern (black).For the back and sleeves, I'm going to use the straight Ottobre pattern pieces. No morphing necessary. Especially since I see those high Burda sleevecaps for a knit again. Ick.I'm going to go back up to the sewing and change over the threads on the machines and then I'm hoping to cut this out after dinner."},

At this point, I'm realizing it probably never will be. One of the things I really like is the narrow road behind our property where I walk the dogs. It's a lazy road, about a mile long, with lots of open spaces. We rarely have to watch out for cars. It's quiet back there but there's always something to watch (or sniff, in the case of the poochies) and I come back from the walks peaceful and happy.Yesterday, I finally remembered to bring my camera. I've been wanting to get pics of the various critters we see along the way. Below is a sampling of down just one half of the road.First up, cows. They love eating the Spanish Moss which hangs from the trees. When they're close to the road, I'll often pull some down and feed it to them. It takes a little coaxing to get them over to me, but they usually can't resist the sight of that fresh moss.The goats. These guys take no coaxing whatsoever to come close. Before I got here, they were all just casually grazing but as soon as they saw me, they came running. Sorry goats. No veggies for you today. On the days I do bring carrots and celery, Chili and Dani eat just as many as do the goats and give me dirty looks if they think the goats are getting a bigger share.This guy is the chief billy. He's very greedy and often head-butts subordinates outta the way.You'll have to squint for this one. At the right, near the telephone pole is a horse and a rooster. It was about 2 PM but the rooster was just crowing away.These guys bark and run around non-stop every time we walk by. You'd think they'd remember they know us by now. They are actually very friendly and are just trying to get my pups to join in their fun. They are all rescues and are living a pretty good country life now. Lucky dogs.Another yard, another dog. This is Pepper's dog-walk boyfriend. She just adores Java (his name) and starts whining and whimpering when we get near his yard. Java likes her too and always comes over to say hello.

And with as many times as Tommy Boy was hammered, it was almost aerobic exercise.Ahem. OK, back to today's post.I knew that once the pre-game stuff started I would be mostly planted in front of the tube. That meant I had to get the eats out of the way early in the day so the boys wouldn't be interrupting me watching Ryan Seacrest (Ryan Seacrest??) on the red carpet (red carpet??). Actually, it's Terry, Howie & Jimmy that I watch every Sunday during football season. I like the pregame shows almost as much as the games.

{"title": "Shirred Success", "date": "Saturday, February 2, 2008", "text": "Here's the final top on me. Yes, I'm still wearing my new jeans. I'm never taking them off. I wore them half of Thursday and all day yesterday and they didn't stretch/bag out a bit. See. Best Jeans Ever. (Thank you all so much for the nice comments!)Anyway, the shirred Burda top is done. You can read the full review here, but the short of it is I ended up taking the entire thing apart, cutting a whole new front, modifying the back, and cutting new sleeves. I thought when I first pulled this fabric out of the stash that it would be OK if I had to sacrifice it to a wadder. But the more I looked at it and tried on the ill-fitting version, the more I decided that I wanted to keep it if possible.During the week I worked in spurts with unstitching and evaluating the fit issues. Because I did it in small increments of time, it didn't feel tedious or annoying. Which is good, because now I have a top that I'll wear a lot.I released each end of the shirring to see how that affected the armhole curve. It really didn't affect it at all. The problem was the shape of the pattern, not the shirring. So I used my TNT Ottobre tee front armhole shape/width to modify the Burda pattern. That fix, new sleeves and a modified back which fixed the too-far forward shoulder seam and batwings problems was what I needed.I'll keep this pattern and make it again. Well, actually, I'm only keeping the front pattern piece. I've marked on it in big red lettering to use the Ottobre back and sleeve pieces with it.Oh, and don't be surprised if you see shirring show up again something else I make, because I really liked doing it and how it turns out. (Hi Angie!)Parting Shots:I've mentioned that Dani has been enjoying nibbling on my comforters, right? Well, a few weeks ago I noticed that it was Too Quiet downstairs. Like when you have young human children and you just know that something bad is happening. I went upstairs to find Dani and Chili in the center of my bed, surrounded by clouds of fluff. DH had forgotten the rule of last person up immediately makes the bed or else. Well, \"or else\" happened and that comforter was now beyond repair. It's one thing to patch the edges. Another thing entirely when the center has been shredded and defluffed. Ahem. Bad (giggle, giggle) Dogs! Bad (snicker, snicker) Dogs! You should have seen their you-know-what eating grins when I found them.So I took the main comforter off the bed and dragged it into the sewing room to evaluate what I could do until we replaced it. While I was doing that, the dogs decided that the bottom comforter was now fair game too. Grrrr! The bottom-layer comforter is now waiting in my sewing room since I have plans to cut it up, serge the edges and make doggy nap pads. Except, well, they beat me to it. The napping part anyway.A new bottom comforter and a top quilt were purchased and put on the bed. Here are the \"Bad Dogs\" on the new bed stuff with DS. And I know, it's only a matter of time."},

The pattern turned out to be a clone of my TNT so, really, the best part is the fabric and is what makes these my Best Jeans Ever. Dark navy denim with just a hint of stretch. I'm SO hoping that the denim I ordered yesterday from Fabric.com is more of this wonderful stuff because I can't remember exactly where I got this piece from and now it's all gone. Sniff.Today I'll be finishing up my re-make of the shirred tee from the latest Burda Plus. And waiting for the cooktop repairman. Maybe I'll be able to use my pots and pans again tonight."},

I'm mentioning this because part of the reason these are the Best Jeans Ever is the darkness, weight and only slight stretch of the denim. Look at the Dark Navy (#BF-738) and Dark Indigo (#BF-735). I ordered Dark Navy and Indigo Blue (#BF-721) because I want to see piece-to-piece the difference between 10 oz. and 12 oz.

{"title": "Just Say No!", "date": "Tuesday, January 29, 2008", "text": "My body is not really made for nor flattered by true jeans. But yet I live in jeans. Unfortunate paradox, eh?Well, not really, because I can make \"jeans\" that are a cross between true jeans and slacks. I can incorporate the extra leg room where I need it and how it looks best on me but I can still keep the snug (tummy-holding-in) jeans abdomen area and overall general styling.But I really need to be thumped over the head because I keep finding myself attracted to real jeans patterns only to be reminded that they don't actually do much for me.So, here's the pattern again (from the E799 issue of Burda Plus). Remove the mid-leg seam and it's a pretty basic bootleg jeans style, with shaped sideseams that skim the legs. That's the place where I need to remind myself to keep turning the pages. Those lovely shaped sideseams. Except, um, well, if I wear them I look like a stuffed sausage.Here's my muslin from the front. Not completely horrific, although my thighs are filling out every square millimeter of those shaped sideseams. But with these same basic thighs since puberty, I'm used to that. ;-)But the back? Hahahahaha! No.Still not quite enough a of a reminder, I suppose, because I took off muslin #1 and dutifully made the Minott alterations and a couple of tucks/spreads for leg and crotch length. I also straightened that lovely sideseam shaping to hang straight and camouflage instead of squeeze and unflatteringly accentuate. And guess what?I ended up with a pattern that was nearly identical, yes IDENTICAL!, to my TNT Simplicity 4068 pattern. I literally cracked myself up when I got out that TNT pattern and laid it over the altered Burda for comparison.Since I had already wasted spent the time making the alterations, I decided to go ahead and just cut my fabric using this pattern. Here they are so far, sans waistband, back pockets, and hemming. The legs and crotch are only basted but after this fitting check, I'll rip that out and go finish them.Until the new body fairy comes along, I'll just have to keep my jeans basically the same and only make changes to the pockets and hem width. And stop reinventing the wheel! Speaking of pockets, here's one of the single-welt pockets I made for these jeans, borrowed from another WOF pattern I made a few years ago."},
{"title": "Thanks Marjie!", "date": "Monday, January 28, 2008", "text": "Marjie left a comment on my blog when she tried the Sweet Potato Bread. Of course I had to go check out her blog, and when I did, I found some great recipes to try. Today was her Pane Toscana, (Tuscan Bread).Marjie's Recipe:Starter:1-3/4 cups water2-1/2 tsp. yeast1/2 cup whole wheat flour1 cup white flourPut these ingredients in your machine and set it for the dough cycle. Let it mix for 10 minutes, then turn it off and leave the starter sitting in the closed bread machine for one hour.After one hour, add:2-1/2 cups white flour1 tsp sugar1 tsp saltRestart the bread machine to mix these with the starter. After about 15 minutes, when the dough is completely mixed, remove from the machine and form into 2 round, country style loaves. Let them rise for an hour or more, until doubled in size, then bake 35 to 40 minutes at 375.And my changes:Instead of forming into two loaves, I used my deep dish baking stone from Pampered Chef for one big, round loaf. I also lightly punched the dough down after the first rise and let it rise again for about 45 minutes. After baking for about 10 minutes, I brushed egg white over the top of the loaf and sprinkled on flax, toasted sesame, black caraway, midget sunflower, poppy, & anise seeds which is a mix purchased from King Arthur Flour and then let the loaf finish baking. It's out of stock—I almost typed OOP!— right now, but don't they look delicious! The bread turned out nice, with a wonderful crusty-crust. The seeds add a nice country flavor (I sampled it!). I can't wait for the rest of dinner to be ready.* * * * *I'm plugging away on the Burda jeans and I'll update about those later."},
{"title": "It Might Work", "date": "Friday, January 25, 2008", "text": "Anyone that knows me, knows that I am like a starving dog with a bone … I just don't easily let go. So, of course I ripped out the arms of the latest Burda tee to get to work on trying to salvage it. I hadn't yet hemmed the bottom so if I end up taking in the sideseams all the way down, at least I won't have to rip that too.I tried it on sleeveless and noticed two things right away. First, the shoulder seams are set just a smidge too forward for me. And, second, the shirring is what is causing the weird curvature at the front armhole. I didn't think the pattern looked particularly curvy at the armhole and this confirms that thought. But it is still right on the verge of being too narrow-shouldered and I don't have any seam allowance left after serging the sleeves on to fudge that.What to do? Well, there's not a whole lot to do about the shoulder seam on this one. Not unless I want to remove the binding and since I don't want to fight with it yet again, I'm probably not going to. I'm saying probably because I reserve the right to change my mind after I see how the other fixes I have in mind work out.For the armhole problem, I'm thinking that ending the shirring where I have the pins circled in the photo above should give me the extra width I need across the high bust. It will be a pain to unstitch the zigzags from this fabric, but I'll just suck it up.I also need to take it in at the sideseams from the underarm down to below the waist. I have about an inch pinned out in the left side of the above pic. Definitely a big difference for batwing reduction.On the other hand, I have enough fabric to cut an entirely new front. Hmmmm.I'm going to let this sit today, though, and start on the jeans. I need jeans more than another tee. Especially with the temps dropping this week. It will down to a frigid 66F. ;-)Oh, by the way, I wore my latest brown Burda pants yesterday and I'm not disliking them so much anymore. They are extremely comfortable, both in fabric and fit. Although every once in a while the seams down my backside feel like my undies have slid up when they haven't. Nothing majorly irritating, just a new feeling. LOL! They'll definitely be staying in my wardrobe."},
{"title": "Meh", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2008", "text": "I finished the Burda WOF Plus shirred top this morning. It's now my muslin. Yeah. Sigh. It's still wearable and fits better than most RTW tees but it doesn't fit nearly as well as I'm used to which means it won't ever be a favorite. I've had the fabric for a long time so I'm not upset about that, and chose it specificially because it could be expendable.I should've listened to myself and morphed my TNT Ottobre 02/2007 tee into this one because there are some definite fit problems. It may not be immediately apparent in this pic, but look at the close-ups below.The front of the armholes are wonky on me. Too inwardly curved and right on the line of being too narrow, and I didn't even narrow the shoulders as I usually have to do. I traced a straight 46 at the shoulder, neck, and underam (with a square shoulder adjustment) and morphed out to the 50 at the bottom of the underarm and down to the hem. I measured the resulting armhole and traced a \"51\" for the sleeve. This is very similar to how I morphed between sizes with the Ottobre tee. Except that one turned out perfect and this one, not so much. Part of the problem, for me, is that the cap for this sleeve is much too high for a tee. A lower cap fits my square shoulders better. You can see the cap sorta poking up in the first pic above.There's also much too much fabric under my arms. Batwings anyone? Clearly morphing out to the 50 at underarm level was not necessary.To fix this pattern, I would need to start with a \"47\" at the shoulder, reshape the sleevecap and front armhole and then not morph to the 50 until waist level. It wouldn't be hard to do, but I think it would still be easier to just spread the Ottobre tee neckline to incorporate the Burda shirring.To improve (I can't fix it completely) the sewn shirt means I'll have to frogstitch the sleeves. I don't know yet if I'm willing to do it so this might become a Goodwill donation.On the bright side … The shirring went rather well. I did one practice run and decided that was quite enough to be ready to go for real.This is the neckline of the pattern. The black ink is the marking for the shirring placement. The blue marks are the measured intervals. There are 5 rows of shirring but you'll see 6 blue dots below. That's because I decided that the instructed placement was just too high to be able to bind on my CS machine, so I marked one more row down and skipped the top mark.I folded the pattern piece so my marks were on an edge and then walked it around the neckline using the dots to mark my fabric about every inch or so.Here's the neckline marked. Those two lines in the upper left corner are just the fabric folded back on itself after I laid it on the table for this pic.I used my 7-hole cording foot and threaded the elastic thread through the middle hole. This foot held the elastic perfectly in place as I zigzagged over it. I just moved from dot to dot, eyeballing the placement. It came out pretty even this way. Love those specialty presser feet!Here are the 5 finished rows of shirring from the wrong side (and before pulling them into the gathers):And from the right side:This is where the instructions lost me. I think I figured out that they wanted me to straight stitch a strip of narrow satin ribbon over each end of the rows to anchor and stabilize the shirring stitches and elastic So, that's what I did. With pink ribbon because it was handy. I imagine this will fray like crazy in the laundry. We'll see.Here's the finished neckline. The shirring gets lost in the print in this photo but it does actually show up in real life one me.This fabric was a BEAR to run through the binder and you can see that it most decidedly did not turn out perfectly. The fabric is polyester Lurex. Those metallic stripes run throughout the fabric and they acted like Velcro on top of each other … the binding strip wanted to catch on the bodice edge and stay put. Oh well. It looks a lot worse in this close-up than it does when worn so if this top stays in my wardrobe, I won't fret the binding too much.Overall, I like the style. I just am not thrilled with the fit of the pattern yet. And my cooktop? Still not fixed! The guy came (5 minutes before the appointment window ended) and without even looking at it, said that he needed to order two boards. They should be here by next Tuesday, at which time he'll also return. Looks like the crockpot will be getting a workout until then. At least I'm not paying for the repair. Extended warranties for major appliances are the *only* extended warranties I ever buy. And they've always been worth it. ;-)"},
{"title": "Again With Jeans, and Maybe a Top", "date": "Wednesday, January 23, 2008", "text": "LOVE that Burda Plus is now archived on the Burdamode.com website! Thanks again Mia and Rose.The queue has changed. It always does. I'm still thinking about that jacket I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, but what I really need is a pair of plain ol' blue jeans. I have one pair of regular-length blue jeans which are starting to show some fading. It's time to replace them with jeans that aren't brown.I thought about just sewing the same TNT pattern again (Simp 4068, which is not only OOP but now it seems to have been completely removed from the Simp website too so I'm guessing it's sold out) but where's the challenge in that? OK, so I may have to eat those words but I do like trying out \"new\" patterns. I put quotes around \"new\" because the pattern I've chosen is actually from the Winter 2004 Burda Plus issue.In the magazine they are shown made in suede. Um, no. Although they are beautiful in the photo, suede jeans are not exactly my lifestyle. Picture me walking through the woods with the dogs and picking up poop in suede jeans. See what I mean? Maybe in my next life I'll be more glamorous. So boring ol' blue denim it is.I'll be leaving out the mid-leg seam since I'm not trying to fit the pattern pieces onto hides and because it's not the most flattering look to be visually chopping my chunky legs in half. I will be morphing the contoured waistband from Simp 4068 onto this pattern if I decide these are a go, since it fits me much better than a straight one. (I won't be making the jacket, but it's part of the line drawing I grabbed from the Burda site and I was too lazy to edit it out.)Also on the table to be traced is this tee from the latest issue of Burda Plus. I'm going to compare it to my TNT Ottobre tees to see if it will be more efficient to trace the Burda version or morph the Ottobre. I'm guessing the latter, but you never know. Whatever is quicker, you can be assured that's what I'll be doing. I know I'll have to do some practice runs of that shirring though which may cancel out the \"quick\" part of the equation.While I waiting for the cooktop repairman to show up I did manage to do a bit more painting on the french doors this morning. Gah. All those panes are a PAIN! Then I got a call that he had called in sick and wasn't coming. They tried to reschedule me for Monday. Monday?? I think not. The cooktop lost all power this past Monday night and there's no way I can go a week without it. DH brought out his propane camping burner but I laughed and then turned him down. It hasn't gotten that bad yet. Anyway, I called Customer Service and they did whatever they do, called me back and assured me that someone will be here tomorrow. I decided to give up continuing with painting and head to the sewing room. I didn't have to twist my arm. ;-) We'll be having steaks on the grill, baked potatoes and nuked veggies for dinner tonight. I don't think the guys will even notice the stove isn't fixed."},
{"title": "Monday, Monday", "date": "Monday, January 21, 2008", "text": "The mending is still sitting on my cutting table because I didn't do much in the sewing room this weekend except pass through. I did manage to sew the button back onto to DS' coat last night before bed because I remembered it was going to be cold this morning and he would need it. Other than that, my weekend was spent doing odd jobs around the house.I knocked out a lot of painting and I can now say my dining room is officially finished. It was mostly finished, but there was one area of painting to do. If you look at the photo below, you can see the still-brown inner edge of that half of the double doors. (There's 2 sets of these double doors but the others were done months ago when we painted the dining room.) These edges and the sides of the doors facing the wall were still at wood or primer stage. I also painted the inside and outer trim of that doorframe and happily installed new knobs last night after it was all dry. All those \"little\" things that kept getting put off because I hate painting doors. Whose idea was it to paint all of the doors in house white anyway? (Yeah, mine.)The closet doors and doorframe in the foyer were also still at primer stage and I'm glad to say they are now done too and a new knob installed so we don't have to keep fumbling to open the darn door. I also touched up the door in the laundry room that the dogs scratch on to go outside, the door to my sewing room that took a hit when DH was trying to squeeze my new cutting table through it, and various other spots throughout the house that were sporting nicks.But these doors …… still don't look much different. Sigh. But I did start them last night and so far have painted about half of them today. It's such a tedious task. Each row of 3 windows takes me almost half an hour. You do the math, and keep in mind there's one whole panel you can't really see in the pic. ;-) Holding the paint bowl as I go makes my arm ache after a while too so it ends up being paint, paint, break. Paint, paint, break. And it's really going to need two coats on top of the primer you see here. But at least the second coat will go faster since I don't have to be quite as detailed with it. I'm looking forward to a day hopefully this week when I can get out the razor blade, scrape the paint off the window panes and finally call it done! We've been living with the primer on the frames and panes for 2 years. Ahem. We'll still need to paint the outside of the doors but I've already decided we'll tape and otherwise block off the house portion and then get out the power spray painter and have at it. But it might be another 2 years before I am motivated to do that."},

Trim that needed a second coat, some touch-ups, some trim that hadn't been touched yet. I may even get to the french doors in the family room that I've been avoiding for almost 2 years! And there's a few items in the mending pile in the sewing room that will need attention before I start another project. This afternoon is football playoffs so I'm pretty sure I won't be sewing today, but I can probably paint those doors while the games are on. But it's a long weekend so there's still tomorrow for sewing.In the meantime, I thought I'd answer some comments before they stack up too much. And I'll plead again that if you are posting as \"Anonymous,\" please sign a name just so I know who you are in order to distinguish your notes from others.From Kris O:I love your bags. My mom loves VB bags. What are your favorite sources for the pre-quilted fabric? Thank you! I don't really have \"favorite\" sources since I don't make too many of these anymore. This particular fabric came from Fabric.com. They have a prequilted section on the website and with a little bit of looking through the other quilting cottons, you can find unquilted coordinates for the prequilted selections.From Mia & Rose:Yes, BurdaPlus does have archives. They are in the German pages, under \"Archiv Sonderhefte\" (extra/special issues archive). Thank you, thank you!! I will be using this a LOT!From Arielle: I'm just discovering your post (was away on vacation) and I wonder if you could tell me the brands and sizes of your rulers? Especially the French Curve one.The French curve is the Styling Design Ruler and I bought it from Nancy's Notions. I just recently bought another since I've really put some wear and tear on my original. I also have a Dritz clear, flexible plastic ruler (from Joann's), and the others are mainly clear quilting Olfa quilting rulers.From Anonymous: Is it possible to reduce the leg width by taking it out at the seams which run down the center back of each leg?Yes. And in a perfect world, that's what I'd do. But since I had already cut the fabric and sewn/topstitched the center seams, I opted for the less painful sideseams.From Marji:Is this pair of pants the candidate to go with your most recent top?Well, while they do match in color, I don't think they match in style. So, no. Still no pants (or hem) for the recent top.From Izzie: So, you achieved this fit with just the cut and slide at the knee and the tuck at the knee? No FED? Correct, no FED. I haven't been using the FED for a while. Before this latest round with Minott, I was using wedges (slash/overlap or spread), like this.From Designdreamer: Now I'm not sure if they're full in the \"inner part\", (but my guess is yes,) but I KNOW they're full in the FRONT. Is there a different alteration for this? There is. And it should be found in most good pants fitting books. But, truthfully, I don't know all the methods off the top of my head since I don't use them so I don't have any specific advice.From Anonymous: Do you plan on doing a review of the Minott books you bought? I have been looking to buy some good reference books but looking at some of the reviews on PR, It kind of puts me off.... I wondered if the books she is selling are just copies of earlier books or are different than earlier publications.No, I don't plan to review any of the Minott books because I haven't really read them cover to cover. Well, without my eyes glazing over because the information is very disjointed and badly organized. Mostly, they are drafting books, although one is a convoluted (to me) method for altering commercial patterns. I think most of the information in these books can be found in better form in other sources. But there are the \"wrinkle charts\" which are good references for alterations and a few of the problems/solutions are not easily found elsewhere. So, I keep them around for that. But, really, that's only about 20 pages out of hundreds so unless you're shaped like me or want to draft patterns from scratch using her methods, then it's probably not a worthwhile purchase. And, yes, I think the books available on that website are indeed (legal) photocopies of previous publications.From Anonymous: I will also definitely get rid of both my Palmer Pletsch books. They do nothing for me. I purchased them because people raved. Maybe they raved because of the colourful illustrations, I don't know but I have never found them helpful or informative.Hmmm. I'm sorry but I have to disagree here. I love the P/P books! Slash/spread is the method I use the most and these books cover all of that in great detail. They also have a lot of valuable fitting information, especially diagnosing the wrinkles. I don't think there is a more comprehensive or easy-to-understand fitting series, especially as a jumping-off point. While I may not now agree with every single solution, I do with the majority of them.But different strokes and all that, and if you still want to get rid of them, I'm sure you'll have no trouble reselling the books.And my favorite comment about my latest pants:From Meg:I think EVERYBODY feels that way about their bodies in January!How true!! Thank you for the reality check! And yes, Meg, feel free to use \"elastification\". LOL!"},
{"title": "Pants Done, Ho Hum", "date": "Thursday, January 17, 2008", "text": "Here they are. They're done. But I'm not completely enthused about them. The fit is good but the cut is, well, not my most flattering pair of pants. I thought the seaming would show up more, but it doesn't … not even in real life. Maybe in denim with contrast thread it would be better, but I don't think I like them enough to try again. Especially not when there's still 1,472,968 pants patterns yet to try. ;-) But they are comfortable so I'll wear them. I just won't love them.Truthfully, I think what I'm feeling most ho-hum about is the body inside the pants. I'm never going to be rail thin, but during football season and the holidays I added enough additional fluff that I'm ready to do something drastic … you know, like eating healthier!  And increased walking.  Even a 10-lb. loss would do wonders for how my clothes hang on me and how I feel in them.But enough of my whining. Here's a photo of the pocket and topstitching. Even artificially lightening the pic doesn't help make the stitching stand out.And here's a view of the waistband elastification (new word!) and the inside. The instructions are sorta sparse for the waistband but I'm pretty sure they didn't instruct to turn under the inside edge of the waistband, which is just fine with me since I usually don't anyway. As per usual with straight WOF waistbands, there's no actual pattern piece and I didn't pay close enough attention so I ended up cutting it without a seam allowance. And not enough fabric left to cut it again. Oops. But I had cut the rest of the pieces with a 5/8\" seam allowance so I just used 1/4\" to sew the waistband to the top of the pants, making it off only by about 3/8\". Not really noticeable when being worn.I'm glad I tried out the Minott alteration. I think it's going to be a winner for me."},
{"title": "So Far, So Good", "date": "Tuesday, January 15, 2008", "text": "A quick update while I'm waiting for DH to get home from work. Although after seeing these pics, we really shouldn't be going OUT to dinner. Sheesh ... those Christmas cookies tell no lies and it's time for another 2008 resolution.This is the muslin from the current pants. The leg on the left side of the pic has the tuck in it between crotch and knee. It's an even tuck, around the whole leg. Big difference, no? BTW, the seaming over the derriere is supposed to be curved as you see. It looks weird to me in muslin, especially with the dark undies, but much nicer in the final fabric. And the seam does provide a nice fit over the tush.Next are the real pants, with the Minott alterations incorporated into the pattern. I haven't yet attached the waistband so an elastic \"belt\" is holding them up. The vertical seams are still basted. Hopefully the pic is clear enough that you can see there are no X wrinkles. There are vertical wrinkles because they're still too long and I'm standing on the bottoms. The fabric is a milk chocolate brown woven RPL (rayon, polyester, Lycra) with both horizontal and vertical stretch. I will definitely be stabilizing the crotch and waist seams.I was also experimenting with the leg width and the sideseam on your right has been taken in an additional .75\" (total 1.5\"). It would look better if I wasn't standing on the hem area ;-)  but I think I prefer the narrower leg.Here's a front view, although I forgot to turn off the flash. My hand is at the top of the pocket opening. (And I swear I recently cleaned this mirror.)"},
{"title": "Full Inner Thigh Alterations", "date": "Tuesday, January 15, 2008", "text": "Let's see … where was I? Oh yes. I had just finished tucking up a good amount of length between crotch and knee on the Burda WOF pants muslin.I've now made that alteration to my pattern pieces and have cut the good fabric. As I mentioned on Sunday, I knew that my extended calves were playing a part in this fitting conundrum. As I was slicing and dicing my pattern pieces, this was confirmed. What that crotch-to-knee tuck actually did was to bring up a wider section of the pants leg to calf level. So, it's not really the length that was the culprit; it was a matter of putting the required width at the proper level. Well, in theory at the moment, because I'm still sewing the pants.Sunday night, I went to bed with some of my fitting books to re-read any info on alterations for full inner thighs and/or knock knees (FiT/KK). (Both body types display the same rear X wrinkles.) In my pile were:Fitting Finesse (Zieman)Fantastic Fit for Every Body (Grigg Hazen)Fast Fit (Betzina)Sewing Pants That Fit (Singer Reference Library)The Perfect Fit (Singer Reference Library)Pants and Skirts Fit for Your Shape (Minott)Fitting Finesse had nothing. Zero. There is some basic info for full thighs, but nothing specific for full *inner* thighs or KK (or bowed legs, which is the direct fitting opposite of KK).Fantastic Fit for Every Body was another miss. It usually is. I really don't know why I hang on to this book. I've never once used anything from it and some of the advice is just plain wrong, IMO. But I digress.Fast Fit does address the FiT/KK issue:(Click on all the photos for bigger, clear versions.)With the Fast Fit method for KK, I would still have to add width between crotch and knee because my issue is actually FiT, not KK. FiTs still need more width than what you get with this alteration alone. There is another section in this book which illustrates how to achieve that extra width by adding to the inseams, with the length of the addition dependent on how full the thighs are. After that, I would still have to re-establish a vertical grainline, because as you should be able to see, the alteration below angles the original grain outward.I know the Fast Fit method works, as it's the basis for my previous X-wrinkles alteration, here. But I'm fickle, and curious, so I wanted to try something different. ;-)An Anonymous commenter mentioned that I should buy the Singer books instead of the \"expensive\" Minott books because the Minott info is also in the Singer books. Well, first, I already have both Singer and Minott so acquisition/price isn't an issue. But, the main point of my response to this comment is that while the FiT/KK Singer alteration starts like Minott, the end result is different.Both methods start out by slashing the pattern at the knee and sliding the knee-to-ankle section toward the inseam, as in this section from Minott:In Sewing Pants That Fit, you are never instructed how to true the seamlines after the slash/slide (oops). In The Perfect Fit, this is the illustration and instructional text for truing the seamlines to finish the adjustment:It's an at-first-glance subtle difference between Singer and Minott, but upon further inspection the difference is really quite significant. With the Minott method, the entire leg is shifted toward the center of the body, with the overall width of the pant leg remaining virtually unchanged. This is what I want, pants that have the same cut as the original pattern but which have been adjusted to follow the shape/slant of my leg.The Singer method starts out OK, but the way you are instructed to true up the outseam gaps left after sliding the lower section toward the middle gives you pants that are still centered on the \"perfect\" leg exactly as before but now they're also wider.Minott trues the outseam from the bottom up. Singer trues from the top down. It makes a difference.So now I'm going to go back to the sewing room and work on finishing those pants to see if my thinking works in practice as well as theory."},
{"title": "Sunday Pants Trials, Part 2", "date": "Sunday, January 13, 2008", "text": "As mentioned earlier, I've been fooling around with that WOF pants pattern. I finished the X adjustment as per Minott, which is to cut the pattern at the knee and slide it over toward the inseam (front and back). That part was easy and went fairly quickly. I marked the knee line on my pattern by first marking the crotch line and then folding the pattern from hem line to crotch line, using the resulting middle fold as the knee line. Standard stuff, right?Then I cut out my pattern in muslin and methodically marked all the vertical and horizontal lines (grain, crotch, knee) and sewed it together. My X wrinkles were better, but still not completely gone. I stared in the mirror while pulling, pushing, … you know the drill. ;-) And then I noticed that the line I marked for my knee was a good 3+ inches below my actual knee. While still wearing the muslin I sorta tucked it up at the knee and it looked like it improved things at that back X area. So, I took off the muslin pants and machine basted a 4\" tuck between crotch and knee so that the knee line actually hit ON my knee.I then tried the pants on again and I swear that back leg/crotch is now nearly perfect.Could it really be that simple? Could the lower part of those X wrinkles have been fooling me all along, making me think they were something else instead of simply too much length in that area of the pattern?I never thought I had short legs, and I don't as far as RTW pants. But I suppose mine *are* shorter than the 8-foot model legs the patterns are drafted for. And maybe they're shorter between crotch and knee than \"normal.\" I know I do have extended calves, which has got to play a part in this. But maybe I just have short legs overall and am in denial. I have no idea.So, hmmm. I'm going to think on this for a while. And maybe make another muslin while playoff game #2 is on to test this again.Sheesh. The more you learn about this stuff, the more you realize you don't know.First, thank you everyone for weighing in on the length of the last top. So far in the comments, longer is winning with \"medium\" coming in second. I'm going to let it sit for a while before I decide what to do. And, as Belinda pointed out, I really need to decide what pants and shoes I want to wear with it. It's not as casual a top as I usually wear, so that will have some bearing on the rest of the outfit.(Oh and to address your comments Carolyn ... thank you for your opinion. I like hearing different takes, different ideas. But … (you knew there was a but!) … I'm not going to add any more dark brown because I want the focus to remain UP, near my face. If I add brown at the sleeves or bottom, it will just draw more attention to my hips.)In the meantime, I'm going totally off track from the ideas that have been floating around. Which isn't unusual for me. I should learn to never say what I'm planning to sew next because it usually doesn't happen that way.I've traced these pants from the January 2008 issue of Burda WOF.I'm really loving the close-up detail photos Burda is now including on the website. This new feature is so helpful since you usually can't see those details in the modelled magazine photos. I love the pockets and extra seaming on these. The front and back seaming, by the way, incorporates waist darts so I shouldn't end up with a bunch of extra fabric at the waist, which is good for my basically hourglass shape.I'm about halfway through initial alterations before I cut a muslin. I'm doing this at the commercial breaks during the NFL playoff games today so it will be slow going. Instead of doing my previous \"X-wrinkle\" alteration shown here, I'm trying an alteration shown in one of Jan Minott's books (I have 3 of them and the exact title is upstairs in the sewing room so I'll update that info later). It's an easy alteration to try so I thought I'd give it a go just to see the results. I'll also have to add to the back crotch length so I'll do this at the top of this pattern. It's a partial-elasticized, pull-on pant and adding on to the top is the easiest and most efficient way for this pattern."},
{"title": "Hemming and Hawing", "date": "Saturday, January 12, 2008", "text": "It's done. Well, almost. I'll get to that later.I added the topstitching on the pleat seams. It gets a little lost in the print but I think it's better than no stitching at all because it does show, even if it tends to blend in. I also used the 1\" binder for my coverstitch machine to create a thicker neckline band/binding. And, of course, it's brown. Were you really expecting anything else? ;-)The sleeve ruffles are Much. Too. Full. I think I'm going to have to do something about that if I want to wear this top and actually be able to do anything in it without dragging my sleeves through the soup. I like the way they look. But when my arms are in them, they feel too floppy (the sleeves, not my arms). I'm thinking of running elastic through the hem so they stay in place. One of the views of the original McCall's pattern shows something like this.Here's a semi-profile view to show that by enlongating the pleat stitching, the open pleats don't poof out until below the girls. When worn, it has the look of an empire waistline.Now here is where I'm stalled. Final length. What should it be? Long? Short? In between? To my eye, the longer length looks better. But I'm just not used to the tunic length so it feels like I'm wearing a dress. So maybe a little long, longer than the pic on the right, but shorter than the pic on the left? Opinions??Beth asked what I was planning to wear with this. The answer is, I don't know. Most likely long pants similar in silhouette to what I'm wearing in the pic. But these pants are actually purple so it won't be them with this top when I leave the house. (And my hair is soaking wet from the shower so I felt compelled to chop off my head.)"},
{"title": "Morphing to McCall's 5469", "date": "Friday, January 11, 2008", "text": "No, it hasn't taken me all week to morph my Ottobre Woman tee pattern, but it has taken me from Monday until last night to again become productive in the sewing room. I have all these ideas and projects running around in my head and it's just been overwhelming. I keep talking myself in and then out of starting. Analysis paralysis. I finally decided yesterday that I would go ahead and let the other projects bubble around some more and just do this morph since it would be easy and fast and should bring the sewing mojo back.Since this is a very easy morph, I'm glad again that I caught myself before ordering the pattern. I never would've sewn the actual pattern and would've only been paying for a picture I've already printed off.I started with the plain front Ottobre Woman tee from the 02/2007 issue, pattern no. 2 with the 3/4 sleeves.Then I decided how much I needed to add to the front for the 4 pleats. I settled on 1.5\" pleats (.75\" deep), spaced 1\" apart. That meant adding an additional 3\" to the Center Front of the pattern (2 x 1.5\"). In the pic below, the yellow line is the original CF, the green line is the new CF, or cut-on-fold line, and the red shows the placement of the pleats.I traced the Ottobre tee as-is and then added the 3\" to the CF. I widened the neckline .5\" at the shoulder for an inch total and also lengthened the top and back about 5\" at the hem area, figuring I can always cut off what I don't want later.Last was the sleeve. I'm trying out View B, which to me looks like a regular elbow-length sleeve with a long ruffle sewn on the bottom. I cut a straight section that is 8\" wide and 2.5 times the width of the bottom of the sleeve. I used my original tracing of the 3/4 Ottobre sleeve and then just folded it up to where I thought it should be. Nothing scientific here (and no sleeve pics yet).Here's what the front looks like so far:I'm using a poly knit from Fabric Mart for two reasons. One, it's very drapey and, two, I have enough to make another top if this ones turns out to be a wadder. I didn't really want to start with a true (unwearable) muslin because this top is so simple to draft and sew that it's either going to work on me or it's not. Fitting shouldn't be an issue. But if I hated it, I didn't want to waste muslin time or lose a nice fabric. Since I had plenty of this, it won't bother me to toss some if I do end up hating it on me.I sewed my pleats further down the front than the McCall's version because my bust is bigger than the model's. I figured the pleats shouldn't be poofing out right at apex level. I'm thinking of topstitching the pleat stitching with my coverstitch machine so they are more defined. I'll definitely be using the CS machine to bind the neckline.So far, I'm liking what I see. It's full but because the fabric is drapey it looks tunic-y to me and not maternity. Do you agree?"},
{"title": "Free To Move On", "date": "Monday, January 7, 2008", "text": "ETA: I forgot to mention the pattern (thanks Donna!). It's my ol' stand-by for Alex — Burda 2713. I've made it a few times for him. Last time he was smaller and I thought I'd go down a size, but time and teenage hormones kicked in and the same exact size as before is a perfect fit now. Well, almost. I also added elastic to the waistband to snug it in a bit at his back waist right above the full booty, using this technique. When worn, you can't see that there's any elastic. It's just enough to ripple the waistband when off the body but it stretches to flat when worn. You can see the rippling in the last pic below.We now return you to your regularly scheduled blog entry …Darn black fabric ... you can't see anything! You'll just have to take my word for it that these jeans are fabulous!! ;-)Seriously, I'm just glad they're done. The sewing part was fine but the topstitching thread gave me fits. I let DS pick from the thread stash and he happened to see some multi-colored pearl crown rayon. I agreed, without realizing what I was getting myself into. But it's done and it looks great against the black denim so the pain is fading.I didn't topstitch as much as I would've with more cooperative and less bright thread. The back pockets are only colorfully-stitched across the upper edge. The waistband is topstitched with regular black thread because by that time I was at my wit's end and no one is going to see it anyway. The beltloops are done with the colorful thread and that's enough eye interest at the waist. I also topstitched in the usual fly and yoke places, and down the outseams.I added a No Fear tag from old RTW to one of the back pockets. I also split the legs in the front and the back (in two different places) and topstitched the joining seams for more interest. And, I added a front patch pocket for the cellphone/ipod.I used a red zipper and B/W striped cotton for the fly shield and pocket bags. You can see a bit of \"faux piping\" at the edge of the pockets where I let the pocket lining peek out at the edge as DS' urging. DS loves all the colors together. Me, I think I'd go cross-eyed staring at all of this too long. But then again, I'm not 15 anymore. If he's happy, I'm happy. He really does like to have a hand in \"designing\" what I make for him."},

And if it's something that's not going well or that I've lost interest in, it stalls my whole sewing mojo. That's kind of where I am with the jeans. I want to finish them but I just wish they were finished already so I could move on to ME! ;-)While looking through the McCall's website to take advantage of their weekend sale, this pattern caught my attention:I almost ordered it but then decided I could morph my Ottobre tee into it, so that's been percolating around in the gray matter too. When I'm finished with the jeans, I'll probably start on this first since it will have more of an instant gratification factor. The jacket will take more fitting and fabric contemplation. The top may not get further than a muslin, though, since it does have a tent-y thing going on which is not usually a good look on me. I'm hoping that the stitched-down pleats will help.In the meantime, back to today's playoff games and those jeans."},

It looks pretty, though, doesn't it with its orange-y color. The main problem with this loaf is likely baker-error (mine!). I added too much sweet potato and didn't cut the water to compensate, which probably caused the bread to fall a bit during baking and resulted in a too-moist, heavy loaf. I'm going to try this one again since I still have one more sweet potato to use. Next time I'll measure the potato and apple more carefully and leave off those 2 extra tablespoons of water.  I'll also add vital wheat gluten (1-2 tsp per 3 cups of flour)  which helps bread to rise better. I usually add VWG when making the recipes in this book but I was in a hurry to get to the dogpark (or, more correctly, the dogs were in a hurry and underfoot) and so I was distracted and forgot.The recipe is from The Best Low-Fat, No-Sugar Bread Machine Cookbook Ever (Madge Rosenberg).

I couldn't get motivated on starting a project for me and well, I've been wanting to try this Simplicity pattern for my guys. Too bad the pants are ridiculously baggy since they had some promising design features that you never find in the meager offerings for men's patterns.I don't think I've ever made a muslin for anything I've sewn for the men in the family. But something told me to do so for these pants. Maybe it was the 27+\" hem circumference?? Sheesh. Yep, the legs are as wide as that hem measurement indicates. And much too wide to be taken seriously by my teenage son. I'm so glad I didn't just plunge right in with the good fabric.There's also something going on with the back besides just too much leg width. Yes, Alex has definitely inherited his mother's ample derriere, but these pants make it look more like a woman's rear end than anything else I've ever seen him wearing. That just ain't right, and no, I'm not going to tell him I said this. Nevermind that I said it for the entire world to read.

Hey, at least it's still 2007.I made a few of these purses about 5 years ago, when I first started sewing. Vera Bradley bags were really \"it\" then, and a local sewing machine dealership offered classes for making Vera-clones, based on Simplicity 7098 (OOP).The class pretty much followed the pattern but the instructor showed how to add pockets inside and outside since the Simplicity pattern does not include any. I was hoping I had taken some notes. But I didn't. So I had to really dig into the memory banks to try to remember what I did. Luckily, I took pics of two of my earlier bags so I could refer to those. Also luckily, nice pre-quilted fabrics are more readily available now and I didn't have to quilt the main fabric myself like I did years ago. That takes forEVER. (Mom picked out this fabric so I know she'll like it.)I changed some of the construction for this bag to reduce bulk at the seams, and I fully enclosed the top zipper. It's hard to explain without being able to show you what I did before and what I did now so you'll just have to take my word for it that my construction knowledge improved enough since I last made one of these so that I could \"engineer\" it much better. ;-)Here's the inside. Lots of pockets, which I did always really like about this bag. I also added a small zippered pocket to this bag, which is hard to see since the fabric is mostly black. It's the pocket that's closest to the \"front\" in the pic. That's something I remember wishing I had when I was using one of these bags myself.When I was making this, I completely forgot that I needed to match the stripes at the top. Oops. I ripped out one of the panels and re-did it again to match stripes. Those notes I didn't take would've helped me avoid that goof.This is the first one I made, in that class. (See, those stripes are lined up so I should've known better today!)And this was the second. It looks saggy because it was fully loaded!Both are long gone now. I never did take a pic of the original purse I made for my mom. I did take a pic of another similarly-styled tote I made for her in 2002 (different custom pattern from the same instructor). Amazingly it's still in service, as mom is using it on her current trip to Florida. And, it still looks pretty darn good. ;-)Mom will be back over this way in a couple of days and then she can collect her belated gift. Meanwhile, I can think about sewing for ME again. ;-)"},

Since the guys see nearly every movie and multiple times when it's on DVD or cable, they answered most questions quite easily. I think this is why DS picked that game, knowing it is one of the few chances they do have to beat me at some sort of trivia. ;-)Yesterday morning, we all took the dogs to the dogpark and enjoyed the sunshine and warm breeze for a few hours. The dogs ran and ran and ran (well, not Pepper) and collapsed in sleepy near-comas for the rest of the afternoon and evening (this Pepper did participate in).We started playing Dominos around the kitchen table in the late afternoon.

It's today's lunch and I'm eating it now so I'm not baking on an empty stomach.Becky, I don't really have a recipe but I'll try to reconstruct what I did. For soups and stews, I tend to inventory what I have on hand and go from there.I started with a little olive oil and chopped garlic in the bottom of a large pot over medium heat. I sautéed 1-1/2 onions (the other 1/2 is in the bread), carrots and celery left over from finger food during last week's football games and cut up soup size (about 2 big handfuls of each). Those continued to sautée while I was cubing 3 boneless chicken breasts, which I added to the mix and continued to cook until the chicken was fully-cooked.I added some dried dill (about 2 T), salt (1 tsp) and pepper (1/2 tsp) and 3 peeled, cubed white potatoes (peeled). I let all of that simmer a bit and then I added 6 cups of chicken broth and another 6-8 cups of water (my pot is a big pot!). I looked in the fridge to see what else I could empty and toss into the soup. I found about 3/4 cup of corn (I had used the rest for quesadillas on Wednesday) and 2 green onions so I tossed them in too. I also found some leftover cooked elbow macaroni, which I put on reserve to add at the end.I started the soup after I had the bread dough going in the machine and then let it simmer until the bread was finished baking.Before serving, I poured about 3/4 cup of cream and 1 T of cornstarch into the blender, whipped them together so the mixture wouldn't be lumpy, and then stirred the mixture into the simmering soup. After that, I added the macaroni and turned off the burner. The macaroni was already cooked and the hot soup heated it up almost instantly.So, that's it.For a recap of ingredients:3 cubed boneless chicken breasts1-2 yellow onions, sliceda few green onions, sliced (optional)diced carrots, about 3/4 cupdiced celery, about 3/4 cupolive oil (about 1 T)3/4 cup corn (frozen or canned)3 medium white potatoes, peeled and cubed1 cup pasta, precooked and drainedchicken broth/bouillon (enough to equal 4-6 cups)garlic, chopped (1-2 tsp)1 T dill (or more, to taste)1 tsp salt1/2 tsp pepper3/4 cup heavy cream (or milk)1 T cornstarchwater (4-6 cups)The amount of liquids depends on your pot size and how much soup you want.The soup is even better today. But now I'm done with my early lunch and it's time to mess up the kitchen again. I didn't really gain any space in the fridge since I have a big container of leftover soup in lieu of smaller containers, but we'll be eating it today and tonight and by tomorrow it should be gone. Still, this week I'm particularly glad I have the second fridge out on the back porch. ;-)"},

Soup and foccacia for dinner it would be.Although I didn't realize it this morning when planning, my foccacia would be the \"poor woman's\" version since I later found out I was very low on Rosemary and completely sans sea salt. (Already added to tomorrow's shopping list.) I subbed some thyme and tarragon and a pinch of chipotle.When the bread came out of the oven, DS#1, who works at The Cheesecake Factory, couldn't get the plate of olive oil & ground pepper prepared fast enough — trying to impress us with his presentation knowledge. ;-)Anyway, my point (yes, I do have one) is that this bread is absolutely delicious! And incredibly easy to make with a bread machine (Belinda, are you listening?). I made it this afternoon in the middle of holiday baking. Just a few minutes to toss the ingredients into the machine pan, and then later a few more minutes to turn the dough out into the pan. The machine, yeast, and oven do all of the hard work. I am definitely making this again next week when my mom, sister, and spouses are here.The creamed chicken soup was very good too, but I forgot to take a photo of that while we had some in bowls. A shot looking down in the pot wouldn't do it any justice."},
{"title": "Groovy Scrub", "date": "Monday, December 17, 2007", "text": "One more gift is done on the to-make list. This is another scrub top for my sister using Kwik Sew 3201. In the past, I've had questions about how I do the neckline so I took some pics while making this one.In this pic, the two neckband strips (the polka-dot fabric) are sewn together at the bottom of the vee, which you can see in the second pic below. The vee of the neckline has been staystitched and clipped per the pattern instructions, and the seam allowances for the entire neckline are pressed under. The neckband strips are laying under the neckline, stuck in place with Collins Wonder Tape. (Remember to click the photos to enlarge them.)This is the wrong side of the pic above. You can see the stitching at the intersection of the neckbands. No stitching to attach the neckbands to the neckline has been done yet.To attach the neckbands, I serge the raw edges of each neckband strip and corresponding neckline seam allowance, one at a time, moving the body of the top out of the way so that only the straight edge of the neckbands and neckline pass through the serger.After the two passes through the serger, I turn the top to the right side and press the seam allowances toward the body of the top. I then topstitch the neckline, catching the overlocked/pressed seam allowances as I do so. I also stitch a diamond at the bottom of the neckbands to hold the cross-over together.Not much to it, eh? But I find it a lot easier this way than to align dot marks at the points, pin, etc., etc.Tomorrow, more baking, working on my brother-in-law's shirt, and boxing up some things for a Post Office pick-up."},

{"title": "Answering Some Comments", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2007", "text": "Thank you EVERYONE for all the nice comments you leave for me. It's really nice to read them and I appreciate it very much.Some answers to some recent questions:Nancy K: \"What pattern are you using for your jeans? They look great.\"Thanks! I'm using Simplicity 4068, OOP (link to my review on PR). The pattern has back waist darts, not a yoke. I added a yoke for my last make.Gaylen: (On the shirts for my FIL and DS) Can we get more info on the fabrics - where purchased, etc.Believe it or not (I still can't), the fabric comes from Joann's. It's a cotton/poly blend jersey with some body. Perfect for loungewear. It was a recent purchase (I bought white too, and that's what I used for yesterday's Ottobre tee) so it should still be available.Kat: DH has just requested a Dolphins shirt in the same style. Do you use Embird for the embroidered letters? Actually, I used my HV \"VIP Quick Font.\" It's an older program now, but I don't do nearly enough embroidery to warrant upgrading it. I have Embird for editing and have thought about the Font Engine because I hear it does a pretty good job. But the program I do have does OK too, so I just keep using it.Laceflower: Please share how you made the iron on logo for your DH.Julie: How did you make the iron-on logo?First, I already had the font from a project for a local client or else I probably would've spent hours looking for it. But that's not really what you're asking, I think. The iron-on is easy-peasy. You just need transfer paper for dark fabrics. It has a white base, instead of clear like you usually find at places like Office Depot, etc. Then you print on it with an inkjet just like regular printer paper, peel off the backing, arrange it on the tee/whatever, cover it with the parchment paper/vellum that's included in the pack, and press with a dry iron for 20-30 seconds. I buy mine from PrintOnIt.com It lasts pretty well, although after a lot (think teen sons) of laundering, it does begin to crack a little. Not bad though, and it doesn't flake off and the colors don't fade. You just end up with a \"distressed\" iron-on, which is still very fashionable. ;-)Jodi: What pattern is your jacket? I looked at your earlier entries, but I couldn't find it. I really like it.Thank you! It's #128 from the 04/2006 issue of Burda WOF. My review is here. If you click on \"Jackets\" in the Labels in my sidebar (scroll down, down), it should bring up all the entries related to making it. I don't make many jackets so those entries shouldn't be hard to single out.Teddylyn: My youngest DS is a Redskins fan too and would love it if I could figure out how to digitize the logo like you did! Send me an email to djc at cedesign dot com and I'll send it to you. It's for BIG hoops. Let me know what format you need.Carolyn: And exactly how many Ottobre tees do you have now?Counting the PJs I just made, I think I'm up to 10.bishopfamily: May I ask what Ottobre you use?All of my recent tees are from the 02/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman. It's still available on the Ottobre website here (click on English) and I think The Woolly Thread sells them too.kasizzle: Wish I could get away with doing laundry only once a week! Me too! I meant one load per week of *my* colored laundry which I separate from any of the boys' things out of self-preservation. ;-) BTW, I looked at your profile and if I'm not mistaken, you are in Valrico too? Is that right?And now for some really old questions which I forgot to answer earlier:Could I ask you whether you do a 'standard' FBA on your tops or do you have to start afresh with each and every one? I'll quickly tissue fit a new pattern and make an FBA based on that, so yes, pretty much a new one for every pattern. I also use TNT patterns for comparison and will sometimes do the FBA based on that.shorty: Oh one more thing about those chevrons, can you elaborate more on which direction they should go?I think chevrons on a plus-size figure should be oriented so that the vee points down. That way, the illusion of the widest part of the chevron is not opening up and making waist & hips look larger. Instead, it's opening up at your face and creating the expected hourglass female figure. But that's just my 2 cents. ;-)* * * * *Chili has poked me in the leg with his nose at least 50 times while I was writing this (it's so darn cute, too). It's time for their walk and they know it, so that's what I'm off to do. And yep, Dani seems to be good as new. It's been one week since she was spayed and her incision is healing nicely so I'm going to let them run and run today. Maybe she'll exhaust her energy chasing Chili instead of on my patterns. ;-)"},

Time to do laundry again.I'm happy to report that the Ottobre patterns are alive and well. ;-)The reason I had them out to begin with was for a marathon PJ sewing session on Sunday. Needing to piece together and re-trace slowed me down a bit though and I didn't get all the PJs done on Sunday. I finished everything except waistbands for the pants by Monday night and this morning I completed those. I now have a selection of new pajamas to choose from at bedtime tonight (and tomorrow, and the day after!).First up, a rayon/Lycra turquoise and green jersey print top with turquoise interlock pants and matching turquoise binding on the neckline. While I was re-tracing patterns Sunday morning, I also traced the 3/4 sleeves.To wear with this top, green interlock pants:Here's a close-up of the sleeve vent (coverstitched, of course!) for the 3/4 sleeve.Pink/white rib pants, white jersey with matching print sleeves and neck binding. I have PJ pants from this same print but they have seen better days. Now I can toss them. And I still have enough left for one more pair in the future. Why did I buy so much of this?? It must've been really cheap. (And yes, it is, but just fine for PJs.)Blue rib print with coordinating periwinkle rib top, neckline and sleeve hems bound with the print.And a 3/4 sleeve top from the same print:Close-up of the neckline binding and sleeve vent:All tops are the gathered front tee from Ottobre Woman 02/2007. I added an extra inch in length to the tops since I like longer tops for sleeping. All pants are Kwik Sew 2779. KS 2779 is a no-sideseam pattern for knits. It takes very little fabric and with only one pattern piece it sews up in a flash.I goofed when cutting some of the tops because I wasn't paying attention to my notes on my tracing. The short story is some of the necklines are wider than intended. But no problem on PJs since I won't be wearing a bra with them anyway. In other words, no worries about straps peeking out. I caught my mistake about halfway through cutting so some are as intended and a couple are not.All fabrics are from stash so it was nice to put a dent into it. I still have quite a few fabrics earmarked for PJs that are taking up room so maybe after the holidays, I'll do another PJ marathon. You'd think this would be enough, but much of my current \"wardrobe\" of PJs is looking rather worn and I like to have a new pair for every night without needing to do laundry more than once a week.Up next is more Christmas sewing. I think I'll do the scrub for my sister before starting in on mom's purse."},
{"title": "The Dog Ate My … Patterns!", "date": "Sunday, December 9, 2007", "text": "And not just any patterns. My absolutely positively most favorite patterns. Yes, my Ottobre tee shirt patterns!!!When I walked into my sewing room last night to turn off the lights, etc. before going to bed, I found shreds of Swedish Tracing Paper at the doorway. My first thought was that Dani had done her usual deed of pulling stuff out of the trash basket. But before I could even finish that thought, I remembered that I had emptied the trash earlier and there was nothing in it for her to pull out. And then I panicked.My heart sank when I recognized that the shreds were my Ottobre tee patterns because it wasn't going to be as easy as simply re-tracing them since I had blended between sizes. I gathered up all the pieces and laid them on my cutting table. As I started smoothing them flat, I saw that, with some work, they could be salvaged enough for me to retrace. I also saw that only the 3 torso pieces were damaged and that all of the sleeve pieces were untouched. I went to bed.This morning I got out the Ottobre pattern sheet, laid the main torso pieces on it and tried out the various shreds as you would with a jigsaw puzzle. My favorite of these patterns (the gathered front tee) was the worst damaged. Almost the whole shoulder area — a spot I always modify on any pattern — was missing and there was a good-sized chunk out of the neckline. I felt lucky that I had marked my blending between sizes very well, which made it so much easier to re-map what I had done.I pressed the little shreds flat and with some trial and error got them back to the most important areas. Then I taped them in place, slid some more STP underneath where there were still holes and retraced those areas.This is what the pattern pieces look like at the moment, with the leftover shreds sitting in the middle:I'll retrace those onto some fresh STP and I'll be back to good as new. It was totally my fault for leaving the pattern pieces rolled up on the easily Dani-accessible botton shelf of my cutting table in anticipation of cutting today. Lesson learned.At least it wasn't my TNT pants pattern."},

I remembered that the Bucs embroidery design I used before is quite dense and I didn't want to distort the shirt and then wish I hadn't.The pants for my FIL are done too. The lighting was really bad so details aren't showing very clearly and colors are off. I'm hoping to get DH to agree to a modeling session before I ship these off.I added gray flat piping down the outseams:And I changed the pattern to a full elastic waist with drawstring elastic. The fly has a real overlap but no zipper and so is for show only. It is sewn shut at the CF seam under the flap.The shirts are Kwik Sew 2561 and the pants are Kwik Sew 2776. I've made this shirt pattern a number of times. It's definitely a keeper. This is my first make of the pants pattern, which is now a keeper too. It's really a pattern for wovens but I wanted to make knit lounge pants with front pockets and sideseams (vs. the no sideseam lounge pants I've previously made my FIL and DH) and the style of these fit the bill. I didn't make any modifications for using a knit except as noted above for the waistband and fly. If they're extra roomy, my FIL will like that just fine. I also added an extra inch of length to the legs and arms for my tall FIL and left off all but the front pockets on the pants.I'll write up a \"proper\" review when I've got better pics."},

It's just that I'm feeling selfish and want to keep sewing for me. OTOH, I don't want to be scrambling at the last second so I suppose I'll turn my attention to those gifts. Well, at least *some* of my attention. I still want to whip up some more Ottobre tees for me.For my FIL, a lounge outfit in a Washington Redskins (a pro football team for non-U.S.'ers) theme. He really appreciates handmade gifts and since he's tall, he also appreciates that I can make him things with extra length where he needs it. I'll start his first since it has to be mailed.For my mom, a by-request purse. I made a few of these Vera Bradley style purses years ago and she keeps hinting at how worn out hers is and how she'd love another one. I hope I can remember exactly what I did to make those. It was based on a Simplicity pattern but it was also a local class and I know we did some things differently. I hope I took some notes. I also hope my guess as to fabric requirements was close and that I'll have enough.For my sister, a new scrub top or two. These are always on her list, no matter what the occasion. Hmmm. Maybe I should make her an Ottobre tee too. My sister and mom will be visiting here (separately, and with their significant others) just after Christmas so I have a little extra time for their pressies since I don't have to mail them. All are patterns that I already own, which is good for the checkbook, and all fabrics have already been purchased.

Yes, hate is not too strong a word. Unfortunately, it's the only game in town and I don't have any online choices either, that I know of (anyone??). There was not even one choice for dark brown buttons. Luckily for me I had pretty much decided before I got there that I was going to go with lighter buttons. But still. How can it be with the hundreds of buttons hanging in the two button aisles that there are no dark brown buttons? Yes, at first glance it looks like Joann's has lots of buttons — and they do — but I can never, ever find buttons that call to me or match what I'm making. It's always a second choice, a struggle. One of these days I'm flying to Melbourne to go button (and fabric) shopping with Belinda. ;-)So, where was I before the mini button rant? Oh yeah. The Onion top is finished and is sporting (boring) buttons from one of the above cards, but I'm waiting until the Ottobre tee is finished too before I take pics. It's almost done so I should have pics this afternoon. I substituted Ottobre sleeves for the Onion sleeves and narrowed the shoulders just a smidge more this time. I like these changes much better. The Ottobre sleeves have a better shape (and flatter cap) for me for a tee. I walked the seamlines of both the sleeve and the armhole and they matched perfectly, so nothing further needed than to just fire up the serger.Speaking of my serger, while at J's I did pick up the new upper knife and installed it. This pic below is my old knife. (Blogger has posted a workaround for photos so you can actually click on mine again to make them larger w/o getting that download dialog.) Look at those nicks. I think we were overdue, don't you? After putting in the new knife, I immediately folded up a scrap of denim into four layers and tried it out. Like buttah! I think I actually heard the serger smile. ;-)I just finished applying the binding around the neckline of my Ottobre tee. What a pain in the you-know-what. I love the fabric, but it's slippery with a mind of its own. Not the best combo for running through a CS binder attachment. So I forced it into submission by fusing interfacing to the back of the strip. Much better. Went through the binder this time with no sassing back at me.All that's left for this tee is to put in the sleeves, sew the sideseams and hem.

Yep, after 5+ years, I finally managed to run over a pin and it wasn't pretty. Overlocking still works fine but cutting through thick layers doesn't. It was fun (not!) finishing up the seams of my brown jeans last week. While I'm there, I'm going to look at buttons for this top. I haven't decided if I want brown, or beige like the background of the print. I'll probably get both and decide while looking at the top on my dressform. And yes.

I did one row of regular straight stitch and then two rows of triple straight stitch on front and back pockets, inspiration for which was stolen right from one of the photos/drawings in a recent Ottobre Woman.The waistband facing is a brown & aqua polka-dot cotton. The fly facing (not shown) doesn't match, but it does coordinate. I used scraps from this skirt fabric.I'm going to cut another Onion top tonight. It's all ready to go. It's just me and the dogs here tonight so I might even sew too.I should also cut another (or twenty) Ottobre tee like the one I'm wearing in the photo above. I wear this one and my other Ottobre tees ALL THE TIME. I haven't worn the first make of the Onion top very much because the weather turned too warm again. It just hangs in the closet waiting for the temps to drop below 80. Don't feel too jealous if you're in the cold climates — some of the humidity has returned too. Ugh.

The Eagles were so close to serving the Patriots a slice of humble pie that I was glued more to the game than my sewing. But during commercials ;-) I took a few pics.First up, how I add twill tape to stabilize stretch denim. I know I've mentioned doing this before but I don't recall showing photos.In this pic, I've already sewn the waistband to the top of the jeans and to the right of the needle is the seam allowance for that. The twill tape is laid just inside the stitching line on the seam allowance, waistband side up. I move my needle a few blips to the right and sew the twill tape 1:1 to the seam allowance, with that stitching line being very close to the original waistband stitching.The seam allowances are pressed up and the waistband facing covers them, with the twill tape encased inside. This simple little step keeps the waistband exactly as I've fitted and sewn it and prevents my jeans sliding down by mid-afternoon. (Do this at the end of the day when the tummy is fullest or you may wish you did!)Next, a comparison shot of my yoke goof. On the right is the corrected and finished yoke. I decided to go ahead and correct/redraft it this morning. On the left is the much-too-long first try yoke. I wish I had thought to measure the yoke of a pair of RTW jeans before just eyeballing the first one, since I do have one or two pairs in my closet. I would've saved time and a replacement fabric purchase. Live and learn. But the yoke is the perfect size now so all's well that ends well.If you click on that pic to enlarge it, you can see that I also changed the grainline for the yoke, so that the striping would chevron. I caught this uh-oh too late on the first yoke but let it slide because I knew it wouldn't really show. I'm glad I didn't bother with it since all of those pieces ended up being trashed anyway.The final photo shows the knit I have out for after I finish the jeans. It's either going to be another Onion top with shorter sleeves or another Ottobre gathered front tee. If I decide on the Onion top, I'll need to buy some buttons. (The sticker on it reads \"Prewashed,\" which should be self-explanatory. I use these because I don't overlock knits to prewash them.)Now off to bed since it's back to the real world tomorrow."},

The turkey is almost gone now. The turkey leftovers soup above is for dinner tonight with this bread, which used up the leftover mashed potatoes. I threw in some onion flakes and dill too and it is yummy stuff with a wonderful crust (see all those crumbs!). The rest of  Thursday's leftovers are nearly gone too. Three big males in the house plus three dogs means a 23 lb. turkey and side dishes don't last as long as I thought they might. I should know better.I haven't left the house since Wednesday night. The thought of hoards of people shopping yesterday didn't interest me in the least. I'd rather pay full price than to deal with that mess.The Godfather I/II remix is on the tube right now and I always glue myself to the TV when it is. I don't know why, since we have the DVDs. It's just one of those things. But I think I'll move up to the sewing room and turn it on there and maybe make some progress on something. My replacement brown denim arrived Wednesday and it's been prewashed so what I really need to do is rip out the wadder back legs from the jeans I started a few weeks ago. We'll see. That tryptophan is some powerful stuff. ;-)Hopefully the next time I post I'll have something other than another food photo."},
{"title": "Happy Thanksgiving!", "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2007", "text": "I started the day's kitchen duties making this apple pie, crust from scratch too (which I don't usually do since the refrigerator crusts at the store are pretty good, but I forgot those. Oops.). The lattice isn't the neatest and the apple filling ran over, but it tasted quite yummy — which goes to show you that looks aren't everything. ;-)After the pie, the turkey went into the oven. Every time I make a turkey, I am so grateful for the double ovens here at the Money Pit. I can put the big bird into the bottom oven, forget about it until it's done and still have a full oven's worth of space above. I may not yet have a real floor in the kitchen, but I love it all the same.Once the turkey was underway, I continued with 18 dozen of 3 different kinds of cookies. Those are for DH to take when he goes back on the road, and for the teenage eating machines during the coming week. I figured I was already trashing the kitchen, so why not. I think 2 dozen have already been vacuumed up. I had to hide the rest for a couple of days.After the cookies, it was potato peeling time. White potatoes for garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes for a casserole with pecans, brown sugar, butter, condensed milk, and cinnamon. I don't make a traditional pumpkin pie because this casserole takes its place and we like it better. The pecans, butter and brown sugar are mixed together (with a bit of flour) and folded into the whipped potatoes to bake up crunchy and streusel-like.Then it was time to put together the perverbial green bean and french fried onion casserole (DS#1's favorite) and sautee onions and celery and apples for the stuffing.Everything came together on time and we stuffed ourselves like most other Americans today. The feast leftovers are now packed away and taking up every spare inch in the fridge. I won't have to cook again for days.I hope your day was as peaceful and full of family & love as ours."},
{"title": "Frayed Pieces", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2007", "text": "This is what happens when (1) you leave pillows unattended, (2) the DH isn't keeping an eye on the dog hooked up to the outside line, and (3) you rearrange the furniture so that the sofa backs right up to your desk.The white snips on the table are the plastic insides of pillow welting. Yes, Dani snagged another one. By the time she outgrows this, the pillows will be round instead of square as I keep sewing the corners inward. She has a thing (whatever it is) for plastic. She chewed the (plastic) zippers. I sewed the pillows permanently shut. Then she must've smelled the plastic cording inside the welts around the pillows. I sewed those nibble holes shut. But she keeps finding the rest of the cording and nibbling. I keep fixing them. There's no way I'm about to buy or make new pillows until she's over this. Any visitors to the family room will just have to deal with the lopsided pillows for a while. ;-)The black pieces are one of our leashes and the harness we bought for Dani for hooking her up to the zip line DH put in last week. DH was outside this morning relocating two bushes from right in front of the dining room window to either side of our front door so the (spoiled rotten) dogs can see out the window better. He had the pooches out with him but wasn't really watching the whole time. Dani is a fast chewer. The leash was only in two pieces so easy enough to zigzag back together, almost as good as new. The harness, however, needs webbing replacement. I'll head to Joann's tonight or tomorrow and buy a couple of yards. But as I type, I'm thinking I should get enough to do this twice, going on Dani's track record.The nose is Chili's. He now delights in getting onto the back of the sofa and walking straight onto my desk/table. It's behind me as I type on the computer so when I hear papers rustling, I know he's peeking over my shoulder. Silly dog. We really do not allow our dogs to walk on the furniture (save for the family room sofas and my bed). But how can you yell at that face?I'll be busy over the next couple of days …getting ready for Turkey Day and all and maybe sewing myself a new tee … and I'm not sure if I'll remember to post on the actual day. So, if I don't, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone who celebrates. Happy November 22nd to those who don't."},
{"title": "Metza Metz", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2007", "text": "That's my childhood Italian slang for so-so (which you say while rotating your hand back and forth), and my general opinion of the \"blouse\" pattern from Connie Crawford's Butterick 5053.CC stresses that her patterns are designed, sized and graded so that you should pick your blouse/top size by your full bust measurement. My full bust is 47-48\" (depending on the hour/day/week!) so I chose the 1X, which is one size larger than the pants pattern I made up yesterday. I made it up with no alterations whatsoever. Clearly, this bust circumference isn't working for me. My chest is being smushed and there are all kinds of unsewn dart folds radiating around the girls.To more clearly illustrate that point, here's what happens when I lift my arms and don't immediately pull the top back down. It gets stuck on the \"terrain.\" Nice, eh?A good thing about this pattern, though, is that it does not have the linebacker shoulders you see when commercial patterns are graded up to larger sizes. My shoulders are on the narrow side. I always chop off at least 1/2\" from other patterns (even after reducing for the linebacker factor). This one is fitting pretty well in the shoulders. And, as I guessed a few days ago when preflighting the pattern against one of my TNTs, it is definitely drafted for more square shoulders, as I have. I don't think I'd need to make any further \"squaring\" adjustment. I would still need to take in the shoulder width but that's my body, not the pattern in this case. If you do not have narrow shoulders, it should fit you here great.Here's a shot of the side. The sleeve is a little too snug, and waaaay too long, but that's to cover up my unattractive arms, right? ;-) I've cut the sleeve on the hem line so this is the finished length. All of these problems are easy fixes. It is hanging pretty well on grain, though, so that's good. The armhole is a bit low, but not nearly as low as I see with Big 3/4 patterns. Again, another easy fix.The back has problems too. It's too long between shoulder and waist, which is a problem I have on most other patterns as well. It's probably also too long in the front in the same area but it's harder to tell since it's too tight across the girls. It's not as snug as it looks here while I'm trying to take a back angle shot but since I chose a pattern that is one size larger than the pants I just made, I expected to have a bit more room at the hips. Wrong. It's at the verge of too tight. Why wouldn't the sizing be consistent across pieces in the same envelope? Speaking of envelopes and hips, this pattern in the smaller size range includes a side seam vent at the bottom with pattern pieces that jut out at the bottom, if you know what I mean. Not hard to make up myself but why doesn't the plus size pattern include this same detail as the smaller range? For heaven's sake, if anyone needs a vent at the hips, it's us with the bodacious booties.Here I've pinned out a 1/2\" tuck across the back. If I wasn't trying to juggle a camera and mirror, it would look a lot better and the neck wouldn't be gaping.Now that I've covered the fit issues, I'll address the style problems. This is not sold as a tee shirt pattern. It's a \"blouse\" pattern for wovens. As such, it's way too plain and tent-y. It's almost a swing silhouette, which just billows out from a full bust. It would have even more of a tent factor if I went up another size, instead of doing an FBA, so it actually fit around my bust. The narrow scoop neck is frumpy and, frankly, any more narrow and I couldn't get it over my head. A more open neckline would be much more flattering on nearly any woman, plus or not. In a woven, this top needs sewn bust darts. All those wrinkles around the armhole are distracting and do not flatter full busts. The bottom hemline does have a slight curve, which actually is a flattering detail. Finally, one flattering thing. ;-)Here's my TNT tee pattern on top of this blouse pattern. Yes, my pattern is for knits but it does not have negative ease. It's not too far off overall, but I don't need another basic top so I won't be fiddling with it. Because the shoulder area does seem to be a better fit than usual Big 3/4 patterns, if you don't already have a TNT, maybe it would be a good jumping off point for you?And here endeth my experimentation with Connie Crawford patterns."},
{"title": "Butterick 5053 Pants (With a Side of Snark)", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2007", "text": "I reviewed the pants portion of this pattern on Pattern Review here, where you can read the details. The bottom line (no pun intended) is that it isn't a miracle pattern or anything close. It fits no better or worse than other pants patterns I've tried. But other than that, it's a really boring, frumpy style. Inseam pockets on plus-sized hips? Puh-lease! Tapered legs? Hello … 1985 called and they want their pants back.Sorry, I'm being snarky but after a week of reading on that email list about how wonderful Connie Crawford's patterns are for plus-sizes and how all the other patterns are wrong, I was expecting (hoping for?) a little more. I mean I *am* the demographic body type she designs for. Or so she says. And says. And says. This lady certainly knows how to toot her own horn. ;-) Oops. Snarky again.I like the drawings on her patterns and they are tempting. But the drawings are nothing like what you really get. And I just don't think CC knows what looks good on plus-sized women. I think she can make patterns large enough to fit well enough out of the envelope. But they do not flatter. Elbow-length short sleeves add width just where we don't need it. She says she makes her short sleeves longer to cover up the \"unattractive\" arms of larger women. Excuse me??Baggy, undarted tops? Otherwise known as \"How To Add 15 Lbs. in An Afternoon\" and without the benefit of chocolate. A waist tuck on a boxy top is not the same thing as a bust dart, and the armhole will tell the truth. Now I'm just going by the photos on her website and on reviews on PR since I haven't actually tried the top from this pattern yet, but I'm really not holding out much hope. (If, however, I'm wrong about this top—and I will try it in muslin—I'll be the first to admit it.)But really, look at this one. This lady is actually not very large under all that fabric but she's gained 40 lbs. just wearing this top. And this top is from Frumpville too. The chevroning is going in the wrong direction for someone with boobs and hips. The armhole is dropped and droopy, adding folds and width at the bust. And that straight hem makes it look like a maternity top. I'll snark on one more … this is the fashion drawing. This is the actual top. Notice any differences? Where is her waist? Her stance tells me she does have one. Well, at least she's covered up those unattractive arms. ;-) (These are all CC's garment photos on her website.)CC is just not doing plus-sized women any favors. Her styles and her comments are reinforcing the tent effect many plus-sized women seem to gravitate towards in an effort to hide themselves. Instead, she should be designing and promoting more fitted styles which flatter so much better and encouraging her customers to stop hiding in those tents. And she shouldn't be telling us to cover up our arms. Unless we're cold. Hmprf.DH was a busy man this weekend. Not only did he finish my cutting table, he also washed down the windows outside and put up a zip line for Dani.Dani's favorite thing to do outside is chase squirrels. She's actually caught one and then was surprised when it didn't \"play\" anymore. She tears off after them and turns completely deaf when you call her to come back. It would be OK if she stayed in our yard but she doesn't. She always, always heads right for the neighbor's yard and sometimes keeps going from there. Other than building a fence which we may do one day, the only option has been to take her outside on a regular leash. That's fine a lot of the time, but she and Chili love to play tag and wrestle all over and keeping them (and me) untangled and my arm in its socket is tricky.I'd been spying two trees in our front yard which are about 100 feet apart from each other without a lot of anything in between. The dog trolleys I could find locally are only 30 feet long. I found a 100-foot version online last week and ordered it. It got here on Friday, just in time for DH and the weekend. That was great, but there was still a problem. I really wanted a retractable drop line for it so that Dani could have more space side-to-side without dragging a line on the ground that would tangle her and Chili. I can't believe these dog trolley things don't have retractable leads but I couldn't find anything anywhere. So I improvised.We cut the drop line so the hook is about 4 feet off the ground. Then we just loop her regular leash through it. With her harness on so she's attached at the back and not the neck, it's perfect. The leash follows along on the zip line and stretches/retracts as necessary. The harness prevents the lines from swinging around her neck and getting trampled and tangled. We'll never leave her on it unattended, but this rectractable set-up means we don't have to walk over to her every 5 seconds and unwrap a line from her legs. She's not very coordinated so \"every 5 seconds\" isn't an exaggeration. ;-)Here a shot of the two trees and the zip line between them highlighted in yellow:Here are the wrestlers, and you can see the leash hooked onto the drop line:And a little video that was much better quality before YouTube got ahold of it. You can see the handle of the leash swinging by as they move around. The main objective of this game is to trip each other, by nibbling legs and tails. Today Chili is playing the submissive. Other days, he's the aggressor on top. They have tons of fun together and play this game in the house too, incorporating zooming up and down the stairs as part of the play. Sometimes even Pepper joins in. Read: Herd of Wild Elephants* * * * *Sewing related, I've cut and sewn the Connie Crawford pants. I was out of camera memory card space so I had to process the dog photos first. I'll be back later with an update on the pants."},
{"title": "At Last", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2007", "text": "This is the very quick sketch I gave DH to work with:And now I have this:I have achieved sewing room bliss!DH dragged the pieces into my sewing room last night and reassembled it (inside the room this time). The top from my old cutting table is actually just laying on top of this one with my cutting mat on top of that. We had planned to use construction adhesive to attach the old table top to the new base but once the top was in place, it didn't move and so I didn't see any point to gluing it down.I've still got some more reorganizing to do (because of course this has started a domino effect throughout the room), but I've already started loading 'er up. On the upper shelf is the stuff I use for altering and cutting out patterns. Things such as pens, chalks, scissors & rotary cutters, pattern weights, tape dispenser, and a few other odds & ends that now live here too. The bottom shelf holds the on-deck fabrics & projects and things I don't want to put away yet because they're reminding me of something or are inspiration. In the middle of that bottom shelf is also one of the pillows Dani can't leave alone, still waiting for me to sew up the corner. Even though the shelves look full from this angle, there's still a lot of room left. At least for a little while longer.I hammered some high-tech nails ;-) into the side of the table to hold my rulers, squares and curves. A few more that I don't use often are hanging off the back side of the table. Still accessible and near the others but not in the way of the favorites.Having this table and its shelves means that my ironing board surface should now remain free and clear. Right?? I still need to do something about organizing/hanging the pressing tools which are now in a plastic bin under the board and/or on the shelf to its left. I think I want a slatboard or pegboard on the wall. And I keep meaning to make myself a nicer cover for the board. One of these days …Once again, a BIG thank you to Melody for making her table first and inspiring me & DH! It took a little longer than planned because of DH's limited weekend time to work on it but it was well worth the wait. I am SO trying it out tomorrow!"},
{"title": "Curiosity", "date": "Friday, November 9, 2007", "text": "Before I go on, be assured that I *have* learned my lesson about trying new pants patterns and being optimistic. I have my TNTs and I'll stick with them. But that doesn't stop my curiosity and experimentation.Last night, I went to Joann's to pick up a few supplies. While there, of course I made a stop at the pattern books. I was by myself with no time limit so this was a rare luxury, even if I was only mainly \"window shopping.\"On an email list I belong to, Connie Crawford has been the guest host this week and, naturally, talking about her patterns and her drafting methods which she claims are more aligned with modern, mature bodies and RTW sizing. I take all of that with a grain of salt. Plus, I have \"issues\" with CC after meeting her at a sewing Expo a few years ago. But I'm still open to looking and maybe even learning. So, I decided to pick up one of her Butterick patterns, 5053, just to have a look. It's fairly cheap entertainment for me.I compared the pants pattern pieces with my TNT. There are some things that I like about what I saw and others that I think may not work. A muslin will tell the truth.Here's a general overview of her pattern and mine. The back hip is curvier on hers and while the back crotch curve is close, mine is a little snugger … but part of that is because mine is for jeans. What you can't see because of my poor photography skills this morning is the angle of the legs. I think this may be the sticking point since it's where I usually have a problem with other pants patterns. But it's close, so maybe it will be OK or only need a little modification. Yeah, right. ;-)This is a close-up of the back crotch. You can see my stitching line on my white pattern piece, but the rest is very close.This is the top of the back piece. CC's pattern is dramatically higher at the center back than most other patterns you'll see. Keep in mind that mine is already angled up at CB. (CC's pattern has a cut-on waist, which is why it is so much longer than mine.) This tells me it's cut for those who have a generous tushie.This is the front crotch. I see the most difference here. CC must draft for extremely full thighs. And I *have* full thighs and there is a lot more room here than even my pattern. Again, part of this will be due to the difference between a jeans pattern (mine) and a pants/slacks pattern (hers). CC does draft for a tilted waist, good for us plus-sized girls. I think I wouldn't have to take out much, if any, at the front rise.I also compared the undarted blouse (really a tee) pattern in the envelope with one of my TNTs, but I ran out of memory on my camera card so I don't have any photos of that yet. Overall impressions: The armhole will be too low for me, but not nearly as low as other Big 3/4 patterns. The shoulders looked to be narrower than your \"standard\" Big 3/4 larger sized patterns. And they look to be much squarer, which is good for me but may not be good for others w/o my square shoulders. I think this may be because CC claims to draft for fluffier shoulders which would have more flesh at the end whereas mine are really just bone.I do need to make some new PJs so I'm thinking this may be a good way to test CC's patterns. Two birds, one stone, and all that.So, this will take a spot in the sewing queue while I wait for my re-order of brown fabric to finish up my jeans that I'm obviously NOT wearing tonight. Sigh."},
{"title": "Rats", "date": "Thursday, November 8, 2007", "text": "Well, I've now found out that I really should've tested my back yoke in something other than the good fabric. It's too low and it feels like it's cutting the cheeks in half. Not because it's too tight but because it's in an odd spot that is fleshier than where it should be hitting.I just ordered more of the same fabric so I can re-do them. I haven't decided yet whether I'll re-do everything or just cut new backs without a yoke. Which is worse? Ripping out the sideseams which have been serged and topstitched? Or cutting all the pieces over and sewing them again?Time to take the dogs out, clear my brain, and then off for my haircut. And, yes, I checked. My son took the Mustang today so I have my own wheels.ETA: OK, back from the dog walk. I've decided to put the pants on hold until the new fabric arrives. If it matches perfectly, I'll just recut the back legs. The temps have dropped but my internal thermometer is still on summer because I couldn't wait to get my feet out of closed shoes and my flip-flops back on. So, I don't think it'll kill me to wait for the fabric and much cooler temperatures."},
{"title": "Teenagers!", "date": "Wednesday, November 7, 2007", "text": "So, did I do either of the two things on my list today? NO!My 18-year old son left for work about 8 a.m. I took the dogs out for a mid-morning romp around 10 a.m. and noticed my vehicle was gone and his was still here. With a flat tire. After I told him last night that I had a hair appointment at noon. Grrrr! And let's not forget that he actually has TWO vehicles! The first, a Jeep, the one with the flat. The other, a 1965 Mustang, perfectly driveable. By him. Except it was parked in the garage and blocked by the Jeep so he couldn't easily get it out. I don't drive the Mustang because it has manual steering and no A/C and, well, I'm spoiled. And besides, I couldn't get it out of the garage today even if I wanted to.My hair appointment has been rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon and I did at least make some good progress on my brown jeans. I'm to the point of sewing in the zipper. The front pockets are sewn and topstitched, as are the back yoke pieces. Tomorrow, I'll finish up the fly, sew the in/outseams, back pockets, and hopefully get the waistband on and the jeans finished. I'd work on them more tonight but I think I'm feeling a cold coming on so I'm going to go vegetate in my bed under the covers with my new Threads. Maybe I'll get a second wind. But at least with a TNT pattern, the whole process is a lot faster and I don't procrastinate through it which makes me optimistic about wearing these Friday night, even if I do pass out at 9:30 tonight. ;-)There are only two things that really have to get done today. One is a haircut for me at noon. The other is a trip to Walmart for some more fire ant killer. We go through that stuff at an alarming rate. I sprinkle the mounds when I'm out in the yard with the dogs. I'm not sure if the ants are actually dying or just moving to a new \"neighborhood\" in the yard. Probably both. But it makes me feel better to at least be trying to eradicate them. Fire ants are one of the worst things about Florida (and the southern U.S. in general).So, in view of my lighter schedule, I'm going to start on yet another pair of jeans for me from Simplicity 4068, my TNT fly-front pants pattern, which I noticed yesterday is now out of print. I'm going to use the brown denim from FFC that I just bought/received/prewashed, and I'm hoping to have them finished in time for the (last!) football game on Friday night since it's supposed to be cool temps and my usual mom uniform capris will look silly and feel chilly. When I re-traced the pattern last month (was it last month or the month before?), I also made pattern pieces for scoop front pockets instead of the slash front pockets. My preference is for scoop so I'm looking forward to this little change. ETA: Oh! I just remembered that during that re-tracing session, I made a back yoke for this pattern. Yay! (I tellya, the brain is Jello these days!)Also on the \"on deck\" list is some sewing for my sons. I think it's been almost a year since I last sewed anything for either of them. Sheesh. Bad mom. For DS#1, I want to make him Simp 4287, View C (also out of print) and for DS#2, a morph between his TNT Burda pattern and Simp 3891. The morph will just be the tucks at the front knees, as I don't want to do the rest of the cargo styling of the Simplicity design. Belinda gave me some great ideas after my ramblings to her via email about how to accomplish those tucks. I don't yet have the Simplicity pattern, but after seeing Belinda's sketches I want to see how Simplicity drafted the front leg pieces. And then I'll probably just do what she suggested anyway. ;-) I'll wait until the 11th when Simplicity patterns are on sale again."},

I have more than enough other tasks to keep me busy no matter how impatient I feel about the new table.

{"title": "Answering Comments", "date": "Thursday, November 1, 2007", "text": "First, the \"bad\" news is that I won't be showing the costume from yesterday. It left the sewing room after the ruffles were done and DS's girlfriend will be finishing it. It's a baby outfit (big size), for a play she's working on. She's a drama major and it's another student's original play for which she's doing some of the costumes. Nothing for Halloween, even though I did post on Halloween. That was just a coincidence. But really, it wasn't that exciting. Trust me. ;-) A pink Walmart tee with ruffles around the bottom and around the sleeves. It just took a LOT of flat strips to get enough length of ruffled strips to go around it and when she was here one day talking about it, we brainstormed together and ended up doing the ruffles on my machines.Onto the questions …What would I look for from the Ebay gadget guy in generic fellers for my Janome CS? Keep in mind that I've never actually used any of these generic fellers since I bought actual Babylock fellers before finding the Ebay guy, but this looks like the equivalent, even though it's described as a Juki sewing machine attachment. When looking at all the choices from this seller for fellers/folders, the important features to note are whether the folder/feller is downturn (like I showed), upturn (which flips the edge UP), single (one fold under or up) or \"clean finish\" (two folds down). I like the swinging out feature of his generics, which would let me move the attachment out of the way without actually removing it. Also, I don't think his prices for these particular attachments are any great savings over what I paid for mine, which I think was in the neighborhood of about $20 per. They're reasonable, just not a big bargain.Do you have any tips for using a hemmer on a regular sewing machine? You have to start with the leading edge pressed under twice, the same width as the hemmer will fold. You stitch for about an inch with the edge not yet in the hemmer foot. Then you stop with the needle down and work the edge into the hemmer. After that, you've got to hold the fabric feeding into the hemmer at a slight angle (toward your left) and up, and keep even pressure on it as it feeds into the hemmer. It takes practice. And patience. ;-) On your latest Ottobre top, looks perfect for the season....where do you purchase your bindings?Thank you! For the binding, I just cut strips of knits I have on hand. Nothing that is specifically a \"binding.\" Those knits come from all over.When you do the wedge alteration, and the grainline *is* thrown off, then what?You have to redraw it. Fold the bottom hem in half to find the center and then square a line up the leg from the hem.(About my cat) DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT! You heifer! :D I just KNEW he was going to die (LMAO at \"he wasn't going to off himself\" tho!!)Angie, you always crack me up! Gizmo is doing great. No more limp at all. Nothing to show he was ever injured. He's back to his usual routine of hanging around outside, sleeping in the garage, drinking the dogs' water, and eating yummy (not!) cat food.I have a question about your sewing dummy. Have you padded it or how do you make it work for a full bust?Yes, I've padded it. For the bust, I stuffed one of my bras with fiberfill and she wears it under a camisole. I took photos of the process, here, but since then I've removed the lower padding because it looked strange and lumpy under some tops and skirts. I've been meaning to re-do it smoother, but I haven't gotten my round tuit yet. But that's because I've been sewing mostly TNT (tried-n-true) patterns lately. When I need a better fit model, I'll be more motivated to re-pad."},
{"title": "I Heart Gadgets …", "date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2007", "text": "… especially gadgets that work! (Blogger's photo uploading over the last few days, on the other hand, not so much. Grrrr.)This is one of Babylock's single downturn fellers. The 1/4\" version, to be exact. I have all three — 1/4\", 5/8\", and 1\". I bought these from my Babylock dealer before I ever stumbled on \"the Ebay guy\" and his industrial generics. (And those of you with coverstitch machines know what an enabler I've been for him ever since!)Every so often I consider selling these fellers on Ebay or the PR Classifieds because I really don't use them. But I always stop myself and start thinking, \"What if …?\" Yesterday, I was very glad I've held onto them.I was helping DS' girlfriend with some costume sewing (which explains the pink and the pacifier fabric you'll see below). We needed to make ruffles. Miles of ruffles. OK, not miles, but almost 10 yards and the thought of hemming nearly 10 yards of strips made it seem like miles. Usually I take the easy way out when making ruffles and just fold over the strip so it's doubled and no hemming is necessary. But GF had a limited amount of fabric and to get all the ruffles we needed meant we had to cut single layers of strips. And then finish the raw edge. Urgh.Enter 1/4\" downturn feller (with a chorus of Hallelujah in the background). Now I know some of you probably own and have tried various hemmer feet for your sewing machines. And most of you have cursed the day you ever bought it/them. They do work, but they are fiddly and then in the middle of a long hem, you blink, and it goes off track. I feel your pain. ;-) Not so with these fellers. They just plain work and you can blink all you want.The feller is attached to the bed of the coverstitch machine (here, it's just laying on my sewing table, but you get the idea). The fabric is fed into the turning-under-thingie and the feed dogs move the folded edge under the needles where it gets stitched.This is the back side, where you can see the turning under happening. (And if you look closely, you can also see the reflection of the vent on my sewing room ceiling!)This is what the finished ruffle looks like from the top. Yes, there are two rows of stitching at the hem and it's probably not something you'd want on your finest silk blouse, but this is cheap cotton and a costume so I think it looks just fab! And really, it's not like the hem police will ever stop me to issue a citation.And this is the underside. The raw edge is perfectly and evenly covered by the (ahem) coverstitch. 'Tis a thing o' beauty, ain't she?After the long strip was hemmed, I ran it through my serger with its gathering foot (another gadget I love) and voila! Perfectly gathered and hemmed ruffles. Minimal effort. And one happy GF."},
{"title": "Sunday Errands", "date": "Sunday, October 28, 2007", "text": "No sewing today, yet. After I'm done typing here, I'm going to head up to the sewing room to finally hem that last Ottobre tee I recently mostly finished, since there's no football game on tonight and I couldn't care less about the World Series. After the hem, I have to sew up yet another pillow that Dani nibbled. Well, same pillow but second nibbling. Sigh. She thinks the throw pillows are just big square doggie toys. Actually, she thinks just about anything is a doggie toy. ;-)Today was errands and odd jobs day. I left the house early this morning for Costco and the grocery store. After coming home and putting away the haul, it was lunch and then off to the dog park with the whole family. That was nice. There were tons of dogs there today and of course I forgot the camera.We got back from the dog park around 3 PM and the baking urge struck. I made blueberry muffins, banana nut mini muffins, and 2 batches of brownies. Most of these will be packed up for DH to take on the road this week, although you can see Quality Control has already been sampling the goods.Speaking of DH … he's making progress on my sewing table. I don't think it will be done tonight, but maybe. He's out putting the final coat of paint on it right now. The photo below shows one coat of primer. After the paint, he'll put the shelves into the middle areas and then we've got to take the top off the current table and attach it to this one. Casters need to be attached to the legs too. If it gets too late, I'll wait until next weekend so I'm not out a cutting table completely. But those shelves are really calling to me. So close …Keeping DH company in the garage today (and sweeping up the floor with his tail!) was Gizmo. He's doing great and it seems he's forgiven DH for the runover. You'd never know how traumatic his last two weeks were. Our neighbor who found him last week knocked on the door on Saturday to see how Gizmo was doing. She also brought us two mini loaves of pumpkin bread. What a sweet lady! I'm the one who should be bringing *her* the pumpkin bread.My denims from Fashion Fabrics Club arrived yesterday. The brown is not as heavy as I was hoping, but it's still quite nice and will make pretty pants for the upcoming \"winter.\" It has a subtle striping in the weave which I like. You'll probably need to click the pic to make it large enough to see the detail. The blue is a nice dark denim (but the flash is making it look lighter here), so all in all I think I fared well. It's hard buying denims from FFC since their descriptions are not always very enlightening. To say the least. ;-)The last \"errand\" of the day was dinner. Blue cheese burgers requested by DH. These are waiting for the grill. Easy to make and very tasty. Mix the hamburger with ground chipotle pepper, worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, cilantro, black pepper, salt, and a bit of hot sauce. Then form into thin patties. Between pairs of patties, layer crumbled blue cheese and then squoosh the patties together. Yummm! I'm still stuffed and we ate almost 2 hours ago.All in all a relaxing family weekend. I hope yours was good too!"},

{"title": "Ottobre for October", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2007", "text": "These Ottobre tees are so fast and easy to sew up that it almost feels like cheating. This one is done except for the bottom hem, which I'll do later tonight. The fabric is from Lucy's Fabrics, but months and months ago and it's been sold out for a long time. Sorry.I bound the neckline using a 1/2\" double-fold binder with my coverstitch machine. Because of the bumps and basting stitches of the center front gathering, this slightly bigger binder worked better than the 3/8\" binder I used on the first version, I also used brown thread on top so I didn't get away from the brown completely. ;-)For this one, I lengthened the short sleeve pattern to 3/4 length, curved the bottom edges and then bound the edge. The end result is a quasi vent and a tiny bit of a bell shape. I like it for something different. This is another tee I won't be able to wear for a while yet, as it's still hitting 90 degrees here during the day. Blech. Enough already.And now for an abrupt change of topic …Below is Gizmo, our cat. He's a tough cuss and has got to be on Life #10 by now. Whatever life he's on, he is 16+ human years old and we've had him since he was a kitten. When DS#1 was a toddler and still an only child, he and I picked him out at the horse stables just down the road, where cats run amok and the stable owners are more than happy to send them off to new homes. DS named him Gizmo, after the Gremlins movie character, because he thought our then-new kitten looked like Gizmo the Gremlin.I didn't mention it earlier because we were all a bit depressed, but DH *very accidentally* ran over Gizmo in our driveway last Saturday (just before DS#2 needed to leave for his Homecoming activities). I took DS#2 in one direction and DH and DS#1 took Gizmo to the ER vet. They both left their cellphones behind so it was a long wait until I heard an update from them.The vet examined Gizmo and didn't find anything right away. He didn't feel any broken bones or injured internal organs. But Gizmo was very obviously hurt and limping at his hind end quite badly, although he wasn't complaining a bit. Unfortunately, further testing and x-rays were going to cost over $800 and even then, we might not find out anything. So, we decided to bring him home with some pain meds and observe him before making any big decisions.Gizmo has always been an outside cat. His choice, no matter how much we tried to make him an indoor cat. Probably something in his horse stable genes. He has a \"home base\" in our garage, where there are food and water dishes and litter box. We set him up in the garage on a blanket and there he stayed for 24 hours. Sometime Sunday night, he managed to limp outside without our knowing. I'm guessing when DH was taking out the trash. Poor DH already felt bad enough.We looked all over for him on Monday. Our property, the neighbor's property where he would sometimes go for a sneaky bite of her kitties' food, and we walked the dog path a few times. Nothing. No Gizmo. Tuesday came and went and still no Gizmo. Even though he always stayed outside, he never really went too far and we always saw him every night and every morning, for greetings and feedings. Gizmo just never went away overnight. Ever. Until Sunday.So, we figured he was bidding his final adieu to the world and we probably wouldn't find him. As Wednesday came and went with still no Gizmo, I just knew we wouldn't see him again. He was hurt and weak when he left — how would he ever be surviving these days without food or shelter?Thursday afternoon, our neighbor knocked on the door. As soon as I saw her, my heart sank because I just knew she was coming to tell me she had found Gizmo's body. But no! Yes, she had found Gizmo but he was most certainly not in kitty heaven. She told us he had been laying next to her back porch all morning and hadn't moved for hours.DS and I ran over to her yard with a basket and blanket, scooped up Gizmo and carried him back home in the basket. We still had his pain meds so we immediately gave him one pill and then some water and some cat food. He vacuumed up the food immediately and was looking for more. I knew that if he was eating and drinking, he wasn't planning to off himself. So we set him back up in the garage and checked on him every hour or so. He would be on the blanket one time and off another. So he was definitely moving around.As of today, he's very much improved. He's still limping, but only slightly. He hasn't been back outside since Thursday but he hasn't acted like he's wanted to go either. He seems to know that he needs rest and TLC. The photo above was taken just before I started writing this.This little old guy is 100% Tough As Nails."},
{"title": "Fully Cooked Onion", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2007", "text": "(I couldn't resist one more play on the pattern name.)(Edited to include a new photo.)I finished the top last night and sewed on the buttons this morning, after a 20-minute dig through my button stash to find suitable candidates. My review is here, and photos are below. I'll take a pic of me wearing the top soon. I snapped a pic of me wearing the top tonight, before I changed into my bake-blueberry-muffins clothes. I've added it below.I really like this top and the Onion pattern. None of the other Onion patterns are calling to me yet and I have a lot of other garments in the queue, but based on my experience with this one, I definitely recommend Onion. I purchased mine at Shop Onion. The delivery from Denmark was very fast, the price and shipping reasonable, and a downloadable PDF English translation comes with the purchase. (If you're going to order, please note that Maria, the Shop Onion website owner, is on vacation until 29 October so shipping is delayed until her return.)"},
{"title": "Full Busted Onion", "date": "Saturday, October 20, 2007", "text": "(I just love the name of these patterns and playing with them in my blog entry titles.)I'm in the process of sewing up my Onion. I'm foregoing a muslin and forging ahead with the good stuff. Mostly because, truly, I have lots of good stuff and if this somehow doesn't cut it, it won't be the end of the world or even a small dent in the stash. But also because a comparison of my final pattern pieces against my TNT Ottobre tee pattern is purty darn close so I'm purty darn confident it's going to work fine.The promised non-earth shattering FBA pics and narrative follow. Or would, if Blogger would cooperate. Grrrr. I'll come back later and update this.* * * * *OK, Blogger is still hiccuping, but I managed to get the pics uploaded.This is the Onion upper bust pattern, unaltered (obviously!).I traced that and made an FBA, resulting in the dart highlighted in yellow, below.I then slashed from the shoulder down to the bust and rotated the horizontal dart to the shoulder, which resulted in the new dart opening highlighted in yellow, below. The new dart opening on the pattern is filled in with tissue and will be sewn as gathers onto the back shoulder seam.Next, I added the extra width needed at the sideseam to make this piece match up to the width of my Ottobre tee, and then I laid the puzzle piece of a pattern on top of a new sheet of tracing paper and traced it, adding seam allowances too. Voila! Done. The new extra length of this upper piece will be eased into the sideseam at bust level.You'll need to click this photo so you can see the detail in the larger version. This shows my Ottobre back pattern piece under the Onion tracing. You can see (I hope) the original Onion width, and the 2\" I added. The original Onion shaping is very similar to the Ottobre, with just the overall width being different. Which is to be expected since I'm wider than the largest Onion size. ;-) (The Onion XL size in inches is 42-35-46.)If you're going to do a similar FBA for this pattern, be sure that your results for the top bodice measure 1/2\" narrower than the bottom piece at the empire seam (circled in red, below). The neckband makes up for this difference.For the sleeve, I eyeballed it using my Ottobre sleeve pattern width as a guide. It's a knit, it's forgiving, and I was too lazy to do a \"proper\" sleeve adjustment. This will work fine so I'm not worried about the Alterations Police hunting me down. ;-)When I was getting ready to write the entry earlier, this is where I had stopped. You can see that my altered upper bust pieces do hit at the proper empire area, i.e., below my (Zillie's) bust. Since Blogger wasn't cooperating, I went back upstairs and continued sewing so I'm a lot further along now. I expect to finish it tonight and post a photo or two tomorrow.Since my Ottobre tee pattern pieces were handy, after I cut out the Onion pattern, I cut out another Ottobre tee too. I'm planning to bind the neckline with the fabric in the upper left corner but it's nowhere near as bright orange as it appears here. It's more of a duller pumpkin orange. I really wanted to bind it with brown, but I think every top I've made lately has been bound with brown, including the Onion in the works, which might be verging on Too Much. Or not, since I do love them all.And the best news is that while I've been sewing, DH has been in the garage building me a new cutting table base, with SHELVES!! Woo hoo! I don't think it will make it into the sewing room before next weekend since it will need to be painted, but it's close and I'll just have to be a little more patient."},
{"title": "Tracing an Onion", "date": "Friday, October 19, 2007", "text": "I'm about to leave for the weekly Friday football pre-game meal duties, but I did manage to squeeze some tracing time in this morning.I like the lines of this top and bought the pattern, even though I could probably copy it pretty well by just morphing a TNT tee. There's nothing like the call of a new pattern, eh? Although I'm pretty sure I have learned my lesson for pants patterns!I laid my TNT Ottobre pattern pieces over the Onion pattern sheet and could see immediately that things weren't too far off. Yes, I'd need to add width since my Otto tee is plus-sized and the Onion isn't, but it would be a straight 2\" per side seam (according to my eyes and the Onion pattern measurements), so nothing too hard there. Everything else seemed to line up very well. Except the bust area for the front empire piece of the Onion. But I knew that would be the case, so I was expecting to need an FBA.That's where I'm leaving the pattern for the moment. I've already slashed/spread for the FBA. Now I just need to rotate the resulting dart up to the shoulder seam where there are already gathers. I'll do that between meal and game time when I get home later and I'll share pics (although it's nothing complicated so it won't be earth shattering) probably later tonight or tomorrow. After the alterations, I'll sew an ungly knit muslin to test out the altered pattern.Now it's off to the races …"},
{"title": "Errands and Odd Jobs", "date": "Thursday, October 18, 2007", "text": "I spent a lot of time in the sewing room yesterday but I have nothing to show for it. At least nothing wearable. As planned, I did trace my TNT pants pattern onto STP (Swedish Tracing Paper) and also made pieces for the modifications I've been wanting to do. Things like different pocket opening shapes, a back yoke for jeans, and tracing off different hem widths so I can mix-n-match without dragging out the pattern tissue. I didn't hang the pattern tracings as I was initially thinking; instead I rolled them and put them into the empty bottom drawer of my pattern cabinet. My TNT Ottobre tees tracings are also rolled and I'll store them in the same place after I've made a few more over the next couple of weeks. For now, they're sitting on top of the cabinet, gently calling to me. (Soon, my pretties, very soon.)I really wanted to put the newly traced/created yoked jeans pattern to work, but I don't have any decent denim. Really. I'm all out. Well, not all out, but the few pieces/colors I have aren't what I want to sew. So I ordered two cuts (one solid brown and the other dark denim blue) from Fashion Fabrics Club. Since I'm dealing with FFC, it will take a while before it gets here so I'll just have to be patient. I hope I love the brown because that's a color that is still going to figure prominently in my wardrobe as we move into Autumn, if not in temperature at least by calendar.I've also decided that with or without DH (he'll be mostly out of town for the foreseeable future), I've *got* to do something about the lack of flat surfaces in my sewing room. The only places to put things that need a temporary resting area are on my cutting table and on the ironing board. I don't like things piled up on my cutting table, especially when I want it clear for cutting or tracing and it's a right pain to not have a clear ironing board when I need it, so I want to convert my sewing table to have shelves under the cutting surface, very much like Melody did. I'm really, really tired of moving my Stacks of Important Stuff from cutting table to ironing board to floor to table to board to table to floor … well, you get the picture. I long for two shelves under the cutting table. I dream of two shelves under the cutting table. I covet two shelves under the cutting table. I'd sell my firstborn for two shelves … OK, that's a little extreme, but I just can't stand it anymore. I have a $50 Home Depot birthday gift card in my wallet from my mom and I know how to use it! Now I have to come up with plans and a materials list and psych myself up to actually tear apart my sewing room even more while it gets done.But before that, I need to clear out the mending jobs. First up will be the 4 throw pillows that belong on our family room sofas. Dani, sweet poochie that she is, has a puppy penchant for chewing zippers on throw pillows. Sigh. She's gotten all but one of them, so far. I'm going to take the easy way out and remove the remainder of those zippers and just sew the darn pillows permanently shut.After that, I need to re-attach four beltloops to two pairs of DS' jeans. I'll have to sew in a reinforcement patch inside the jeans first since there's now only holes where the beltloops used to be. Don't ask.And in about an hour, I'll be shuttling with DS to take his Jeep into the shop so his A/C can be worked on.It's going to be a another busy day, so I'd better get moving."},

Yet, I keep torturing myself by trying new patterns when it would be less time-consuming to just morph any style changes onto that TNT pattern. And let's face it — I don't even have that many style changes. I live in jeans and jeans-styled capris.I guess you know where this is heading, and CAUTION … Objects In Mirror May Be Larger Than They Appear! ;-)I traced both the Patrones and Ottobre patterns yesterday and I cut and sewed a muslin for the Patrones. The front view isn't too bad but those familiar back X-wrinkles greeted me in the mirror.I actually contemplated altering the pattern for a while. And then I thumped myself upside the head, came to my senses and curled up with a few issues of some magazines that I've gotten behind on reading.This is my TNT pattern. Simplicity 4068.I've made it lots of times now. All of my alterations are actually on the pattern pieces (versus little notes to myself for later) so I can just mindlessly cut the good fabric and sew, no muslin needed. It doesn't have a back yoke like a true jeans pattern but by tomorrow, it will. My final pattern pieces are still in tissue form, sliced and diced, taped and re-taped. While I'm working on the yoke, I'm going to trace off a good \"keeper\" copy because this thing is GOLD and I don't want to keep fiddling with that icky tissue. I may even just hang this one so I never even have to press it flat before starting. The Ottobre tracing is headed for the trashcan before I make myself insane. ;-) And I think I'll be listing my Patrones and a few other non-English pattern magazines on the PR Classifieds soon. There are so many other patterns on my list for which I can actually comprehend the little details that I really shouldn't frustrate myself with translating Spanish, German and Dutch sewing terms. Which is a good thing, really, because now I can focus on some late-summer (Autumn to the rest of you) tops that have been calling to me. So that Ottobre magazine will still be getting a workout, just not in the pants sections. Oh, and there's a Onion pattern (5038) calling quite loudly too, although I may just morph the details of that onto a TNT tee pattern. I do eventually learn things from time to time. ;-)"},
{"title": "Experiments", "date": "Tuesday, October 16, 2007", "text": "It was March when I first mentioned this Patrones jeans pattern, noting its seemingly perfect-for-me extra thigh and caboose room. It's now October and I've finally traced it.I also traced a capris pattern from the 02/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman (the issue with all those great tee shirts!), but not the one I have circled in that pic from March. Instead, I've traced the pair at the bottom left of that line drawing sheet because it's more jeans-like and will be easier to morph if it works. Maybe by next summer, I'll get around to the other pair of Ottobre capris.Looking back on that March post, I see that I didn't make up anywhere close to what I wanted to try, which is always the way. Too many patterns, too little time. But hey, I did make about half of them so that's pretty good. Of course by now my want-to-make list is even longer. Sigh. If I was filthy rich, I think I'd have a staff to trace, cut & sew along with me.After dinner tonight, I'm going to cut and sew a muslin for each of these traced patterns and compare.Oh, I forgot to mention … I think I hate the non-English pattern magazines. I don't need the construction information but I *do* need the info for things like waistbands to cut from measurements, or recommended fabrics, etc. I'll need to study the Spanish in the Patrones a little to see if I can figure out that waistband (in centimeters no less!). Otherwise, I'll just cut a length of muslin and wing it. A waistband isn't hard to figure out, but not being able to understand other little details makes me crazy."},

I think I forgot something.\" Before the words were even out of his mouth, I realized we had left Samantha's wristlet corsage at home in our refrigerator. Oops. I dropped him and made a mad dash back to our house to pick it up. We basically live on the same road (different names as it continues through 3 zip codes), but it's a long road and about a 15-minute drive between our house and hers. I made it back before the deadline for leaving for the restaurant so all was well.Alex, Samantha, two other couples and Samantha's parents took off for Outback Steakhouse and then Samantha's parents dropped off the teenagers at the dance venue, which is a brand new media and theater center that's part of a local community college campus. Alex says it was very nice and much better than last year's venue, which was one of the big buildings at the Florida State Fairgrounds. In previous years, the school has also used Raymond James Stadium, the place where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team plays. One of the other girl's parents picked up the group and dropped them off at their individual houses so my participation was easy-peasy and I had a nice peaceful night to myself.In response to a comment, yes, the Homecoming dances in our area are formal. I think it's great because it gives all the high schoolers one opportunity per year to go all out and have some good, clean fun. Prom is for Seniors only here, but Homecoming is open to all the grades. With both sons in high school, last year was a doozy for the budget because we had to rent two tuxedos for Homecoming and another for Prom, plus shell out the money for corsages, dinners, etc., but this year we're back to only one high-schooler and one tux/one event until Alex is a Senior.And for non-U.S. readers asking what Homecoming actually is, I'll refer you to last year's Homecoming post, here. Yes, Alex is trying out different hairstyles. ;-) Last year, was a 5-inch Mohawk. This year, he's shaggy and curly, with hair much too pretty for a boy. I wish mine was still that red on its own. But there's no denying he's my son — he looks just like me, except for his blue eyes. Oh, and the football team won Friday night 32-13. A perfect Homecoming week all around."},

But that brief cold snap this morning gives me hope that lower humidity levels are just around the corner and soon we'll be enjoying that perfect Florida weather up until next May.I went a little topstitching crazy on these but I wanted them to look more like \"real\" jeans than a quickie sew of pull-on denim pants. From way before summer started, I had really wanted to sew true jeans from this fabric but I never seemed to have the time. I finally decided *something* was better than wishing the flat fabric was pants. At least now I can wear them, and I will. A lot. I may still topstitch a fake fly onto the front but I'm out of time this morning and need to get out and about to start the day. A day which won't end until close to midnight, when I'm back home again after Team Mom and Game Day duties. Tonight is Homecoming, so halftime will run long and the game will end later than usual.This is the side pocket. I *need* this pocket every Friday when I'm looking for an easy place to stash the receipt from the restaurant that provides the team meal. It's also good for dog treats during our daily walks. The back pockets are slighty bigger versions of this same shape, with the same topstitching. I wasn't imaginative this time as this is the exact same pocket and topstitching used for my khaki capris earlier in the year. I've been wearing those on some Fridays, but inevitably when I do is when I slosh BBQ sauce down my leg. If you haven't guessed yet, Mr. Murphy seems to follow me around a lot.The bottom hem is vented, and I bartacked just above the opening with navy thread for a little invisible security. Nothing exciting there, just a detail that will be useful for me when I'm sitting funny and go to get up with my pants leg still stuck under my butt or something. ;-)Now, to the shower and then out for a quick dog walk. Then off to the school to pick up checks for the restaurant, to the restaurant by noon for lunch for me and DS and then to load the food, return back to school to unload the food, set up the tables and drinks, serve the team, clean-up, return home around 4 p.m. for another quick dog walk, grab dinner, and off to the game at 6:45 p.m. Sounds like fun, eh? ;-) Actually, it is as long as you don't list it all out like that.

{"title": "Questions and Capris", "date": "Thursday, October 11, 2007", "text": "OK, I have to admit that I never thought I'd get so many comments about the little thread rack and my \"floating\" basket. But thank you. It's nice to know I'm not the only one touched by OCD in the sewing room. ;-) There were a few questions/comments, so I'll address those here.1. Will bobbin spools fit on those spindles?Not directly. The spindles are on the thick side. And, as a side note, they are also spaced too close together to put C&C spools side-by-side. (Yes, I use C&C a lot because of the better color selection and my machines never balk at it.) But the spacing doesn't matter to me because I'm not intending to actually fill up the rack. If I do, it means I have too many spools sitting out. OK, back to bobbins …To get around the spindle size, I use plastic drinking straws. I cut a straw so it's about 4\" long and then I slit it along the length so it can wrap around itself to become narrower. I slide the straw over a spindle, pop on a spool of thread and then slide the matching bobbin thread down the straw on top of the thread, like this:I use the straws on my big thread racks too, to stack multiple spools of the same thread.2. How do you store your bobbins?I use these Bobbin Saver thingies. I think I purchased them at Joann's with coupons, but they're available at many places that sell other notions. I like these a lot. My bobbins stay put and are handy, and the thread tails don't unwind. Well, if I actually take the time to rewind the tail around the bobbin. Ahem. But the tails don't unwind any further than however long they are when I stick the bobbin into the Saver.As you can see, I have a few bobbins. But I do actually use them up. Either on the next sewing project if the color is right or when I'm basting something. I like to use different color threads top and bottom when basting so it's easy to tell which is which when I'm removing the stitches or pulling up gathers, so I pop in a \"used\" bobbin and baste away. I'm not always so thrifty, but this is too easy not to be.3. OK, Debbie, you had such a brilliant idea that now Nancy's Notions is backordered 2 weeks out for the mini thread rack!Nah, it wasn't me. NN's was backordered when I ordered mine too. But it was worth the wait. But I'm *still* waiting for the rest of my order and I'm getting ticked off. It's been over a month now and apparently NN's uses a new FedEx slow-boat-to-China service and on top of that sent one part of my order to my previous (as in 2 years ago!) address and has now had to reship it, again on the slow boat. Grrrr. My orders from NN's used to arrive very promptly. I am not liking their new, not-improved, shipping service. Oops. Rant over.4. Simplicity 9076 has a can caddy pattern that I used, it has pockets. You can be quite creative with it, you need an empty coffee can.I couldn't find that exact pattern on the Simplicity website, but I'm pretty sure I know the type of caddy. Unfortunately, I never seem to find time to sew those sorts of things for myself. Cheap plastic baskets from Walmart are more my speed. ;-)* * * * *My next project up is a quickie pair of denim capris. Yes, I know it's October. But it's still over 90 degrees here during the day and I need a new pair for the rest of high school football season, and probably beyond. The pair I usually wear to the games is looking too faded these days and they are on the verge of becoming embarrassing. Plus, the school colors are navy & gold and a new darker denim is closer to the navy and will look better with the gold tee shirt I wear every Friday to the games.I'm using my TNT Simplicity 4605 (OOP, I think). I cut them out last night and will finish them this morning. I'll be adding two back and one side pocket, because the other thing that bugs me about my old denim capris is that they have NO POCKETS. Arghhh.The rest of the day will be filled with errands. To the post office, to DMV to pay a ticket for DS (not speeding, thankfully, but driving with an expired tag which was sort of my fault too for not paying attention to it), and hopefully to the dog park. Poor poochies haven't been in so long. It's been so hot that going in the middle of the day is useless because no one else is there and with football practice pick-up, the timing has been wrong to go before or after dinner. Tonight is a big pep rally at school since this is Homecoming Week. I'm thinking if I skip the Pep Rally, I can take the dogs and then go pick up DS. DS#2 has an actual date for the dance on Saturday. I'm hoping I'll have some pics to share. Which reminds me, I need to pick up his tux too. Time to scoot …"},
{"title": "It's The Little Things", "date": "Saturday, October 6, 2007", "text": "You probably already know that this is a thread rack. But what you may not know is that it's a tiny thread rack, costing about $3.50 from Nancy's Notions. When I saw it, I was in love and I bought it pronto!This is where I sew.My machines are spaced along a 6-ft counter. Generally, it's more than enough room. Except, as I sew I tend to accumulate \"clutter\" to the right of the sewing machine. Things like the 2-3 presser feet I'm switching between during a project, my thread snippers, different spools of thread for different parts of a project, and more. And then, if I have to move to the coverstitch machine on the far right, my garment gets laid over the top of that pile of clutter and invariably something slips to the floor or I have to hunt underneath for my snips. This drives me NUTS as I'm usually a very organized person. A place for everything and everything in its place.The little thread rack arrived yesterday. This morning, I couldn't wait to get to the sewing room to get things in order. Now the space between the sewing machine and coverstitch machine looks like this:The white basket to the left of the thread rack isn't a new addition, It's always been there. It holds my most-often used notions. Things like tweezers, my \"stick\", bodkins, seam ripper, buttonhole cutter, screwdriver, lint brush, etc. But now the mini thread rack is also in place and it's currently holding the spools of thread for a project in process, a spool of white thread that's almost used up but has too much thread left to toss, same for a cone of serger thread, topstitching thread for a pair of DS's jeans that need repair, and a couple of straws holding matching bobbins that I don't want to \"file\" away with the rest of the bobbins yet, lest I forget which one matches which.Also added today was another little white basket that will \"float\" between the two machines. I'll toss the in-use presser feet and needle cases** in there, along with my pin cushion. Then, when I need to move to the coverstitch machine, all I'll have to do is move that little basket aside instead of gathering up each piece of clutter individually.**I leave the whole needle case out so that I can tell at a glance what needle is in my machine. When I switch needle types, I put the previous case away and put the new case out.  Yeah, I'm probably a bit OCD about all of this, but for now, I'm feeling very pleased with the results."},
{"title": "Sometimes Things Just Work Out", "date": "Tuesday, October 2, 2007", "text": "DH finished with his 3-week class this past Friday, but he's only home for this week before he takes off on Sunday. It's gonna be me and the boys (and poochies) manning the home fires for a while. We decided to have a real lunch date together today before his trip.Of course I wanted to wear my new top but I didn't think it would be a go because I didn't think I had anything to wear with it yet. Hah! When one has been buying and sewing (and receiving wonderful fabric gifts from Aussie friends) in the same color families, one should know better. A trip through the long pants section in my closet revealed a winner. Last year's pants from the wonderful bengaline fabric that Belinda sent from Australia. Belinda knows my colors as well as I do. Lucky me, eh? These pants match my new top perfectly. I love it when that kind of stuff happens.So, here I am. New top, last year's pants. The top feels great. I love this fabric. But it's a looser style than I'm used to so I need to stop thinking it's going to fall off my shoulders because it really isn't. It fits fine and doesn't move. I just don't have a seam at my armpit so I'm getting more of a breeze in there. ;-) I could see living in these tunics all summer long. Why did I wait until October?But I'm now long out of that outfit and back to my flips flops and capris. Mom uniform. Plus my toes were about to suffocate being covered over and all. ;-) Here's what I'm wearing as I type this, apologies for the blurries. And no, still no carpeting in my bedroom. Sigh."},
{"title": "99.99% Finished", "date": "Sunday, September 30, 2007", "text": "The only thing left to do is to press up and coverstitch the bottom hem.If I had to do anything over, it would be to raise the waistband just a little because it's slightly too low in the back. But not enough to stop me from wearing it. Besides, I don't look at my own back, right? ;-)It's very comfortable and the loose, flowy style is good with the poly fabric since it allows air to circulate. It's still over 90 degrees here during the day and will be for a while yet, so air circulation is a must.These pics were taken during my pin-fitting of the sideseams.I'm not used to wearing dolman sleeves these days but even so, I thought they were hanging a bit low and long, especially since I hadn't added the sleevebands yet. There was also too much ease at the waist and hips. I chopped about 3 inches off the sleeve length (before bands) and reshaped the underarm curve higher and tapered it down to the bottom hem to incorporate removing about an inch from each side at the waist and hips.With the sleevebands sewn on, the finished sleeve length is not a whole lot shorter than what you see here, maybe an inch shorter. But with my arms at my sides, the bands are above the level of the horizontal line at the waist, which is what I wanted so the wide expanse would be broken up visually. With the slightly longer short sleeves than what I usually wear in the summer, the top won't scream \"Summer\" in the middle of December when I'll probably still be wearing it and wishing for cooler weather.This is the back side of the modesty panel. To place it, I put the top on Zillie and then pinned a folded and pressed scrap of the print behind the neckline. (For the panel, I put the stretch going up and down so it wouldn't give when being worn.) I carefully pinned it to the seam allowances where the neckbands meet the bodice body. Then I sewed the panel to those seam allowances and trimmed away the excess, resulting in the shape you see above. The bottom of the panel is raw edges. I may end up hand-tacking the panel to the inside layer of the neckbands at the top, but I'll see how it wears without doing that. So far, it stays in place just fine so tacking it probably won't be necessary.Since it's Sunday and no make-up and icky clothes day, I'll take a pic of me in the finished top in the next day or so. Maybe after I've made some pants to wear with this.We had lots of errands to catch up on so I didn't get a whole lot of time in the sewing room today, but I did make some progress. This pic makes it look like the top is further along than it really is. But turn Zillie around and you'll see there's an important bit missing.I still need to sew on the back waistband and lower bodice section, plus I think I'll need to shorten the sleeves somewhat before I sew on the sleeve bands. It was hard for me to judge the length of the dolman sleeves when making the pattern without being able to try it on.Today I attached the front waist band, front lower bodice and I created and attached a modesty panel for the cleavage area. ClaireSondra, the reason I don't want to wear a cami underneath is simple — I just don't. ;-) More precisely, this fabric is nice and drapey and I don't want it to get hung up on an underlayer and I don't want to fiddle with keeping both layers in their correct places. Plus, I like how Sigrid's top looks with the panel made of matching print, like it's more planned instead of something there just to cover up.I took a chance and didn't make a trial muslin but I think this one is going to fit fine especially given the more loose and forgiving style, but I'll pin the sideseams tomorrow, try it on and tweak if needed.Thanks everyone for the nice comments welcoming me back. I didn't really go anywhere but something had to give for a while so I could cram 28 hours into every day. It was a busier than usual summer but things are starting to fall into a better routine so I should be around more regularly now. Still, it's nice to be missed and I thank you for that."},
{"title": "In the Pink (and Brown)", "date": "Friday, September 28, 2007", "text": "A recent topic on the Pattern Review message board about sharpening pinking shears detoured into a side discussion about how those who have pinking shears don't really use them anymore now that they use rotary cutters for cutting out patterns and sergers for finishing seams. Among other things, pinking shears are/were used when cutting out so that the raw edges of the seam allowances wouldn't fray.I've never used pinking shears for cutting out in my recent sewing, although I do remember my mom using them so I probably did too when I was a kid. But I do use mine now on a regular basis for other tasks. And yes, my pinking shears are actually pink. I did that on purpose because I thought it was amusing at the time. These are Fiskars brand and cost about $35 when I bought them about 10 years ago. That was a lot of $$ to me then for a cutting implement since I didn't really sew at the time. I bought them for other fabric crafts. Anyway, they're still as sharp now as when new. I mention this because Fiskars get a bad rap in the PR discussion and not all Fiskars are cheapos. It's probably another case of different grades of a certain brand and getting what you pay for.My pinking shears are always within reach so they're handy when I need them. One of my favorite uses for them is to clip curves. Instead of actually clipping or notching a curve with regular scissors/shears, I pink the curves close to the seamline (after pressing open). The seam allowance is then trimmed and notched in one step and getting the seam to lay flat after turning right sides out is a breeze because the pinked notches and narrow seam allowance remove all the bulk that can hamper a good, smooth curve.I also use my pinking shears to grade seam allowances, as you can see in the photo below. In this instance the bulk of two pressed-open seam allowances on top of each other is better distributed, as I pinked this side and left the other side as is.Here's the pic after turning. It's brown fabric so the detail is hidden, but I think you can see how smooth that inside curve is. The outside curve is still raw edges at this point.What these pics show is the neckband for the Burda WOF top. After I cut out these pieces, I thunked my forehead when I realized I should've just cut them on the fold instead of with a center back seam since I'd already eliminated the back zipper and cut the print section on the fold. But I wasn't thinking. However, it worked out fine in spite of my brain lapse and cutting separate pieces actually uses less fabric and interfacing, so it might be better after all. Yeah, that's my story. ;-)So far, it's looking good. I'll probably have to add a center front modesty panel like Sigrid did for her top as otherwise I think it will be too low-cut and I don't want to wear a cami underneath, like you're seeing here on Zillie. I'm looking forward to finishing this soon but I'll have to stop sewing until tomorrow as I'm off to the shower and then onto the Friday football duties.Oh, Belinda asked in her comment from yesterday where I got this print. It was months ago from an Ebay vendor. Sorry! But it's poly so not your favorite anyway. ;-)"},
{"title": "Fingers Crossed", "date": "Thursday, September 27, 2007", "text": "It's cut out (Burda WOF 03/2007 #103B). No muslin. No time. This is the *good* fabric.I did spend some time tweaking my pattern after I had it printed, taped and cut out. I laid the actual Burda tracing over it and finessed mine to match theirs where there is some subtle shaping. I really do think it's good to go, but I won't know for sure until it's sewn and on me. Although maybe I should be smart and do a little pin-fitting before I commit every seam to the serger.Next up is interfacing the neckbands. I hate interfacing. Not the noun, but the verb. The fusing step isn't bad (although I do have a wee bit of envy over Belinda's new pressing toy which she's yet to blog about. Ahem.), but the cutting out and then re-cutting out after fusing is just fiddly and an extra step before sewing. Not a big deal in the whole scheme of life or anything, just a little irk of mine.My iron is heated up, so time to strike while the iron's hot (groan).(Wow—A whole post completely sewing-related. Amazing!)"},
{"title": "So, What Did YOU Do Yesterday?", "date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2007", "text": "I spent most of Monday under my son's new (old) car, a 1993 Jeep Cherokee. He and a friend installed new front brake rotors, calipers, and pads on Sunday but his friend had to take off early and the brake lines still needed to be bled to remove the air in the lines before the job was finished. DS bought this Jeep about 2 weeks ago and has been very impatient to get it fixed up so he can drive it. His main car for the last 2 years has been a 1965 Mustang with lots of looks but no air conditioning. He loves that car (and still has it) but wanted a \"crapper\" that he could tool around in and not really care where he parked it and, more importantly, one with A/C. I can't imagine driving around here in Florida in August without it, but he's done so for a while now. He'll get A/C for the Mustang one day but for now, he's sittting cool (finally!) in the new Jeep.You would think that an 18-year old \"dude\" with a love for cars would also have some experience fixing them, right? Hah! He's handy but not very experienced in the car maintenance department since he has not really needed to be. Until now. I know a little from my dad and from my days as the teenage girl friend (not girlfriend, but female friend) and neighbor of Guys Who Drove Muscle Cars. OK, for a while I was girlfriend to one of them, but I digress. So anyway … I promised DS that I would help him yesterday and we would get his car road-ready or bust!DS did the muscle work by jacking up the car, putting it on jackstands and removing the wheels. I studied the service manual, looked on the internet for more info and was ready with the how-to. Then we worked together to bleed the brake lines and to install new spark plugs and wires. Years ago, when I envisioned our mother-son bonding, I can tell you I never thought auto repair would be on the list. But it was actually a fun day together, even with the grease, brake fluid, and sweat. And we're happy to tell you the Jeep is braking like a champ, running smooth with the new plugs/wires, and DS will be driving it to work this morning and with hundreds more dollars in his bank account than the repair shop's.Before Cook Auto Repair opened for the day, I did actually get in some sewing-related activities. Remember this Burda WOF top?Well, I tried on the paper muslin again yesterday. Over TWO MONTHS after I first traced it. Sheesh. Time flies. I spent some time contemplating what I'd need to do to alter it and my head hurt. ;-) Not because it would be hard, but it would be time consuming and I'm short on time these days. So, instead of slicing/dicing my 42-to-48 graded-up pattern tracing, I decided to try recreating it in my pattern software. Which is what those doodles below are.I'm nearly finished with the front pieces. I still have to create the neck and sleeve bands and then work on the back pieces, but so far my pattern pieces look nearly identical to the Burda pieces. When I've got mine finished and printed, I'll overlay the Burda pieces and do a final finesse to incorporate any subtleties missed during the \"copy by eye\" process.Today, I'll try to finish up my pattern, get it printed and taped together. Maybe tomorrow I can squeeze in some time for a muslin."},
{"title": "Sewing Nibbles", "date": "Sunday, September 23, 2007", "text": "Can't quite figure out what that's a photo of?? Well, let me help. That's one of the comforters on my bed. Post-Dani destruction and crude sewing job to seal the holes. This is one of her few puppy vices and she seems to know when the bed hasn't been made immediately upon getting up for the day.It started out a few months ago as a little nibble out of one edge. OK, no big problem … a few runs of zigzag stitching at my machine and it was almost as good as new again. Well, not new since we've had it a while, but you know what I mean. Then some subsequent Saturdays later, we got up and left the bed unmade for a while, and when I went back upstairs to get dressed for the day, I was greeted by a big pile of stuffing and shreds of comforter in the middle of my bed, and, of course, Dani plopped in the center of the mess with bits and pieces hanging out of her mouth. The look of glee on her face was almost too much. That one took a little more creative sewing to patch up but I did it.After that I'd been really good about making the bed as soon as I get up. For whatever reasons, she leaves it alone when the bed is made and she hasn't yet attacked the good top comforter that we turn back for sleeping. But today, I got up before DH and when he got up, he didn't make the bed. I went upstairs a while ago and found another big pile of stuffing and shreds. This time, however, the gleeful criminal was long gone. ;-)The pic above actually looks better than it is in real life. That corner of the comforter (sor far, she likes only that one corner … DH's corner) is severely distorted, ugly and lumpy with all the haphazard fix-it-fast sewing all over. I'd buy another comforter right away except Dani is still a puppy and if when this happens again, I'd prefer it not be on a brand new one. So, we'll limp along with this ugly thing for a while longer, try harder to remember to make the bed immediately, and dream of the day when it's safe to buy a replacement.(Another of her bad puppy vice is shoes. Dani has claimed and destroyed one pair per each member of our family and we've all learned that shoes not put up and away are fair game. The silver lining is that my teenage sons are now not leaving their shoes laying around the family room anymore.)The other sewing nibble for today is my re-make of the annual football tee shirt Friday morning before starting my rounds of football meal pickup/delivery/serving and attending the game. These pics aren't so great and are after I wore my remade tee Friday night, so bear with me please. Here is one of the original man's tees:And here is my remade version on top. I bound the new neckline in navy cotton/Lycra ribbing and used navy thread for coverstitching the sleeve and bottom hems for a bit of contrast. The whole thing took less than hour, start to finish, and it's the only sewing for me I've done in over a month, but it felt good to actually be sewing for me.And the back view. Last year, this DS was \"Cookie, Jr.\" since big brother is/was \"Cookie.\" Now, he moves up to just \"Cookie.\" This is the coaches' nickname for him, not ours.Friday night's game was interesting in many ways. First, it was rain-delayed, which was good since we were going to be a bit late. (Ahem. Someone, and I'm not naming names, DH DH DH DH DH, has absolutely NO sense of direction.) And the trip home was delayed for everyone by 30 minutes spent parked on the interstate waiting for a huge accident to be cleared (surprisingly no serious injuries and no one involved that we know). But the game itself was great! Our team blew theirs away, 30-6, and my sophomore baby actually got to play when the starting Center was injured in the 4th quarter. Nothing serious, thankfully, and I had to explain to his mom (another red-headed Debbie and sitting right next to us) that I wasn't cheering for her son's injury but for my son's Varsity debut. They're our friends, so they understood. I hope. ;-)"},
{"title": "The Guilt Trip … It Worked!", "date": "Sunday, September 16, 2007", "text": "I'm still not really back to blogging but I couldn't stand another cute little sad plea for my return. LOL! Angie, Sondra — YOU CRACK ME UP!! Plus, I thought it was time to supplant that pic of the stuffed dog with a photo of real poochies.Life is still rolling along here. Older son has deferred college until the Spring semester and is currently working two jobs. One is at The Cheesecake Factory, where he brings home TONS of tip money, more than should be legal for an 18-year old! The other is at The St. Pete Times Forum (in downtown Tampa), where the Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL hockey team) play and bands, shows, etc. perform. That job usually runs through the middle of the night when he and the rest of the \"Conversion Team\" change the floor from or back to ice. Thursday night was an Alice Cooper & Black Sabbath show and DS floated back home after actually talking to some of the (geriatric) rockers. ;-) DS is really liking that job and has been interested in sets and stages since his Drama days in high school. Who knows, maybe it will actually lead somewhere for him.DS#2 is a sophomore this year. Our district changed their schedules and we've been adjusting to that. Until this year, we were on the \"block\" system, which meant four 90-minute classes per day, and only one semester per major class. So for instance, Biology would only take one semester instead of a whole year. Now, because of budgetary and legislative class-size concerns, they are on a traditional schedule with seven classes per day and all classes (except electives) last the full school year. Apparently you need less teachers/classrooms this way. DS is in all Honors and AP classes so he's a bit loaded down. But he's doing great and was the only kid in his World History class to make a 100 on a surprise test the other day. I hope he keeps that up!And, yes, there's football. I'm still in the middle of the annual tee shirt sales and still doing the Varsity meals every Friday. DS#2 was supposed to be on the JV team this year. He is only a sophomore after all. But the Varsity second-string Center quit the team and so the Varsity coach moved DS up to the Varsity team to fill the gap. It's a mixed blessing because what it really means is that he won't play much and that disappoints him (and us). And no, he doesn't have a choice. Even with me as the Team Mom, there's no extra pull. LOL! But he's adjusting and the current Center is a senior this year so DS is definitely IN to be the starting Varsity Center his junior and senior years. I suppose it's good for him to learn some patience, right?The biggest change around here is that DH and I have decided to get out of the self-employment biz. DS has been in training classes for the past couple of weeks with two more weeks to go before he moves into a slot with his former employer, a major transportation company. It will be nice to have regular paychecks and company-paid benefits again. But it also means DH will be on the road traveling a lot, leaving me to man the fort at home alone. That will take some getting used to after 15 years of a set-your-own schedule. Sigh.The second biggest change is we're down to one vehicle between DH and I right now. The lease was up on our gas-guzzling SUV last month and we've just been too busy to slow down and decide/shop for what we want. So, of course, I've needed a vehicle during the day more than I usually do and we've had to do some shuttling. Ugh. With DS's Mustang in the shop the first 3 days of this past week, it's been ugly. But his car is out (long rant coming on that another day), and he's actually buying an old Jeep tomorrow to be his daily driver, so we'll be back to 3 vehicles in less than 24 hours. And once DH is out of the classes, we'll shop for our second and the family's fourth. Oh Lordy, be still my insurance rates! But I will say it's been nice to NOT have to $$fill up$$ the honkin' big V-8 SUV anymore.And me. I haven't sewn a thing for myself since whenever I last posted I did. But I have been sewing. A LOT. And not doggy diapers, although I'm still doing them in dribs and drabs. I stumbled on to some private customers that at another time I might have turned town, but it's been lucrative so I'm giving it a shot since we need the income right now with DH in training mode and me officially un-self-employed. But, man, that Burda top is still calling to me every time I open the stash closet and see that beautiful fabric. Sniff, sniff. It will be hot/warm here for quite a while yet, so I haven't given up on it. And I will have to convert a football tee to a female version very soon. So, hang in there … there will be sewing on this blog again soon."},
{"title": "More Than You Ever Wanted To Know …", "date": "Sunday, August 5, 2007", "text": "… about doggy diapers. ;-) (Sorry, no Burda top yet.)So, along with making Dani some new diapers since she likes to chew on them (grrrr!), I decided to take some of your and my family's comments to heart and experiment with making others to sell. I figure between a flyer I'll put up at the dog park next week, Ebay and some other local venues, I might just gain a small customer base. There seems to be a need because many small dogs have piddle accidents in addition to those going into heat, but the \"RTW\" dipes you find in the chain pet stores are, frankly (and excuse the pun), butt-ugly. And many of the dipes on Ebay are horribly-sewn and still selling (although to be fair, some are very nice too). So, who knows if this will lead anywhere.I've done some research and test sewing (one of the reasons I've been blog-absent). First, I went to the pet store with a measuring tape and notepad to get a better idea of the sizes & shapes. I figured why reinvent the wheel when someone else has already done the calculations. Then I made another trip with the measuring tape to the small dog side of the dog park since I'm limited with my own live \"fit models.\" It was interesting convincing pet owners to let me measure their poochies' crotches. ;-)Speaking of models … I also looked for and found (whew!) a free downloadable pattern for a stuffed dachshund. Oh, I love the internet! None of the Big 3/4 pattern companies have anything remotely useful for this or I probably would've bought that since finding a pre-made stuffed toy dog at Walmart was also a bust. I've seen my own photos of Dani (Hi Sherril) plus others using real dog models. It's very hard to capture a live dog photo which looks like they're enjoying the modeling session and/or the diaper. Since I don't think it's particularly good salesmanship to use humiliated models, I decided a generic dog was in order.But smack me if I ever want to sew a stuffed dog again, OK? Sheesh. Flashbacks of Home Ec in junior high with a stuffed green & white gingham hippo (which I think my mom still has!).The free pattern was fine, but talk about fiddly. All those Y intersections, sharp curves and tiny seam allowances and me with ravel-ly twill. I almost gave up in the middle of it. But when I went back at it the next day, things worked out better. She didn't turn out perfect but she's more than acceptable for these purposes. My sons think she's \"freaky\" because she has no face. I think she's kinda cute, and she makes a great pincushion. Ewww ... doggy acupuncture. ;-)So, where was I? Oh yes. Patterns. Until 2 weeks ago, I'd never even contemplated making human baby diapers let along a doggy version. But I had my prototypes from Dani, measurements from the dog park and plenty of tracing paper, pencils and my french curves. Working out the basic pattern was pretty easy. Refining it and working out the fastest sewing order took a little more work.If you remember, my first Dani dipes had a tail hole like this:But I saw others on Ebay that had ribbing (or bias binding) like this one I made for Dani:At first I thought the ribbing would be easiest. Ah, how wrong I was. It's hard to tell scale in my photos, but the tail holes are not that big and there's barely enough space to maneuver a sewing machine presser foot, let alone a serger or coverstitch machine foot.Back to Plan A, but with a better sewing order (another of the prototype dipes for Dani).Deciding on this tail hole did mean a pattern redraft of all the sizes but now I've streamlined the sewing and can spend less time and materials on the dipes because there's no ribbing to cut, sew/press in a circle and then attach and topstitch around the hole (swearing like a sailor the whole time!). On top of that, this unbound tail hole makes the diaper easier to put on and take off, especially when you add fur to the scenario. Plus, with all that seaming and thread at the dog's nether region with the bound version, I think it's got to be less comfortable. I do know that Dani chewed hers with the ribbing and has left the plainer tail holes alone.Next up was deciding on the lining and interior. Flannel is soft and absorbent but little piddlers need a bit more protection. I settled on two layers of microfiber toweling sewn onto the wrong side of the flannel lining before assembly. It's soft and very absorbent without being too thick for the dog's comfort. Those with bigger wetness issues can also add a disposable pantyliner, etc., like we've been doing while Dani is in heat.So here's one of the final dipes (Chihuahua or Yorkie sized). There's elastic inside at the tummy and leg areas to prevent gaping and leakage and heavy-duty Velcro at the waist for easy-on, easy-off and adjustability.Here's another with a removable skirt option. Am I getting carried away now? ;-)The last thing was to make myself a logo, of course! ;-) If you'd like to make your own stuffed dachshund, here is the link. The original is much cuter than mine because it's made from faux fur and has a face. But don't say I didn't warn you about the sewing! I can't even fathom it with the fur."},

{"title": "Dani Pants", "date": "Tuesday, July 24, 2007", "text": "Edited to add more photos, below, including Dani Pants #2.Dani went into heat last night. Ugh. I thought we had a little more time. We're going to let her go through this cycle and then get her spayed before the next one.So, there I was last night at midnight making up \"doggy sanitary pants\" at the spur of the moment. I can honestly say I never thought I'd be sewing those! But necessity being the mother of invention and the pet stores being closed …The first pair was basically a belt with elastic attached to go around legs and tail, designed and sewn in about an hour. Luckily I had human \"supplies\" I could use for the disposable part. That prototype worked pretty well and we could all sleep without worrying about a mess in the bed but Dani really needed a little more coverage between wee-wee and tail. ;-) This morning, I drafted full coverage panties after looking around on the internet for ideas, and then I started sewing.The panties Dani is modeling in the pics is from that pattern.They are, appropriately, lined with Scooby Doo flannel (and a pantyliner!) but I forgot to take a pic before putting them on her.I thought I was done sewing underwear for a while, but Mother Nature had other ideas. I'll make one more pair tonight and then get back to my Burda top tomorrow. Do you know that the similar doggy pants I found during my morning research were going for $25-$35 each? Yes, it would be easier to go to the pet store and buy some but even at probably $10 each for mass-produced versions it still adds up to more than a couple of dollars. Versus shopping my stash and a few hours at the drafting table and machine? No brainer! ;-) Especially now that I have the custom-fitted pattern and construction perfected.It's amazing what one can do with a sewing machine!I've finished tracing and cutting out the new pieces for my \"up-graded\" pattern, which is now a straight size 48 with no alterations (yet). I think I did pretty well. The seams line up correctly and the fit on Zillie is what I'd expect for a Burda size 48. The only glitch is the neckband but that's because I altered for my square shoulders as I was tracing. Adjusting the neckband to match will be easy.As for alterations — I will have to do an FBA …and add at the waist and hip …and it looks like the shoulder-to-waist length is too long, which is disguised in the front because of Zillie's (and my) full bust.But these are all my usual alterations, so I'm quite pleased with myself and the grading!Tomorrow, I'll make those adjustments and make an ugly muslin."},
{"title": "Plan A & Plan B", "date": "Monday, July 23, 2007", "text": "Plan A: I traced the pattern. Then I cut it out without seam allowances to have a look at on Zillie and decide how to proceed. The good news is that I'm pretty sure I'll like this top on me if I can work through the alterations. The bad news is the alterations are going to be many. But I knew that going in.As you can see below, the underbust band is under Zillie's bust. But …… that's just an illusion! I have the whole garment pinned a couple of inches down from the true shoulder.And there's still quite a bit of real estate in the nether regions left uncovered.I stared at the pattern draped on Zillie many times today. Part of me wanted to start slicing & dicing to add length and width \"by eye.\" The other part of me was thinking how messy and unexact this would be and how I want to preserve the original lines as much as possible.Plan B: Returning to Square 1 and grading up the pattern in a more controlled manner.I used the grading lines on the pattern sheet (the pattern in pink) to go up 3 sizes, from 42 to 48. More specifically, I measured many points on the pattern between the printed sizes and then increased by those amounts at corresponding points on the pattern sheet to create my new size. I did this on the pattern sheet itself because, hey, what's one more set of lines, right? If you click the photos to enlarge them, you should be able to see my black pen lines a little more clearly.This grading process really didn't take that long. I sat at my cutting table with the TV on in the background and I was done in about an hour. Next, I'll trace again but this time following the lines of the \"new\" size and adding seam allowances so I can cut a muslin. I know I'll have to do regular pattern alterations, but first things first. Let's see how this up-graded pattern fits Zillie and how accurate my grading is. Judy asked in the comments about the origin for the Duro name. Duro refers to the London-based designer Duro Olowu who reincarnated this style a couple of years ago and made it his own for the runway, with bold prints and colors. It's trickled down to the masses and it seems that all dresses (and tops) with this basic look are becoming known as Duro dresses (tops) even if they're not Duro originals.I love this top. I've seen a few versions reviewed on Pattern Review which make me love it even more. The problem is, it's sized 34-42 (Euro) which is definitely too small for me.I'm going to spend some time today working with the pattern, hopefully to the point of sewing up an unwearable muslin to see what I can do to make it fit me and if I even like it on me at that point. Pretty soon, this banded/Duro-esque trend will be completely over and if I don't hop on the bandwagon soon, I may miss it completely. Remember, I don't live anywhere near NYC so trends are slower to pass here in Florida and I do still have time for this one. ;-)If I can \"make it work,\" I want to use this ebay fabric, with a solid brown for the bands:And if *that* works out, I have a brown crosshatched stretch denim for a pair of capris to wear with it. But's that's getting waaaaaay ahead of myself because, if you haven't guessed by now, my \"up next\" list changes with the rise and fall of the sun and moon.The skirt from the last couple of posts is still on the back burner. It's not abandoned but the project needs to percolate some more while I think about fabric choices and possibly altering it a little more to move the CB zipper to CF. Or maybe just using a more drapey knit and doing away with a zip altogether."},
{"title": "A New Day", "date": "Sunday, July 22, 2007", "text": "(Or is it a different pair of undies??)I tried the Burda WOF purple skirt on again this morning and I'm liking it better. It can't be the \"Magic Wardrobe\" because it never made it that far. I'm thinking that the real magic was a slippery-er pair of panties underneath while I tried it on. I know, I know — proper undergarments, which in this case will have to include silky panties or a slip (or both).It's still too long, but only compared to my other summer skirts. It should be perfectly wearable after I hem it. I'm still deciding on whether I'll keep it or donate it, but I have made my pattern alterations for the next time while the info is still fresh in the gray matter. We're off to the dogpark before the daily afternoon thunderstorms hit. The pooches are full of energy and really need a good \"burn-off\" session. Even Pepper has been, um, Peppy ;-) this morning. I hope there are a lot of playmates at the park today to wear them out. No, Chili won't be wearing his new No Fear shirt."},

I've had DS#1's thermal knit shirt sitting on top of the washer for months. He didn't want it anymore but I thought he might change his mind when it got colder so I hung onto it. For whatever reason today I unfolded it and noticed it had a couple of small holes on the front near the bottom. I was just about to finally toss it when Chili wandered in, and the brain began clicking. Chili—No Fear, No Fear—Chili. Perfect!This pattern (KS 3076) is ridiculously easy and fast. The hardest part was unstitching the neckband from the original shirt so I could re-use the ribbing for the mini version. I also re-used the ribbing at the sleeve cuffs but all I had to do for those was to cut them off without any unstitching and then join them together to make a strip.I did change up the construction order so I could attach all the ribbing in the flat. It's a LOT easier for those very small neck and \"arm\" holes. I think I'll update my review with that information and the new pics. Here's another shot of the dogs new shirt (and DS' feet).The other little project of the day was a quilt block to send in to be part of the \"commemorative\" quilt for Pattern Review. It's been a long time since I've done any quilt piecing, but it came back fairly quickly and this project, from design to done, only took a couple of hours.I haven't done much more than that in the sewing room (unless cleaning up and prewashing a couple of fabrics counts), but I feel it was a productive day."},
{"title": "Not Quite", "date": "Friday, July 20, 2007", "text": "This is going to end up being my muslin for this pattern. It pretty much fits, but I don't like the way it fits. It's too long overall and the waist is hitting me in the wrong place. I would show you on me but I'm not camera ready today. It was raining all afternoon and I took the dogs for a walk anyway and never did fix myself up after that. But the temperature drop with the rain was a nice change from the usual 6 billion degrees and 400% humidity.Back to the skirt — I could take some length off at the top, but that will mess with the darts and zipper and, really, I'm not up for reworking this one. The length needs to come out the right way, by removing it from the middle of the pattern, so I can preserve the darting and the slight pegged shape. What bugs me is that I knew this. I had made some initial alterations (adding booty width) but then I set the pattern aside for a couple of days and forgot I still wanted to check the overall length so I just went ahead and cut. Oops.I like the overall shape a lot, though. I'm obviously into gored skirts with flounces for the summer, which is good because I think it's a flattering silhouette for my curvy shape.The front of the flounce is interesting. It's more of a handkerchief shape when laid flat than it looks while on.Even the sides of the flounce have an angle.The only thing left on this skirt is the bottom hem (which is going to be interesting with those points). I think I'll hem it, use it for judging my adjustments, and then put it in the donate pile."},

And when we're done and the light goes away, she sits and stares at the floors and walls waiting for it to show up again. She just knows it's still out there, somewhere, hiding from her.I think this skirt is what I'm making next. It's from the 04/2005 issue of Burda WOF, the issue with the (in)famous twist top. But I haven't even started tracing it. Life is busy these last couple of days so no sewing-related activities have happened. (Well, last night at bedtime I did read through the Australian Stitches that arrived in the mailbox yesterday.)Right now my plan is to test this pattern in the stretch poplin print I've had out for the second skirt to match the new lavender tops. If it doesn't work, no big loss. But if it does work, I can see this being a good skirt staple for many skirts to come. This skirt does have an elastic waist, but it's as a facing not a casing. It also has a back invisible zipper and darts all around, for a somewhat sleeker fit (I'm hoping). DH is going with the boys tonight to see Harry Potter in IMAX. I have no interest in Harry Potter (sorry HP fans!) so maybe that will be my opportunity to trace and cut."},
{"title": "One More Lavender Tee", "date": "Sunday, July 15, 2007", "text": "This is #3 from the Diana Mode inspired tee pattern I created with my pattern software. It's also the second solid lavender top I've made this week. I don't know why I was stuck on lavendar. It's not even one of my usual colors. But it was calling to me from the stash so I listened.I wanted to experiment with this one and so I made up a frilly neckband to add some interest up near my face (and away from the fluff!). The front and back neckbands are usually made from two layers each. For the front neckband on this one, I channel-stitched 4 concentric rows (more or less) on the two layers and then I added a third unstitched layer for the back. If you've ever done the chenille technique, it's just like that. I also satin-stitched a vertical line down the middle just because. ;-)I slashed through the center of the rows, through the first layer only. When I was done, it looked like this:Then I continued with the rest of the construction as usual and tossed it into the washer and dryer when I was done. I got the effect I was hoping for — curly frills.I left the back neckband with no frills.Here's a close-up of the sleeve, for which I again used the original Diana Mode pattern pieces.So now I'm done with all the patterns I cut out last weekend. I still have one more skirt to make to go with this latest tee but I'm still working on the pattern alterations since I'm short on fabric for my first choice of pattern. I have to say that I've really liked having multiple garments cut out at once so that I get a mini-marathon of just sewing."},
{"title": "Another Tee & Other Stuff", "date": "Thursday, July 12, 2007", "text": "I think Belinda and I are in a race to see who can sew the most tees from 02/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman. ;-) This is my third and she's up to three (four??) too. This one is design #5, but I used plain sleeves instead of the puff, banded sleeves from the pattern that I used for the first one. I also remembered (too late) that I sewed the first neckband with a smaller seam allowance so it would turn out a little wider. This purple neckband is narrower than the other. It's still perfectly fine though, and not anything I'd point out in real life. I've now made a note on the pattern piece so hopefully I won't forget the next time. And yes, there's definitely going to be a next time, and a next time, and a next time with these Ottobre tees!I edgestitched the neckband with my sewing machine (per the instructions) this time, instead of twin needling with my coverstitch machine. This is good for a little change but I think I prefer the double needle effect. Next time I won't be so lazy about rethreading, which I had to do anyway for the hems.(Oh, and before you ask, the fabric is from Lucy's Fabrics, but it's sold out.)Next up, some answers to comments. After that, a little meme. Don't worry, no personal info required! Keep reading to see if you've been tagged.* * * * *\"I really love the look of this top with the cute tie and gathers in front. Did you use a particular pattern, or is it another variation of one of your TNT tops?\"Thank you! It's from the 06/2005 issue of Burda WOF, and yes, it's a very TNT pattern. It's one of my favorites, as you can see below. I've made it 4 times now. I was trying on the latest aqua top last night before tossing it into the laundry to get it back into shape and I decided that this pattern, with short sleeves and the ties sewn in place, will make a great nightgown too. So that's on my list for someday too.Here are the photos of the past versions, and the Burda line drawing:(Regarding sewing lingerie) \"What if your machine doesn't have a three stitch zig zag?(Mine doesn't.) What's the next best thing?\"A regular medium zigzag stitch.\"On the panties that I just made, I used my CS machine. Some of the stitches popped. I think that is because I wasn't using wooly nylon. Maybe I should use the 3-step ZZ instead. Is this why you don't use the CS for elastic in panties?\"Wooly nylon in the looper and regular sewing thread in the needles should help prevent the stitches from popping. But, yes, that's why I don't CS for panties. The triple ZZ just seems to hold up better, and it's faster to do since you don't have to keep switching machines, etc.\"On the last picture of the overlapped ends (of lingerie elastic), I can't tell where it's overlapped. Do you zig zag horizontally across, or do a zig zag the length of the overlap?\"I zigzag the length of the overlap. I've added a photo to the tutorial on my website which should help explain.\"I am curious as to whether you have used Curves software to create panties or do you prefer the KS pattern?\"I haven't used Curves for panties. No reason, really, except that I have the Kwik Sew pattern perfected for me so no need to reinvent the wheel. I did like having the instructions for the first time I made them, which you don't get with a self-draft in Curves.\"I like this top a lot. Can you show the trim up close? I see that you bound the neckline, but is that what you did on the sleeve hems? Which pattern is the skirt? It looks great with the top.\"Thank you! Here are some close-up pics. The sleeve hems are just straight strips of cross-grain knit, sewn into rounds and pressed in half and then applied in the round with my serger. I coverstitched the seam allowances up with my coverstitch machine. The sleeve pattern (from Ottobre Woman) is gathered at the top and onto the band. I pinned the band onto the bottom of the sleeve 1:1 until about 2 inches on either side of the outward center. Then I just stretched the heck out of it while I serged. ;-) That's why you see a little gathering at that area. It's supposed to be there. After a trip through the laundry, it will be back in shape.The skirt is my ol' TNT, Kwik Sew 3287.* * * * *Finally, here's the meme. The \"rules\" are simple. Answer the questions, add photos if you want (or steal mine), and tag 5 other sewing bloggers.1. What kind of seam ripper do you use?I use this one. They are very sharp and stay sharp a long time. But they're cheap when they need replacing. I buy mine from Nancy's Notions for under $3.98 each. And I buy 2 at a time so I always have a sharp one.2. What do you use to snip threads at the sewing machine?I use these little Gingher curved embroidery scissors. They're very sharp, and easy to grab quickly.3. What do you use to cut out patterns/fabric?Mostly my Olfa 60 mm rotary cutter, even around tight curves. I like that it covers more \"real estate\" at once than the smaller cutters. I use the 20 mm cutter to cut traced patterns which need a seam allowance added. I wish there was a seam allowance thingy for the 60 mm cutter. The spring-loaded Fiskars are used mostly for cutting notches/snips and other miscellaneous tasks.4. Do you stash zippers?Yep. I love not having to run to the store for a zipper. Not that the local stores ever have the right color anyway. ;-)5. Which takes up more space in your stash — knits or wovens?Knits, hands down. Probably 65-75% of my stash is knit fabric.6. Are you wearing anything today that you made?Yes. I made everything except my bra, shoes, and jewelry. More specifically, I'm wearing the orangey gathered front top you see above, khaki knit capris, and (TMI) one pair of my newest undies.7. Does anyone else in your family currently sew?Yes, my mom sews. My sister owns a sewing machine but she doesn't really sew.8. What is the last $$ sewing-related (non-fabric) item you bought?I think it was my big cutting mat.9. Cutting out, pressing, hemming. Which one do you like the LEAST?Hemming. I usually just wing it, by eye. ;-)10. Do you have any non-chain garment fabric stores in your local area?Yes, there are 2-3. But I usually shop the internet because it's more convenient. These stores are nice, but they are about a 30- to 60-minute drive.OK, I tag: Belinda, Gaylen, Beki, Erica, and Angie."},
{"title": "One More", "date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2007", "text": "Just the top. The skirt I made a couple of months ago.I wanted another top to wear with this skirt that only involved one layer. While I love the top I originally made to wear with this skirt, I do have to wear a cami with it and that gets a little warm in our summer temps.However … I don't love this new top. Well, more precisely, I don't love the aqua fabric. It's too thin and clingy, I think. But I'll see if it grows on me over the next few days. If not, it will be a PJ top or it will go into the donate pile, and I'll be on the lookout again for another fabric for a plain aqua tee.I topstitched all over with brown thread in my coverstitch machine and I trimmed the neckline and sleeves with a brown knit.

{"title": "Lingerie Elastic", "date": "Monday, July 9, 2007", "text": "Taly, this is for you. :-)(I've put this info into my Tips pages — link at top right — if anyone needs to quickly find it again.)I use 1/4\" and 3/8\" plush-back picot elastic. The sample 3/8\" elastic is not plush-back but it will work for this series of photos.1. Pre-stretch the elastic a few times and then align the straight, non-picot edge of the elastic with the raw edge of the fabric.2. Attach the elastic to the fabric, sewing next to the picot edge of the elastic with a narrow zig-zag stitch. (The elastic may stretch out during this step but steam or a trip through the laundry will pop it back into shape.)3. Turn to the back and trim close to the zigzag stitching. I use my duckbill scissors for this. It doesn't have to be especially neat as this edge will not show on the finished item.4. Fold the elastic to the wrong side so the picot edge peeks out from the right side. Stitch on the right side using a 3-step zigzag stitch. (The brown layer of fabric is here only so you can see the picot edge.)5. This is what the 3-step zigzag stitch looks like on my machine.6. This is the wrong side of the last stitching. If your thread matches your elastic, it's nearly invisible. The 3-step zigzag stitching can be anywhere between the 2 edges of the elastic. Ideally, mine would be overlapping the straight edge of the elastic to hold it down in a more finished-looking manner (which means I needed to sew more to the left in Step 4), but I was making a fast sample and wasn't paying close enough attention. ;-) I'll try to remember to update this photo when I have a better sample.I've used other methods to attach the elastic, including trying out my serger's elasticator foot and also my coverstitch machine. (See photos here). In my opinion, the method above using only the sewing machine is the best for durability and comfort in the normal course of lingerie wear. The other methods work fine initially, but the extra thread and stitches cause elastic fatigue and result in more popped stitches. The panties I sewed that way just didn't hold up as long as those sewn from the same fabric but using only the sewing machine.By the way, I sew leg and waist elastic on in the round. I overlap the cut edges of the elastic as shown below. I think it creates less bulk than a RS-together seam with the allowances pressed back. The overlap goes at the outside of the leg and the back waist."},
{"title": "First New Outfit Done", "date": "Sunday, July 8, 2007", "text": "Another nice summer outfit. Easy to wear, comfortable, and nicer than a plain tee and jeans. The skirt fabric is a stretch poplin from Fabric.com last year (or maybe the year before). The skirt is just pinned onto the dressform so it's hanging a little funky. The fabric for the twist top is also a Fabric.com purchase from last summer. It's got a puckered rib texture which you can see better in the photo below.I made another of this same top from the same fabric in a different color last year. The fabric was labeled as polyester but I think it's more nylon than poly. It's very comfortable to wear, even on our hottest and most humid days. I still wear this one a lot, so I knew I'd wear another one in a different color. I left the rosette off this lavendar version, but I made another tie which can be tied on as seen or left off. The top is not too low-cut for me to wear with only my bra underneath because after I made the turquoise version, I adjusted the pattern for a higher neckline.This makes #3 for both patterns. I love those TNTs for instant gratification. I'm not sewing as fast as I was cutting yesterday so it's not quite \"instant,\" but I am making progress. The jury is still out on the second skirt.

That's them, in a heap, on my cutting table. All sewn, awaiting the elastic in the other two heaps. Panties aren't hard to sew. At all. They don't take a lot of time. Even when making multiple pairs at a time. And I love having them when I'm done. But I just don't like doing the same thing again and again and again, and so I'm avoiding them and what should've taken a day or two has now stretched into many, many days. Sigh. I know all this yet, I can't stop my mind from wandering to the next project. And I won't let myself move on until these are done. Maybe it's 2 mostly rainy days in a row, but all I want to do is take naps and read. But I will finish these tonight and tomorrow they'll be behind me. Literally. ;-)Earlier today, I was sewing the elastic into rounds and took a pic of one of my favorite sewing \"notions,\" given to me personally by Martha Pullen about 5 years ago. OK, she gave everyone in the class one too. ;-) It's a simple little bamboo stick with a pointy tip, not even made for sewing. I'm not sure exactly what is is made for, though. It's not a shish kebab skewer, it's shorter and fatter than those. Anyway … I use it to hold things in place really close to the needle, where I'd rather not be sticking my finger. Since it's bamboo, the worst that will happen is the needle will hit it, stab it, and maybe break. Better a needle than my finger. I will be sad if I ever lose this.Since I'm still obviously avoiding the sewing room, I'll answer a few comments.\"Relating to the crotch lining, would power dry also be suitable to use in this area?\"I don't really know for sure as I've never used it. My first inclination, though, is to say no since powerdry is polyester and doesn't breathe. Yes, it wicks moisture away, but in that area of a panty, where exactly would it wick TO? Know what I mean? ;-) If anyone has more … uh … experience with this, let me know.\"I'm like a dog with a bone, and I just need to clarify. Some of those kints are just your regular garden variety knits that you're using for t-shirts etc? Just as long as they're slippery?\"Yes, just garden variety knits. And they don't *have* to be slippery if you're wearing them under jeans, etc. I just prefer slippery fabric when I'm wearing a skirt or dress. And I also use what I have and lately I've been sewing with rayon knits that are more slippery than cotton knits. Experiment and see what you like.Regarding the purple bra/panty set, \"Nylon takes dye?!???!!!! Who woulda thunk it? Please tell me you're not dying your thread? I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but wouldn't you just use purple poly thread???\"That set started out white and I didn't know what color it was going to be until I dyed it. It could've been green or pink or orange or whatever mood struck that day. If I knew it was going to be purple (and that the white poly thread didn't take dye), I might have used purple poly thread. But the beauty of nylon thread is that it will dye to the same exact shade as the rest of the lingerie so I don't have to worry about matching up beforehand.\"Just wanted to ask with a (wink) if you will be modelling the undies too?\"Um. No. Consider yourself lucky. LOL!"},

I wanted a day to just vegetate and putter around. We all slept in, including DS#2 who got back from wrestling camp last night.Soon after I got up, I prepared the preliminary makings for some Rocky Road ice cream and put that in the freezer to chill. While waiting for that to cool down, I sorted through DS's stinky camp clothes and started the laundry, took the dogs out, made lunch, and tidied up the kitchen. Hmmm. That doesn't sound like vegetating, does it? Well, if you consider that we had planned to go to the dog park after lunch and we finally made it there around 6 PM, you should understand how slow I was moving. ;-)Here's Dani jumping for joy in and out of a puddle at the dog park.Before we left the dog park, I decided that instead of the same old, same old shrimp stir-fry I was planning for dinner, I wanted to do Alfredo sauce and pasta. That meant a stop at the store on the way home and a late dinner. But, mmmmmmm, the wait was worth it.And for dessert, the Rocky Road ice cream I started this morning and finished this afternoon in the new ice cream maker, complete with waffle cups and chocolate sauce.I probably should've stuck with the lighter stir-fry since we're all so stuffed, we can barely move. ;-)* * * * *The ice cream recipe comes from the internet. The Shrimp & Broccoli Fettuccine Alfredo I made up, so the measurements are approximate since that's how I cook.Shrimp & Broccoli Fettuccine Alfredo (serves 6 adults, or 2 adults and 2 teenage boys)2 packages fresh fettuccine pasta40 or so medium shrimp, peeled and deveined (I used frozen, 2 bags, thawed)fresh broccoli cut into about 2 cups of small florets, blanched until dark green1-1/2 cups heavy cream (Yes, OMG)1/4 cup butter (as if the cream weren't enough)3/4 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese2 teaspoons minced garlic2 tsp ground black pepper1 tsp salt1 tbl dried parsley (because I forgot to buy fresh)In large saucepan, over low to medium heat, combine butter and cream, stirring constantly until butter is melted. Add cheese and garlic and stir until cheese is melted. Add cooked shrimp and broccoli. Continue stirring until sauce begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente; drain.Place pasta in a serving dish, and toss with shrimp sauce. And be prepared not to move for 2-3 hours after eating!Rocky Road Ice Cream (from BHG website)2 oz unsweetened chocolate1 14-ounce can (1-1/4 cups) sweetened condensed milk*1 cup water2 cups whipping cream1 cup chopped walnuts1 teaspoon vanilla1-1/3 marshmallows, cut into small pieces2 oz semi-sweet chocolate, smashed into small pieces (I added this)*I didn't have sweetened condensed milk so I found a conversion for evaporated milk, which I did have. In a medium saucepan melt the chocolate over medium-low heat. Gradually stir in milk until combined. Gradually stir in water. Remove from heat. Pour half of the mixture into a blender container; cover and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with other half of mixture.

I've been very happy with each of these vendors.\"Those fabrics … Where in the world do you find pieces like that?\"These are scraps from tee shirts and other knit garments I've made and the fabrics come from all of my \"regular\" sources, mentioned previously throughout the blog. A good list of internet fabric stores can be found on Pattern Review, here. Also, if you want solids, any of the lingerie suppliers above can put together white \"kits\" that can be dyed using plain ol' Rit or Dylon dyes. Dyeing your own can be fun too because then you'll have laces and other \"findings\" which perfectly match, like the purple set in the photo above. Just be sure to use nylon lingerie thread because regular polyester sewing thread doesn't take dye and you'll end up with white stitching like this, (I made these couple of years ago).\"What pattern are you using?\"I'm using Kwik Sew 2908, modified for an enclosed crotch lining sewn like this.\"Is it difficult to make your own or no?\"Heck no! And the sewing goes pretty darn fast too.\"I can't remember what fabric you said you're using. I think you said rayon/lycra. If so, is it slippery enough to allow your clothing to slide freely over the undies?\"Yep, some rayon/Lycra and also EOS buttermilk, and some nylon/Lycra. And all plenty slippery. I don't enjoy Velcro butt. ;-)\"This is prolly TMI, but I had to get up in the middle o'the night to find some different undies. Mine were driving me CRAZZZY.

So I think it will stay since it's not a pain in the neck to make nice again.Next … instead of cutting out panties like I originally planned to do, I put together the double welt pocket tutorial. Best to do that while it was still fresh in my mind. You can go to it now directly here, or later you can find it by clicking Sewing & Pattern Tips in the upper right of the sidebar. If you find errors, glaring or otherwise, let me know. Here's a preview of the sample piece. That red edgestitching really makes a statement, no? ;-)Some replies to comments …\"Ack! What do you mean it's always a crap shoot with pants, even with a TNT pattern?\"LOL! I didn't mean that as literally as it came off the fingers. I just mean that changing up fabrics or hem lengths or waist treatments also can introduce that pesky human error element. The basic pattern will fit as long as your body hasn't done a major change since, but you'll always need to tweak something or other.\"Where do you get your pant wt fabric? I too live in FL and am constantly looking for cool, kewl fabrics and your choices fit both.\" Thanks! The fabric for the latest capris came from Lucy's Fabrics, click here to go directly to it while it lasts. It's a blend — 70% Polyester / 25% Rayon / 5% Spandex, sometimes also known as RPL (rayon/poly/Lycra). Some RPLs are great; some aren't. This one is great.\"I love the flower - you should keep it. Did you have to adjust the body of the tee for the wider neckline?\"I probably should've to be technically correct. But I was lazy and didn't. I figured I had already eyeballed the front shape into that curve for the gathering and it wouldn't matter much to attach it to a slightly wider neckband. It worked out fine, I think.* * * * *And finally, thank you everyone for the really nice comments about my blog, poochies, and everything. I've been enjoying myself too.

It was about a billion degrees out there today and the capris were extremely cool and comfortable.

{"title": "Casual Capris, Complete", "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2007", "text": "The capris are done. Nothing much to write home about fashion-wise. But it will be nice to have some ultra casual pants to wear with some of the tees I've made lately. I have another pair of khaki-colored capris but they are hot to wear on walks, so these new capris will fill that void.Here's me with my hand in the pocket. The dogs will key into that move very quickly as it will mean \"treat!\" ;-)Here's the pocket again but it looks slanted because of the weird photo angle (and tummy fluff). I'm including it to show that the pocket doesn't gape and you can only see a slight outline for the pocket bag.Yesterday I tried to get \"fancy\" with the waistband and ended up ripping it completely off. Today I cut a new plain wide casing, sewed it on, coverstitched and inserted the elastic and the pants are finally done. I'm glad because I took what should've been a fast and easy project and really over-complicated it. (Hi Belinda!) But that's what I do sometimes.Next up? Underwear! Tomorrow I'm going to cut out about 5-6 pairs from various knit scraps I've been saving and I'll work on them in dribs and drabs over the coming week around my \"real\" work. I hate assembly-line style sewing but I really want some new undies.By the way … I had a look through most of my sewing books earlier to see how each of them covered double-welt (or bound) pockets. The method I used was only in Palmer/Pletsch books. Specifically, Pants for Real People and Easy, Easier, Easiest Tailoring. I'm guessing it's also in Jackets for Real People but I didn't specifically look. What's so great about this method is that you are not trying to place and sew separate welts/lips and instead, you create them \"on the fly\" after 99% of the stitching has already been done. I'll do a photo-tutorial at some point, but I can't promise when."},
{"title": "The Real Deal", "date": "Friday, June 22, 2007", "text": "Here's the final pocket on the pants front. It looks a little funky right now because the opening is basted shut and, well, this knit just does not want to cooperate in proving I have straight stitching. Trust me. I'm OCD enough that I would rip out and re-do crooked stitching. ;-)I haven't yet finished the pocket bag. I'm going to wait until I have the capris on to decide how deep I want the pocket, depending on where it hits me, etc. It will be an easy \"alteration\" … just a quick run through the serger to chop off the bottom.In an email last night, Belinda gave me a good hint about using a lightweight fusible interfacing so I gave it a try. I think I like the stabilizer better, but only because it's fiddly to draw a straight line on the interfacing. Bulk-wise, it's great. IOW, there is none.A few of you commented about interfacing and fabrics, etc. Let me tell you what I was thinking and why I made the decisions I did.\"Is your knit a pant weight? Using a thinner fabric could also eliminate a lot of bulk. \"\"I also think that if you make the whole pocket out of the double knit it will be thicker, not thinner than if you add the pocket facings to a light weight pocketing. \"Yes, the fabric is pants weight doubleknit. Using a thinner knit fabric would give the pocket a tendency to creep up and/or stretch out. There really isn't excessive bulk with just the two layers of the pants fabric. It was the facings from the original instructions that added unnecessary bulk.Using a thinner woven fabric would mean I'd have to iron my pocket after laundering the pants. Um, no thank you. ;-) I think it would also bunch up because of the friction factor between two different types of fabric.You really need to feel the fabric in real life to know these things.\"Without the interfacing, how will you keep the pocket from stretching out of shape?\"\"I'd think twice, maybe 3 times before I left out the stabilizer in your pocket.\"With the method I used, you outline the pocket hole about 3 times and then I edgestitched it too. That's a lot of \"stay stitching\" so it's not going anywhere. ;-) I'm also not planning on stuffing a bunch of stuff inside the pocket. A few dog treats and maybe a cell phone when I'm out walking or a grocery list while I'm shopping. That's it. These aren't meant to be dress pants so even if it *does* stretch out a little over time, I'm OK with it. The pocket will be covered up by a shirt anyway. But, really, I don't think it would stretch even if I didn't use the fusible, which I used only because you need to draw out the template on *something* and I wanted to try Belinda's suggestion. Two birds/one stone, etc.So now that the pocket is done, maybe I can finish these pants tonight. I only have the waistband and finishing the leg bottoms to go.Here's the finished sample welt pocket. You can see the pocket bag sticking out at the bottom. The second photo below shows a peek inside the pocket. The stitching is actually straight but the knit has a slight texture that creates hills and valleys.I took photos during the construction process but now that I've finished this one, I've decided I'm going to change a few things for the final pocket. Yes, there will be a final welt pocket for the capris.I used the welt pocket instructions in Pants for Real People. Not only is this a great book for pants fitting, but there's also a lot of good pants construction information toward the back, including easy and well-illustrated instructions for different types of welt pockets. I followed along step-by-step for my sample but for my final pants, I do need to change a couple of steps.The first step in PFRP is to sew strips of fabric onto the pocket bag piece. (Highlighted in yellow for clarity in the photo below.) This is because it's assumed you will use a fabric other than the main fashion fabric for the pocket bag. For my front pocket, it means additional layers and bulk that aren't necessary since I'm 99% certain I'm going to use the same knit for the pocket and welts as I'm using for the pants.The instructions also have you create a \"stitching template\" on non-woven interfacing. I think for the real pocket, I'm going to use washaway stabilizer and eliminate yet another layer. The knit is sturdy enough, has great recovery, and I won't be loading a lot of stuff into the pocket.Finally, I'm going to trim the backside of the welts close to the stitching to remove even more extra fabric. The knit won't ravel and there is enough stitching and overstitching that nothing is going to move anyway.The only other changes I'm planning are for size. I want the width of the pocket to be a little bit bigger. It's about 4 inches wide now. I think 5 will be easier to get my hand in and out. I'm also going to make the pocket bag about 2 inches deeper than the PFRP measurements given since mine is for a front, not a back, pocket.I'll take more photos as I make the final pocket tomorrow."},

Difficult pockets versus no brainer pockets? Getting the idea? LOL!!! Just put normal pockets in and stop over thinking!! ;-)\"That's an excerpt from Belinda's comment to yesterday's post. Do I smell a challenge?? ;-)But seriously, I don't think welt pockets are difficult. Granted, I've only made them a few times and I have to follow step-by-step instructions, but I didn't have any problems. (Just jinxed myself, didn't I?) But even before Belinda's comment, I decided to at least test the pocket in scraps from the pants fabric (which BTW is a doubleknit that I think will support a welt pocket just fine). So the test is what's currently in progress. I have all my pieces cut and I've started assembly.But I've got to leave in about 20 minutes to drop off DS#2 for camp and then I'm heading to the dog park to wear out the pooches so I can have a very peaceful afternoon of sewing. I'll take pics as I do the test pocket, which might turn into a photo-tutorial if all goes well. If not, the pics will document my goof-ups. ;-)"},
{"title": "Capris & Camp Prep", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2007", "text": "I've made some progress on the new capris. I cut them out and started sewing yesterday. The \"fly\" (not really a fly) is sewn and topstitched, as are the sideseams. I've basted the center back and inseams for a quick try-on and things are looking good. (Whew! It's always a crap shoot with pants. Even with a TNT pattern.) I still have to decide what exactly I want to do for a waistband though, as these are knit and my plan is for pull-on without a pull-on look. Not that anyone will ever see the waistband of these pants, so why the heck am I overthinking this anyway? I also need to decide about pockets. I *need* pockets on dog walks (treats, etc.). These capris won't have front scoop pockets but I'm thinking maybe one front welt pocket would do the trick.But the capris are on hold until later this evening or tomorrow as I do laundry and various errands in preparation for DS#2 taking off for a week of wrestling camp in Georgia, starting tomorrow. They're not really camping, as in The Woods. They are staying in dorms at the State University.One of the things I've been doing today is getting DS#2's ipod stuff loaded onto my computer. Poor kid has been without \"new\" portable music since we moved into the Money Pit. I've yet to set the boys' computer up anywhere and that's where all the ipod software was. But during the dining room remodel, I found the box with the ipod software and told him I would load it on one of the other computers in the interim. Unfortunately, I made a bad decision during the install and he lost all the music that was already on the ipod. Oops. But we spent some time copying some tracks from favorite CDs so he's set for the week. When he gets back, I'll teach him how to do that himself and then he can load whatever he wants. (I really don't know how I ended up with the only 2 teenagers in the world who aren't computer saavy.)Since I was doing the istuff ;-) and got itunes updated, etc., I finally subscribed and listened to a couple of Lori's Sew Forth podcasts. Cool stuff, Lori, and you sound NOTHING like I was imagining! When DS comes back home with the ipod, I think I'll be borrowing it for sewing time. If I can stand those ear buds long enough. In the meantime, I'll listen from the desktop speakers.Now I'm off to the grocery store for a week's worth of non-perishable snacks, travel size toiletries and other miscellaneous \"camping\" stuff. It's going to be very quiet around here with DS#2 gone and DS#1 working full-time."},
{"title": "Tee Time", "date": "Tuesday, June 19, 2007", "text": "I finished this tee tonight. As you can see, I went with plain sleeves. That was mostly because of laziness. ;-) These are just faster to sew.I'm on a roll because every tee I've made in the last couple of weeks has become my new favorite. It's so nice to have a choice of new tees/outfits to wear for summer. It also means that it's time to start weeding old stuff out of the closet and drawers.I tried a little raw edge \"embellishment\" for this one. I rough cut 3 of the brown outline flower motifs from the fabric scraps and then zigzagged around the outline, stretching a little for a curly effect, and then trimmed the excess. I attached them together with a circle satin stitch pictogram on my machine. For now, the flower is just safety-pinned to the top to see (a) how much I really like it and (b) how it will do through the laundry. If I decide to keep it, I'll attach it more permanently with a few handstitches.I also reshaped the neckband just a little. I made it a little wider so it would be more open on my upper chest. The new pattern piece is on top in the pic below.Speaking of new outfits (which I was earlier if you scroll up), I've decided once and for all that I'll never be able to do a SWAP. I buy fabric for and sew outfits, not wardrobes. I love seeing the SWAPs and storyboards everyone else puts together during contests and just good planning, but I'm much too fickle to be tied to one color scheme with everything coordinating. The brown I've been sewing lately is about as close as I get. I do tend to pick the same color families but I still don't really have a true mix and match wardrobe. Just lots of outfits in greens, turquoises, and now corals and browns.Tomorrow (or is that later today?), I'll work on altering the pattern and cutting out the fabric for the capris that are next up … so I can finish this new outfit. ;-)"},

I think I'll do basic short sleeves this time instead of the shaped, gathered hem band. I may change my mind on the sleeves, though, since I do like them a lot. I'll be using this fabric for the body, and a solid brown for the neckband.For the capris, I'm going to rework my TNT fly-front Simplicity pattern (4068) into a pull-on pattern with a faux fly and side pockets. This is the same pattern for the coral capris you see me wearing with my latest Ottobre Woman tee with the lime green neckband. (Speaking of which, thank you everyone for all the nice comments on that!) For the capris, I'll be using this beefy doubleknit from Lucy's Fabrics:I'm all about getting summer clothes made quickly right now, so you'll be seeing mostly TNT patterns for a while as I (try to) whittle down the stash piles. But I am easily tempted so I'm sure a new pattern or two will make an appearance. I've already tagged some cute skirt patterns from some European pattern magazines.* * * * *Now, onto some answers to comments recently received (grab a cuppa, I didn't realize I had so many to answer):About the Jalie 2681 skirt, \"Could you make this pattern into a full length skirt? If you think it would work I would HAVE to go buy me a pattern!!\"Yes, that would be an easy change. Just slash the gore piece and add length. Voila!\"Do you cut your gores out on folded fabric? If so, I found it helped me if I take what I've cut directly over to the serger without separateing them.\"Yes, I did cut on folded fabric, but I just had a brain freeze that day. ;-)\"I was wondering, what is the name of the cutting board (with the grids) on your sewing table?\"I don't know the exact brand as it wasn't marked. But it's the cutting mat that Joann's sells. It fits the cutting table also sold there and is pretty reasonably priced when you use a coupon. I've been using it a while now and it's holding up great.\"I was looking at that New Look pattern you were considering that had the tops with the Duroesque shape. Is it true that there aren't ties in the back on those tops? … I wonder if it would pull a little bit in the back where the midriff band in the front crossed the seam there.\"Correct, no ties in the back. It might pull as you mention, but it shouldn't if it fits well.\"I have an alteration question. It appears that we both have the same body shape and need to adjust patterns. I get BWF and like some of the patterns but they are too small, Do you ever grade these patterns up (or maybe you don't need to do this)? Do you use your software for this or do you do slide and pivot--or just what?\"If the pattern is simple, I would probably copy it with my software or morph the style elements I like onto a TNT pattern that I know fits. Otherwise, I have graded up using the method described in a past Threads article, where you increase around the pattern the same amount as what's between one size and another. As WOF are multi-sized, it's easy to see how and where one size increases/decreases from the next.\"Where and how do you get Octobre Woman? Do you also sew from World of Fashion?\"First, yes I sew from WOF. It's one of my favorite pattern sources. You can purchase a single copy and/or subscribe to OW directly from the Ottobre website (click here). Click on \"English\" at the left for the English version of the site.

Just to be clear, the latest tee with the lime neckband is NOT a binding applied with the coverstitch machine, although I did topstitch it with the CS after it was sewn on. To answer the question … I leave one shoulder seam unsewn, apply the binding with one of the binders, and then sew/serge the other shoulder seam. If you look at your RTW tees, you'll see that most of them are done this same way."},
{"title": "Who's Been  Drinking From MY Bowl?", "date": "Saturday, June 16, 2007", "text": "Along with the three dogs, we also have a cat. Right before I took this pic this morning, I heard him scratching at the door from the garage to the kitchen. I let him in and he went over to the dog bowls as usual. Dani had followed me and is still fascinated by this creature who basically ignores her no matter how much she tries to beg for a new playmate.Gizmo stays mainly outside by his own choice. Over the years, we've tried to get him to stay inside but he's 15 and by now quite set in his independent ways. We adopted him from a local horse ranch as a tiny kitten and I think his outdoors and barn roots were stronger than any bribes we offered. He doesn't stray far from the house and he'll come in to steal the dogs' water (see photo) or to \"shortcut\" from the garage to the back yard.He's even gone on walks with us. Yep. He follows at a typical cat distance of about 15 yards and if you turn to look at him, he pretends he thought of the walk by himself as if to say, \"What are YOU doing on MY walk.\" It's really quite funny. Except for the time we took the dogs (then only two of them) across the street and into a nearby neighborhood for a night time walk. When we had circled that neighborhood and were back at the entrance waiting for traffic to clear so we could cross back over to our side, there was Gizmo waiting for us at the entrance. Yep, unbeknownst to us, he had followed us down our long, dark driveway, and across the street to that neighborhood.Dani eventually gave up hope that Gizmo would play with her and went and bothered Chili instead.Edited to add link to review here.Edited to add photo of me in tee (and coral capris wrinkly from wearing all day) below.Another now-TNT Ottobre Woman tee. This went together very easily, and I love it! I'm so glad I kept the green contrast because I really like how it looks. I'll write up more blog details and a review tomorrow sometime, but for now I'm off to bed. Last night partying with my uncle and his wife (my aunt, I suppose, but she's my age, so I don't really think of her as my aunt) has caught up with me. Zzzzzzzzzz …"},

And it was full. Of this:There are a few pieces in this mix that aren't part of that order and have been temporarily \"stored\" here awaiting their turn at prewashing, but most of the pile did arrive today. All of the solids are great — either rayon/Lycra or cotton/Lycra knits. If I can get them made up soon I'll be living in them this summer. (The key here for me to remember is TNT!) There is one knit print I'm not thrilled with, so it will go to the knit \"muslin\" stack. Or maybe I'll take fabric.com up on their satisfaction guarantee and free return shipping.Over the weekend as I do laundry, most of these will be prewashed. Then I'll need to find room in the stash closet to put them. As long as I can still fit my fabric in the closet and not expand elsewhere, I feel OK. But I think I'm at the critical mass point now.Speaking of fabric, a few readers asked about the fabric I'm using for my next top. It came from Ebay so it's a one-shot deal. Sorry.Now I'm off to the sewing room for a few hours to hopefully finish the Ottobre Woman tee I started yesterday."},

It was my uncle from Viriginia (who is only 7 years older than me so we're very close) telling me he and his wife are in Tampa and are coming by tomorrow (today). He's very spur-of-the-moment like that so when I saw the Caller ID, I just knew he was in town and was already mentally preparing my to-do list.Sewing is on hold while we do a mad-dash vacuum/dust and a trip to the grocery store so we can offer some drinks and snacks before we go out to dinner. Plus, I have to wear out the dogs today so they'll behave while we're out.What you see in the pic is Pattern #5 from Ottobre Woman 02/2007. I've been waffling about the neckband fabric. First, the pattern calls for a satin woven. Nope. Not happening here.Next, I want to wear this top with my coral capris, but I don't really want to be orange from head to toe. Plus, the solid coral fabrics I have are not quite the right shade anyway. There is light lime green in the print of this fabric and I've cut the bodice so the greens are close to the neckband. I think it will have an \"unexpected\" look but that it will look nice.On the other hand, I have an order with some solids arriving from Fabric.com tomorrow. I wonder if I should wait and see if one of those will look better?In the meantime, I'm off to do some errands so the top will just sit and percolate a while longer anyway."},
{"title": "Another One for the TNT Column", "date": "Wednesday, June 13, 2007", "text": "OK, one more edit if you can stand it. I just threw on the brown skirt earlier for the pic below because I thought it would look better than my floral PJ pants. When I really got dressed for the day, I decided to pair the new tee with these khaki capris. DH was still home when I came downstairs and commented that he liked the new tee and the way the tee and the capris \"matched.\" He then asked if I made the pants.??? Men! Yes, it's nice he does notice. But nearly 6 months later?? ROFL! It's not like I haven't been wearing these capris at least once every 10 days or so. This just cracked me up.Edited to add a photo of me wearing the now hemmed top, and a link to the review, here.* * * * *A huge shout-out to Angie for trying this pattern w/o alterations and then modeling it for her review. It's definitely a winner and likely would've languished in the pattern stash indefinitely without Angie trying it first.This is the Puffy Sleeve Tee (pattern #4 in the 02/07 issue of Ottobre Woman). Obviously, I have a thing right now for gathered sleeves. I stuffed them for this photo but the elastic needs a trip through the washer/dryer to spring back into shape after being stretched out by the serger.I made this with no FBA and it fits great. Once I get a pic of me in the top, you'll see. I traced a straight 48 through the upper body, tapering to the 52 at the hips. The only fit alteration I made was my usual for square shoulders. I did not need to narrow the shoulders or raise the armholes, which are alterations I almost always need to do. Before cutting the fabric, I laid my TNT tee over the Ottobre pattern tracing and they were close so I decided to try it without alterations like Angie did. Success!I used my coverstitcher binder for the neckline binding and applied the sleeve hem elastic like you'd do for an attached elastic turn-down waist, then coverstitched from the right side instead of following the pattern instructions for those elements. The tee length is about 1-2 inches too long and still needs to be hemmed. I'll do that tomorrow.The fabric is another rayon/Lycra knit that's been in the stash a couple of years. As you can see, I'm still on the brown theme. It will go great with my latest brown Jalie skirt."},

And Angie, it's all your fault. ;)Ever since seeing Angie's tee and reading her review of the pattern from the 02/2007 issue of Ottobre Woman, I've been fighting the temptation. It wasn't much of a fight though. I quickly surrendered and have just finished tracing the pattern. I'm going to test it with an aged stash fabric. If it works as well as Angie's, I'll be thrilled and will have a new tee. If it doesn't, I'll have yet another PJ top and then I'll get out one of the TNT patterns.Cross your fingers …"},
{"title": "Tomorrow's Dog Walking Outfit", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2007", "text": "Well, I don't have anywhere else to go so why not? ;-) And, yes, I was being goofy in the middle pose. As Angie pointed out yesterday, it's a bit weird taking photos of oneself in the mirror while juggling camera, dodging dogs playing tug-o-war with fabric scraps they steal from my trashcan, and trying to stay in the shot (OK, those are my distractions not Angie's) and yet still come up with something I'm willing to park on the internet for the entire world to see. Not that I think the entire world is reading this, but you know what I mean.Here's a close-up of the sleeve. The top of the sleeve is gathered a lot more than the bottom. It makes a nice shape, I think. I like the narrow hem band too. I'll definitely be using this sleeve again.I'm still really digging these skirts. Our summer heat and humidity are finally here for the duration and a Florida girl needs all the updrafts she can get. ;-)Oh, and to Claire … Yes, I agree about the turquoise but I didn't have anything this exact shade. That was part of my analysis paralysis, and I finally decided to just go with the brown.It's mostly done and I think it's going to be a keeper. But I need to get over the \"maternity\" feeling. It's not the top so much as the belly underneath the top. ;-) I still need to hem it (the top, not the belly). When I've got the hem done (after dinner?), I'll take a pic of me in it.I got sidetracked from hemming by fussing with Zillie. I've never been happy with the tummy and hip padding on her so in a fit of frustration on a whim, I took it all off. But the result of that was even worse since my hips haven't been that skinny since I was 8. Or maybe 11. So then I added some padding back. And then I had to adjust the waist/bust depth, which is another thing that's not been quite right for a while. But that still wasn't right. More fiddling. Zillie turned upside down. Loosening, tightening, pulling, pushing. Chasing Dani the Thief  as she raced off dragging a mouthful of batting/padding behind her. All of that and Zillie isn't really any better than when I started, just different now. Sigh. I'd really like a true body double but (a) I don't know if I really want to see it and (b) I'd have to grin and bear DH doing the wrapping. But boy, if I had a true body double, I know I'd be a Draping Queen.Back to the top. There's some things that could be better in a second version that most likely will never get made. I think I'd like the band under the bust to be a little higher. It's higher on me than on Zillie, but not where I thought it would land. The neckline probably could be a little lower. Although at least where it is now it doesn't gape or reveal too much. I like the sleeves though. They are loose enough that they aren't squeezing the flubby arms and shorter than my usual short sleeves so maybe I can get some new tan lines during the daily dog walks. ;-)This is just loosely pinned on the dressform and so the fit proportions are a little off — especially the underbust band which is sitting at waist level here on Zillie. I'm ambivalent about it at this point because I've had to fiddle with things more than I like, but I think I'm going to end up with a wearable top.I hope to get into the sewing room tomorrow to finish it. I still have to sew the lower back, the sleeves, and the sideseams. Then I'll decide on the final length."},

I have all these plans for projects I want to do and then I just can't get my butt into the sewing room. Some initial analysis paralysis set in after taping the pattern together, but I did finally manage to make some decisions on the top and it's cut out and ready to sew. I'm going to work on it for the next few hours.I decided to forego the muslin stage and the good fabric is cut. It's not like I don't have a plethora (I love that word) of replacements waiting in the stash closet if this one doesn't turn out as I'm imagining. I'll be disappointed, but I'll get over it. I also stole a sleeve from Simplicity 3837 (View B, puffy sleeve).While I'm sewing, DH will be doing some dog training. Dani really needs to have \"Come\" more firmly embedded into her cute puppy head. She likes to wander and is easily distracted by squirrels (and Chili).

{"title": "The Pattern", "date": "Friday, June 8, 2007", "text": "I fiddled around with my software today and came up with this pattern. It's printing as I type. Speaking of printing … This is the print screen from Pattern Editor (which is the same screen as all of the Wild Ginger programs). Each grid section represents one letter-sized page. The yellow sections are those I have marked to actually print. Those that aren't yellow will not be printed. I won't waste paper that way. But if you prefer to print the entire grid (in order to assemble all columns/rows and not piece them together as I'll be doing), you can do that too.OK, back to my pattern. I decided to go with the crossover. I'm still undecided on the final length which is why you see 3 different hem marks. I'll cut long and then decide. I'm also undecided about testing it first. My gut is telling me to test instead of cutting the good fabric, so I think I'm now leaning that way. Maybe instead of an unwearable muslin test, I'll look in the stash for something that I'd wear if it turns out but won't cry over if it doesn't.The skirt is done and here it is on Zillie's lumpy hips. (My hips are lumpy too, just not in this particular way.)The \"PD&SD\" in today's title refers to a Personal Drafting & Sewing Day. I don't have any outings planned, except for the usual dog walk around midday. So today I've declared that I will draft and start sewing a top to wear with this newest skirt.I was fooling around with the fabric and some skirt scraps last night, like this:In my mind, I was going for something Duro-esque. I want the contrast neck and underbust bands. I do not want a kimono sleeve, but I do want a short sleeve of some sort. I looked through my pattern collection to see what I could come up with, but of course, out of 3,784 (estimate) patterns, I didn't find The One. After looking at the online catalogs, I came up with this one, New Look 6677, Views D and E.But then I started thinking that maybe something more like, New Look 6515, Views A and B (this one I do own) or Butterick 5031 with a crossover would be more flattering than doubled band right down the center of the mountains.Instead of fiddling with a tissue pattern, I'm going to morph one of my TNT computer patterns into these basic shapes. Most of the work I've already done when creating other patterns.What you see below are the pieces I'll be working with. Those in red are from a previous TNT top. The others are from the stenciled brown tee I made the other day.I'll rotate the bust dart to underbust gathers and then I'll need to decide if I'm keeping the crossover or going full Duro. Either way, I'll morph the stencilled tee neck band onto the front of the bodice and I'll create an underbust band that goes around to the back too. I don't think I'll do a muslin of this pattern since most of the elements will already be TNT. I may kick myself later for that. Oh, and I'll need to figure out what I want for a sleeve. But first, I really should get into the shower and out of my PJs. ;-)"},
{"title": "Beach Day Revisited", "date": "Thursday, June 7, 2007", "text": "It was another fun afternoon at the doggie beach. We even saw some \"old\" friends that were there on Monday. I wish it was just a little bit closer (drivetime-wise) so we could go there more often. It's fun right now, but the drive will get old soon enough.We saw more \"beachy\" sights today, including 3 dolphins jumping in and out of the water as dolphins do. I was very surprised to see them in this little inlet and I couldn't get my camera out fast enough for photos. We also saw other fish jumping and pelicans swooping down to scoop them up for lunch.On the way out, I stopped the car and snapped a photo of the marina side of things. All those boats and no one using them. I couldn't help thinking something was wrong with that equation.This was Chili 5 minutes after we were settled back home.Now for some dinner and to finish up that skirt.This is definitely going to be my Summer of the Skirt. While I love my capris, I also love how girlie and heat friendly skirts are. I wore my new Jalie skirt on Monday to the beach. Tuesday and Wednesday, I wore different skirts and I'm down to the last one I like for today. But, I have another Jalie 2681 in the works.I thought I'd have it done yesterday, but the one-hour skirt turned into a comedy of errors. Mine. First, I sewed a wrong side to a right side. Luckily, I caught that only about 2 inches into the seam and so didn't have to rip the entire overlocked seam. And to think I even had the RS marked with tape. Then, while I had both RS together on another pair of gores, I had one turned top-side down. Sheesh. I gave up for most of the afternoon and took the dogs for a walk. But I did get back to it after dinner and all I have left now is the bottom hem and the waist elastic. I wonder what I'll mess up with those.I'm using a brown poly/cotton knit and I'm triple-stitch coverstitching the seams to give it a denim-y, casual look. I'm planning a top to wear with it from another rayon knit since otherwise the skirt will be an orphan. But as this is also going to be my Summer of Brown, I'm planning still more tops that will match it and other browns soon to be entering the wardrobe.Sewing will have to wait until this afternoon, though. The boys and dogs and I are off to the dog beach again."},
{"title": "Q & A", "date": "Tuesday, June 5, 2007", "text": "While I'm deciding what to start on next (sewing, grocery shopping, laundry, vacuuming???), I'll reply to some more comments …\"How did you do the tilted waist alteration, since this has an elastic waist, may I ask?\" Easy! I slipped on the circle of elastic I use for fitting waists over the skirt, chalk-marked where it hit on the skirt, and then cut off the excess (plus seam allowance) above that mark at the front before attaching the waistband elastic.\"Where'd you get the skirt fabric?\" It's from Lucy's Fabrics. Incidentially, it's also featured in the June 2007 issue of Burda WOF. How cool is that!\"That fabric is really cool, what kind is it?\" It's a rayon/Lycra knit, which is just deee-vine. Great drape, great breathability.\"PMB... can add s/a's... OUCH! (computer shock from keyboard being drooled on)\" Yep, although it's not totally automatic. PMB has a function called \"Offset\" that will offset a seam allowance from the seam line. You can offset seam allowances of differing distances for different areas of the pattern.\"Have you tried the dog beach on Honeymoon Island?\" No. Now I have to go look up where it is! OK, I just did. From what I read, the dogs have to stay on a leash. Is that correct? That won't work for us at a dog park since we like to let them run and run and run.\"Did you add to the width at the hem or did all the perceived fullness come from the added gathers at the neckline?\" (Regarding the brown tee with the stenciled neckband.) Since this was drafted from my TNT tee pattern, I didn't need to add anything anywhere. The fullness you see is from adding at the neckline for the gathers.\"Now I already have stencils and fabric paint in my notions stash … Mmmmm, now how can I corporatize that look?\" I was thinking a button placket on a blouse? Or the hem area of a skirt? Tone-on-tone to keep it subdued for the office?\"As I come from Germany I want to offer you, to ask me if you want something to know about the instructions.\" Thank you Barbara! I will definitely keep your offer in mind if/when I get stuck on something.\"The sizes are the same. Diana is printing the same pattern sheet for everyone.

It's not much of a beach in human terms and is in an ugly location next to a small private airport and marina, across from an industrial park and near the Port of Tampa, but the dogs loved it. Well, 2 out of 3, as you'll see later. ;-)Chili and Dani took to the water like ducks, and made lots of new (giant) friends.They couldn't decide who would bring the ball back to shore so they shared the job.Next, it was Pepper's turn for some swimming. Chili was immediately on the scene to rescue her if required.Dani soon followed, and Alex held them while Pepper flailed … um … swam back to shore.There she goes!Almost there!She was most definitely not thrilled with the whole swimming thing.

I'm going to be wearing this every time it's clean … it's SO comfortable! There will definitely be more of these Jalie skirts made for the summer.I traced, cut, and sewed this skirt in about an hour earlier this evening. Isn't this the prettiest fabric? I have enough left for a top of some sort and probably a pair or two of undies from the leftovers.The skirt is Jalie 2681. It has a total of 2 pieces. One is for the gores, which gets cut 8 times and the other is the flounce, which is cut twice. Fabric requirements are less than 2 yds., even for the largest size. I made View D, because I love flounces and also because I think I look better in skirts that are more fitted through the hips since I certainly don't need to add any additional visual width.I just finished a review on PR. I couldn't believe mine was only the second write-up for this cute and FAST skirt. I'll definitely be making more of these since I love skirts for summer and I love easy patterns even more.Now I'm off to bed. Yes, Peg, I do sleep — about 5 hours per night."},
{"title": "Done With Diana 23-31", "date": "Sunday, June 3, 2007", "text": "I see now that it's hanging crooked on Zillie but the top is done, and I like it. I hemmed it on the long-ish side because the fabric is a rayon knit that will likely shrink some more in the laundry. If not, I'll have to re-hem it later. Like that will happen.Here's the back neckline:I'll take pics with me wearing it and write a review soon. I just looked and I haven't \"officially\" reviewed a pattern since March. I didn't realize it had been that long.Next I'm going to give Jalie 2681 a try.We got back from our trip to the dog park and I was all set to hide away in the sewing room for a couple of hours to work on my top. Until I realized I was completely out of brown thread. How did that happen? So no sewing until a trip to Joann's to restock.I figured I might as well take a quick thread inventory before leaving to make the gas expenditure worth the trip. (That's my excuse and I'm stickin' with it!) I restocked a few shades of brown thread and some other colors, and even found some mini cones of Gutermann upholstery thread for future topstitching. (Using this thread is Belinda's great hint, BTW.)Then, because the store was relatively quiet and I didn't have a time limit, I decided to wander around to look at the sections I usually never even go near. At the back of my mind was looking through the stencils and paint to see what I could come up with without spending another $30. Stenciling some fabric has been at the back of my mind ever since Belinda showed me this tee shirt she stenciled a couple of Aussie summers ago. And then Beth brought the stenciling bug to the front of my brain with her recent hat and dress projects.Is it only me, or does anyone else remember when stenciling was more popular and those little bottles of acrylic paint were front and center? At \"my\" Joann's, the stencils and paints are now at the very far, far, far corner of the store. I really had to hunt to find them. The collection of stencils is pitiful and it looks like they're about to be cleared out completely as nearly every one was marked way down with a clearance sticker. Good for me today, though, as I was able to find a few stencils that would work, a couple of cheapie stenciling sponge brushes/daubers, and paint — all for under $8. (I'm also wondering what I ever did with the stencils/brushes I used to have. Did I toss them, or are they still hidden in an unpacked box somewhere? Hmmm.)Here's some of what I bought:And here's the top in progress:I've stenciled the front and back neckbands in a haphazard, random \"pattern.\" I don't think I'll do the sleeve bands because I really don't need extra attention at my flabby biceps. But I reserve the right to change my mind tomorrow. The paint is metallic brown with fabric medium mixed in. It's not nearly so shiny as shows in this photo, but the flash reflected and made the paint stand out really bright.Because I had to first play, test the stencil on scraps and then wait for the final stenciling to dry, I haven't made a whole lot of progress. (Yeah, tell us something new Debbie!) This is just the front piece pinned to Zillie. I have to thread up the serger in brown thread to neaten up the inside before I move on but I was too lazy to do that tonight so I stopped and headed for the computer. But so far I'm loving the top with a vee instead of scoop neck. I like how the gathers are radiating in a flattering-to-me shape and they really add some nice bust shaping. Too bad you can't see this top in 3D. It looks like it has boobs with no boobs yet inside. ;-) I'm also half-wishing I wore sleeveless tops because I think this would also look great as is.Speaking of the gathers, this photo is for you Bev. ;-)After I pulled threads for the gathering, I fused a narrow self-cut strip of black interfacing onto the seam allowance to keep the gathers tight until I could attach the neckband. I tried the Design Plus fusible stay tape first, but it isn't meant to fuse permanently and didn't hold the gathers in place as I started fiddling to pin the neckband into place. Most of the interfacing will be cut off when I serge the edges tomorrow so no worries about extra bulk. Tonight the inside is messy and the gathering threads are hanging out all over the place.Before I go, one more comment about a comment. Someone asked, \"I am wondering if that neckline curve should be concave instead of convex, just a bit, following the natural line of the body.\" After the gathering is pulled tight and attached to the neckband, the shape does turn into what you'd expect for the neckband (concave, so to speak). I'm sure there's a great technical explanation for curving out the seam allowance where it is to be gathered and maybe I'll even be able to think of it when it's not 4 a.m., but the main reason I do it is simply because that's just how I've seen it done in patterns and patternmaking books and it made sense to me.Now I'm off to bed.

{"title": "Morphing Along", "date": "Saturday, June 2, 2007", "text": "The Tropical Storm (Barry) in the Gulf has been dumping rain on us since yesterday morning, and it's turned me into a slug. I seem to be moving at half pace. Unlike Carolyn, who is on vacation from work and has been churning out the outfits at 10 times my normal speed.I did manage to tape my pattern together, cut it out and then cut out my fabric so that's some progress. While taping the pattern sheets together, I decided I didn't like the scale of my sleeve inset as well as the original, and then I compared the armhole seamline lengths between the two. Very, very close. So I made the executive decision to toss mine and use the original pieces. This sleeve detail is the reason I liked the pattern after all, so this makes perfect sense, right?The muslin sleeve felt a little tight so I added about 5/8\" more width to the pattern and I've decided to leave out the interfacing in the band, which at the time I wasn't sure was called for or not in the instructions since they're in German and all I had to go by was the sketch ... which could've been indicating wrong side or interfacing. I did recognize \"Vilieseline\" as interfacing in the instructions so I decided to interface the shaded areas of the layout since I had no real idea what was being instructed. It was Guess Your Best and I guessed wrong. ;-)Since then, Katharine very kindly translated her French version of the instructions into English for me. I see a few discrepancies between what I did and the instructions, but nothing extremely glaring. And I also see the sizes Katharine lists are different than the German version. Katherine's copy lists the sizes as 40/42, 44/46, 48/50 and my German copy lists them as 38/40, 42/44, 46/48. Interesting. Katherine also confirmed the dart for me. Apparently it is added to just the largest size for additional shaping, which tells me that I was correct when I decided the larger sizes are drafted for a larger bra cup size too. That's a Good Thing for me. And she confirmed the back facing piece. I still haven't gone back to figure out whether I traced it wrong or the pieces just don't match. The pattern sheet is folded back up and my table isn't clear enough yet to get it back out.Here's a comparison of the Diana pattern laid over my TNT software pattern. The Diana pattern is wider at the shoulders and upper chest, which I knew from my muslin. As I was expecting, the Diana is also narrower at the hips and waist. The Diana armhole is a lower than my pattern, especially at the back. I like high armholes, which is one reason I always seem to crawl back to my TNT pattern. It just plain fits the way I like and it's just not that hard to morph elements from other patterns onto or into it. The overall lengths between the two patterns are about equal, but since I always cut with lots of extra just-in-case length, my pattern looks a lot longer. In reality, I cut most of that off when cutting my fabric.This is the original Diana sleeve and band after I added width, and my new neckband pieces.The sun is starting to peek out so we're off to the dog park for a while to burn off some of the energy of 3 dogs mostly cooped up inside for a couple of days. I'm hoping to get back into the sewing room later this afternoon to start sewing this new tee.BTW, I made lasagne for dinner last night and found out that leftover uncooked pieces of the lasagne pasta make really great crunchy dog treats. They LOVE that stuff!"},
{"title": "Plan B", "date": "Friday, June 1, 2007", "text": "Living here in Florida, I never check the weather. It rarely changes. But today, it's gray and the forecast is for actual rain. A good thing environmentally since we're in a severe drought but a bad thing for a beach dog park afternoon. So we're putting that outing off for a day or two and I spent the morning fiddling with my TNT tee pattern to come up with a vee-neck version of the Diana Mode top.First, I offset a neckband from the front pattern neckline (1) and then cut it away from the pattern (2). Next, I slashed/spread at the neckband seam to create extra fabric for gathers. The pivot point is at the small pink circle in (3). I trued the seamlines (4) and added seam allowances (5).The sleeve was next. I created the bottom band shape (6) and cut it away from the main sleeve shape (7). I then slashed/spread along 3 pivot points. The shape of my final main sleeve piece is different from the original pattern, but I'm pretty sure it will work out exactly the same.I added seam allowances to the remaining pieces and printed out my pattern.I'm heading up to the sewing room to tape the printout together and decide on a fabric to use. After that, we'll head to the local dog park because \"the kids\" really need to run off some energy.I want to try to get into the sewing room for a bit this morning before the day explodes so this will be short and sweet. I never did make it in there last night.A big thank you to Vicky for mentioning bromeliads. Yep, I agree that these plants have got to be those. I so do NOT have a green thumb and had never even heard of bromeliads before so this was both helpful and educational as I read up on them. Of course, I have heard of pineapples and spanish moss, just not the whole group they belong to. I couldn't find any photos that perfectly matched what we have, but some were very close. Maybe we have one of those yet-undiscovered varieties. ;-)Dani is doing much better today and we both had an uninterrupted full night's sleep last night. The vet tested for and ruled out Parvo (whew! my heart sunk when she first mentioned it) and is now just treating the symptoms, thinking it's a bug she picked up about the time she came to live with us. We came home with 3 vials of meds and will also keep her (and the other 2) on a very bland diet for the next few days. If she continues to feel well, we're going to try to get to a new-to-us dog park at the beach this afternoon, schedules permitting. If not today, then definitely sometime over the weekend.Also on the weekend agenda is to gather and stage stuff for a yard sale to be held very soon. After unpacking things that have been in boxes for 18 months, I decided there was plenty of stuff I could now live without and too much to just toss. I haven't done a yard sale in many years, but I clearly remember what I'm getting myself into. I'll just look forward to a little extra cash to cover those unexpected vet bills and try not to think about the negatives.Since the boys are out of school, every weekend from now until the end of August can be a long weekend if I'm not ready to stop playing. I love that about summer."},
{"title": "Nature Strikes", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2007", "text": "DH cleared a path a while ago from our property to the vacant property behind us, which is what I cut through every day when I walk the dogs on the goat road. This is how I usually see these plants.But over the weekend, I noticed some were turning bright red in the middle, and one was especially magnificant, with a huge bloom in its center.On today's walk, those you see with red centers in this photo all now have the blooms too.I'm not really sure what these plants are. I believe they are some type of Century plant/agave. If they are, the plants will die after the blooms. But for now, they're gorgeous to see at the beginning and end of my daily walks. The photos can all be clicked on to see bigger versions.I haven't been back to my sewing room since I showed the test muslin for the Diana Mode tee. I've been busy working on icky paperwork and taking care of the poochies.The dogs are exhausting me because Dani isn't feeling well and I've had a lot of top and bottom end cleaning up to do. Last night she was a very sick little girl at both ends and I spent most of the night half-awake with her snuggled very close to me (her choice) and ready to jump up and aim her toward papers and towels when needed. We're off to the vet again this afternoon. She was there on Tuesday for a tapeworm treatment. I'm pretty sure what's going on now is something else.But she's feeling much better today. Good enough to go tearing off into the neighbor's yard with Chili, and then me chasing them. Twice. And of course the telephone rings at that exact moment with a call I'd been waiting for. Did I mention the neighbor is a very nice elderly lady who tries to be patient with my pooches but she's really a cat person. I think fencing in part of the property is in our future. It's been one of those days.The paperwork is mostly done but I'm going to abandon the remainder for the evening and hide out in the sewing room, if I can get a volunteer for Poop Patrol. Anyone?? ;-)"},
{"title": "Answering Some Comments", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2007", "text": "Some paperwork and other not-fun stuff is calling my name which means there won't be any sewing going on here for the next 2-3 days. So, I thought I'd make this post a response to some comments. After that, it might be doggie pics again. ;-)1. \"The neckline is also too wide for you.\" The neckline itself really isn't too wide fit-wise, but because the shoulders are, the sleeves droop down and pull the neckline out of place. Plus, I need to adjust for square shoulders too, and that will help the back neckline which is also affecting how the front neckline sits. And finally, when I'm holding a camera in the air, the neckline shifts so the pics aren't exactly representative of what things look like without a camera in hand. All of this to say, really, it isn't quite what it appears.2. \"Would you mind explaining just where/how you would put that fusible tape to keep the gathers in place?\" I haven't quite fully thought this out yet. When/if I do, I'll take pics. But I'm thinking I'd fuse the tape just over the stitching line, with most of it in the seam allowance, or something like that.3. \"I think the sleeve cap should also have some gathers to balance the cuff gathers.\" Hmm. No. ;-) I like the style of the sleeve as it is, and with double gathers I think I'll end up looking like a linebacker.4. \"I've been looking at Ottobre 2/07 Top #5.\" I like that top too, and it may make it to the top of my list. I'm not sure, though, that I want to start from scratch again yet. I'm more inclined to take my TNT pattern and morph it into a vee-necked version of this Diana Mode tee, if I decide to do a vee'd version.5. \"I have this issue at home and in Dutch, which I can read. Want me to have a look for a second opinion on that back facing?\" Katharine, that would be great if you have the time. I'm just wondering if there are instructions for what to do with the mark on the pattern, and also curious if the bust dart is mentioned at all?6. \"I will introduce myself and stop lurking, cause I'm hooked on Debbie and her doggers, so I'm always checkin' in.\" Thanks for de-lurking Laceflower! And thank you for the nice comments (that goes for everyone too).7. \"I've never heard of Diana Mode #23. Is this a magazine? Where can it be seen/found?\" DM is a German sewing magazine, like Burda. I believe it's also printed in other European languages, but not English. But that's about all I know. I buy copies on Ebay when I find them.8. \"Can you take a picture of what the sleeve pattern looks like?\" Here you go:9. \"And I thought my daughter was unique by buying a $10 plastic pool for the Chihuahuas.\" LOL! We probably would never have thought about a little doggie pool except there are many at the dog park and Dani and Chili *love* them. They're cheaper here in FL though — $7.99 at Petsmart. ;-)"},
{"title": "Ho Hum", "date": "Monday, May 28, 2007", "text": "The jury is still out. There are some fit issues at the shoulders and back neckline, and the armhole is a little too low for my preference, which are contributing to my indifference about this top. But I'm also thinking the gathered sleeve is maybe not such a good look for my arms. I don't know. I still like the sleeves, in theory. Maybe when the shoulders are narrowed so the sleeve head hangs where it's supposed to and a little more width is added to the bicep/band, I'll like it more.I'm also indifferent about the scoop neckline, which you can't see on me very well in the pics below since I'm wrestling a camera with one arm (the gathers really do hang symmetrically when my arms aren't up in the air). I wonder how much trouble it would be to draft a vee neckline instead of this one. I think it would be easy enough to do in my Pattern Editor software, so maybe what I need to do is start with my TNT tee and copy the sleeves since otherwise there's nothing extraordinary about this top compared to my TNT tee.One thing I know for sure, don't use a knit with poor recovery for a final version. It's really a bugger to keep the gathers from stretching out flat. With \"real\" fabric, I would stabilize the gathered areas with some Design Plus fusible tape."},
{"title": "Slow Sunday Sewing", "date": "Sunday, May 27, 2007", "text": "Not a whole lot of progress on the muslin for the Diana Mode top, but that's OK. A slow day feels very good.So here's where I am — neckband attached to bodice front, neck facing to bodice back and shoulder seams together. After dinner, I'll tackle the sleeves.One oddity while tracing the pattern was a surprise bust dart. Nowhere on the line drawing or in the photos did I see a bust dart. In my world, it's a teeny-tiny dart so for the muslin I'm just going to ease in the excess when I sew the sideseams. Another glitch was the back neck facing. The pattern piece is partially marked for what I thought was a facing to be created from that mark (and I still think it is). But now I'm not sure if drew it correctly or if I was supposed to add seam allowances at the back neck edges or whatEVER because it didn't fit on the neckline as I was expecting. (Normally, I'd eliminate such a facing altogether, but I think it will look good edgestitched and topstitched down with the same spacing as the front neckband.) I'm glad I'm doing the test sew because it lets me figure out these things as I go without worrying about wasting the good fabric. Another option is a crash course in sewing German but that isn't likely to happen.As for fit, so far so good. I traced a 46/48 (that's the actual size, not an \"in between\" tracing) and I'm sewing it exactly as traced with no alterations so I can see how Diana Mode patterns are drafted compared to how I'm drafted. ;-) I can see that I will need to add at the hip for a different fabric but this cotton rib has more than enough stretch to compensate for this tester top. The bust looks pretty good too, but I'll reserve final judgment for when I put it on my actual body and not Zillie's. It does seem like this pattern is drafted for a cup size larger than B, and maybe even larger than a C. Does anyone more familiar with this line of patterns know?(Hmmm. Two posts in a row completely about sewing and nary a mention of dogs or remodeling. Oh. Oops.)"},
{"title": "Did I Say TNT?", "date": "Saturday, May 26, 2007", "text": "Hah! I'm so fickle when it comes to patterns. But I am going to stay true to a simpler-style tee as the next make. Just not so simple as to be plain.I've been liking all the interpretations I've been seeing made up of Simplicity 4076, View B (below). This pattern was so very close to the top of my To Do list.But then, after a leisurely evening of perusing my latest pattern and magazine acquisitions, I saw a tee pattern in Diana Mode #23 which caught my eye even more. It also has a gathered scoop neck, but the neckband is wider and shaped. And I love the pieced and gathered sleeve detail.It would be great for the summer wardrobe to have this top in 2-3 different colors (and my stash will definitely support that plan), but for now I'm going to concentrate on a knit \"muslin\" which can maybe double as PJ top so I can test the fit. I'm guessing that for an out-of-house version, I'll need to do an FBA, increase the hip and bicep width, and maybe lower the neckline a little but maybe not because it may not lay flat once it encounters the 3D terrain. ;) From my centimeter-to-inches conversion of the Diana sizing chart, it seems that these patterns are drafted for a slightly shorter height and center back length than Burda so I may not need to adjust shoulder-to-waist length. The muslin will shed more light, so that's what I'm off to do now."},

{"title": "Hopefully Soon To Be Sewing", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2007", "text": "Things are starting to calm down around here and I can start to think about what's next on the sewing horizon.Our guests left Monday evening, new pooch Dani is settling in quite nicely, and DS#2's last day of school is tomorrow. I just finished putting the final touches on our real world job stuff and now there's only a couple of things I need to finish up before I can lose myself for a few days in the sewing room. Tonight, I'll curl up on the bed with patterns and magazines and try to whittle the want-to-make list into 2 or 3 priorities. However, I really need some simple tees since mine get worn a lot here in Florida and last year's makes are starting to look like last year's makes. ;-) I'll probably pull out a TNT pattern or two for those. I also need new underwear, but the thought of that project isn't thrilling me this week so I'll put that off for a little while longer. And finally, there's a pair of DH's pants to be hemmed and also finishing the armholes and rehemming my graduation dress. I don't like things hanging over my head, so to speak, so I'll probably start with those just to have a clean slate. Thank you everyone for the supportive comments about our new family member. I'm a sucker for furry beasts and I'd probably have 10 times as many if it were financially and otherwise feasible. But it's still rewarding to be able to save one at a time when we can. It's amazing how quickly a pet becomes a family member and you can't imagine a day without them. It's also amazing how LOUD two dogs running around the house for a game of canine tag can be. Pepper is doing her best to stay off the racetrack. ;-) But she obviously isn't minding too much."},
{"title": "3 Dog Night", "date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2007", "text": "It's official. We're now a 3-dog family. Like that was any big surprise, right? ;-)A visit to the vet this afternoon let us know she was not micro-chipped and is free from heartworms and intestinal worms, although they gave her a dose of dewormer for good measure. As far as they could tell without x-rays, she's also \"free\" from puppies so her round belly is hopefully just a puppy belly. She's now had her shots and is \"legal.\" The vet estimated her to be between 6 months and 1 year old. She was so well-behaved and sweet at the vet's office, even when they were drawing blood and sticking things in places that didn't thrill her. We'll take her back next month to be spayed, after she's settled in here a little more.We had been tossing around various names, some of which were suggested in the comments, but keeping it light until after the vet pronounced her healthy. The boys really wanted to stay with the Red Hot Chili Peppers theme they have going, but \"Red Hot\" or \"Red\" just didn't fit despite how much we wanted them to. I came up with \"Dani\" (after the RHCP song \"Dani California\") and we all liked it. So, Dani California is her full name but we'll call her Dani. Thank you everyone for all the suggestions. We truly considered them all.BTW, for those who weren't sure, Dani is the black/white pup on the left in the photo from the previous entry.The excitement just never stops around here. ;-) Yesterday, DH drove DS#2 to school — since his usual driver has now graduated and, well, we've never figured out the correct bus or times since we moved to this house. On the way back, DH was supposed to stop for milk. On the way to school, DH saw a small black and white dog weaving in and out of the traffic on the small country roads. He felt really bad for the dog but continued on to drop DS at school. On the return trip, he saw her again as he was pulling into the corner store for the milk. When he went to push open the door on his way out of the store, the dog was staring back at him with sad eyes. He scooped up the dog and then asked the group of older men sitting outside at their usual morning coffee drinking table if they knew anything about her. The men told him that a short while earlier they had seen a truck stop and push the dog out of the truck in front of a nearby trailer park. DH decided to bring her home to keep her safe. (I have a personal rant about people who dump animals, but I'll save that for now.)So there we were — me, my mom, and Bob (her \"companion\"), sitting at the table with our own morning beverages and in walks DH. I was expecting him to be carrying a gallon of milk, not a dog! She came with a small collar, but no tags. She was horribly infested with fleas (we bathed and treated her immediately), and she's very sweet. Pepper isn't 100% sure of her yet, but Chili has been enjoying a new, young playmate and they've been racing around the house non-stop. Only on the first floor though, as she is afraid of the stairs and will not go up or down them. I don't know if we'll keep her. I didn't have time yesterday to deal with Animal Services and I don't want to turn her in only to be euthanized if she's not claimed or adopted. Before we go that route, I need to find out if they'll let us take her back if she goes unclaimed.But THREE dogs? (Gaylen, tell me it will be OK!) And this one who will certainly need a couple hundred dollars' worth of vet services, if only to be spayed, probably dewormed, and her belly button hernia taken care of. (Yes, she's got a chick-pea sized protrusion at her navel spot which will need to be fixed.) Who knows what other health issues may be lurking. We don't even know how old she is, although she seems to be young. Will she get bigger? Is her round belly a sign of worms or of an impending litter of more pups? So, does anyone have any suggestions for a name that goes with Chili and Pepper? We can't keep calling her \"new pup\" if we keep her. If. Yeah, right. ;-)"},
{"title": "Details", "date": "Saturday, May 19, 2007", "text": "It's definitely been a whirlwind couple of weeks and it's not quite over yet, but it's calming down and I don't have anymore pressing deadlines so I can start relaxing.My mom arrived Wednesday evening, after a 2-hour delayed flight. I had planned to cut out my dress before leaving for the airport but cleaning and straightening the house took more time than I was planning and with the delayed arrival, a late dinner and some visiting with our guests, I put the cutting off until Thursday morning. I did manage to get both patterns cut before we had to leave the house around noon to do the Team Mom meal duty thing for DS#2's football game that night. He's #78 in the pic below.DS' team won (yay!) and then we had to get back to and wait in our school's parking lot for nearly an hour before DS was released. No sewing that night, which meant I'd have to do it all Friday (the day of DS' graduation). Nothing like a little pressure, eh?But it was easy sewing so I figured I could get it all done by the afternoon. And I did, but not without a couple bumps in the road.The first \"bump\" was that after trying on the nearly complete but unhemmed dress, it was about 6 inches too long. Not because the pattern was too long, but because the fabric hangs heavy and it grew. It's a wonderful rayon knit, but it has slinky-like qualities in drape and stretch. The dress flares at the hem so I couldn't just hem out the extra length. I decided to toss it in the washer/dryer and work on the cardigan and to reevaluate after the laundry cycle. The worst case solution going through my mind would be chopping the dress in half, taking out the length from the middle and then sewing top and bottom back together with a seam that would be hidden by the cardi.Luckily, the dress shrank enough in length in the wash that it was going to be wearable without any surgery. Long, but still wearable. (I'm thinking now that I never did prewash this length of fabric, so I can't ever dry the cardi in the dryer since I hemmed it to the length I want it to always be.) The extra length meant I couldn't wear the lower-heeled shoes I had been planning on but I did buy a Plan B pair last week with a higher heel (about 3\") in case my Zappos-ordered Plan A didn't work out. Boy was I ever thankful for having that choice at the 11th hour.As the night wore on, I could almost feel the dress getting longer. It was growing again after hanging on me. So it's now on the dressform for a few days so it can finish any more growing and then I'll hem it again shorter, sacrificing a bit of the flare. It's a great dress to wear though. Very swishy and comfortable. The rayon knit was perfect for the style, for the warm, humid weather last night and for sitting in the stands for hours watching the ceremony and waiting for the 593 names of the graduating class to be called. I know I'll be wearing this again and again over the summer.The other \"bump\" in the road was that by the time I washed/dried the dress, sewed the top, and then fiddled with length and shoes, I was out of time to finish the dress armholes. No one was going to see them, so I just wore it with the raw edges. I'll turn those under when I do the new hem.The cardi went together without a hitch and turned out great. I had some hand-dyed-by-me foldover elastic left from another project that matched this fabric perfectly. I used it on the neckline edge so that the cardi would have some contrast from the dress underneath and to add some flattering vertical lines. I pressed the elastic in half and then used my coverstitch machine to attach it all in one pass.And now for a few more graduation night photos. The first is of DS and his brothers.Next, DS and his girlfriend.And last, DS and two of his close friends. The young man in the middle also graduated last night but ditched his cap and gown right away.DS looks happy, doesn't he? ;-) I know DH and I are thrilled, and very proud. It's hard to believe this day has come and gone already. It's zipped by fast but the years have all been so fun and enjoyable. I'm a little sad that my first \"baby\" is nearly all grown up, but he won't be leaving the nest quite yet. DS will continue working full-time at The Cheesecake Factory (restaurant) over the summer and will then drop to part-time when he starts community college in the fall to train to be a fireman/paramedic. A new chapter begins.Whew! It's been a busy last few days, but my mom and her sweetie arrived, the dress got made (hastily), DH's oldest and his friend arrived, DS graduated, and I'm off to bed to sleep very soundly. More details on everything (especially sewing!) soon, but for now here's a photo from tonight's activities, which can be clicked on for the bigger version."},
{"title": "Painting Cheat", "date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2007", "text": "First, thank you everyone for all of the wonderful compliments. It was a lot of work and in less than 2 weeks (whew!), but it's all worth it, now. I love my new dining room, I love having that room open and accessible again with light shining in from the window, and I can't wait until we sit down to our first dinner in there. Of course, I may never get up …Next, while it's still fresh in my mind, I thought I'd share a little tip for \"painting\" around existing crown and chair rail. The gist of the hint is … don't. ;-)Until the dining room, all of the crown we've done in the house has been new and installed *after* we painted the walls. But in the dining room, the house came with the crown and chair rail and we were not planning on removing it all before painting, although we did remove some before the new wall was built and in the end on this project removed almost 3 walls' worth of crown because it really needed a good sanding and cleaning up. But for what was left, that meant that the \"line\" of red paint butting up next to the white trim was going to have to be perfect because of the high contrast. I'm a really, really straight painter but the job was proving to be a major headache because 34-year old caulk is bumpy and thus very hard to paint so that it turns out looking straight. I mean, technically, the painting *was* straight but it didn't look like it. Ick.So, I stared at the source of my headache for a while and came up with another plan. We'd add a row of narrow trim just under the crown and just above the chair rail. We would paint the new trim white while it was off the wall and then paint the wall with red very close to the existing trim line but not all the way up to it. The new trim would then cover up those bumpy old caulk imperfections and the transition from red to white.This photo shows the new, fluted trim under the crown molding:This photo shows the original chair rail, before we started painting:And this photo shows the same wall now finished and with that same narrow fluted trim just above the old trim:It all looks like it's always been there, doesn't it? It was wonderful to relieve myself of that headache! I love it when a plan works, especially since we've had quite a few \"learning experiences\" in this house. Anything to make this job easier is good in my book.Yesterday I got my hair cut and did the grocery shopping. Two more things crossed off the pre-guest list. Today I'm going to spend the morning cleaning and then after lunch I'm going to cut out the dress. I have to get to the airport by 6 PM, so that gives me a few hours to do the cutting and maybe even start sewing. Hopefully my next post will be truly sewinig-related."},

I still have to (1) finish painting one set of doors, (2) recover the chair seats, (3) hang more pictures, (4) buy a rug. Those things will come, but not until after graduation and after our company leaves. And a long rest. ;-)The trim work went pretty well, except DH turned into the s-l-o-w-e-s-t painter in the world so we lost more time waiting on that than I was planning. And then unpacking the china and crystal, washing it and putting it away took a good chunk of time. But it's done now and looks great (if I say so myself!). Once again, I unpacked some things I had completely forgotten we owned. The yard sale pile is growing by leaps and bounds.I'm hoping I still have enough energy tonight to start my dress. Around that, I have to get my hair cut, buy groceries, and clean the house — which is still in semi-disaster state from the dining room project. So that means unpacking a few more boxes and stashing stuff. (If you look at the kitchen counters in one of the pics below, you can see the stacks waiting to be dealt with.) It's going to be an interesting next couple of days. I'm looking forward to just sitting still during the graduation ceremony. ;-)"},

The last sheet of the underlayment (is that a word?) is down and I've now got about 1/4 of the floor left to go.DH has been putting the finishing paint touches on the trim while I do the floor and I think we'll be able to start on it after dinner (take-out again). We took the trim around the window back down because we decided it made more sense to put it up *after* the floor was in place instead of trying to guess dimensions. After the window trim is up, we'll do the chair rail, then the crown, and then the little extra trim we bought. Everything is cut and ready to go except for a couple of pieces of chair rail that had to be replaced so it should go a bit quicker than the family room. Oh, and the baseboards have to go up too. Lots of trim work, but I really do think we can get it done. I hope so, because my sewing room is gathering dust.And in completely unrelated news, last night DS#1 won the Best Supporting Actor award at his school Drama Troupe's version of the Tony's. That's two acting awards he's won in the last few weeks. I hope he continues with community theater after graduation since he seems to love it so much. Me? You couldn't pay me enough to get on a stage. The performance gene comes from DH, who is an accomplished singer and has done his share of amateur acting.Back to work!"},

Two whole rows — woo hoo! ;-) But I'll start in again in the morning and work until I have to leave at 1:00 PM to do the Team Mom football meal thing. And there's the game tomorrow night.DH has all the various trim painted and waiting in the garage, and he's working on framing the window as I type. Over the next couple of days, he'll work on the chair rails and crown while I do the floor. I'm still hoping to be done with the dining room by the end of the weekend, but I know that will be really pushing it.Here's what it looked like about 10 minutes ago:I promise, this blog will return to sewing next week. It has to. I have a graduation dress to make."},
{"title": "Another Busy (and non-sewing) Day", "date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2007", "text": "Continuing on from yesterday, Home Depot refunded my money for the bad red paint. At first, the manager on duty was only going to refund for the full can. But I politely let him know that DH and I spend thousands in that store every year and he really should reconsider unless he wanted us to take that money across the street to the brand new Lowe's. He was very nice and reasonable and didn't have to think twice on that. ;-)We got our money and then went back to the lumber department to look for some trim to add under the crown and over the chair rail so I don't have to paint perfectly straight lines in that high contrast between red and white. Ironically, Home Depot didn't have what I wanted and we found it at that Lowe's across the street. Oh well. We'll be back to Home Depot before the weekend is over, I'm sure.So the red painting is done and looks great. The white below is also done. Today, after I run DS to/from a doctor's appointment, we'll start in on putting the wainscot trim back on. I'm hoping that will go quickly (hah!) and that I'll be starting in on the floor by late-afternoon. Our guests will be here in SIX DAYS so the clock is definitely running and we're trying to catch up.Meanwhile, more of my non-sewing time shopping arrived yesterday. I finally broke down and ordered some of the knits on the Fabric Mart site.The first 3 are poly ITY jerseys. I have no idea what ITY means (anyone??). They're very nice, even if they're polyester. Drapey and thin, but not too thin. The last is a rayon/spandex knit and it's wonderful. The pattern looks bold in the photo swatch but in real life, it's much more understated. It's available in 4 colorways and if you've been contemplating buying some, I say go for it! Seeing the fabric made up in this review on PR is what put me over the edge for finally ordering it. I'm even contemplating making the graduation outfit from it instead of what I'd originally picked. Except I can't prewash right now as my washer is flashing a repair code. ARgh. But the repairman will be here tomorrow morning so hopefully the laundry room will be up and running again soon. Love those extended warranties on major appliances!"},
{"title": "Painting Primer", "date": "Tuesday, May 8, 2007", "text": "I read the comments about red vs. gray primer when the final color is red. I really don't know the definitive answer, but I can tell you what we've learned over the last couple of days and last year.The biggest lesson is: All red paint is not created equal.We usually buy Behr paint from Home Depot. It's always performed flawlessly for us. It goes on smoothly, covers well, and wears great. Until this week.Backtracking … Last year we painted DS#2's walls half red and half black.We had absolutely no problems with either the red or the black. Two coats of each over a gray primer and we were done. This was Sherwin Williams paint, though, and I really can't remember why we bought SW instead of our usual Behr. I must've had a reason.As you saw in Sunday's post, we used a pink-tinted primer for the dining room. Then we started painting using Behr \"Ripe Currant.\" OMG. It was like we were using a glaze and not a paint. It was thin and runny and streaked like you wouldn't believe, and it wouldn't dry. I wish I had taken pictures, but I was too mad to even think about it. We thought there was something wrong with the paint so we made a mad-dash run to Home Depot Sunday night before they closed to trade what we thought was defective paint for a different can, same color.While we were waiting for the new paint to be mixed, the lady at the paint counter starting telling us that we would probably need to paint up to EIGHT coats, waiting 24 hours between each coat. Huh?? We had painted DS's room last year in a very similar color and had zero problems. Even though we heard her, we still thought it was just a bad batch because we have been painting for years with no problems, including DS's red and black last year. But when we got back home and started in again and there was no improvement with this \"new\" paint, we started questioning everything.Because we had no time or desire for painting over an 8-day spread, and after 2 days, 3 coats, and the primer, you could still see the primer and every roller stroke, we decided to throw in that towel and move on to Plan B.Another mad-dash trip to Sherwin Williams yesterday before they closed at 6 PM. There, the salesman gave us a mini lesson in paint and bases. I had noticed that the paint we used for DS's room used a Red Base and the Behr paint for the dining room starts with a \"deep base.\" Mr. Sherwin Williams explained that the dark colors which use a deep base (or Ultradeep in SW terms) do usually take more coats for coverage but he was as shocked as we were upon hearing the recommendation of EIGHT coats from Home Depot. It's got to do with the lack of white pigment (titanium dioxide) in the base for those deep colors. Titanium dioxide is what gives a paint hide and coverage. (He also explained that the color of the primer doesn't really matter for red, as long as it's either gray or tinted (pink). It's the primer itself which should be decent quality (ours is) so that it creates a favorable surface on the wall for the paint to adhere to it.) So, here's the dining room now, after the SW paint. Any shading you see is from actual light/shade in the room, not paint streaks. Finally!I'll be making another run to Home Depot later — to demand a refund or credit for that horrible paint. At over $27/gallon (we bought 2) plus the new paint from SW, it's too much money to just let go."},
{"title": "An Hour in the Sewing Room", "date": "Monday, May 7, 2007", "text": "Isn't that tire around Zillie attractive?? I really should pad her further down her \"body\" to avoid that horrible silhouette. Maybe in my spare time. ;-)Anyway … she's sporting the muslin for the graduation dress. And below, I'm wearing it too. With my painting pants and shoes. Such a fashion plate I am, no? DH had an early morning appointment so I snuck into the sewing room before bringing out the paint roller again. I cut the pattern (finally!) and quickly serged it all together.Overall impression? Pretty good, but I'll try it on with the good bra later to be sure because I think I may need to pinch out about 3/8\" in shoulder to bust length. The icky painting bra isn't as uplifting as my better ones. ;-)The front shoulder-to-shoulder width is also a smidge too wide. That section is cut on the fold so I'll just lay the pattern with a deeper fold line for the final and that will take care of that. The shoulder length is too long, which is always the case. No big deal to just lop 'em off later. And finally, I think I'll raise the armholes. Right now they're fine, but the seam allowance is still in place so I'll raise them to equal that 1/2\" allowance.The neckline depth is good, though (again, seam allowances are still in place so imagine it 1/2\" lower). The way the different sizes were nested on the pattern sheet made it easy to drop the as-designed neckline about an inch as I traced. And the fit through the torso seems to be good too. The seams are staying vertical through the booty region, so I won't add any extra width.Since I showed some new pattern acquisitions yesterday, I'll fess up and show what I bought during Joann's last Simplicity sale. I had originally thought I'd buy the new 3768 direct from Simplicity, but then I decided I wanted two copies of it so I went for the el cheapo route. Yeah, right. I ended up with all these other patterns too, so what did I really save? ;-)There's 3 other Khaliah Ali patterns in the mix, one of which is a wrap dress, for a total of three that I've bought in the last couple of weeks. Why am I buying wrap dress patterns anyway?? I don't really even like them on me. Hmmm. I should probably just purge those before I even put them away, although the KA version is also a top which is actually why I bought that one. The others (including the Vogue version shown yesterday) — I plead pattern insanity, Your Honor."},
{"title": "Shocking", "date": "Sunday, May 6, 2007", "text": "The dining room is coming along. Beautiful, isn't it? Hahahahaha!! Don't worry, that's only the primer, which is the most hideous shade of Hot Pink. The final color will be a deep red, which we'll start painting after dinner. DH is quite eager to cover up that pink. Speaking of dinner, DH and DS#2 (the one with the newly acquired learner's permit) are picking up pizzas, which is why I'm here with a few minutes to kill.In sewing-related news … I picked these up from my mailbox today, which means they arrived yesterday. When I can't sew, I buy. Vogue had an online sale so I was on it. Of course they'll be added to the To-Do-Hopefully-Before-I-Die-Along-With-1,000-Others  list, as I have to work on the graduation dress before starting anything new. A couple of them I would like to make for summer so maybe I'll get to them before November. ;-) The others I bought just to look at, like the Betzina jeans.My May issue of Burda WOF also arrived so between that and the patterns I've got some good bedtime reading material for later.I'm also expecting a couple of other splurge items in the mail this week, but right this minute I forget exactly what. Uh oh. Time to hide the debit card until the dining room is done. ;-)"},
{"title": "One More for the Memo Board", "date": "Saturday, May 5, 2007", "text": "Carolyn asked for a pic of the final placement and here it is. I also took a close-up with some of the stuff in/on it (which can be clicked for a bigger version). The only thing I'm going to add to it at this point is a pic of DS#2 since we can't leave out those second children. ;-) I just have to find one of his Homecoming pics or print out one that I took. The other things on it are a variety of pins with a sewing or crafty theme that my sons have given me over the years, a card from DH, and postcards from Melbourne, Australia (Hi Belinda!). Now I'm going to go crash. I'm tired from texturing and painting. And, oh boy!, more painting tomorrow.So many projects, so little time in one day and me with a mind that easily jumps all around. While I did finish the mudding & sanding in the dining room, I did not do one lick on my dress. It's still not cut out, although the pattern pieces are now in place on the fabric so that will be first on the agenda tomorrow morning.Instead of working on my dress (needed 2 weeks from today!), I was distracted by the bulletin board that had been staring at me from its place at the top of the stairs. I had set it there on the floor on purpose as a visual annoyance reminder to make a \"French Memo Board\" sooner rather than later. The problem was that while I remembered about the board on a daily basis, I always seemed to forget to pick up ribbon and upholstery tacks on my errands around town. Finally while I was in Joann's last week picking up sale patterns and a bolt of muslin, I actually remembered. So then the bulletin board called out even louder and today I just couldn't ignore it.I started with an ordinary unfinished pine & cork bulletin board purchased at Target, and painted the frame white. Because the cork would be covered, neatness didn't count (obviously!).Next, two layers of poly batting cut to fit inside the frame.The fabric was cut with a 1/2\" seam allowance (not really a seam, but I think you'll know what I mean!).Most memo boards are made with the fabric wrapped to the backside of the base and stapled in place. But because I wanted the frame to show, I used my putty knife (quite handy from the dining room project) to force the \"seam allowances\" under the frame.And because I also wouldn't be wrapping the ribbons to the back, I had to be creative. I tucked them under with the putty knife too and then pinned them into place, slipping the head of the pin under the frame. A few sewing pins sacrificed for the cause. ;-)The last step was to push small upholstery nails into each ribbon intersection.With this method, it's not the strongest memo board ever, but it will be fine for the few postcards & other small paper items I want to tuck into the ribbon. Its main purpose is to add a bit of color and texture to the room and that job it will accomplish rather well. I'll hang it tomorrow, when I can hammer loudly and not wake DS#2, sound asleep in the next room after his first week of spring football workouts."},
{"title": "Dining Room First, Cutting Fabric Later", "date": "Thursday, May 3, 2007", "text": "Let's backtrack for readers who haven't been there for the beginning of the Money Pit saga. And also because I selfishly love to see actual progress documented in one place. ;-)This is the way the dining room looked when the previous owners lived here. (The pool table came with the house and is now set up in the attic.)Then we bought the house and started working on it before we moved in. One of the things we did was to strip the 1980s wallpaper off the walls. (Hey, this paper was an \"upgrade\" — everything else was vintage 1974.) So then it looked like this:Not too bad, but with the wallpaper gone we noticed some wall oddities in one corner of the room. Those oddities were termite \"trails\" and we knew we'd have to deal with the problem. The termites were long gone since, as part of the sale, the whole house was treated for termites & we were being compensated for the damage we already knew about. But until we started working on the house, we didn't know how much more damage was still lurking. It was depressing and the whole project went downhill and then stalled completely because of a horrible contractor. We pretty much ignored the dining room and most of the rest of the house for a couple of years, until we moved in during November 2005. (The original plan was to move into the house approximately 6 months after we bought it. That 6 months turned into 3 years and the work is still ongoing. Remember us if you ever think about buying a fixer-upper!) Last April, DH tore off the original drywall to expose this bit of loveliness.And then he replaced the wall studs and part of the joists, and re-drywalled. The job was actually easier than we had first anticipated, but by then DH had had plenty of practice from repairing the termite damage in DS#2's room.This is the storage pit dining room as it's been for over a year.But now its time has finally come (again). DH has been moving some stuff out and rearranging the big items to one side of the room while I work on finishing up the \"new\" wall.This is what it looked like this morning, after the first coat of tape & mud. Tomorrow morning, I'll sand and then apply the second coat of mud while DH paints the ceiling.I can't wait until the wainscot trim is back up and we take down that u-g-l-y chandelier. But that won't be happening until at least next week and working with that trim is going to be one big jigsaw puzzle, even with the \"map\" we made while removing it.Tonight, though, I'm going to be cutting out the dress muslin and maybe sewing it together during Grey's Anatomy commercial breaks. I know I've \"earned\" some sewing time."},
{"title": "Inch by Inch", "date": "Wednesday, May 2, 2007", "text": "So, if Belinda is McSewing over on her new blog, then that's me in the photo above. ;-)But I did get the dress pattern traced and hopefully I'll be cutting the muslin tomorrow. Before I could start tracing, however, I had to reassemble the pattern sheet. It seems the folding machine at the printhouse was a little hungry the day they were getting my magazine ready.Do you see that vertical black \"line\" down the pattern sheet in the pic below? That's a slice taken out. Not an even slice where the edges would easily abut, mind you, but a more radical slice which required getting the sheet as flat as possible and taping together the \"air\" in between the pieces. I couldn't press the sheets flat because that would rip them even further.I remember someone talking on one of the message boards about a similar problem, but I don't remember if they were talking about this WOF Plus issue or another one. It wasn't a big deal really, but still an annoyance when you're already pressed for time. Oh well. It's over and done with now.Also on the list for tomorrow? Taping and mudding the dining room drywall repairs from last year. Yeeee hah!"},
{"title": "Double-Duty Dress", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2007", "text": "I need a dress for Mother's Day and my older son's graduation. Mother's Day comes first, so that means a May 13th deadline. Although I may get a reprieve because *my* mom will be here for the graduation and we're thinking of delaying Mother's Day dinner until graduation weekend so we can do everything at once. (And, really, anything to reduce the activities during May would be welcome.)I've decided that I'll make this dress, from the Spring 2006 Burda Plus magazine (cover shot below because I've yet to figure out the numbering system for these Plus issues). Except I'll be making it in a knit with a lower neckline and leaving off the zipper, facings, and matching stole. I made a WOF dress a couple of years that was based on a similar style and also used a knit instead of woven for it. I tried it on over the weekend and even with the extra fluff, it still fits. Which is great, because I cut a straight 48 for that and only made square/narrow shoulder adjustments. It would be great for my schedule if I can get away with equally minimal fit adjustments for this one.I'm also going to make this now-TNT Butterick 4986 top to wear over the dress, to serve as both arm and tummy camouflage.I won't be making a muslin for the top, but I definitely will for the dress. I've got some knits in the stash that I'm more than happy to sacrifice. The final fabric will be this drapey rayon/Lycra knit, which you seen before with my 2-seam twist top."},
{"title": "Details", "date": "Friday, April 27, 2007", "text": "It seems that the embroidery just does not want to be photographed, but here's another attempt anyway. The effect is subtle, but not this subtle!There was a question in the comments about the embroidery design. It comes from a Husqvarna Viking disk, #150 Designer Flowers. Apparently, this collection has been discontinued because it's no longer listed on the HV website. But the image files were still there with a little digging and I came up with this screen grab.As you can see, the original design is smaller and has many more colors than my final motif. I used Embird for the editing. Below is the \"Mega Hoop\" design I created from bits and pieces of the original HV design.This is the single hooping file for the pockets, which is just a separated-out section of the larger design above.Here's a shot of the pockets. You can see the embroidery a bit better here than in the leg shot. (Reminder: You can click to enlarge all of the photos.)And here are the pockets on my backside, the embroidery again being an elusive model.The outfit on Zillie:A close-up of the gathered short sleeve:I've had comments in favor of the length of the top. I'm still giving it thought. I don't usually wear my tops this long and it sorta feels like the typical, big & baggy top that plus-size women hide under. I know it isn't the same, but with the extra pounds that have recently found their way onto my already fluffy self, it's difficult to get past that feeling. That's one downside to having a great kitchen that I love to cook in! ;-)"},

But it does show in real life. I'll try to get better pics later. Or I might just collapse. Fast sewing is not my forté.The top is another Burda WOF 06/2005 (#111).This makes #3 for me. For this one I stole the gathered short sleeves from my recent make of Butterick 4986 . I love this WOF pattern, but today I wasn't lovin' the binding process. It's as if my binder knew I was in a hurry and had sabotage on its brain. I ended up interfacing the binding strip and then running it through the binder, which worked. But sheesh, enough already. ;-)I think it's a bit too long, but tunic length is in so maybe it's not. I don't know. I'll run it through the laundry cycle one time and then re-evaluate. For now, I don't have time to worry about it. My hair is still wet and I've got to be out of here in 30 minutes.The pants will be done for tonight's school event, but a top?? I don't know. I'm running out of time. Yesterday was not a PSD after all, so all I've got left for sewing time is between now and 6 PM. I think I know which TNT pattern I want to use, but can I sew uninterrupted and get it done? Time will tell.Here's the embroidery on the capris. The washaway stabilizers have not yet been washed away so the leg is still very puckery and the pockets have a \"fill\" inside the embroidery that won't be there after a trip through the laundry — which will happen in about an hour, sewing gods willing. The pockets will be tone-on-tone just like the leg but because I wanted to precisely place mirror images of the motif on the pockets *and* embroider them at the same time and in the same hooping (I'm lazy), I needed a see-through stabilizer on top so I could arrange the pockets under my tracings of the designs. (Clear as mud?) It was a bit fiddly to get right, but it worked rather well.Because this is stretch denim and I don't want the waistband to stretch now that it's fitted to me, I've sewn twill tape just inside the waistband seam allowance. After that, I trimmed the seam allowances with pinking shears to reduce bulk. The twill tape and pressed-up seam allowances will be covered by the waistband facing, which itself will be secured with some stitching-in-the-ditch from the right side of the pants, as well as the topstitching that is still to be done.Now, off to finish the waistband, sew some buttons & buttonholes and get started on the top."},
{"title": "Actual Sewing Going On (and other stuff)", "date": "Tuesday, April 24, 2007", "text": "I really, really want to wear the new capris to a school function on Thursday and other projects (see below) have kept me out of the sewing room more than in it. So, I've declared today a PSD (personal sewing day). And because I want to make a new top to wear with them, I'm probably declaring another PSD for tomorrow. After that, though, it's back to installing floors so I have a functioning dining room for the houseguests descending upon us in three short weeks for DS#1's graduation. Although I will be popping into the sewing room on and off during the floor install so I can make the outfit I want to wear for the graduation. Whew! I'm tired already. ;-)So, the capris are cut and halfway sewn. Then while making pockets, I decided to get out the camera because this little pressing tool has gotten such bad press (har har) on Pattern Review and it really is a handy notion for me. Sure, you can burn the dickens out of your fingers if you're not careful, but if you handle it from the opposite edge of the iron, it stays cool enough that burns are not concern, and it's aluminum so the heat dissipates quickly. I use it for pockets mostly, but I do sometimes use it to start a measured hem or to press a crease in stubborn fabric. I actually like that it's metal and gets extremely hot because pressing denim pockets into shape goes a lot faster with the extra heat and moisture (when the steam hits the metal).I finished the fly the other day, but not without some mild cussing at myself. See the striped fabric? That's what I cut for the waistband facing and for the pocket bags. And then I promptly tossed the scraps, and DH even more promptly emptied trashcans and took the trash to the end of the driveway for the next day's pick-up. Except that I forgot to cut a fly shield! So, now you all know that these capris don't have a coordinating fly shield. (Will the horrors never end?)Here's where I am now — with the leg marked for the embroidery I'll be doing as soon as I upload this post. I had to topstitch some of the hem area first so that the embroidery is on top and not vice versa, which means that I have to turn up the rest of the hem later with parts of it already topstitched. That will be fun fiddly.In other sewing room \"news,\" while I was taking pics of the capris, Chili fished out the empty stabilizer tube from the trash as his new toy of the hour. (Why couldn't he have fished out a scrap of that striped fabric when I needed it??) This dog loves to shred paper/cardboard. He doesn't eat it, just shreds until it can't be shredded any more and then walks away, leaving his pile of shreds. It's actually kind of funny (even if I'm usually the one picking up the shreds) and on this floor what difference is some shreds blended in with the threads?And, lest you think I'm letting you get away without yet another remodeling update … hah!The living room and family room are pretty much done. I still have some stuff to put away and some desk organizing to do, but most of the big stuff is unpacked, out, and/or otherwise put where it's going to be. DH hung the new light fixtures in the laundry room, and made & hung the photo ledges for the family room. It's finally starting to feel cozy in this house (well, some parts of it). Various photos below.My office area looking from the TV end of the room:Looking at the TV end of things from the kitchen door:The HGTV-inspired photo ledges DH made:The new sofa in the living room:The new overhead laundry room fixture:And the wall sconce (why does anyone need a wall sconce in a laundry room?

I'll be tossing some of them into the washer before I leave … as soon as DH is done putting up the new light fixtures in there (which are looking pretty good — Oops, sorry Carolyn, I reverted to remodeling again).

Mine will be more capris very soon because I want to LIVE in them all summer long.Oh, and you'll have to trust me on this, but the capris are not as neon orange as they appear in the photo above. The color is a more subtle coral.I know Carolyn was just teasing in her comment to my last post, but she's right. I was planning to spend the morning hanging up the pictures, etc. that are littering the table in my office area, but I've switched gears and instead I'm going to spend some quality time in the sewing room working on those capris before I forget how to sew!I'm using my TNT (Tried and True) pants pattern (Simp 4068), which hadn't yet been marked for cutting at capri length.

So many things I forgot I even had, and now decisions to be made as to exactly where to put some of this stuff and what to just toss. It feels like we've just moved in all over again. But at least this time, I'm clearing things instead of stashing them for later. I can actually see the dining room floor again.We also moved the new sofa into the living room, although once we put the door & frame back on that doorway, it ain't never coming out again — at least not in one piece. Whew! That was a tight fit getting it in. But it looks pretty good, even if it is clashly wildly at the moment with the area rug.

I know what I/he wants, so it's just a matter of hitting the stores. DH wants to join me, so I'll be taking off as soon as he's back from some client meetings and I'm back from walking the dogs.

My mom and her POSSLQ (pronounced pozzl-cue and meaning Person of the Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters) will be here for DS#1's graduation in mid-May. We have no real guest room — yet. My mom suggested that instead of them paying for a hotel that she give me some money toward a futon that could be put in our living room as a guest bed. Hmmm. Good idea, Mom! So I agreed. Then I started looking on Craig's List for futons that were acceptably used (IOW, not gross!) and cheap, and found a great sofabed instead. (I'd rather have a sofa in the living room than a more casual futon, but I was trying to be budget-conscious.)The only problem with the sofabed so far was that it was in St. Petersburg (about an hour from me) so if it was a dud, it would be a wasted long drive. (Have you seen gas prices this week??) The seller and I emailed back and forth and she offered Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday evenings as choices for the pick-up. I'm so glad we went with Wednesday since it rained all day both Monday and Tuesday (desperately needed in these parts, but not good for sofas in the back of pick-up trucks). We loaded up both strong boys into the back of the cab and off we went.We met the seller at her (retired and very sweet) parents' house. The back story is the parents were the actual sellers but she's the one who put up the Craig's List ad and volunteered to be the contact person. The sofa belonged to a friend of her parents. He had died shortly after it was delivered to his home and this couple is in charge of selling off his belongings since the man's family is all out-of-state. Or something like that.As soon as I saw the sofa in person, I knew it was good quality (La-Z-Boy) and in brand-new condition. The mattress for the pull-out bed was/is still in the original plastic covering. Sold! So we (and by \"we,\" I mean the guys) covered it in plastic, loaded it on truck, paid for it, and off we went. Definitely a steal at $300, I think. You can't even buy a crappy new sofabed for less than $600.It's paisley, which I love (and not quite as red/purple as it looks in this pic), and it's temporarily sitting in the family room awaiting the transfer of computers and office furniture which should happen this weekend. So, before the family room gets better (and truly done), it gets even more crowded. But we'll manage. We've already decided that we like the big U of sofas in there so I see us looking for new stuff for that arrangment at some point in the next year. Uh oh!I mentioned the rain, right? This is Florida and we're about to head into summer. The dry weather has been great comfort-wise even if it meant drought conditions throughout the state. But with the recent rain came the dreaded humidity we had been escaping until now. Where is this leading? Well, yesterday was also a dog park day and because it was hot and humid, I didn't see myself in long jeans, and my favorite capris are in the laundry room. So, I pulled out this recently sewn outfit to wear:And I have to say it is going to be some of my favorite summer duds. So comfortable, and still casual enough with my brown flip-flops that I didn't feel overdressed for a dog park! The skirt (Kwik Sew 3287) is just wonderful made up in the cotton. I'm definitely going to be making at least two more before summer is over. (After those waiting capris, of course!) Yesterday was busy and I forgot to take pics of me in it before we left. And then I spilled Coke down my front in the truck so a photo will have to wait until the cami is clean again. Yeah, I'm a klutz.Oh, to finish up the vacuum saga, my replacement PowerMate vacuum head arrived yesterday, and it's the correct one this time. Which means I can finally do a decent vacuuming. Sears credited me for the first wrong one, including the shipping, and also waived the shipping charges on the replacement. So I suppose I feel better. But, still, what a pain! And I'll reserve final judgment until I actually try the thing. Between dogs and floor-laying, we have plenty of \"test material.\""},
{"title": "Almost There", "date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2007", "text": "Half of the room is nearly set up, the TV end of things. I spent way too much time this morning getting the surround sound system installed. When I opened the box, it was a mess of wires on top and I knew then it was going to be slow going. But I got it all hooked back up properly and we now have thundering sound booming at us from all corners of the room. (I can look forward to doing it all again when we get that flat panel screen DH has been hinting at.)I'm still thinking about this particular furniture arrangement. We used to have it so that the large sofa faced the TV/wall unit. But I kind of like the sofas facing each other. It seems friendlier and not so TV-centric (which the guys don't quite understand the problem with!).The perspective is off in these pics. The wall unit is centered on what used to be the fireplace wall, but because I'm standing off to the side in the kitchen doorway taking these, it looks lopsided. It's also dark because we're still missing the overhead lighting (and it's after midnight). If you're trying to work out the scale on this room, the wall unit is pretty darn huge and each of the full floor planks is 4 feet long. I'm still surprised at how much room we have in here.Still to do is my office side. Most of my furniture is in the dining room and what's here is standing about 2 feet away from the wall with DH's computer in residence. It will be about a week before I make the final and complete actual switch since we have to do some paying work first and so can't really spare the computer down time yet. It's coming soon though and I can hardly wait.Also on the to-do list is to unpack and hang the wall art, unpack and place more useless decorative knick-knacks, and buy and install lights (or fans, or something — we haven't decided yet) from the ceiling. It will be nice to be finally rid of the bare wires.DH commented earlier that it feels like moving day all over again. He's right. We have boxes strewn all about as I unpack and try to find new homes for the things I've forgotten I had. As well as feeling like moving day, it feels a bit like Christmas too as I rediscover those little treasures. Things like all of the family photos we always have out but which were packed away as soon as we listed our other house for sale. It's been almost 2 years since I've seen some of these things.After all of the unpacking and box moving today, I can actually walk around in the dining room (a/k/a temporary storage) again. I'm starting to eye it in earnest as that's our next project. We have family coming in for DS#1's graduation in May and I really want us to be able to sit and eat in the dining room. My short term goal for that is to at least get the floor in and the table set up. Anything else beyond that will be gravy."},

Some furniture is still in the family room, but most is in the hallway, the dining room, and in the living room. All of it is very dusty. Ick.It's still going to be a day or two before it all starts coming together in its final placement, especially since I've decided to move my office back to my real office furniture, which will reside in the family room too. For the last year, I've been working/computing in here (the living room) on furniture that was bought to be DH's home office set-up. I hate working at that armoire and have never quite felt at home with it. I miss my stuff. The family room is plenty big enough for both a typical sofa/TV set-up and also for my office space so I'm moving in. But I want to experiment with a few arrangement ideas before I commit to the layout. DH and the boys will be so thrilled as they'll be the brute force labor moving things around. I haven't told them yet. ;-)Today I finished laying the floor (plank by plank by plank). My knees are very grateful to be done. I've been a sight to see — with DS's football kneepads taped around the knees of my paint-splattered stretchy pants. But hey, it works and they're free so why not? To add to the look, I went to bed last night with very damp hair. OMG. I had a 'fro this morning. LOL!After the floor was done, DH put the baseboards into place and will lay down the quarter-round trim tomorrow. After that, it's crown molding time. DH has it painted and ready to go. The walls have been ready for a long time. ;-)As you can see in the very top photo above, the french doors are still quite gross. They've been at the primer stage for well over a year (probably closer to two years). I'll work on those over the coming week, after the furniture is back in place. And definitely after I've reaquainted myself with my sewing machine."},

{"title": "It was 20 years ago today …", "date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2007", "text": "On April 4, 1987 I became a Cook. After growing up a Ronzitti, I never thought anyone would ask, \"How do you spell that?\" ever again. I was wrong. I've been wrong a lot over the last 20 years. But that's OK. DH is patient, forgiving, and very generous of time and spirit. We've been up, down, and all around like any marriage, any family. But the good far, far outweighs any rough days and I know we'll be growing old together.Sewing related, my paternal grandmother made my wedding dress. She took some measurements, looked at my bride magazine clippings, and then took me shopping in the NYC garment district — the former, more bustling and plentiful district that it was back then. We trudged in and out of shops where she had long-established relationships. (All of my grandparents were either NY natives or immigrants through Ellis Island into NYC and knew the City well.) I had given her general ideas of my dream gown but that's as far as my \"authority\" went.After that, she picked the fabrics, laces, beads, pearls, buttons, netting, and whatever else she knew would be perfect. After all, this wasn't her first wedding gown. Before mine, she had made her own (of course), her own daughter's, two for her future daughters-in-law (one being my mother's), and countless others for close friends and extended family. Our last stop that day was for me to be professionally fitted into a \"Merry Widow\" long-line strapless bra because she knew to start with the proper foundation even if I didn't at that point.My grandmother was a professional tailor/dressmaker, and her work was the definition of couture, although I didn't know it at the time (shame on me!). To me, grandma just sewed. She always had a project in her hands, making the most tiny, precise stitches almost automatically. (If only I could go back in time for some lessons!)Most of the construction of my dress was done with only those hands, and without any pattern to guide her. She spents hours and hours on the lace and beadwork alone. The edges of my multi-tiered veil were hand-rolled. Each of the 48 buttons up the back and 12 on each sleeve were covered and stitched on individually. The delicate button loops were fashioned from tubes of the dress fabric. There'd be no zippers on this dress! My crinoline underneath was another project. She did all of this long-distance as she lived in NY at the time and I was in Virginia. I only knew what was happening from her letters and telephone calls and I could only hope that she had really understood what I was dreaming of.Finally, it was time to travel back to NY for a visit and the final fitting. Yes, final. No muslin, no intermediate fittings. The dress was done, waiting for me, and the fabric had not yet touched my body.Of course, it fit perfectly, and was just as I had been imagining. I was definitely Princess for the day, and on the arm of my Prince Charming.Happy Anniversary Mike, and thank you grandma!"},
{"title": "A New (Old) Direction", "date": "Tuesday, April 3, 2007", "text": "I still want capris. What I don't want right now is fiddling with a new pattern. While I usually enjoy that process (OK, maybe enjoy is too strong a description!), I've got too many things on my plate right now for it to be anything but frustrating.This morning I got out TNT Simplicity 4068 and pressed the tissue flat (and made a mental note that I need to trace this pattern onto something more substantial). I also pressed the coral stretch denim I'm planning to use for the first pair of capris and laid it on the cutting table. I've got lime twill and plain ol' blue denim in the queue but I'm trying not to get ahead of myself here. One pair at a time, since I'm just not good at assembly-line style sewing.Meanwhile, one of the things on my full plate is the family room. DH is putting down the underlayment (is that a word?) as I type and soon I'll be in there hammering planks into place (with American Idol playing in the background! And sheesh! When will Sanjaya be voted OFF?). The capris will continue tomorrow morning. But at least I have a workable plan now.Here's what's been happening in the family room. Well, first, let me backtrack. Below is a \"before\" shot of the room. When we bought the house, there was also painted panelling on that back wall but a discovery of extensive termite damage meant tearing it out and starting over. (This is also an example of the ineptitude of the contractor. Why would you drywall only this wall at this point when the a/c duct running along the ceiling was also to come out after being re-routed? But I digress …) See that funky off-center fireplace? Eww.This is a photo from before we bought the house. Even uglier, no?Before we ever moved in here, we had removed the faux wood (styrofoam!) ceiling beams, re-routed the a/c ducts to get rid of those downhanging soffits, and removed/replaced the rest of panelling. We spray-primed the new drywall and the french doors, painted the walls, and then tore out the stinky carpet. And that's how it's been ever since. Lovely, eh?This is the fireplace and hearth brick work that we just removed. .DH patched the holes from the hearth with new drywall,stuffed the fireplace \"hole\" with insulation, and covered it up with a sheet of drywall. The hole and insert/chimney are still intact behind the drywall but we've decided to just do a quick cover-up for the time being so we can move forward on this project.Here's where I take over. This shows the drywall patches taped, mudded, textured, and drying. And a quick inspection from the Pooch Patrol.This is what it looks like today, painted to match the rest of the walls.The \"lovely\" fireplace cover. But trust me, it will never show when we're done in here.And now DH tells me he's ready for me in there. Oh my aching knees tomorrow! ;-)"},

That's them being all serious and glamourous and grown-up.This, on the other hand, is really them — all silly and goofy!We had a mad-dash scramble the afternoon of the prom, looking for DS' entrance ticket. We looked everywhere. He said he gave it to me to keep. I said I gave it to him. It wasn't in any of our \"safe-keeping\" places. So we eventually, grudgingly gave up the hunt and I sent him with a check in case he had no choice but to buy another ticket (if they'd even let him do that). Luckily, he's pretty well-known at school (in a good way), and he had no trouble from the teachers and chaperones after explaining he'd lost his ticket.They stayed out all night long, with a group of friends in a hotel near the dance venue. (Yeah, I know. But they're all over 18.) They brought extra clothes for hanging out and bathing suits for swimming in the indoor pool. DS' girlfriend forgot to bring different shoes so when they all went out for breakfast, she wore DS' flip-flops (size 12!) and he wore his dress tuxedo shoes (with his board shorts and tee shirt). I wish I had a picture of that! They made it home safe and sound around noon on Sunday, tired but happy."},
{"title": "I've got nothing", "date": "Sunday, April 1, 2007", "text": "The weekend is nearly over and has anything come out of my sewing room? NO! It's been one of *those* weekends. That's not to say that I didn't get in there yesterday and this morning, but I hated what I tried so I just gave up.I actually traced 2 Burda WOF pants patterns, cut the muslins and sewed them up. The first one was me trying to upsize a non-plus size pattern. It mostly worked but something went wonky on the front seam and I didn't feel like figuring it out or messing with it. So then I tried a similar design that was already a plus size, except it was for a knit. I traced a size smaller than usual and it was way too big to even think about doing in a woven.After that, I was asking myself why am I trying to reinvent the wheel when all I want is very easy, very casual summer capris? Why not use a TNT pattern? So, that's what I'm going to do when I can get back in the sewing room and the sewing mood.For now, I'm stuck doing the paperwork I was putting off and finishing up the drywall in the family room. No flooring has been started yet, but we're very close. I'm hoping to have a finished floor in there by the end of next weekend although I'll probably have to work on it in spurts over the upcoming week."},

(But I was a good girl and laid down a coat of tape and mud on the new drywall in the family room first.)I was all set to pick back up on the Diana Mode top but I really wasn't feeling it today. Instead, I was thinking about capris. I seem to be living in them these days and I want more. So I pulled out the March 2007 issue of Burda WOF to look at the capris I showed the other day. I started reading the construction info (I always read the instructions — I'm OCD that way) and at one point, they referred to another design for more construction steps. I flipped to that page and I was in love. I hadn't noticed these pants before but that's because (1) the magazine photo shows nothing about the design details (I hate that!) and (2) they're not plus sized. And so that's where the challenge begins. I've traced them and now I'm going to try to grade them up to fit me with a few considered slash/spreads. It may work or it may be a dismal failure. Either way, it will be fun trying to get there.Stay tuned."},
{"title": "Not Sewing", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2007", "text": "Here's yet another not-sewing post. I've got a bunch of paperwork to do over the next two days and then DH will want me to start in on the family room floor (well, I want the floor too, just not the work!) so the sewing will be slow around here until next week. My Diana Mode top remains on Zillie as you last saw it.Does that stop me from buying fabric? Hah! This arrived this morning. The fabric inspector gives his approval. So do I! These are rayon/Lycra knits from Lucy's Fabrics. They are more beautiful in real life than in either Lucy's or my photos. And Belinda, if you're reading, these are more of the *good* rayon knits. Luckily for you, they're not your colors. ;-) Unluckily for me, new swatches were also packed in the box and I couldn't resist ordering yet more. I'm pledging to use many TNT patterns over the spring and summer so I can sew the stash down faster and have more clothes to actually wear instead of just dreaming about. We'll see how that works out. ;-)These Sophia doubleknits arrived yesterday, from Ressy's coop. These are also quite lovely but more wintery so they'll go through the laundry room and then be put away for a few months (at least). Ressy almost tempted me with the first round of Juliette knits and she's making it hard to resist the more springy colors & coordinates currently being offered. So far, I'm being strong so don't you go pointing that wand at me Miss Evil Fabric Queen!Speaking of the family room, I know you've been on the edge of your seat waiting to see what the fireplace looks like now. OK, maybe not, but here it is anyway. Still need to tape & mud the seams on the patches to each side, and then cover the fireplace hole with more drywall (which,(shhh!, we're not going to make pretty because it won't show). DH has used expanding foam and fiberglass insulation to fill in the gaps the brick used to cover. Our electric bills are high enough without sucking out more A/C and heat through all of that. The huge jumble of wires is from the TV. I can't wait until we can get that cleaned up and our surround sound hooked up again. (The boys say, \"Me too!\")"},
{"title": "Hey Mom, What's For Dinner?", "date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2007", "text": "Ham Broccoli RingThis is one of the boys' favorite meals. Maybe it's because they also love Hot Pockets thrown in the microwave for a quick weekend lunch? ;-)I found the original recipe idea in a magazine years and years ago, changed it up a bit and used to make it once in a while. But then for whatever reason, I stopped. Probably because my (then) little sons were picky about vegetables. One day a couple of years ago I remembered it. I made it up, served it, and watched it disappear in seconds. All the guys loved it, including DS#2 who at that time hated broccoli (or anything green) but loved ham. He didn't believe there was broccoli in it even though it's as green as can be. Silly boy, but I didn't argue.I know a lot of you are short on time too so tonight while I was making this up for dinner, I took some pics along the way. It's delicious, cheap, and looks like you spent way more time than you did. ;-) I think the total prep time is 15 minutes or less. I hope you like it as much as we do.Ingredients: (Makes 2 large rings, see notes below for quantity changes)3 cans of crescent roll dough1 lb. sliced deli ham, sliced (while still stacked) into 1 inch squares2-3 cups shredded Swiss cheese3-4 cups frozen broccoli florets (mostly thawed)2 medium onionsabout 1/2 cup dijon style mustard2 tbl parsley (fresh or dried)1 tsp black pepperPreheat oven to 350°.Finely chop broccoli and onions in the food processor (or by hand) and turn out into a large bowl. Add ham, separating the slices a bit as you do. Add the cheese, mustard, parsley and pepper and mix together, so it looks like this:Open the crescent rolls and arrange 12 crescents on each baking stone (or cookie sheet) like this:Scoop and arrange 1/2 of the broccoli mixture onto each ring, like this: (I use my hands to do this so I can keep the mixture compacted and neat.)Stretch the crescent points up and over the broccoli mixture and tuck the ends under, like this:Both rings complete and ready to bake:Bake for approx. 20-25 minutes, until the dough is golden brown, like this:Slice like pizza and enjoy!Notes:Before my sons' appetites became insatiable, I used to use 1 can of crescent rolls and make only 1 ring, served with a green salad. The rest of the ingredients are then decreased by roughly half, but you'll have a bit left over (great on toast in the toaster oven for an open-faced sandwich the next day!). You can also use 2 cans, 8 crescents per ring, and decrease the ingredients by roughly one-third. Play with it, it's very forgiving.The original recipe called for canned ham, but I changed that to the prepackaged sliced ham found in the refrigerated lunchmeat section of the grocery store. You can substitute deli or pre-cooked/leftover shredded chicken, turkey, or your other favorite meat, and cheddar (or another) cheese can also be substituted for the swiss. If using chicken or turkey, try substituting tarragon for the parsley.* * * * *For Non-US'ers, we have crescent (and other) roll doughs which come pre-shaped and rolled up in a cardboard \"can.\" These are found in the refrigerated goods section of the grocery store. Pillsbury is the most popular brand. The can is \"popped\" open by tapping it on the counter, hence where the Pillsbury Dough Boy, Pop 'N Fresh, got his name.(I use the plain dough, not the butterflake dough shown here, but this was the best photo of the can that I could find.)I've decided to start with this top from Diana Mode, mostly because it's going to be fast and easy. Ahem. Famous last words. Well, I hope it will be. We're going to be putting down new flooring in the family room toward the end of the week/weekend and I wanted a sewing project that I could work on (escape to?) in little bursts between floor laying and still make some progress.So far, I've traced the pattern and have pinned it on Zillie for a first evaluation. The tracing was an adventure. If you thought Burda WOF was a challenge, you ain't seen nuthin'. Imagine 3 times more patterns per sheet and in only 2 colors, red and black. Then couple that with non-English instructions, and throw in a dash of middle-aged eyesight. Thankfully this pattern only has 4 pieces.Nothing surprising here. I'll be doing an FBA.The back is not too bad, although I may need to fold some length out above the waist. I'll wait to see how it is after I add to the hips.Sidseams. Again, nothing surprising. I'll do the FBA to gain some width on the front and I'll slash/spread for some more caboose room.I think the shoulders on this pattern are square-er than most others I've used, which is a good thing for me. Since I will be doing a muslin, I'm going to leave them unaltered for now and see how they fit. The armhole may need to come up a bit, but the FBA reshaping may fix that so I'll wait until the muslin for that too.I wouldn't normally be doing a muslin for such a simple knit top but I want to really test this properly because there are a few more styles in the magazine that I like and which use some of the same (or very similarly shaped) pattern pieces. The other reason is my stash is just overflowing and I need to actually use some of those knits I bought for testing. And we won't mention that even more fabric is on the way. Oh. Whoops.I will be making that Burda WOF shirt dress very soon so hang in there if that was your \"vote.\" In the comments, someone mentioned a hesitation about the puffy sleeves. To me, they are more like the essence of puff. Not quite a full puff going on, so the effect will be more subdued and appropriate for my puffy arms. At least that's what I'm thinking now. I also need to decide on a fabric for that. I've got some linens, but I'm not sure if I have THE linen.Oh, and speaking of comments … I have a favor to ask. If you comment anonymously, would you mind giving me a hint of who you are. A name? Initials? I'm just curious is all. Thanks! :-)Now I'm off for an overdue haircut. I shall be so glamourous upon my return. Until we hit the dogpark."},

Ugh.It was a relatively boring day (OK by me!) but the evening made up for it. Here's my outfit for the night —the new Favorite Things Cute Skirt with my Burda WOF 07/06 #109 blouse (remember that one?). A perfect match! There's something to be said for constantly buying and sewing in the same color families. And, yes, white shoes before Memorial Day in Florida is a law. ;-)The \"men\" took me to dinner at The Cheesecake Factory where we started with a sampler appetizer for four which included Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Summer Rolls, Quesadillas, Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts and Calamari. We should've stopped at that because there was more than enough to call it dinner. But no! DH had a chicken pasta entreé, DS#1 had Grande Burrito, DS#2 a honkin' big bacon cheeseburger/fries, and I ordered fish tacos (of which I ate half of one and brought home the others). Were we done? Nope! Dessert. One Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake, one Lemoncello Cream Torte, and four forks. Again, enough for 10 people. Other numbers not getting smaller yesterday? My waistline!After dinner, we drove over to Channelside to hit the movie theater. We love this theater because it's new and modern, and never crowded. Downtown Tampa has too few residential dwellings to keep the theater busy. More and more buildings are going up so it's only a matter of time. But until the real estate market picks back up and those condos are sold, we'll keep this theater our little secret. ;-) It's only takes about 20 minutes longer to get to than the local 24-plex, and well worth the drive. Did I mention it has free valet parking?So, what did we see? Premonition, starring Sandra Bullock. Yawn. Save your money. Lame, lame, lame — especially the ending (which I won't spoil). The boys kept reminding me that 300 was playing right down the hall but I'm not sure I want to see that one either so we stayed planted. Still, it was nice to be out with my family even if we were just making fun of the movie toward the end.Once home, I opened my presents. No big surprises there since I'm required to supply a list. LOL! Some kitchen gadgety things I've wanted, a CD, and a HUGE chocolate chip cookie that DS#2 picked because he's the one who really wants to eat it.By the way, after we got out of the car and had started walking toward the restaurant, DH asks, \"Is your slip showing or something?\" Typical. ;-) (But I wouldn't trade him for anything.) Hey! What's happening up there? Ooo. What's that stuff? Looks like fun! Does it taste good? Pick me up. Please? Pretty please? Sigh. OK. I get the hint. Hah! Fooled you. Here I am on the other side.

I call them surprises because FFC isn't known for its speedy shipping and often by the time my order arrives at my house I've almost forgotten about it. This one was no exception. I remembered about the print (cotton sateen) and the lime (stretch twill), but I had completely forgotten about the aqua (tencel). Bonus!Don't these all look perfect together? (Trust me, the green in the print matches the green solid and the two solids are a little brighter than my dull photo.) And aren't they 100% my colors? These will all get sewn up before summer officially arrives because I want to live in them until October. Perfect spring/summer Florida fabrics.From the comments on yesterday's entry, it looks like the Burda WOF dress is the majority pick. I'm not sure if that will be the next thing I sew — I need to scope out the stash for a good fabric pick and I've got to start installing the family room floor soon — but it's definitely going to be a sooner rather than later make. I think I have some linens that would be great, even if it means I have to iron it before every wearing. I can see a casual linen dress with sandals or even flip-flops claiming a top spot in the summer wardrobe, can't you?"},
{"title": "Decisions, Decisions", "date": "Saturday, March 24, 2007", "text": "I was paging through some of my pattern magazines today to see what was catching my eye. Pardon the burriness and overall poor quality but I was taking these pics as the magazines, notepad, pen, and I were sprawled across my bed. With two nosy dogs sniffing to see what was going on.First is #128 from the 03/2007 issue of Burda WOF. It's a pretty dress with some nice details. Look at the back seaming — very interesting.And #130 from the same issue. Nothing striking here except they look like a fast sew for some more summer capris but with a little more detailing.This one is from Diana Mode, Nr.22/#17F (or however they number them). I like the use of trim and the basic shaping, even though the pinheaded model is swimming in this plus sized top and thereby doing everything possible to hide what could be a nice tee. This would also be an easy way to try out one of the Diana patterns without too much of a time investment.The line drawing looks entirely boxy but the pattern pieces do have some shape.This is a Patrones \"Grande\" jeans pattern from the 11/2006 issue.Look at those pattern pieces. This may be just the thing my full thighs and caboose need. I'm going to try this in muslin if nothing else, just to see what I learn.This skirt will be getting made soon — View D as on the adult model and in the upper left, the paneled skirt with the flounce. I like that this pattern is for knits. I think I'll get a slimmer fit since it won't need so much gathering at the top in order to make it past the hips. I can see this being a *very* comfortable skirt, almost like yoga pants but in a skirt. ;-)Next, there's the latest issue of Ottobre Woman. I'm definitely trying one or two of the tees, the 10-gore skirt, and the drawstring bottom capris (without side cargo pockets though). I'd also like to try the flared curvy skirt but I may be tired of skirts by the time I get to it.And finally, this 06/2005 #111 Burda WOF pattern that I've already made twice. I want to make it at least once more with short sleeves (longer than the cap sleeves shown) because it is one of my favorite tops both for comfort and flattering-on-me style. I just need to pick the fabric wisely for this since it may not look as nice on me in a less drapey knit. (Or, who knows, maybe it would.)So, what to make next? Probably nothing until next week. Tonight my now 18-year old son is having a co-birthday bonfire party here with his girlfriend (hers was this past Monday) and 30+ guests. And tomorrow I really need to be doing some paperwork.But if you had a vote, for which would it be? I'm thinking the Diana Mode tee because it will be fast. Of course, it's all subject to change on a whim since I haven't included my on-deck non-magazine patterns in the mix."},
{"title": "Let's Not Get Complicated", "date": "Friday, March 23, 2007", "text": "I got a second wind around 10 PM last night and decided to just go ahead and make up a Favorite Things Cute Skirt. From sewing the muslin the other day, I knew it would be a fast project. That is until I started overthinking things. I'm good at that. ;-)It started with the fabric … a very sheer cotton batiste (I think). OK, I could sew the pattern as is and wear a slip. But ugh. Another band of elastic around my middle in August in Florida? It wouldn't be a Favorite Thing anymore. So I started rooting through the stash to see what I had for an interlining and I came across some white cotton bastiste (I know this one is bastiste) purchased from a Martha Pullen expo a few years ago. Perfect. That is until I started overthinking things.To underline meant that the white bastiste would have to be caught up in the sideseams of the outer layer, at the very least. I wanted a more flowy, breezy skirt. Which meant a true lining. Which meant tossing out the easy, sew-in-an-hour-or-less instructions and making up my own. Not to mention making up my own lining for an 8-gore skirt. Neither of these is hard. That is until I started overthinking things.By this time, it was going on 11 PM and my brain really did not want to think about all of this. I came downstairs, poured myself a (soft) drink and sent out some email (Hi Belinda!). But I forced the thinking cap back on and came up with a plan.I sewed up the 8 gores of the skirt fabric as per the pattern — one section of 3 gores and the other with 5. I then topstitched each gore seam because if you're going to break away from easy, you might as well go all the way. I laid those two sections on my white bastiste one at a time, traced around them with the rotary cutter and came away with a front and back for my lining.With a true lining, I couldn't use the great neat-finish waistband application instructions so instead I just sewed the waistband in the round but because I like to overthink things, I aligned the skirt and waistband sideseams and sewed one raw edge to the skirt, inserted the back elastic and stitched that in place leaving an opening for adjusting the elastic, and then flipped the other half of the waistband down and stitched in the ditch from the right side of the skirt.Of course, I'm now slapping my forehead because I should've just serged the folded-over waistband on all in one pass, leaving an opening in one sideseam for the elastic, and then finished it by edgestitching the seam allowance flat from the right side of the skirt. Oh well, by this time it was waaaaaay after midnight and I did what my tired brain came up with. On the bright side, the next one will now go at least 10 times as fast. ;-)Then I tried it on to adjust the elastic and see about the hems for the lining and outer layer. My plan was to turn under a narrow hem on the skirt, and cut the lining about an inch shorter and narrow hem that too. Until I started overthinking things.When I looked in the mirror, the lining was hanging out at the bottom since I had cut it a little longer than the skirt just in case. Hmm. What if I purposely left the lining longer than the skirt?? Flowy and romantic, no? (Just go with me here.) So that's what I did. Instead of cutting the lining shorter, I cut the outer layer shorter. And instead of narrow hems, I opted for rolled hems on the serger. Nothing rolls nicer than a lightweight cotton batiste. Then I stopped thinking and overthinking and went to bed.And that's how to take a really easy pattern and make it take 3 times as long to sew up. ;-)But hey, at least I *like* the skirt on me now. (Photo coming soon.) With this lightweight and drapier fabric, it's not the sack that my muslin fabric was. The two cottons feel very luxe. Looking at the back view on the pattern, mine looks pretty much the same. Well, except for that underlayer sticking out. ;-)And now I'm not going to overthink things. I'm going to pretty much cut and paste what I wrote here into a review on PR. So if you've made it this far, you probably don't need to read the \"official\" review."},
{"title": "The First of Many", "date": "Thursday, March 22, 2007", "text": "You may get really tired of seeing this top because I'm planning to make at least 150 of them. ;-) I'm very happy with how this fits, how it flatters, and how easy it was/is to make up. In case you're just now tuning in, this Butterick 4986 pattern required NO full bust alteration at all. On me, that's a minor miracle. The official review on PR is here.I wanted a bit more edge treatment than a typical double-needle coverstitch so I stuck in the third needle, threaded up, and went crazy.And I didn't stop with just the top. I also used the same thread and triple coverstitching on the skirt seams and hems. I really like how it turned out. The flattering vertical seams aren't hidden in the print and the prettiness of the skirt design comes through.I'll get a photo of me in the new ensemble soon."},

I was trying to get photographic evidence yesterday but he was so wiggly. This is the best I could get.It's hard to capture the goofiness because it tends to look like a full-on dog snarl in a still photo, but trust me, it's not. He is definitely happy. Oh, and excuse the rug full o' dog hair — I'm still having vacuum issues. (One being that I haven't.)  ;-)I'm hoping to finish my skirt and top this afternoon after I get back from some errands, but one project that did get completed yesterday was the tee shirt pillow DS made for his girlfriend's birthday. He really did do everything himself. I chalked out the cutting lines on the tee shirt and rethreaded my machine in black, but then he took over and rotary cut it, sewed the seams, stuffed the pillow form in plus some extra stuffing in the corners, and then hand-sewed the opening closed (which I had pinned for him).  I had suggested adding a ruffle trim but he vetoed the idea by saying it would be too girly for him to do. The logic of making something girly for a girl was lost on him."},
{"title": "The Fabric is Cut", "date": "Tuesday, March 20, 2007", "text": "I've cut the skirt out, using the Kwik Sew pattern shown yesterday. But last night I did try on the FT Cute Skirts muslin again and have decided that with a couple of adjustments and in nicer fabric, it won't be as horrible as I was describing. Since the KS pattern is fairly distinctive, I can't make every summer skirt from it (can I?) so a very casual Cute Skirts option would be good to have. However, I do still have one or two new-ish casual skirt patterns yet to try so I'm not sure if I'll return to the Cute Skirts straight away. One is from the new Ottobre Woman magazine which has yet to show up here (grrr) and the other is Jalie 2681. But that's putting the perverbial cart before the horse since I'm still working on the current Kwik Sew skirt. I always do that … start on one project and then start dreaming about another.I also cut out the Butterick twist top so it's ready to sew too. I won't be able to wear it, though, until I make a cami to wear underneath it. I'll want to wear the cami untucked which means I need a longer version than the one in my cami drawer right now. That will be an easy project so I'm hoping to be wearing the Butterick top soon.Also on the list for today is a quickie pillow from a tee shirt project. DS#1 wants to make that for his girlfriend's birthday tomorrow. The tee is a \"souvenir\" from one of the high school drama productions she starred in and DS thinks she'll like it as much as he likes the pillow I made for him using a football tee shirt. (I thought I had a pic of that pillow but I can't find it. Oh well. We'll take pics of the one to be made today.) DS even ventured out to Joann's all by himself to pick up a pillow form … and he made it back unscathed. ;-)But first, time to take the dogs for a walk."},
{"title": "(Not so) Cute Skirt?", "date": "Monday, March 19, 2007", "text": "Presenting the muslin for the Favorite Things Cute Skirts pattern:OK, first the good points …1. Very, and I mean very, easy to put together. And only 3 pattern pieces.2. It fits. (Although I will have to lengthen it a bit and adjust for a tilted waist.)3. Um. I think that's it. Oh wait. I realized that I don't have to lengthen the top.And now the bad …1. It's a sack.2. It's a sack and has no shape on me.3. It's still a sack.Do you sense a theme? ;-)Part of the problem is the muslin itself. Bland and boring. The rest of the blame goes to this skirt on my body cuz it sure looked cute on Beki. But on me, there's just too much fabric gathered at the back. Five of the eight panels' worth to be exact. As you can see in the pic above, that's a lot of gathering and creates poofs I just don't need. I'm not willing to mess with it at this point or to commit the good fabric to it, so I'm thinking of switching gears to Kwik Sew 3287. Remember this one?It's much more flattering on me and also very easy to make up. In fact, I'm wondering now why I haven't made it again. (Note to self: Stop being tempted by all the patterns not in the stash!) I'll topstitch in aqua to make those seams really pop like they do on this denim version. It'll look fab! :grin:Back to the cutting table …Here's the muslin for Butterick 4986. The fabric is a bubblegum pink textured poly knit. It looks kind of nice in the photo, but it's thin and cheapo looking in person. I would not be wearing this even if the sewing was neat (which it's most definitely not). This ugly knit has served its purpose well by being a decent test fabric without any temptation to want it to be wearable.As I mentioned last night, the only pattern alterations I made prior to cutting and sewing this muslin were to narrow and square the shoulders. After trying it on, the fit over the bust is great, including the underbust seam which hits me under the bust as it should. Yes, this is without an FBA. I'm in shock. And really, even though this is a knit, the stretch is not compensating for an FBA. It fits over the bazooms without seeming to stretch anymore than the bias of a woven would had I used a woven per the pattern.I cut the pattern at the size 18 lines at the upper bodice and gradually morphed to the 22 toward the hips. For this knit version, I also cut the back on the fold instead of with the shaped center back of the pattern. I don't want the seam in the solid fabric I have planned for the first wearable version. I may add another 1/2\" to 5/8\" ease in the back hips since I was trying this on without the underlayer I'll need in order to wear it out of the house.The sleeve on your left is hemmed and the other is not. You can see on the unhemmed side that the armhole is drooping a bit. It's passable on me, but will be more comfortable raised about 3/8\" so that's what I'll do. I think I'll add a little bit to the sleeve length because I like the unhemmed length better than the side that's hemmed. I like the puffed cap sleeves, which I was unsure about before trying it on. The bottom of the top is also unhemmed and again, I like this length so I'll add onto it for a new hem allowance. The last fit tweak will be to narrow the shoulders a bit more.One thing I will be changing that has nothing to do with fit is to leave off the collar stand. I questioned it for a knit but since I was in testing mode, I figured why not just try it. I like the collar but there's absolutely no reason to have a stand for this top in a knit. I'll just widen the collar to compensate and make the top even easier to sew in the process.Oh, if only all patterns were this easy to fit and sew. But I won't be greedy — I'll just be thankful that this one is a winner all around.Other projects going on around here today:DH finally took out the hearth in the family room. It's only a matter of days now before we have a real floor in there. We are going to cover up the fireplace. Yeah, I know, but right now it just does not work for our furniture. And besides, this is Florida. How much do we really need a fireplace? We're not going to make it permanent in case we change our minds or buy new furniture. (It won't even be pretty since our furniture will cover the wall completely.) One of the problems with it is that it is not centered on the wall. That drives me crazy. The other problem is that the brick hearth ran the full width of the wall and took up 2 feet of what could be useable floor space. We've now reclaimed that floor space.This is a before shot from this morning:And this is an after, taken earlier tonight."},
{"title": "Skirt and Top Sunday Plans", "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2007", "text": "Tomorrow I'm planning to sew a non-wearable muslin for Butterick 4986. The pattern calls for bias cut wovens or stable knits but I see it as a stretchy knit.I took out my TNT tee pattern and laid it over the Butterick tissue. It really looks like the bust fullness and underbust seam will be OK without alterations since I'm using a knit. But that's what the test is for. If I'm wrong, nothing lost and I'll make the alterations. But if I'm right, woo hoo! I did already narrow and square the shoulders as I was cutting the tissue but I do those as a matter of course on any pattern.I'm also going to be working on one of these skirts (the third one from the left, the one without godets or flounces). The pattern is Cute Skirts from Favorite Things. After seeing the pattern, I can't believe I paid $10 (plus shipping) for it since it's so simple, but those pretty prints on the envelope pattern and inspiration from Beki's skirts left me weak and it was too easy to add it to the virtual cart with the rest of my order. Still, if I like the results and it sews up as fast as I'm expecting it to, it will be worth the price. I'll do a real muslin for this one too, just in case (and since my fabrics are sold out from Fabric.com).These are my next-up fabrics. The first is a cotton woven for the skirt from Fabric.com. (I have another woven from this grouping if the pattern works. Those browns and paislies were really calling to me.) The other fabric below is a paler-than-it-looks-here cotton/Lycra knit from Belinda Down Under which I want to use for the Butterick top. The knit was part of my 2006 Summer SWAP but my plans were more enthusiastic than my sewing time and thus many of the fabrics are still stashed. Not to worry, they're looking good again for Summer 2007."},
{"title": "Scrub-A-Dub-Dub", "date": "Friday, March 16, 2007", "text": "Finally done! (Click on the pics for bigger versions.) These are all from Kwik Sew 3201, a plus-sized scrubs pattern I used for the first time on these. They're huge on my dressform because my sister is taller and plus-ier than me. I hope they fit. I did make a full-bust adjustment and sewed the dart, because she's bustier than me too (hard to believe!).There's no way I could ever be a real assembly-line sewer. Making 3 of these at the same time drove me nuts. And these are easy. I lost all desire to be creative and instead I just wanted them DONE. So, no sparklies or fancy stitching. But I think the fabrics are busy enough anyway.Oh wait. I take that back. I did get \"creative\" (term used very loosely here). For two of them, I sewed the back facing on so it faced outward. I'm going to do this from now on because what's the point of using pretty fabrics if they don't show? I also used the contrast on the blue version to edge the sleeves instead of fold-up hems, and I edged the pockets on the orange top. The greenish top is just plain-jane, sewn as per the pattern.None of the pockets match up with the print below because I didn't get enough fabric to fussy cut them. The only one that was going to look particularly odd was the orange top, which is why I banded the pocket tops … gotta make it look like it was planned, y'know! But I did line up the general colors of the striping effect so unless you're looking (and I know you are now), they look like they match up. The other prints are busy enough that the pockets blend right in.The last thing (well, actually one of the first things) was to cut the orange fabric cross-grain so that the striping effect runs vertical instead of horizontal. I'm glad I caught that optical effect before cutting.I'll be dropping these at the PO on our way out to dinner. Whew!It's been a full two days since I committed to finishing those scrubs and still they are not done. I was all set to sew up a scrub storm on Wednesday but then I laid on my bed to read for a bit first and yep, out like a light. My sparse sleeping hours caught up with me. That's OK, I needed it.I do have one of the tops finished and one to the point of hems. The other is still sitting on the cutting table. I had to switch gears with it. It was supposed to be made from my new crossover scrubs pattern but silly me neglected to look at the fabric requirements before ordering the fabric and, well, I'm short. By a lot. And there's no more to be ordered. I had already cut the back when I figured this out. Luckily, I could cut the back piece of the other pattern from it without losing a thing. So my sister won't be getting a new style this round. She'll live. ;-)It's raining today so the dogs and I are inside but that means I'll have a few hours to finish up the scrubs (IwillIwillIwillIwill) before I need to get ready for dinner out tonight. It's my first-born son's 18th birthday today. How did THAT happen?More than eighteen years ago a sonogram had told us we were having a son. I had wanted to have a daughter and was a bit sad that I wasn't. Then on the morning of March 16th, 1989 I was laying in the operating room of a Washington, D.C. hospital feeling weirdly outside of myself while my my abdomen was cut open for a planned C-section. Less than an hour later I was madly, deeply in love. Daughter? No way! I wanted a son, MY SON!  Every day has been a joy with my \"baby\" and I feel privileged and proud to be his mother. I get glimpses of the man he is becoming, although he is still my little boy in some ways, and I like what I see. We've had a special bond since the day we officially met and we've always been close. I know we always will be, no matter where life takes him. Happy Birthday Tyler!"},

But I'm going to give it my best shot. I must get those done ASAP so I can move on to more fun things — sewing for ME! :grin:I should be getting a good haul in the mail/UPS today. I'm expecting some books, some fabric, and some doggie flea stuff, since the one down side to the dog park is picking up everyone else's fleas which necessitate flea baths for every park visit. (And it's so much cheaper to buy flea preventatives on the internet that I couldn't possibly justify running up to the vet's office instead, esp. when I've dropped over $600 there in the last 60 days. Claire, I feel your pain.) Plus my March Burda WOF and Ottobre Woman are still MIA. Hopefully they'll show up today too or very soon thereafter.I already had a nice goodie delivery day yesterday so today will be gravy. Yesterday brought fabric (of course) which you've already seen. It's the print from my self-drafted crossover twist. I love the fabric so much I got more to hopefully turn into a summer dress (more on that later).But the neatest thing was an Adele Margolis tailoring book, inscribed by the author herself in 1966! It's not addressed to me, naturally, but it was still a cool surprise to find.I've slowly been making my way through all the used sewing books I've been acquiring lately. Some are good, some are meh. When I finish up here, I'm going to write up one review for PR. Others will follow over the next couple of weeks.Oh, the dress I mentioned above. I realized the other day that I'm going to need a dress for my older son's high school graduation in May and also something for Mother's Day which comes before the graduation. I'm planning to do the 2 birds/1 stone thing and I've got my antenna up for a suitable style/pattern. Nothing has jumped out at me yet, but I've barely begun thinking on it.

{"title": "Pattern Therapy", "date": "Friday, March 9, 2007", "text": "I've been wanting a specific Butterick pattern and keep missing the sales. Yes, Butterick is on sale at Hancock's right now, but, well, I just don't feel like driving all the way to Tampa to see if (1) the store even still exists, as lots of Hancocks have been closing and it's been a while since I've been there or (2) if they have the pattern and in my size. Yes, I have heard of the telephone but work with me here, OK?So yesterday, after running an errand to Sears with DH (that's a rant I'll get to below), I decided we'd stop by Joann's so I could pop in and just buy the darn pattern and also browse for a bit. With DH waiting in the car, I knew I'd be less tempted to impulse buy. I had forgotten that J's has changed the everyday pricing on Buttericks to $5.99. With the price of gas lately, it would've cost nearly the difference in the sale price to drive to Hancock's so I'm not feeling too bad I \"splurged.\" I also picked up a few Simplicities that were on sale. I probably wouldn't have bought them otherwise. But the pattern stash needs replenishing every other month or so, right? Even if I'll never sew but a fraction of those patterns in two lifetimes.So, on to the rant … I have a Kenmore (Sears) canister vacuum. It's about 5 years old. It is not a bottom of the line model. It was not cheap. There's something wrong with the wheels on the \"PowerMate\" head. The thing still sucks perfectly fine, and I mean that in a good way. It just doesn't move smoothly like it used to and it feels like it's dragging when you use it. Like vacuuming isn't already a drag. But I'm not willing to buy an entire new vacuum when mechanically this one is just fine. Not yet.I tried looking for a replacement head on Sears' parts website. Sigh. Nothing specific enough was listed. So I called the parts department. The guy I spoke with had me read off all the serial and model numbers — the canister and the head each have their own. Then he asked me a bunch of questions to make sure he had the right thing. He also said that the connector poles come with it. Hmm. Don't need those but no way to order just the head alone. Oh well. I gave him my credit card info and waited for the box to arrive.Which it did last week. With the most completely wrong replacement head it could ever be. Let's start with the fact that my vacuum and the head are trendy RED. The replacement is 1970s BEIGE. Um, no. My original has a headlight on the front. Replacement? More beige plastic. Model numbers? Not even close. Poles? Mine are telescoping and get pretty long. Replacement? Short and non-telescoping. Grrrr.Fast forward to yesterday. DH needed replacement blades for our riding mower (also red btw if it matters, and it doesn't.) We decided to combine missions and go to Sears together. DH carries in the big box with the vacuum stuff and our original head on top in case the non-online Sears people don't have the same clue like their online counterparts. (They don't.) The parts counter (if you call a tiny window near the rear exit door a counter) tells me they can't take it back there. The only place that takes back online parts purchases is the main parts center in Tampa. Wha???? I paid $16 in shipping for the wrong thing and now I have to spend close to the equivalent in gas to return it to a different location? Sigh.And then we walked into the completely clueless and annoying saleswoman in the vacuum department. The model we have is still being made (it's now trendy orange) so I wanted to copy those model numbers, etc. from the floor model. She just could not understand what we were doing and at that point I was in a mood. It was not a chatty mood if you get my drift. She didn't.(BTW and totally unrelated, while I was standing there copying the model numbers, a man was asking this woman if sewing machines were still in cabinets. Saleslady had yet another airheaded answer and was zero help to him, but the point I want to make is that he was looking for himself and his machines! I smiled to myself and nudged DH. Yay for male sewers!)So, the box with the \"replacement\" is now sitting on my kitchen table while I fume and ponder. And my floors still need to be vacuumed. But DH will be swapping out the mower blades this afternoon.Now do you see why we detoured to Joann's on the way home?So, what did I buy?B4986 - Love it!! It's next on my list, but in a knit.S3837 - Interesting, now that I've seen the pattern pieces. Another layer over the boobs probably won't do me any favors, so it might be a permanent stash victim acquisition.S4375 - Linda, was it you who made the jacket? Whoever it was, I've wanted the pattern since.S3880 - A pants pattern available in plus sizing w/o an elastic waist. Had to buy it.S4095 - I have a feeling I already have this one. (My Palm's batteries are dead and so my pattern list wasn't with me even if my dead Palm was.) But maybe not. Even if I don't have this particular pattern, I know I have all its parts within others. Knowing this, I bought it anyway. ;-)But no fabric! Even though there were a few bolts that tempted me. DH was waiting in the car after all.Oh, and just in case you're keeping score — No, I haven't made any progress on my sister's scrubs. I'm hoping to squeeze in some cutting time today and some sewing time over the weekend."},
{"title": "Afternoon stroll through the woods", "date": "Monday, March 5, 2007", "text": "At the other side of the woods in our back yard you come out on a narrow road and just across that narrow road is this field. The specks in the distance are a herd of goats. Nannies, billies & kids. All cute and very friendly. Especially if you're loaded up with leftover bok choy and a bag of carrots like we were.All 3 of my \"kids\" had fun with the goats. Chili and Pepper were alternating trying to get inside the fence with them or barking furiously. Every once in a while a goat would ram up against the fence as if to tell the dogs to Shut Up! ;-) And they would … for about 5 seconds. Alex enjoyed his role as goat-herder and feeder.The changes in Pepper since Chili's arrival and from all the time spent socializing with other dogs at the dog park is amazing. She was right in the thick of things staring down those goats and barking like a \"real\" dog. Two months ago, she would've turned tail and pleaded to go back to the comfort of the house.While we were out Tyler returned home and, finding the house empty, called to see where we were. About 30 seconds later, we heard one of our ATVs heading toward us and then there he was. He missed the goat feeding but he and Alex had no trouble finding other amusements.Afternoons like this are all the reminder I need of why living in the Money Pit, with all of its imperfections, is just plain fine with me.My 2 Seam Twist pattern is ready for download.But …This is an AS-IS deal, OK? Please read the fine print below.1. Some of the lines didn't transfer 100% smoothly when I was moving the file back and forth between programs. Nothing major at all, but I just don't want you to think this is what I regularly see in PMB. The tiny gaps are from doing things to the end file that PMB is not anticipating we do. ;-) I could've cleaned it up but, well, I didn't.2. The first page shows the whole layout as it should look after you print and tape the pages together. There are \"pie wedges\" in the corners for page alignment purposes. Each page should fit entirely on letter or A4 paper, but it was created for US letter-size.3. The second page has a 4\"x4\" square. You should print this first and measure it to see if your printer is printing accurately. If it's not, this is where AS-IS comes into play. It will probably be a driver setting but you're on your own to figure it out. ;-)4. The third page has basic sewing instructions (and I do mean basic) as well as the relevant body measurements (not finished garment measurements). This is a plus-sized pattern and it's only available in one size (mine). You will undoubtedly have to modifiy it so make a muslin!I added some marks (in addition to the pie wedges) to some of the pattern pieces to help you place the correct seams together. These marks are placement guides only, NOT notches. They are will not line up to each other perfectly. Again, see above re AS-IS. ;-)5. The seam allowances are 3/8\" (which I just remembered is not noted on the pattern). The hems are 1.75\" but that's only because I always cut longer. I don't expect you to sew 1.75\" hems.6. I included the non-peplum back piece I ended up using for my last version, but it's morphed onto the peplum to cut back on pages you'll need to print. I think it's self-explanatory.7. This is my pattern. I'm happily sharing it for you to sew for yourself but please don't make copies for everyone. Send them here instead.So, are you still willing? Here it is. I hope some of you try it and share your results.Here's a pic of me in the latest version yesterday after wearing it for a while. I'm a bit wrinkled and rumpled, but what else is new?"},

Finally.After the stripes experiments, I knew I wanted to try a print. But I also knew I wanted the seaming to show somehow. I decided to cut the twist bodice piece apart and do some colorblocking. I'm very happy with how this turned out. Without a trial, I pretty much had to just guess where to slice the pattern. I think I landed pretty darn close to the right spot. Sure, I could have a squidge more length on the print section before it starts the twist, but anyone that close to see is either going to be DH (who wouldn't know the difference) or someone that is too close overall.Here's a close-up (remember to click on 'em for the big versions) of the twist where you can see that I used a narrow coverstitch for topstitching the green sections.Here's another close-up of the neckline, which was just turned and coverstitched (before I twisted the twist and attached the lower bodice section).I'll be writing a review later to consolidate all of the information but it's much too nice outside to sit here and do that right now.I'm thinking about making this a (free) downloadable pattern. Of course it would only be available in one size (mine, which is between 16 & 18 RTW on top). Is this of interest to anyone (besides Bev :grin: )? Leave a comment and let me know. If there's genuine interest, my arm can be twisted (pun intended) very easily.I haven't done anything more than prewash the fabric for my sister's scrubs. I'm hoping to start and maybe finish cutting those out tonight. I probably won't finish though, since I just remembered I'm going to have to make alterations on the new pattern.

I'll use my TNT Simplicity 8336 but I'm also going to do at least one crossover top using this new pattern (she'll be on her own for the cami underneath unless I'm feeling especially generous!):These are the fabrics I picked out. Part of the fun for me is that Lisa (my sister) gets absolutely no say whatsoever in fabric selection.  ;-)  I get to go a little wild and she loves the surprise.The first in each pair is the main fabric and the other is the coordinating neckband, pocket trim or whatever I decide.

What's that saying about the shoemaker's children? :grin: Hers: I finished my capris, and I like them. Except they're a smidge too long. I'm hoping another couple of trips through the laundry will take care of that. I only prewashed the twill once, so I'm optimistic. I'm definitely not going to be ripping out the hems and re-doing them. The X-Twistie alteration seems to have taken care of the wrinkles from the knock-knee effect. Being extremely picky now, I do still think I need to straighten the back crotch angle a bit more. I tried them on at one point backwards (by mistake) and the back tushie area looked great. Backwards. Hmprf.Back pockets:Hems:I'm planning to wear them tomorrow with my new tee. Hopefully, I'll remember to snap a pic before I get them all wrinkled.In Money Pit news, we've officially started in on the family room finishing touches. It's been without a real floor, baseboards, crown molding and ceiling fixtures for far too long. DH is currently framing out the French doors. After he finishes that job (tomorrow probably), we'll (and when I say \"we\" I mean \"they\") be demolishing the fake brick hearth that runs the width of the room. After that, we'll (and this time I do mean \"we\") need to drywall-patch-mud-texture the gaping hole.

{"title": "Quick & Easy Capris", "date": "Tuesday, February 27, 2007", "text": "I almost lived in 2 pairs of denim capris I made last summer, and I've already pulled them out and worn them again in the last week. (Ah, one of the perks of living in Florida in February!)The warm and sunny weather has definitely given me the summer sewing bug and so I'm nearly done making khaki-colored capris from my TNT pattern, Simplicity 4605 (now OOP). These are just your basic pull-ons, but I need pockets. So pockets I will have. (Sans chalk lines.)These two are waiting to be plastered on my butt. I never actually use back pockets but I find they visually break up the wide expanse back there and so I really do prefer pants with back patch pockets. The third pocket has already been sewn to the side of the left leg. This one I will use to hold things like an ATM card and a shopping list or the catering receipts I bring back to the football coach during football season (gotta plan ahead).I said this was a TNT pattern and for the most part, it is. But … before cutting out these capris, I gave my pattern an \"X Twistie\" modification. I'm anxious to see how it worked out since I didn't muslin or pin fit or any of that icky stuff. Yeah, I'll probably be eating my words. We really shouldn't toy with the muslin gods. I've got about another 30 minutes to go before finishing these and then I'll be able to see how my alteration worked.* * * * *And since I can't seem to stop talking about my dogs these days, here are some pics from yesterday's afternoon outing to the dog park. We took Pepper too, but you can't prove it by the pics I came home with. (Bad doggie mommy!) She mostly putters around with a few bursts of running now and then, and she's never in the middle of the action which is where I'm pointing the camera. Now that her forehead hair (or is that fur?) has grown back, she's photogenic again. I'll make a note to get her in some future shots.Meet and Greet in the small dog area:Chase and Run with some new friends:Meet and Greet in the big dog area:Chili is so eager and energetic that he often intimidates the dogs in the small breed area. Well, not so much the dogs but the owners of those dogs. And since I hate feeling I need to apologize to uppity humans for my dog acting like a dog (gasp!) in a dog park, we've been taking both of the pooches into the big dog area where Chili intimidates no one, and has 4 more acres he can cover at top speed. They both do great with the big dogs. Pepper and Chili really have no idea they're small and neither do the big guys. They're all equal opportunity sniffers (and sniff-ees).I love this thing! It's a water fountain for humans and for dogs. How cool is that?? (OK, I need to get out more … to human establishments.) The button on the right of the tall column turns on the higher spout for humans. The button on the left of the tall column turns on the lower spout on the left, filling a very slow-draining bowl for dogs. Pepper has quickly learned what \"Let's go get a drink\" means and happily follows me over there about 5 times an hour."},
{"title": "New Spring Top Success", "date": "Saturday, February 24, 2007", "text": "Edited to add a photo of the now-hemmed and completed top.Original photo:It's nice to have a successful sewing day! All that's left to be done is the bottom hem (and trimming the ties), but I ran out of one thread on my coverstitch machine after hemming the second sleeve so I've got to wind another bobbin before continuing. I thought it was a good place to stop for the evening. I'll finish the top tomorrow morning when I get up and I'll be wearing it for the rest of the day. (Before anyone asks, the pattern is from the August 2006 issue of Burda WOF.)Speaking of my coverstitch machine … until I sat down at it today, I had forgotten how long it's been since I used it. I've been sewing pants and a jacket which had no coverstitching in their construction, and the twist tops didn't quite make it to the hemming stage. It was fun to bond with that little machine again today.This was one of those projects that just came together with hardly any effort. The fabric is from a recent coop purchase, the neckline trim I've had for eons now matched perfectly, and I had a spool of matching thread already on the rack which was surprising since I don't sew these colors very often. I even remembered that I needed to narrow the shoulders on this top before I sewed the sleeves on, and I managed to keep the big flowers from becoming boobie bullseyes. Good Karma all around.Here's a close-up of the trim. It's plush elastic with little pom-poms knitted into one edge.And a close-up of the coverstitched princess seaming.This is great fabric (cotton with a bit of Lycra) and I know I'll be wearing this top lots all through the summer. It fits great and is ultra comfortable. And it's not striped! ;-)Yep, I love a good sewing day.* * * * *Do you think he's comfortable with his new family? This is where Chili's been while I've been typing this entry. He really wants me to move upstairs to the bed, but he looks pretty content while he's waiting. ;-) We've had him exactly 1 month now.I'm taking a little break from the latest twist top. Not because I'm sick of it (OK, just a little), but mostly because I haven't decided what fabric to use for a non-stripey version. No, I still don't like the last version and never will, but thank you for all the comments and suggestions. I can be OCD on getting something \"just right\" but this isn't going to be one of those times. (So Bev, email me!)Today I'm going to make another version of this Burda WOF top:I loved this one, but the interlock I used kept growing. I gave it to my sister when she was here in January since she has broader shoulders than I do and the stretchy upper width fits her much better than me. I have another lime top to wear with this favorite skirt so the give-away didn't affect the outfit.Spring has definitely sprung here so my attention is on lighter colors, floral prints, and short sleeves. I'd like to get this top done and then move onto a pair of khaki capris. Maybe I'll do a final print version of the twist top in between since I really want a wearable top from that pattern."},
{"title": "Sorry Bev, Not Diggin' the Stripes", "date": "Thursday, February 22, 2007", "text": "I'm tossing in the towel on this one too. I don't like it. It feels great, the way Slinky does, but I just do NOT like the stripes.Especially in the back. Ugh.The chevron effect is cool … when I'm not wearing it. When it's on me, all roads point to and emphasize The Big Butt. Granted, this is a twisted and most unflattering angle, but trust me, it doesn't get much better. The vertical stripes down my arms are not a good look either, since they curve out where my flab does and draw attention to their non-slimness.On the bright side, I like the seaming detail on the front (which is what first inspired me to copy this top) and I think it actually reduces the bustal projection visual. Do you agree? I think if the seaming was actually below my bust, objects would be larger than they appear in the mirror (or something to that effect). I will try this top one more time in a non-stripe and without the back seaming. If that doesn't work, I'll give up once and for all.So, Bev, free to a good home (plus shipping). :grin: You'll have to hem the sleeves and bottom edge, though, since I quit on this one.Stacy Sews and Stephanie Sews laid down the challenge to take photos of your sewing room as it is, without straightening it up first. Sharon Sews accepted it and motivated me to do the same (although I broke the pattern of blog names). So, here are photos of my sewing room taken 10 minutes ago. It's not too bad because I can't stand to work in big clutter so I tend to keep things put away unless I'm using them. (Sorry ladies!)Starting at the door into my sewing room and then going around the room:This is what you see when you first walk in. Zillie (my dressform) is modeling my current WIP (work in progress), which you'll recognize if you're a regular reader. The machines are set up on my table, plastic bins on wheels hold most of my notions and other supplies, and my ironing board is against the adjacent wall. Zillie is blocking my coverstitch machine, which also sits on the table.You also see my pattern cabinet when you first enter, but I couldn't fit it into the same photo as the shot above. On top are mostly things that belong and a few that don't. The blue looseleaf binders on the left are my pattern envelopes filed in sheet protectors by garment category. The envelope contents are in the cabinet below. Next to those are 3 sewing-themed stacking boxes. They are awaiting placement on the shelves that DH keeps promising me he'll hang up \"real soon now.\" (Sigh.) Next to those is a rectangular basket with my \"on deck\" patterns and new patterns that I haven't yet entered in The System. In front of the basket is the leftover purple knit from muslin/tester #2 of the top I'm currently working on. I haven't yet put it back in the stash. In front of the pattern binders is a pile of miscellaneous which includes a pants muslin, a couple of magazines, and some pattern tracings. Between that pile and the purple knit is a stack of swatches I save to send to Belinda in Australia. (We exchange swatches from our sewing projects, which is fun because I get to really \"feel\" what she makes and vice versa.) Finally, on the floor in front of the pattern cabinet is a pile of folded denims that somehow haven't made it into the stash closet yet. I thought I would sew these faster than I have.Next is the \"pressing center\" which kind of drives me crazy. I need to hang shelves or a pegboard or a slatboard on the wall to store my pressing notions. (I think I've decided on slatboard and now I need to buy one.) Right now, they're stacked in plastic baskets on the floor or laid on the flimsy shelf below the board. I also use the ironing board as a cutting table adjunct. IOW, when I'm using the cutting table to actually cut, all those things which I stacked on the table get moved to the ironing board. Right now, that includes a stack of patterns and WOFs, my big clear ruler, and a folded-up piece of cardboard that really needs to hit the trash can. There's also a blouse waiting to be ironed which is just laid across the bins to the right. (I hate ironing, so it's been there longer than it should.)Under the ironing board is a paper bag of I-don't-remember-what, a cut of sherpa fleece for dog napping, and you can see my \"basket\" trashcan in the foreground. I love this for a trashcan because it has a handle which makes it easy to grab and move near me when I switch between machines.Moving around, next is the cutting table. It's looking pretty good. The scraps on it are from the current WIP and also the nearly-complete purple knit test before that. Also visible are my reading glasses (ugh), the TV remote, the pattern I'm using, some pattern weights, and one of my magnetic pincushions (the other is on the machine table). Under the table is a rolling cart which used to be in the laundry room of my other house. The top shelf holds a bin with my cutting and writing implements, as well as my tape dispenser, and the pattern weights. The second shelf is rulers and curves (the ruler on the ironing board usually goes here but since I was just using it, it was still out — really!). The bottom shelf holds a couple old muslins I should toss, and hmm ... I forget what's in that plastic box. Whatever it is, I'm sure I need it. ;-)There is another short shelf at the end of the cutting table. On top of it are various adhesive sprays, a bin with other most-used notions (Wonder Tape, tape measures, gluesticks, etc.). Next to it is a pile of home dec stuff I want to work on one of these days. (Yeah, right.) The bins on the second shelf are lingerie supplies, the bins on the bottom are buttons and large knit scraps for preemie sewing.Behind the cutting table are the TV and big bookcase. The bookcase holds my sewing \"library,\" DVDs, and magazines. You can see my Burda WOFs stacked up on the 4th shelf. The white binders on that shelf hold the WOF newsprint \"At a Glance\" inserts so I can look at styles without dragging out each magazine.This door is just to the left of the big bookcase and leads to the bathroom. Next to that is my mirror corner. STP (tracing paper) rolls are in a basket (which you can't see) and in the corner next to the wicker trunk which holds my embroidery cards and CDs. That's a roll of poly batting that doesn't have a real home so there it sits.Almost full circle. The entry door is just to the right of the thread. The stash closet speaks for itself. ;-)This cabinet (which my father made BTW) actually sits at the top of the staircase and is just outside my sewing room. I included it here because right now it's a sewing room addition since it's holding (1) new fabric, (2) things I want to put on those shelves DH is promising, and (3) has the to-be-hung bulletin board leaning against it. The inside is actually not holding fabric. Yet.OK, who's next??"},
{"title": "Still diggin' the stripes, maybe?", "date": "Wednesday, February 21, 2007", "text": "Stripes isn't really what I had in mind for this top but I think maybe they're growing on me. (Ya think? This is the third stripe-y version, after all.) This latest fabric is the slinky that I bought about a month ago from www.fashionfabricsclub.com and the colors are much closer to the swatch below.I don't know why I keep picking the stripes because it means every piece has to be cut single layer and very carefully so the stripes match up. Well, actually, I do know why. It's because I'm still not willing to cut into the more-loved stuff yet. I wasn't thrilled with this slinky when it arrived so I was willing to sacrifice it if necesssary instead of granting it space in the stash. It's great quality slinky (acetate not poly), but it's just not my usual colors or pattern. It reads much more black and dark than shows up in these pics and I never wear black. Except now I do have a couple of pairs of black knit pants and well, I was thinking this could go with them since nothing else I have really does. That's my thought process anyway. I'm still ambivalent about the stripes though. Yes, they look good geometrically. But I'm not usually a wearer of stripes. Hmm.If I like how this third one fits, I think I'll go for #4 in a fabric/print I really like and I'll do short sleeves since we're slamming right into 80-degree temps and Spring this week after the much cooler temps just a couple of days ago. I doubt we'll be having any more truly cold weather again until next winter. But that's getting ahead of things. I need to finish this one first.I can tell already that this one will fit much better, just with the difference in fabric and stretch factor. I'll work on it a bit more today but this afternoon, Pepper, Chili, DH and I have an \"appointment\" at the dog park. Can't let all this great weather go to waste. It will be sticky and humid before we know it."},
{"title": "Sometimes It's the Fabric", "date": "Monday, February 19, 2007", "text": "Here's muslin #2. Yep, still a \"muslin\" but this time only due to a poor fabric choice.It think it looks pretty darn good on the dressform. But on me, not so much. The fabric is a poly \"faux slinky\" (for lack of a better description) without a lot of stretch/give and it accents every lump and bump because I cut it on the bias to get the chevron effects but with this fabric, there's less stretch on the bias than crossgrain. The top also wants to slide slightly upward at the bust like it doesn't fit even though I know in another knit it would be just fine. Again, the bias cut factor. There was a little voice whispering in my head about this fabric's stretch factor and I should've listened to it.I love the striping detail and it was because of those knitted-in stripes that I decided to try this fabric. That, and the fact that it's been taking up far too much room in my stash for way too long. (See pic here, 4th shelf down on the far right.) I bought it from a co-op and this one was a miss instead of a hit. I still have nearly 3 yards left and I'm thinking an unfitted cardigan and shell will be a better use for this. Or the trash can.Right now the bottom and sleeves aren't hemmed and the neckline isn't turned under. I think I'll spend 15 minutes finishing those details and send it to the donate pile. Then I'll try it again with a nicer knit. It's fast to cut out and sew now that I've got the details worked out.Responding to comments:Toya asked what I used to make the patterns. I use the Pattern Editor module of my Pattern Master Boutique software. Click here for more info on that. * * *Marji commented that maybe I should try one more paper trial of the twist because she didn't think my last pattern revision would work. The top two sections don't really twist around completely. It's more of an interlocking. If you follow the stripes in this version of the top, you should be able to see how that happens.* * *Others commented that it's fun (or informative or whatever) to follow along with me. Thank you, and I'm glad you think so. It's fun for me too. :-)* * *Also, thanks everyone for the nice comments about the party and our parenting. It's pretty easy to take the credit for being good parents when my kids are so great. So, anyone want some pizza? We have plenty. ;-)"},
{"title": "Sidetracked by Seussical", "date": "Sunday, February 18, 2007", "text": "No sewing yet this weekend as it was DS#1's performance weekend for his high school's production of Seussical, the Musical (a cute show based on the works of Dr. Seuss). DS is 3rd from the left in this photo and his girlfriend is 4th from the left. The show opened Thursday evening. We went to Friday's performance and had a great time.Earlier in the day on Friday, DS asked if we could host the Cast Party after the final performance Saturday night. He wanted it outside with a bonfire, food, drinks, etc. DS said to expect 50 or more guests. Because there were two Saturday performances, DS was not available for party assistance and so DH and I spent all of Saturday getting ready for it ourselves (we knew this going in, but we're suckers for our sons!).DH chainsawed some dead trees and fallen branches from the back of the property for firewood, used one of the ATVs to drag in some big stumps for seats and then improvised for others with cinder blocks and planks to supplement the camping chairs, picnic benches and patio chairs we have. We ordered 20 pepperoni pizzas to be picked up 30 minutes prior to party time and also had a few cases of sodas on ice in coolers, giant sandwiches cut up on trays, chips, yummy bakery cookies, a big decorated sheet cake, hot cocoa, and the makings for S'mores. We picked up tiki torches and balloons and red plastic tablecloths. We mowed the lawn, raked the firepit area, and set up a table and blinking lights for DS' stereo & speakers.Around 9:45 p.m., the first cars starting rolling down the tiki torch lined driveway. By 10:30, we had a medium-sized parking lot and a loud and lively group. DS was right about the head count. At one point, I counted 78 which included the kids in the cast and crew, plus a few teachers and parents.It was a great party! The skies were clear and bright and the temps were in the high 40's which was perfect for a bonfire. The hot cocoa and S'mores were a big hit. The pizzas, sandwiches and cookies disappeared before our eyes (although we have plenty of pizza leftovers for today). It was a whirlwind day pulling this all together and DH and I finally fell into bed about 3 a.m. but it was worth it. DS was grinning ear to ear all night and nearly every kid found me and/or DH and thanked us for hosting the party.The pic below is Kelli (DS#1's girlfriend), DS#1 in the middle, and DS#2 (who was a stagehand). That's Thing #2 standing in front of them, but I don't remember her real name.Today we'll clean up what we missed in the yard last night and then head to the dog park for a couple of hours. Later I'll finish sewing my second version of the Adrienne Vittadini Allegra Twist Front Top, which BTW, went together perfectly after the last pattern revision."},

My real mistake was not \"twisting\" the pattern itself when I was making it to allow the right side of the fabric to be facing outward after the twist. By keeping the right side out when sewing yesterday's prototype, the only result would be what I ended up with. A good pattern drafting learning experience for me, if nothing else.Here is my flawed pattern drawing. First, the middle section on the left isn't really there in the final pattern. It's in my drawing only to let me know where I started. Next, imagine folding the extension on the right side over to the left (like the page of a book) and so that it's back on top of the \"phantom\" middle section. That fold/flip puts the correct seams together but the wrong side of the fabric ends up facing outward. If you flip/twist so that the right side of the fabric stays on the right side of the top (which is what I did yesterday), the seams cannot meet up with their correct counterparts. Oops.I hope you can follow this. If not, print and cut out that flawed pattern from yesterday's entry (twice), marking Right Sides and Wrong Sides and then try it for yourself. You'll see the mistake right away. I should've tried it in paper like that first. ;-)What I should have done is to allow for both the twist *and* keeping the right side of the fabric on the right side by flipping the middle section extension, like this:Below is my new pattern drawing with the seam lines trued — and neckline raised per yesterday's test (in pink). I can now fully twist the extension, keep the right side of the fabric facing out, and still end up with the seams next to their correct counterparts.These are all of the latest pattern pieces for printing, with that twist change incorporated. (Click on it for a bigger, clearer view.) I also added some flare to the back peplum piece because after sewing the tester top, I decided that's what I wanted. IOW, a style change only.I'm printing my new pieces now and then I'll be cutting some better fabric. Not the really good stuff yet, just in case, but something that will be wearable if this now works as expected. Hmm. Maybe I should take my own advice and print out and test the paper miniatures first."},
{"title": "In Theory. (Yeah, but.)", "date": "Thursday, February 15, 2007", "text": "So I said that I thought the pattern pieces looked good … in theory. In reality, something didn't quite work.What's wrong with this picture?This is most certainly not a design feature that flatters me. ;-)I must've matched up wrong because I measured all the adjacent seams before I cut, and again after this mishap and the lengths were and are just fine. Which is why I'm thinking I inadvertently twisted a half rotation too much and sewed the wrong seams together. Another clue is the \"striping\" on the knit is not chevroning as I expected. Oops. I'll check all this out later today. It's just a tester top that I never wanted to be wearable, so no big deal.Other than that … erm … slight glaring issue, I'm liking it. The neckline is a little too low cut in this version but part of that is this cheesy test knit.* I'll probably get out my French curve and modify the pattern to raise it a smidge for the next one.The middle sections aren't as deep at the bust as I was expecting, compared to the original handknit inspiration top. (I think they'd be closer to my expectations at the sideseams if there actually were sideseams.) I'm still thinking on whether the lower seam should really land under my bust or not. If I lengthen that section, then I'm also visually enlarging my bust. Trust me, they don't need any more enlargement, visually or otherwise.  ;-) I'm leaning toward leaving that section as is. I don't think it reads \"ill-fitting empire\" when worn because there are two seams. I think instead that it reads \"interesting seaming.\" Of course, all of this is subject to change the next time I try it on.___________________________*I wish I had bought more of this icky knit. It was in Joann's clearance section at least 2 years ago and extremely cheap. It's much too thin/sheer to ever think about wearing out in the world but it's great for \"muslining\" knit patterns since it has pretty good recovery, sews nicely, and the knit-in striping is perfect for grainline checks. Oh well. No sense yearning for fabric not bought — especially fabric as awful as this."},
{"title": "First Draft — 2-Seam Twist", "date": "Tuesday, February 13, 2007", "text": "Here it is, the first draft of my version of Linda's Adrienne Vittadini Allegra Twist Front Top (say that 10 times fast!). I have no idea if this will actually work since I did it all by eye, but it looks good in theory for now.Apologies for the blurriness. Hopefully clicking on it for the full-size view will clear things up a bit. Later: It does. I just tried it. Whew!Here's what I did:1. I started with my TNT (tried-n-true) PMB (Pattern Master Boutique) darted top for knits.2. Next, I drew the seamlines onto my front pattern piece, and transferred 1/2 of the dart to each seam. Sort of the way you'd transfer a dart out at a sideseam. This is the part I'm \"iffy\" on, because I just winged it. I'm hoping a knit with good recovery will compensate for anything I screwed up. ;-)I adjusted seamlines as necessary so that adjoining seams would match in length; specifically, the two seams around the bust and the sideseam (to match the back piece).3. Then I duplicated my pattern pieces and flipped them so I could \"wing\" the twisty section. The original handknit top twisty section looks to be one piece if you follow the chevroning of the cable stitches, so I went with that. I might be totally off here but I had to start somewhere.4. Finally, I pulled in my TNT sleeve and back piece and decided to split the back into a peplum-y thing to match up with the front seaming. Obviously I still have peplums on my mind. My final pattern pieces look like this:I'm going to print it out, try it with an unloved knit, and see what I end up with. I'm not quite sewing again yet, but I'm getting close."},

{"title": "Chilly, Chili & Chili", "date": "Thursday, February 8, 2007", "text": "It's been a bit chilly outside here the last few mornings and evenings (beautiful in the middle of the day though), which makes me crave some warm-you-up dinners from the crockpot. This is Cowboy Chili in the works, and how I came to have this recipe is actually sewing-related.When I first became obsessed with sewing about 5-1/2 years ago, I bought a used Viking Rose. It was a great machine and certainly a huge step up from my very basic Kenmore mechanical. I loved that machine, but soon started coveting a Designer 1. (My dealer is very good at holding classes that make you want to spend money!) Soon after, I lucked into a side web design job that paid Big Bucks. Since it was bonus income, I spent the money on a luxury item — a new Designer 1. But that meant I needed to sell my Rose because, as some of you may remember, I was sewing in a closet at that time and had no room for another machine. (Yes, I did somehow manage to squeeze my coverstitch machine in later!) I listed the Rose on Ebay and sold it to a very nice woman about my age. We had some email correspondence before, during and after the sale and at some point the conversation went in the direction of cooking for a house full of \"men.\" She shared a recipe that has since become one of my guys' absolute favorite meals. Yep, the Cowboy Chili shown above. I've changed the ingredients around a bit, but the basics are pretty much the same. The original recipe (and how I've changed it) is below. I guarantee this will be a hit with any meat-eating male in the house. This current batch has been in the crockpot since 8 AM and the house is already smelling delicious. Later I'll be making some bread in the bread machine to go with it.And, what's one Chili without the other? ;-) The poochies are still getting along great, although we need to make sure that Pepper gets her share of hugs and loves, since Chili wiggles his way to the front-and-center of any petting session! I'm taking them both to the vet this afternoon. Chili for a basic checkup and Pepper for a follow-up after her surgery. She's not looking so much like FrankenPuppy anymore as the shaved area on her forehead is filling back in. Her stitches are still intact though, so she does have a little more healing to go before she's 100% back to her usual cuteness.Here they are, both eagerly waiting for … what else, but a Treat! (I had to bribe them so they'd both be looking at me for the photo.) Chili has made huge progress with his commands. He now knows Sit, Down, Shake, and Come. Next on the list is Roll Over. He'll be a natural for that one. Pepper used to Roll Over, but now she's so plump she gets stuck. ;-) I'm curious to see what she weighs at the vet today since her diet and exercise have improved a thousand-fold now that \"Mr. Spoiling Dad\" (a/k/a DH) isn't in charge anymore.* * * * *Cowboy Chili (original)Brown 2 lb. ground beef. Add 1 chopped onion, 4 chopped green onions, 1/4 c. celery, 1/2 clove garlic, 1/4 bell pepper. Saute until soft.Add salt and pepper to taste, 1 T chili powder, 1/4 tsp. sugar. Stir well. Add 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 16 oz can tomato juice, 2 cans drained whole kernel corn, 1 can Rotel Ranch Style chili beans, and 6 medium potatoes peeled and cubed.

Cook until potatoes are done (approx 30-40 minutes).Cowboy Chili (my changes and for the crockpot)Stir all of the following together in a large crockpot and cook on High all day (about 6-8 hours) or Auto Alternating (high/low) if you have that option on your crockpot.

The extra can of diced tomatoes and tomato paste work just as well.We also prefer stew beef over ground beef. Chicken is a good meat alternative for a different flavor."},
{"title": "I am SO going to make this!", "date": "Wednesday, February 7, 2007", "text": "Have you seen Linda's completed Adrienne Vittadini Allegra Twist Front Top?? It's gorgeous!I love all twisty tops but I think this one has the potential to look the best on me, since it's not a deep V neckline and the twist is more subtle, above the cleavage area instead of right in the middle of it. Plus, look at those opportunities for darts! I don't knit so I'm going to try creating it for a knit fabric and with sleeves. I'm sure I've got a pattern around here somewhere that will be a good jumping off point, whether it's a commercial pattern or something created in my software.I read Linda's blog entry this morning and this top has been on my mind all day. Looks like it's going to be high in the order of the What To Make Next list. But since I'm short on time this (already half over) week, I'm thinking I'll sew up a very quick TNT tee by the weekend and leave this one for next week. But don't hold me to that. I may not be able to wait. ;-)Meanwhile, this rayon knit jumped into my Textile Studios shopping cart this morning. I swear, I was helpless."},
{"title": "This and that", "date": "Monday, February 5, 2007", "text": "I never know whether to respond to comments by making a comment myself or to answer in the main blog stuff. So today, I'm answering here and then rambling about other things.Dog park:  Nope, we don't have to pay directly. It's a county park and so our yearly county taxes help to fund this and other county parks.Dogs: Thanks for putting up with me going on (and on) about Chili and Pepper and thanks for all your nice comments. We're still thrilled with our new family member and I'm not sure if he could get any cuter but he sure keeps on trying. I've also enjoyed seeing and reading about some of your pooches and other pets.Tornados:  Thank you all for thinking of me. We're south and to the west of where they hit. We were lucky but lots of people were not. Dutch sewing terms: Thank you for all the offers for translation, etc. I'm sure I'll be taking you up on that!Topstitching:  Someone asked how I get it so straight ... I probably wouldn't be able to without my edge stitching foot and my edge joining foot! The former has a rudder on the right side of the foot and the latter, a rudder in the middle. The rudders ride in the \"ditch\" and I use my needle positions to set the spacing. Using these feet, topstitching is almost mindless and very relaxing for me since it's pretty much just straight stitching over a seam that's already been sewn.General:  Thanks for the commiseration on the jacket frustrations and the head cold. You already know that jacket is done now and I'm loving it, and I'm happy to report the cold is almost done too. Just a bit of lingering sniffles and an intermittent cough.Tonight is Superbowl food leftovers for dinner. I've got a whole tray of nachos ready to bake, some Buffalo wings, and cheese/meats/crackers. (The beer didn't survive though!) We're also going to be heating up the other leftovers from the past few days. The boys may complain about \"leftovers\" but unless they're volunteering to make something else, it's my vote that counts. ;-) The game was good to watch, since we were mostly rooting for the Colts and Tony Dungy who got a really raw deal when he was booted away from our hometown Bucs and Gruden moved in for what should've been Dungy's first SB victory. But honestly, I like both teams a lot and would've been happy either way.The commercials were a little disappointing though, do you agree? Although I did like the Blockbuster \"mouse,\" the faux dalmation, Oprah and Dave, and the regular joe winning ad with the sports fanatics feeling sad at the end of the season. What were your favorites? I'm sure I've forgotten some other good ones.And does anyone really like Prince? Sorry if you do, but I'm just not getting him and the Superbowl combination (like the halftime show ever makes sense!) I did feel bad that he was completely doused in the rain during his performance though.I did write up my review for the jacket, but if you've been following along here, you've read/seen it all. I think that's enough rambling for one post, don't you?"},
{"title": "Men!", "date": "Sunday, February 4, 2007", "text": "They can be so goofy. I had just put on the jacket to take some pics this morning and met DH coming up the stairs. He says, \"So it's done now?\" And I said, \"Uh, yes. And by the way, I was *wearing* it last night when we went to the store and walked the dogs.\" Him: \"Really? Well, it looks very nice.\" Yeah, sneaky way to escape that one. ;-)So, here's a pic of me in the jacket. The color is off and I look as purple as the jacket for some reason that isn't happening in real life, but otherwise it's not a completely bad shot. Belinda asked me, if after all the work, whether I liked it or if it needed some time in the \"Magic Wardrobe.\" I'm happy to report that I love it and all the time spent was worth it. I really did enjoy the project a lot. It's good to be challenged and I feel like I've learned a few things in the process.I spent some time this morning cleaning up the disaster a/k/a the sewing room and now I'm ready to start thinking about what's next. So many choices! But since it's Superbowl Sunday and the pregame stuff is already on, I don't think I'll be making a whole lot of progress on that today. After today, no more football for months and months. Sob."},
{"title": "Mail Call", "date": "Saturday, February 3, 2007", "text": "I bought these pattern magazines on Ebay about a week ago and they arrived yesterday from Germany. Inspiration is running rampant around in my head again. I absolutely love the patterns in Knip•XL. Patrones comes in at #2 for me. Diana is good, but very classic, conservative, so it's #3. Modetrende is a total yawner. The styles are on the frumpy, baggy side of things. IOW, what someone who is not plus-sized thinks plus-sized women should be wearing. Hmpf.It's going to be interesting trying to figure out what pattern pieces are what in Knip•XL since it's a Dutch language magazine. I think I'll be OK without instructions for most of the patterns, as long as I can be sure I'm using the correct pieces. Anyone know any remedial sewing Dutch?One thing of note, look at the models Knip•XL uses. Actual plus-size models! And they have boobs! ;-) I haven't unfolded the actual pattern sheets yet, but the line drawings make me think these patterns are drafted for at least a C cup. The bust darts look quite ample.* * * * *Jacket update: I wore the new jacket out to the store and a quickie dog walk around a nearby neighborhood this evening. It started drizzling on us so now I have nice new, WET jacket. It's dry again now and no worse for wear. One thing I noticed while wearing it is that I love the sleeve length. For once, I have a denim jacket with sleeves that end where I want them to. As they say — it's the little things, but this one definitely makes me feel good. (The rest of the jacket fits pretty darn perfect too.)Yes, it's done. It's finally done! I hope you haven't been holding your breath all this time. ;-)Here's the back view:This pic shows the weird shaped front facings. (And the stabilizer still on the backside of my buttonholes.) This is the quasi-lining for the back. The middle section has an ease pleat. The bottom section is hanging free. I haven't yet decided whether to attach it to the jacket hem with a few thread loops. I'll see how it wears without them. Here's the jacket splayed out on the (thread snip covered) floor. The back lining is sewn into the neckline, armholes and sideseams. There is a separate collar stand. I'm not sure if this was entirely necessary, but it looks nice. ;-) Yoke, pocket flap, and notched collar … which I did not widen, Katharine, because I decided extra width would overlap the pocket flaps. And the sleeve placket, which I sewed on the right way the first time. Whew! Speaking of the sleeves, they eased in great first try. I think, no — I know, I was stalling on finishing this because of those sleeves. But I shouldn't have worried. I did leave the seam allowances at 5/8\" and sewed two rows of gathering stitches, pinned carefully, and voila! Whew again. ;-) Lots and lots of topstitching on this thing. I topstitched nearly every seam. Actually, I think I did hit every seam, including the two upper sleeve seams because at that point, I figured why not. I do like the way it looks. It's too bad the photos aren't doing justice to the topstitching thread. It's a taupe-y color which matches some of the paisley shades and shows up more in real life.I'll take pics of me in it and write up a review soon. Remember to click on the pics for the larger versions. You can also go here to see all the photos from this project."},
{"title": "Nope, not yet", "date": "Friday, February 2, 2007", "text": "Still no completed jacket. The best laid plans and all … Trips to the dog park and the drugstore won out over the sewing room last night. I really wanted to burn off some of the dog energy and was thinking of taking the pooches to the park this morning but the weather for today was forecast as yucky (which came true) so we made an impromptu trip to the park last night instead. Plus DS#2 came home from school with a completely untouched lunchbox and still feeling bad, which meant restocking on the cold meds so he could get through school today. Staying home and then trying to catch up on a week's worth of school would be more overwhelming than being there with a stuffy head, cough and sneezes so I really wanted him to go if he felt at all well enough. He did, and I'm sure he'll spend the weekend resting some more and catching up on homework. I can't remember the last time he felt this bad for this long. Poor baby. This cold is a doozy, I know that first-hand.On today's agenda:  Some paperwork, some real paying work, some coop stuff, and then (hopefully) finishing the #*@! jacket once and for all. I've actually enjoyed working on it and I think I will like the finished jacket a lot. I'm just frustrated that it's taking me so long to get it finished.

All that's left to do is to sew the sleeve pieces together, topstitch 'em and then set the completed sleeves into the armholes. Oh, and then topstitch on the yokes. In the top photo, I was remembering my goofed-up muslin sleeves and making sure I have the placket band going in the correct direction and attached at the appropriate place. I don't want to be buttoning up my sleeves at my inner wrists. ;-) I'm pretty sure I have it right so after dinner … I. Will. Finish. The. Jacket. After I check the plackets once more, of course."},
{"title": "Fitting in", "date": "Wednesday, January 31, 2007", "text": "Chili thinks the \"Sit\" command involves chairs. Velvet chairs. ;-) Pepper is content on her usual fleece pillow in front of the window.Training is going well. Chili now comes when called with \"Come\" (or the usual kissy-pucker calling an animal sound) and the whistling is long forgotten. He's learned to Sit on command, and not just on chairs. ;-) He sits before we put on his leash, he sits when we need to take it off, and he sits to wait for the door to open. He's starting to grasp Lay Down too. He's a smart pooch who just needs some guidance.The training sessions are hilarious. First, there's Chili, all wiggly and goofy and so eager to please so he can get that delicious morsel of ... doggie kibble. No need for special treats here. Hand feeding him anything does the job. So far, we know that in addition to the kibble, Chili eats raisins, carrots, lettuce, croutons, acorns (outside), spiders (yay!), and any crumb on the floor he's sniffed out. And then there's Pepper, who goes through all the commands I'm giving Chili because she hasn't figured out yet that I'm not talking to her. Or maybe she has and she just wants to guilt me into a kibble morsel for her too. It's working. Hmmm. Who's training who?Both dogs continue to get along great. They play with each other during the day, around naptimes and walk times. Chili has SO MUCH energy (as do most JRTs) that we need to go on little explorations around the yard during the day. It's good for me and Pepper too, so I don't mind. Although I won't be taking another 2-leash stroll off our property again without help until Chili learns better leash manners. On Monday, it was all I could do to control him from darting across the street to greet the boxers and dobermans in the neighbor's fenced-in yard or the horses next to them without getting tangled in a leash web and landing on my butt. Pepper is fine without a leash, but I had her on one in case she wandered when I was attending Chili and so her leash was getting mixed in the tangle too. Whooeee ... what a workout that was! ;-)I'll be working on the jacket some more this morning. Maybe I'll even get to the point of working on the sleeves. Hey, it could happen."},
{"title": "Tutu, Revisited", "date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2007", "text": "The topstitching and serged seams are now all ripped out. I did that this afternoon and then I took the dogs for a walk to recharge my batteries. It's actually cold here today so the weather was perfect for that. While walking, I picked up \"hitchhikers\" all over my shoes and ankles. So after I was back in the house, I spent the next 30 minutes ripping *those* out. Seemed to be a theme today. ;-)Below are two pics of the jacket before I took it apart (sloppily arranged on the dressform). The tutu effect is much more pronounced in the back view, and this is because the bias of the lining peplum is fighting with the bias of the jacket peplum. They're both cut with the same exact \"grain\" (bias angle), but they just don't want to play nice. There's plenty of length in the lining, so it's not that.The pic below is after all the unstitching. The lining and jacket are pinned together at the sideseams but the lining is left hanging free at the bottom edge. Much, much better.So tomorrow, I will baste it all together and check it again. If it works the way I think it will, I'll just hand-tack the lining hem in a few key spots. Ewwww. Handsewing. ;-)  And by the time I'm done, the weather will probably be warm again. The Nyquil is kicking in (yawn), so I'm off to bed.The jacket is inching toward wadder status. After sewing up the sideseams and topstitching all around the edges, the peplum is sticking out way too much when I have the jacket unbuttoned (or, rather, unpinned, since I haven't actually done buttons or buttonholes yet) and it looks like a tutu. Not what I need. Grrrr. I think the stiffness of the denim is part of the problem and I also think the full back lining is going to have to go. Catching it into the sideseams is adding to the sticky-out factor. I'm NOT looking forward to ripping out serged seams and topstitching so I'm just going to glare at it for a while.Meanwhile, my cold is still hanging on and DS#2 has been home from school for the past two days with a fever and nausea.

The inside body is completely finished now and my plan did work out.After the insides were connected, I trimmed seam allowances, pressed and turned it all right side out. It was the moment of truth for my first notched collar and I have to say that I think I did pretty darn good. ;-) There are no ripples or puckers and the inside corner joins all come together as they should. There is a lot to be said for accurate marking and pinning.I still need to topstitch all of those edges but just as I was about to start, the main lightbulb in my studio burned out and it was too dark to go on. So I moved Zillie into the bathroom for a photo session and then started this blog entry. DH has now replaced the bulb but I think I'll call it quits for the night and pick up again in the morning.                                       * * * * *The rest of this entry is about our trip to the dog park today after lunch … just a little fair warning. ;-)Even though we have a big yard, I wanted to go to see how Chili does off leash without risking him zooming into the woods. This dog park is about a 15-minute drive from our house. It's approximately 5 acres, divided into two fenced-in sections. One for big dogs and the other for the little guys. There were TONS of people and pooches there today since the weather was perfect — sunny and about 65 degrees. I think we saw every breed of small dog in our section today. Beagles, Bostons, Yorkies, Pugs, Shelties, Dachsies, Min Pins, Westies, and more.Chili is Mr. Social. Pepper is a bit more reserved. By the time we left a couple of hours later, Chili had introduced himself to every single dog there, and to the girls twice! Apparently, he's still not quite reconciled with the neutering. ;-) Chili must've run 20 miles at top speed while we were there. He *never* slowed down. I don't think I'm going to be trusting him off leash for a long while yet. But since we have the 2nd retractable leash now, I'll be taking the dogs on regular walks off our property. Both Pepper and I can use the exercise.Now on to the photos …Here's Chili playing tag with 2 new friends soon after our arrival. DS#1 and Pepper are jogging in the background near the fence.Comin' on to one of the little ladies.A quick swim break. Looks like baths won't be a problem with Chili.Football with the guys. And that's *not* Chili in the foreground. We actually know the owners of Chili's \"twin\" and the little black/white Jack Russell behind directly him — he's our mechanic and she's the receptionist at the boys' dentist (they're married and own both dogs together). We spent a lot of time talking with them and comparing our JRTs.Chili is in this shot (he's on the left of his twin) along with DS#1, DS#2, and DH. The guys and the dogs tossed the football and/or chased after it for at least 45 minutes straight. It was quite hilarious to watch them all trying to get the football at the same time and if any of the JRTs managed to get the ball, they kicked it around on the ground like a soccer ball and were quite indignant to have to give it up to a human.This dog just cracked me up so I had to include it. Do you think he knows what he looks like? Poor baby. I know he really just wanted to play football. ;-)This was taken about an hour ago. I came downstairs to ask DH to change the lightbulb for me and found him and Chili snoozing together on the recliner. They were both so sound asleep they didn't even stir when the flash was going off. ;-) I think Chili has settled in with his new family quite well."},
{"title": "The jacket slowly progresses", "date": "Saturday, January 27, 2007", "text": "Without thinking too hard, I can come up with many excuses for why this jacket project was stalled most of today (head cold, new doggie playtime, reading some of my \"new\" sewing books which have been arriving for the past few days) but the main reason is because I was in a state of severe frustration with it and I needed time to work through in my head exactly how to proceed. Let me back up …Problem #1: I didn't read the cutting chart closely enough when I was first cutting out. If I had, I would've noticed that the back yoke and peplum pieces were to be cut twice. Once as the garment and another time as a facing. Oops.Problem #2: I was out of fabric. I mean down to tiny scraps. I had to get creative just to cut the 2 collar stands. I definitely didn't have enough for those \"new\" pieces. Plus, I really didn't want another layer of denim to sew through and even worse, this denim is flocked so I would have Velcro butt if the flocked side is worn against my backside.Problem #3: I had already sewn the two stands to the two collar pieces, attached the undercollar unit to the jacket body, trimmed seam allowances, and topstitched when I later figured out that the Burda WOF instructions wanted me to sandwich one whole collar unit (top and undercollar) in between the facing and jacket. Too late! So the WOF method was out. As if it was ever actually in, seeing how my eyes cross every time I read those instructions.So then I decided that maybe I'd just line the whole thing. I was already sewing it together in the way that you would for bagging a lining. Except …Problem #4: The front facing pieces which incorporate the lapels are \"all in one\" and thus shaped very oddly and so it would be a big headache to redraft those pieces to match up with the front side panels that would be needed to fully line the jacket. Plus, like the collar pieces, they were already sewn, trimmed, etc. In the pic below, the jacket is turned inside out and you can see the shaping of the front facings.So, many times today I went up to the sewing room, fiddled with the jacket pieces, thought about solutions (sneezed, coughed) and then left the room. My head was already stuffy with this cold and was too full to process this information. But I got my night-owl second wind a couple of hours ago and I think I've got a workable solution that not only should work but will look good on the inside too.Below is a pic of the facing pieces the instructions want (right sides together, with the bottom facing just pinned into place to show this). Per Burda, the top facing hem would be turned and handstitched to the bottom seam allowance of the yoke and the peplum facing to the bottom seam allowance of the middle section. Stupid looking, isn't it?So what I've come up with is this: I'm going to make a middle back section from the lining/facing fabric, quasi-bag the front facings and collar units (already done), and quasi-interline the back. When finished, the shoulder seams will be encased wrong sides together within the back yoke and front facings (like you would a shirt with a back yoke). The back \"lining\" seam allowances will be sandwiched between lining and garment (IOW wrong sides together), and I'll sew the back lining sideseams and armhole seams with the corresponding jacket seams, like an underlining. I think I'm also going to incorporate a pleat in the middle section of the back to allow for spread when wearing it. The peplum is semi-bias so it will have some give. It's too late to incorporate a pleat in the back yoke but my posture is pretty darn erect so I don't think that area will be a big problem. But if it is and it rips, I'll just deal with it later.So there you have it. Progress, very little. ;-)"},
{"title": "More Gratuitous Pooch Pics", "date": "Friday, January 26, 2007", "text": "I am really sewing today, just not as much as I planned. The jacket won't be done by tonight's dinner out with my sister/BIL, but definitely before the weekend is over. So far, so good. I've attached the collar stands to both collar and undercollar pieces and topstitched them. I attached the undercollar unit to the jacket body, which included one-half of the notched collar construction and all pieces fit like a glove (or jacket!). Whew! I hope it goes as well for the layer the public sees. I've pinned the sideseams and am about to have a quick try-on session just to be sure the fit is still what I'm expecting. DH came home with dog treats and a nametag so we were interrupted. ;-)Someone asked how old Chili is. The shelter estimated 3 years old, but after 24 hours with him, we disagree. I'd put him between 1 and 2 years, an old 1 or a young 2. He's still got a lot of puppy behavior (the good kind), and Pepper is treating him like a \"kid.\" He's completely housebroken which is great, although since he was only neutered the day before we brought him home, he has tried to \"mark\" a few areas inside. But we're keeping him in close scrutiny and distracting him from doing that with a spray bottle and shaker can. Only one inside marking attempt today (so far). This is normal dog behavior and while annoying to us humans, at least we don't have real floors here yet, right? I can see that as he gets more and more settled (and that testosterone dispurses!), his desire to mark inside is decreasing substantially so I'm confident this will not be an ongoing problem.Chili definitely needs some obedience training (sit, stay, etc.) but we've learned that he comes when whistled at so we'll gradually turn that into come-when-called and train him for the other commands. Jack Russells are smart dogs so I expect he'll be a quick learner … especially if his new favorite doggie treats are involved.Both of the dogs have been up in my sewing room with me this morning. I had a folded pile of a flannel pants muslin and scraps under the ironing board. Chili went over to it, rearranged things with his nose to make a nest, and promptly settled in for a nap. My new dog loves fabric — He's definitely a keeper!Here he is! He's still settling in, sniffing everything, and licking Pepper to death (she's enjoying that).Pepper is not too photogenic this week, as her forehead has been shaved and stitched due to a minor surgery yesterday to remove a cyst. But she's been happy with her little brother since they first met and I think they're going to be great friends.Chili is a bit skinny and Pepper … well … not so much. We didn't realize the extent of Pepper's plumpness until Chili arrived for a side-by-side comparison. Looks like it's time for salads for Pepper and protein shakes for Chili. ;-)"},
{"title": "Making mountains out of .... well, mountains", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2007", "text": "Here's my front panel piece laying on the table. Yep, that's an FBA in 3D relief. Yep, it's a mountain. It cracked me up so I thought I'd share.  ;-)Only a little progress on the jacket so far. I've been busy running errands and … getting ready for our new pooch. We found him at the county shelter today and he'll be coming home with us tomorrow. Just in time for my sister's visit. We plan things well, don't we?The new dog will be named Chili — to go with Pepper, naturally. Chili … Pepper. Get it? DS#1's idea. (He being the Red Hot Chili Peppers #1 fan.) Chili is a Jack Russell Terrier, and an incredibly cute happy bundle of dog love. We were planning on another girl dog but he was just too irresistible. We'll pick him up after my sister leaves for her hotel and I'm sure we'll spend the rest of the night settling in with him and reassuring Pepper that she's still our #1 Princess. Both dogs will be recovering from surgery, Pepper from a cyst removal from her forehead and Chili from neutering. It will be a low-key evening. The timing all around could be better, but things have a way of working out so I'm not too worried.So, back to the jacket. There were no instructions for any interfacing, which I'm assuming is because it's to be made from denim. Since my chosen denim has a bit of Lycra stretch, I decided to interface the undercollar and the front facings/pocket flaps where there will be buttons. This was my set-up yesterday, watching ESPN's morning radio show. Yep, watching (listening to) radio on the TV.Here's the current status photo and report. The front and back panels are sewn together and topstitched. (The topstitching isn't showing up very well in these nighttime pics.) As you can see, I decided to go with the upper pocket flaps and have sewn them into the yoke seam and then topstitched. I also sewed the lower pockets and flaps into the front peplum seam, which is where I quit tonight. I'll attach both peplum pieces in the morning before my sister arrives. I used the pocket/flap instructions from a Kwik Sew denim jacket pattern so I wouldn't tear my hair out. It was easy-peasy with those. I was actually getting the Burda instructions, but I wasn't agreeing with them. The pocket lining fabric was a Royal Pain, though. Icky slippery poly stuff. Wonder Tape to the rescue, whew! The upper flaps are fake pockets. I would never put anything into an actual pocket there so I left them off.The temperature is dropping tonight, and I won't have a new jacket to wear tomorrow as planned. Sigh. But dinner has been pushed to Friday night anyway so maybe I'll have it then as I'll have all of tomorrow night and Friday daytime to finish it. We'll see. I'm not going to rush."},

When you figure in cutting a separate undercollar, sleeve bands from measurements instead of a pattern piece, and interfacing, I know I'm well above 20 by now. Whew! My hands are tired. But the jacket has been cut out and I'm about to go sew for a couple of hours before I meet up with DS#1 to pick up tickets to a concert he's going to on Sunday.****Red Hot Chili Peppers, and since he used my credit card and Ticketmaster didn't let us know until after the purchase was complete that they weren't mailing tickets, I have to be present when they're picked up at the Will Call. I'm glad it's not an out-of-town concert like the RHCP show he went to in NJ late last year. Then we're off to the Pound to look at pups. I doubt we'll find The One since I'm picky, but you never know — sad puppy eyes are hard to resist. Oh, and no, we're not replacing Pepper. We're looking for a \"little sister\" that was promised when we moved into the Money Pit over a year ago. I went ahead with Fabric 3 in the photo below. It never officially made it into the stash and instead has been waiting in a neat \"on deck\" pile on the floor since I bought/prewashed it. I had been thinking of maybe using one of the print denims in the stash, but this paisley was still calling the loudest so it won. I probably won't wear it with the purple jeans from Denim #2 below, though. It's just too much purple for my eyes.One of my errands yesterday was a trip to Joann's for thread and buttons. Thread was easy, but buttons. Grrrr. I hate that Joann's is the only local venue for buttons. Even if I was a button stasher, I probably still would've needed to buy for this project since it calls for 15 buttons. (No, I'm not even going to think about 15 buttonholes on denim right now.) I did see a few possibilities in J's button aisles, but none with 15 in stock. Sigh. I ended up buying bronze-colored bachelor buttons (think jeans waistbands) so I'll be whacking my buttons into place instead of sewing them. I left J's with only thread and buttons, in case you were wondering.So, I'm off and running …"},
{"title": "Last look at muslin #2 (time to fish or cut bait)", "date": "Sunday, January 21, 2007", "text": "I've sewn the sleeve in and it's a keeper. The only changes I still need to make are (1) to shorten the sleeve about 3/4\" above the elbow (already tested with a pinned tuck) and (2) to narrow the shoulders a little bit more. In the pic below, I had already narrowed it by 1/2\". I think I need 1/4\" to 3/8\" more. I'm confident in these changes so I'll just transfer them to the pattern pieces and cut the final fabric next.The sleeve & armhole notches/marks/landmarks lined up very well, except for the back arm seam. It's supposed to hit below the yoke but mine doesn't. I've decided it never will because of my square shoulder alteration, which adds fabric above that landmark. The sleeve fits well and looks good and that's what matters.This last pic is of the muslin with the undercollar sewn on to test my notched collar skills (cough, cough) and to see the whole effect. I'm getting too used to these lapels with seam allowances still showing so the actual lapel width is probably going to look too narrow to me. I think I'll sew the width wider than the pattern dictates because I do like that wider look.I'm off to watch some football in between transferring all of the last tweaks to my pattern pieces. Go Saints! Although I like the Bears too, so I'll be happy either way."},
{"title": "Presenting Muslin #2", "date": "Sunday, January 21, 2007", "text": "Muslin #2 is mostly done. I still have to sew in the sleeve, give the collar a practice run and redraft the front facing to match my alterations, but it's late and I'm going to save all that for tomorrow. I'm 99.99% sure that once I align the sleeve into the armhole the way it is actually supposed to go, the twisty problem will be gone.My final tweaks to the bodice are perfect on the front (although it's hard to tell on Zillie) and near-perfect on the back. Moving the princess seams inward was a good call. The bust area fits better and doesn't make the girls look as \"widespread\" as before. The back fits and falls much nicer too. There are still some wrinkles back there but I really don't want an overfitted denim jacket so I'm not going to obsess about them. I'll be wearing it open most of the time and I won't see them in real life anyway. Some of the wrinkles are also because I decided to not shorten the shoulder to waist length any more than the 3/8\" I already removed. If the waist seam sits at my actual waist in the front, I look like I'm even more all bust than usual. The additional length, even though it affects the back fit a bit, is a better illusion for both sides of me.Unfortunately, I *still* sewed the #$@!! lower section onto the sleeve backwards. Or, more correctly, I sewed the left band to the right sleeve. At least this time I didn't sew it on upside down too, so the mystery flare is gone. Obviously, I will need to baste the real ones in place and triple-check them before I commit. ;-) Yeah, I'll probably still sew one on wrong.Claire asked in a comment about my muslin fabric. For this jacket, I'm using actual unbleached muslin purchased by the bolt from Joann's with a coupon. Amazingly, this bolt is the first true muslin fabric I've used for fitting. In the past, I've used clearance and Walmart ugly cottons and ugly knits. But I've used up pretty much all of the cheap uglies in my stash so it was time for a restocking and I decided muslin was better to mark on, cheap, and easier to store.My final jacket fabric is a stretch woven. The muslin is not. I chose to use non-stretch muslin for fitting because I don't want the Lycra in the final fabric to be compensating for fit issues. This way, the Lycra will provide an increased comfort factor but not an increased fit level. At least that's the plan."},
{"title": "Gearing Up for Muslin #2", "date": "Saturday, January 20, 2007", "text": "I'm making progress. Tortoise-type progress, but progress nonetheless.I'm pretty sure I figured out what happened with the sleeve but I won't know for sure until I sew the second muslin, which is happening right after I finish this post. I aligned the underarm seam of the sleeve with the sideseam of the bodice. You know ... how you usually do that. But for this jacket, those seams are not supposed to align and are, in fact, offset. And there is a definite mark (notch) to tell you that, if you pay attention. I did not. That's what I get for thinking I'm so smart and not looking over the details. ;-).The other problem with the sleeve is that it is too tight. It's OK with nothing under the muslin but as soon as I tried it on with a tee, no way Jose. Which called for another head-scratching session, because the sleeves are 2-piece sleeves and with the \"built-in\" elbow dart, they do not pin together flat. I thought about what to do and came up with this:(Remember to click on the photos to enlarge them for detail viewing.)I pinned the sleeve pieces together so that the grainlines were parallel and the armscye seam was fluid.Then I adjusted the bicep width like this (my alterations are marked with red pen on the pattern):IOW, I slashed across the bicep \"latitude\" and straight down from the top center mark plus a couple more \"pizza\" slices in the upper arm area, leaving hinges as necessary at the seamlines.Then I filled in the spreads with more STP and raised the sleevecap back up to close to what it was before the alteration and trued any seams that needed it.Other alterations included moving the princess lines closer to center front by slashing/spreading the side front panel and slashing/overlapping the center front panel. This is roughly pinned at the seam on your left.Finally, depressing as it is, I still needed more hip room for the jacket to hang nice in the back. A center back seam would've been ideal but I didn't want to change the look of the jacket back. (Can you see where I tried that and then Scotch-taped it back together?) Instead, I slashed through the peplum at and up through the back panel seams. I then added 1/2 of each spread to the bottom of each side of the panels tapering to zero by about the mid-high point, and I spread the peplum to match the new width. My mind says this will work. We'll see how Muslin #2 really looks.Now, off the computer and up to the sewing machine where Muslin #2 is waiting, cut and ready to be sewn."},

Um, thanks ladies. ::wink::First, the Rules:• Someone Tags you• You post 5 things about yourself that you haven't already mentioned on your blog• You tag 5 more bloggersSo, here goes. Grab the coffee, it will probably be boring because I'm not about to put my wilder escapades out for the general public. Doesn't that sound intriguing?? Good. It was supposed to. I'm so boring now that I probably don't even remember any wild escapades. Maybe.1. I hate beets. I love every other vegetable, but I can't stand beets. I think it's because my father used to make me eat them. This, from a father who himself wouldn't ever eat brocolli, lima beans, and other things. I used to cram it all into my mouth, excuse myself to the bathroom, and spit them all out down the toilet. ;-)2. I honeymooned in Rio de Janeiro. Coming up on 20 years ago in 3-1/2 short months.3. I totalled my father's car the day I got my driver's license. Um. Yep. And had to call him to come get me. The thought of which made me start hyperventilating. Which in turn necessitated a call to the paramedics. My dad, who was always very particular about his things and his cars especially and who was never wrong, secretly hated that car he bought (it had been a lemon since Day One but he'd never admit it out loud) and he never said a cross word to me about it. I think he was glad to be rid of it. ;-)4. I cried when I found out (prebirth) that my first baby was a boy and not a girl and then 3 years later cried when the doc told me my second was going to be a girl. I love both of my boys (yes, the doc was wrong) very much and can't now imagine a life with daughters. It's good to be Queen. ;-)5. I went to 9 different schools between grades 7-12. My dad kept putting in for promotions which took us to different places. A couple were \"temporary\" private schools until my parents bought a house and registered me in the proper district. I hated it and vowed to never do that do my children. We've lived here for almost 17 years and my sons have been in the same school district with the same friends the whole time. We moved to a \"new\" (different) house in late-2005, but it's only about a mile from our old house so nothing changed for them.You're IT! ... Right Sides Together, Sew West, Skipping Stitches, Girls in the Garden, and Crazed Sewer.Jacket MuslinWell, here it is. I think Zillie's bra needs a bit more stuffing because this fits my bust better than hers and hers used to match mine better. Must've gotten squished during previous fitting sessions (hers, not mine!).Good things:1. It mostly fits and I think I like the style lines on my body. The jury is still out, though, until the fit is improved. I think I may need to lengthen the peplum just a bit since I like where it's hitting now and there's no hem sewn.2. It goes around me and the center fronts meet.3. The real sewing will be mostly easy (see note below on new instructions).Bad things:1. I did something seriously wacko with the sleeve and will investigate that within the hour. The sleeve on its own fit with me sliding it up my arm. The sleeve after being sewn in feels (and fits) like it's sewn in backwards (which could very well be!) and I notice the seams didn't land per the line drawing of the back. Definitely operator error on this one.2. The lower section of the sleeve is also weird. It's flared, and the photo and line drawing are not. Possibly I sewed it upside down. Another thing to check, which I'll do by comparing those teeny-tiny little numbers on the pattern pieces (and which I probably should've done before sewing). This whole sleeve business is made harder with WOF's scant instructions and severe lack of illustration. I pulled out some better instructions last night and will go over those this morning. Another thing I should've done first.3. There's still a little too much length between shoulder and waist, I think, but I can't tell for sure until the sleeve is out or corrected.4. Upper pocket flaps. Not sure this is a good look on me. I'll decide after the fit is finessed.5. Shoulders are too wide, but I was expecting this since I didn't narrow them yet.Good thing this is only a muslin.Odds & Ends1. Lorna asked for the links for my book splurge: I bought from Abebooks.com, and Amazon.com, after using Google to search on a few authors/titles to get started. Abebooks is a middleman for other sellers, like Amazon's used booksellers, and had the most titles/best prices. I left plenty for you.2. New cutting mat: I don't know the brand, it's not marked. I don't think it is Dritz because that would be printed on it somewhere, don't you think?I do like the way it feels when I'm cutting but I still prefer the softness of self-healing mats. I'll see how it goes as I get used to this new one. I can see that this mat will get roughed up as it's used (the con of non-self-healing), but with a 40% off coupon and my extra 10% off ASG discount, I won't have a problem spending the $30-or-so to replace it yearly, if necessary. The size and color push it ahead of the self-heal mats so far, although my end-all, be-all would be a HUGE white, self-healing mat. For those of you who have a mat like this, do you use something to smooth out the cuts every now and then?It's still not completely flat. Too bad they have to be shipped/stored rolled up tight in boxes. So I sprayed the table with temporary adhesive spray and stuck the mat down. Where there's a will, there's a way. ;-) Now that my mat covers the full table surface and is white like the tabletop, I don't think I'll need to take it off anytime soon. If I do, and the stickiness is a problem, I'll just wipe it off with rubbing alcohol, which is another sewing room \"notion\" BTW. I use it all the time to take Sharpie marks off my fingers and table.In case you're wondering, I prefer the white color underneath when tracing anything, or taping computer patterns together. I always took my other mats off the table when doing those things.3. Replacing the zipper in DS's pants ... yeah, I know I could've taken it to the cleaners and had them do it for a reasonable price. But, I wanted to see if I could and DS makes me feel happy with his response when I mend something of his. So, totally selfish project even if at first glance it didn't seem so. ;-)4. Pincushions ... it's been fun seeing all of yours after my Old/New post. Keep the pics coming!5. No shopping this morning. ;-)"},

OK, DH would probably prefer I shop for tile or carpet, but where's the fun in that?So anyway, there I was at 7:30 a.m. just happily minding my own business, checking my email, and what should pop into the Inbox all quiet and innocent-like?? A sales announcement from Fashion Fabrics Club. Yes, I get these on a regular basis and usually I just delete them without further thought. I mean, have you seen my stash closet? But this one mentioned knits and velours at very reasonable prices and I was tempted and clicked the link. Oh no! It all looked so pretty.Want to see what jumped into my cart?The first one is a cotton/Lycra knit. (No, Belinda, you can't have it ... although something keeps telling me you already do.) The next three are rayon/Lycra knits. Next, are two slinkies (of the acetate variety) and finally 80% cotton/20% poly brown velour. Because the order is from FFC, notorious for slow-boat shipping, it won't be instant gratification but maybe I'll be done with my jacket by the time it does arrive.Speaking of the jacket, the pattern has now undergone the initial adjustments, and the muslin is cut and nearly sewn. I'm going to finish putting it together (with at least one sleeve) after dinner, but I already see a bust point adjustment in its future. As much as I went on and on about the 17 pieces, it really hasn't been bad at all once they were traced. The pieces are fairly small which means cutting out is fast and easy. And because they are small, I was able to use up my bigger muslin pieces that I had re-wrapped around the bolt. Yes, I was saving muslin scraps ... but they were much too big to toss. See, I do truly save money sometimes! ;-)"},

Pants and Skirts Fit for Your Shape (Jan Minott)I couldn't decide which one would be the best from the very brief (non-existent?) contents descriptions. I know I want at least one of these. If the others are too duplicative, I'll resell them on PR.4. Fantastic Fit For Everybody: How to Alter Patterns to Flatter Your Figure (Gale G.

Pants Fit for Your Figure: Point-By-Point Pattern Adjustment (Louise Bame)I've never heard of this one, but it was cheap.6. SEWING CASUAL CLOTHES Sportswear, How to Make and Fit Slacks, Smart Separates and Beach Wear, Leather Fashions, Sport Clothes for Men (Better Homes & Gardens)Leather fashions for men? Hmmmm!!!!

The other is to complete the \"set\" ... I already have her Dressmaking book.11.

{"title": "I found my mojo again", "date": "Tuesday, January 16, 2007", "text": "I guess I just needed a long weekend to putter around and veg out. Until last night, I just wasn't very enthused about working on the jacket even though I haven't lost any desire to have it finished and be wearing it. But at the end of the evening, with DH and the boys back home and settled in, I started thinking about the jacket alterations and how I was going to do them, and before I knew it, I couldn't wait to get started this morning.I cut out the STP pattern pieces and started pin fitting the body sections on Zillie. She's not exactly my clone but close enough to give me a really good indication of what's needed. I know that if I had a body duplicate, I'd never have to pin fit on myself again ... it's so much easier and comes so naturally to pin, tuck, let out, etc. with the \"fabric\" (paper) draped before me instead of on me. But I just can't see DH doing a good job of duplicating me. Sigh.Anyway …I definitely will need about a 3/4 to 1\" FBA judging by the gap created when unpinning the princess seam. The gap looks wider in the pic, but the paper is drooping. I'm also seeing a bit of extra length from shoulder to bust/waist both front and back so I'll fold that out at the armhole level. Since I regularly add a square shoulder adjustment, which means raising the armhole to match, a tuck at the armhole should kill two birds/boobs with one stone.I need to add some width/ease across the back and also take out some shoulder to waist length as mentioned above. The pinned pattern is hanging a bit crooked at the upper back because I didn't notch the seam allowance for the neckline and that extra length is poofing outward. I also need to add some width at hip level, both at the sideseam (see sideseam pic below) and a slash/spread over the bum. Nothing unexpected there either. Unfortunately. ;-)I'm going to make some initial adjustments to the pattern pieces and then cut my first muslin. Yes, I said first. I'm sure I'll be doing more than one. But that's OK, as long as the mojo holds out. I definitely need to try on a muslin over a real top because paper over Zillie's thin knit cami isn't a good model for jacket ease.Note to self: Sewing that lapel in denim ought to be interesting … with that yoke seam bisecting the underside."},

I'm now debating with myself whether to cut a muslin as-is without doing any alterations first so I'll have a known starting point, or to make some bust and hip adjustments to the pattern and then cut the muslin. I know I have to do a square shoulder adjustment so I'll do that  either way.There are pros and cons to both. I think I'll pin the pattern tracing together and see if that helps with the decision. I'm going to start with just the bodice pieces. I'll do the facing and sleeves after I've made some progress on the bust and hips.So far, I've thought more about this jacket in the last hour than I have all week. ;-)I've had the house all to myself today (Sunday) while the guys are up in Jacksonville. I thought I would be starting on my jacket but, instead, I spent the day stalling on it again. ;-) I couldn't move forward until I crossed off some other things from my list. First, house cleaning … i.e., vacuuming and dusting and general straightening up.With that done, I moved to the cards and frames I've been collecting for a wall in my sewing room. I was tired of looking at them in a pile. The close-up above is so you can see them better, but the photo below gives the little vignette some scale. The three framed cards are from friends and family, the little framed \"motto/charm\" is the Christmas gift from my sister I showed earlier. The heart is a pincushion from my boys a couple of birthdays ago. All are special and make me smile when I look at them. They are hanging on the wall directly opposite me when I'm at my cutting table so I'll be looking at these little mementos a lot.After finishing that little project, I moved on to one that's been silently waiting in the wings while I was working last week. These are preemie sleepers, a hat and cloth wipes for the premature baby girl born to a lady who belongs to a sewing list I'm on. Another listmember cut out bunches and asked for volunteers to sew them up. I couldn't refuse. These are so fast and yet so gratifying to make. In the past, I've made preemie clothing for TouchingLittleLives.org. TLL host free patterns on their website. I urge you to sew up a few from those scraps you're saving for a rainy day and send them along to TLL. You'll be glad you did, and the babies will be even happier.I don't expect the menfolk back until later tomorrow (Monday) afternoon or evening. Maybe I'll have actually made some progress on my jacket by then. I have to admit that the 80+ degree weather we've been having (unusual in January, even for us) isn't helping to motivate me. But at least there's no more football games to distract me until next Sunday."},

These are the same pants he wore Thursday to school, with collared shirt and tie because of a wrestling dual that evening. (The coach requires that the boys dress up on match days.) These are also the same pants that DS informed me (about 10 minutes before leaving for school of course) had a broken zipper. DS wore them anyway. He had no choice.Fast forward to today. I was shopping at Target and saw a reasonably priced pair of black dress pants. I bought them, figuring $25 or so is well worth NOT having to replace the zipper in the pair at home. DS tried them on. Too small. Grrrr.So I started ripping out the broken zipper to see what I would be up against, and before I knew it (yeah, right), I had the entire zipper out. The only black zipper in my stash was 18\" long. I Wonder-Taped it in place, shined as many bright lights down on my work area as possible, and sewed the blasted black zip back into the black fly with black thread, trimming the extra length when it seemed safe to do so. It felt like I was mostly feeling my way along instead of actually seeing what I was doing. Note to self: Next time, wait until there's daylight outside.They're done. And not too bad either, if I say so myself. Certainly more than good enough for a 14-year old who won't notice anything. And now I can return the RTW pants and spend that $25 on something better.I still haven't moved forward on my jacket. Do you think by replacing that zipper I was stalling?? ;-)"},
{"title": "Out with the Old, In with the New", "date": "Thursday, January 11, 2007", "text": "Time to do some trading out in the sewing room.First, Ye Olde Red Pin Cushion Tomato:At Joann's last night this green tomato pin cushion caught my eye. How perfect for a green sewing room, right? And so much more fun and whimsical than the Ye Olde Red One.Next up, sewing mats:Before, and …After.Yes, it's going to need a day or so to flatten out.I grabbed some stacks of sewing books from the nearby bookcase to help it along.I'm tired of running off the edges of my mis-matched mats so I hope I like this new one. It's not self-healing and has a completely different feel to it, but it seems sturdy after a few trial cuts of nothing. My green Olfa mat has seen better days. The edges are chipped (not really chipped but I don't know how else to describe it) and there are a number of rough spots. The smaller gray mat was my first (sigh) and was more geared toward fitting on my cutting table when I had to store it closed at the other house. I bought the green mat because I was tired of sliding the gray one all around the place. The've done their job and have done it well, but it's time to spread out to the full width of the table now that I've got a real sewing room.While at Joann's, of course I couldn't help but wander around the fabric department.1. Crosshatched non-stretch denim, 5+ yds (remainder of bolt). This pic shows the denim lighter than the indigo it really is, more like in the pic below. There's enough here for jeans for me and jeans or shorts for DS. When I get to whatever is made for DS, I won't tell him that we're the Bobsy Twins.2. Brown rayon blend doubleknit, 3+ yds and, again, the last of the bolt.3. Green rayon blend doubleknit, 3+ yds and yes, the end of the bolt again. So someone besides me is buying Joann's good stuff. I hope they're paying attention. I'm thinking Yoga-type pants for both of these knits.4. Brown RPL (rayon/poly/Lycra) woven, 3 yds and I left some on the bolt this time. I'll see how this launders before I decide if I like it or if it will be muslining stock.All were $5/yd and under, plus my 10% ASG discount card, plus a 40% off coupon and the 10% ASG discount on the mat. I think I did OK. I would've done even worse but it was getting on 9 PM and they were starting to shoo us out the door.On a semi-related note, I kept running into a cute teenage girl walking around with her pattern (and her mom), picking out fabric, notions, etc. She seemed to know exactly what she was doing and it made me smile to see a sewer in the making.I also picked up one of the upcoming class brochures. It was full-color glossy, which makes it more expensive than the newsprint brochures I've seen in the past, which means Joann's is spending more to promote its classes. A Good Thing. But even better, is that their garment sewing classes are on the front cover. Not knitting, not quilting, but *garment* sewing.Two classes in particular caught my eye. The first is really part of a series of 3, starting with very basic beginner. But the third set in this series is for what they're calling a wardrobe (jacket and skirt or pants) and includes more advanced skills (zippers, buttonholes, etc.). Usually, Joann's teaches making a pillow or pull-on PJ pants. That kind of thing. This series looks like it is actually building some skills and ending with something a bit more stylish than their usual fare and which someone might actually want to wear out of the house.The other is a class for planning and sewing your own prom dress. How fun and what a great way to entice those teenagers. I should make a note of the class days and time and go spy on them. I bet that would be fun to see, and I mean that in a good way.Now I don't know who the teachers are or how well they teach, but it does seem like Joann's is starting to listen. First with all the better fabrics I'm finding there lately and also by appealing to the younger set. Yes, the fleece was still in abundance, but at the store I frequent, the whole department has been rearranged and the fleece is not front and center in your face anymore. Instead, it's all on shelving in its own section and you don't even see it until you're deep into the other fabrics. I was obviously more tired than I realized when I wrote yesterday's entry. I'm *not* going to meet up with my mom today. That's tomorrow. Sheesh. I knew that. So, maybe I'll get some time to start on my jacket muslin today. Around paying bills and sorting paperwork and meeting with our business attorney this afternoon."},

My sons, on the other hand, didn't seem to mind it a bit.We were standing on the beach when these two catamarans came gliding up in rapid succession. One of their passengers was a little Scotty dog who looked quite pleased with himself after his day's journey.Silly \"effects\" photo.Typical boy-type \"swimming.\"We finished the day with dinner at Sharky's On the Pier, a great seafood restaurant right on Venice Beach overlooking the Gulf. It was dark by then so the photos I took don't do it much justice. But just imagine tacky straw tiki hut tables, a steel drum band, tropical drinks, and the waves crashing in the near distance. Or, click on Sharky's link to see their better photos. No further progress on the Burda WOF jacket, and I'm meeting up with Mom again tomorrow for a girl's day out so it's going to be on hold a little longer. I have decided, though, that before I cut any muslin, I'm heading to Joann's tonight to buy a big cutting mat. By Saturday, I hope to have the muslin cut. I was really wanting it yesterday as the temps suddenly dropped to the near frigid low 60s. (Yeah, I know, but I'm a Florida girl now.)"},

Tomorrow is a day out for the whole family so no more progress until at least Monday.Since I'm only now just starting with the tracing, I won't be finished with a muslin anytime before I see my mom tomorrow so I'll be on my own for the fitting. That's OK. I'd rather just spend the day walking around on the beach and going out to dinner after.I did finish up the latest pair of Simplicity 4660 jeans this morning. Life's obligations have kept me mostly out of the sewing room this week. I'm going to set this pattern aside for a bit now as the boredom factor has set in after 3 pairs of pants in relatively short order. Remind of that boredom factor when I'm whining about the jacket next week, OK?Here are a couple of pics of the jeans on the table. I made them with a wider leg this time and I think I'm going to like 'em. I hemmed them at a slight angle, longer in the back, since I think the wider hem circumference calls for it.I added deco stitching to the back pockets and topstitched the darts. No one but me will see these details often, as my untucked tops will be covering that area. But still, it's fun to add details just for yourself. That's one bonus with sewing, right?Now onto tracing SEVENTEEN pieces while the NFL playoffs start …"},

At least the holidays are officially over for another year (wooooo!) and it will be a short week before the weekend is here, right? The boys had better be hungry this weekend since I went to the store last night to stock up on lunch stuff and I bought for a week, thinking of course that yesterday was Sunday and I needed M-F supplies. Yeah, like I have to worry about having too much food with them.I'm hoping to finish the jeans tonight. Then I'll pull out the Burda jeans jacket pattern (the one with SEVENTEEN pieces) and start contemplating the tracing. That will require a total mind focus. Did I mention the SEVENTEEN pieces? It would be really great if I could get it traced and then cut/sewn in muslin by Sunday. My mom is still in the area and I could draft her to help with adjustments when we go see her at the beach condo on Sunday. I'm not optimistic though. It's SEVENTEEN pieces after all."},

But, a few trips through the washer/dryer softened it up rather nicely. It's denim-like, but it's not a twill weave. Still, it will make nice blue jeans and will go with nearly any top. I bought the last 4 yards according to the website but it was a very generous cut and I have enough left for another pair. I'll probably sew something for one of the boys, but I'm not in a hurry since Santa brought them each a few new pairs of jeans.When these are done, I'll give the pattern a rest for a bit even though I still have at least 3 pairs of jeans I want to make before winter is over. But since winter hasn't even really started here yet, I figure I have a little more time. I'd like to get started on a denim jacket, using fabric #3 from the pic below, I think.

{"title": "Fly Topstitching", "date": "Friday, December 29, 2006", "text": "In a recent comment, Lorna asked if I used a template for the topstitching on my jeans fly. The answer is YES! Unfortunately, I can't seem to locate an internet source or even a reference for the notion(s) that I use so I don't know if it's still available. I don't remember where I bought it, but it's likely either Joann's or Nancy's Notions. I also don't know who makes it as there are no brand markings on the templates. Big lotta help I am, huh?Still, I thought I would show you the template(s) and how I use them. If you ever see these for sale, I'd advise you to scoop them up. Also, if you're already familiar with these and know who makes them, please let me know. Edited to add: Thanks Belinda for a link to a source for these templates. You Rock!This is the set of templates. With these two pieces, markings and measurements for 4 common fly widths are included, 3/4\", 1\", 1-1/4\", and 1-1/2\". There are also length markings on each end of the templates. I don't use those as my flys are always sized … er … on the fly. ;-) The circles are finger & thumb grips.On the underside of each template are pointy \"grabber\" thingies. These hook into the center front seam gently, but strongly enough so that the template doesn't move.This shows the template hooked onto the fold of the demo fabric. If this were an actual center front seam, the pointy grabbers would be hooked into the seam ditch. After the template is in place, I trace around the template with my chacoliner. The templates are made to be sewn around using a zipper foot, but I like tracing and just following my line. Less chance of cracking my template that way.This is the chalk line tracing. I topstitch on this line using an open toe or a clear foot. If the fly is to have double topstitching as in the example at the top, I'll use a \"toe\" of the presser foot butted up next to that first stitching line for placement and my machine's needle positioning to adjust the spacing if necessary.Since we're talking about fly topstitching templates, I thought I'd point out that zipper packaging includes a template. If you open the package carefully and then trim the bottom curve with scissors to finish the curve, you can use the back flap as a tracing template. These templates are 1-1/4\" wide.Oh, and here's a pic mentioned in a PR thread and nabbed from the Nieman Marcus website. These pants sold for $270. Is that $1 per pucker??"},
{"title": "Mad-Dash New Top", "date": "Friday, December 29, 2006", "text": "Well, I did it. Wednesday night I quickly made a top to wear to the family outing on Thursday. And I love it! I already said that my first version of this top was my new favorite and this confirms it. I love this pattern (from Burda WOF, 06/2005 #111). Now I think this one is my new favorite.I had to scratch my head a bit before I decided how to make this one. Not because of the pattern, but because of the fabric(s). As the photos below show, the body of top is made from two separate fabrics. The outer fabric is a very sheer, very soft mesh knit. The underlayer is a solid fleshtone nylon blend knit, with properties very similar to EmmaOneSock's buttermilks but a bit lighter-weight. I decided to treat the two fabrics as one. My original idea was to make the outer layer \"float\" over the underlayer at the bottom bodice sections but, frankly, I was short on time and sewing them as one throughout the whole construction process was just quicker. It turned out really well so I'm happy with my decision. The top fabric even still \"floats\" over the underlayer when I move. It's a nice effect.The photo below shows the underside of the top. Yes, I'm still with the brown serger thread. Hey, I said I was pressed for time. OK, and lazy too. ;-) When we showed up at my mom's cousin's house today, my mom immediately started telling cousin Susan, \"Debbie made that top. Isn't it pretty?\" Now I hadn't seen my mom in a couple of months and she doesn't read my blog, so of course I had to ask her how she knew as soon as I walked in the door that I had made the top. Mom's answer? \"Well, I know you make all of your clothes now so I figured you had made that too.\" LOL! Nice little backwards compliment, I think.Here's a pic of me in the top after our return. Pardon the wrinkled pants."},
{"title": "Jeans, (Last) Installment #5", "date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2006", "text": "Here are the finished hems. Not much to them. Measure, cut, overlock, press up, and topstitch. The jeans are done and will be worn on a family outing tomorrow. I'm hoping I can \"whip up\" a new top tonight. If not, I'll pull something from the drawer. Front view (hemmed a tad long to compensate for residual shrinkage): Waistband and re-opened pocket (and boy is my top twisted or what?):Rear view: Next up is finishing the waistband. I pinned the facing down and tried them on again to be sure I didn't need any more adjustments. With the final fit complete, I pressed the inside facing hem allowance up and then stitched in the ditch from the right side to tack the facing in place. The topstitching will finish the bottom edge of the extended tab.As a side note, when doing laundry today I noticed DS' RTW pants. Or, actually, the *inside* of DS' pants. This waistband facing was turned and sewn just like mine, except a chainstitch was used on his and the button \"section\" of the waistband was pieced with the outside fashion fabric. I'm wondering why about the button section — is it for form or for function? I also disagree with how they made the pockets right-side out, so that when you actually look inside the pockets you are seeing the wrong side of this print. I suppose it looks better on the rack this way, but still. BTW, you can click on any photo, including this one, for a bigger version. With the facing stitched down, topstitching and buttonholes are next. I also topstitched the center back seam for the \"jeans look.\" Next, buttons. This one was sewn on by machine. The one inside had to be sewn by hand. Ugh. It also doesn't match this button, but it doesn't need to. Nearing completion, it's time for those back pockets. I temporarily pinned them where I thought they should be and then tried on the pants and looked at my butt in the mirror. I adjusted the pockets a little after seeing where they first landed and then did the mirror check again. With placement decided, I used Wonder Tape to stick them in place while sewing. The pockets are now topstitched, bartacked, and a little \"design\" using one of my machine's deco stitches was sewn at the bottom of the right-cheek pocket.Measuring for and then sewing the hems is the only step remaining. That step has actually already been done but I've had to run some errands today and haven't had a chance to take the final pics. Stay tuned."},
{"title": "Jeans, Installment #3", "date": "Tuesday, December 26, 2006", "text": "I sewed the back darts and decided to sew the sideseams with a regular stitch and then baste the inseams and crotch seam, a \"quasi\" baste. That way if the fit is as I'm expecting, I won't have to rip out the sideseam stitching. Today is a Good Sewing Day because the initial try-on tells me the jeans are going to fit. Woo hoo!I ripped out the basting and then overlocked and topstitched the sideseams. Every little vertical line helps. ;-) I restitched the inseams with a permanent stitch and overlocked the seam allowances. Yes, I should really start using the 5-thread capabilities of my serger but, well, I don't. Old dog and all that. Speaking of serging … have you noticed the brown serger thread for the green pants? Hey, I won't tell anyone if you don't. ;-)The center back seam is left still unsewn at this stage because the waistband is a 2-piece contoured band with a center back seam. The pants and waistband CB seams will be sewn as one after the waistband is attached and final-fitted. Speaking of the waistband, that's what was next. I sewed the print facings to the outer waistband pieces and pressed them flat, rolling the upper edge a bit. Next I attached the two waistband sections to the pants waist. The center backs are still unsewn. The center backs are now pinned and ready to be sewn. Which is my next step. I'll see you back here for Installment #4.I'm sure you've all seen one or more of these videos…The Discovery Channel show MythBusters is one of our favorite shows and today they were running a rerun in which they \"tested\" the Diet Coke & Mentos experiments. Silly me, I mentioned within hearing range of my sons how surprised I was that they hadn't actually tried it yet themselves, and then I went back upstairs to my sewing room.Ten minutes later, they're back from the store and this is the set-up in the front yard:And this is their result.Yep. It works. ;-)"},
{"title": "Jeans, Installment #2", "date": "Tuesday, December 26, 2006", "text": "A fresh start after a good night's sleep yields a fly with the zipper sewn correctly this time. I cut a fly shield from the same cotton fabric as the pockets. I like these little pretty touches that only I will see in normal day-to-day wear. They make me happy.Next, onto the back pockets. I baste both pieces together, all the way around. Then I press the seam allowances toward each pocket wrong side, remove the basting and voila! Two identical pockets with the seam allowances already pressed back. I fused some black interfacing to the wrong side of the top fold and then overlocked the edge. The last step of back pocket prep is to topstitch across the tops. I'll set these aside until the pants are complete. I know most instructions have you sew on the pockets while the pants back is still flat, but I like to decide on placement when my butt is actually in the pants. It's easy enough to sew the pockets on when the pants are already sewn together.Next up is basting the jeans together for an initial try-on. I'm very tempted to skip this step since theoretically I've already altered this pattern and the pants should fit, but I know if I do skip it, I'll wish I hadn't. So, the basting step wins.* * * * *While I'm sewing, DH has decided to install the baseboards in the foyer. After he finishes those, I'm guessing he'll be begging to go to Home Depot for more baseboard for the freshly painted upstairs landing. He's already \"reminded\" me that I agreed to start tearing apart the family room after Christmas. Yes, it's now officially \"after Christmas,\" but I'm in a sewing zone so the family room won't be happening today. ;-)Christmas Day has come and gone and I was finally able to get back into the sewing room for a while tonight. On Saturday I had cut out another pair of Simplicity 4068 pants which I am again sewing as jeans. I actually like the first pair more now than when I initially finished them. But I don't like the way the stretch denim stretches too much after a day of wearing them. This time I'm trying them using a non-stretch denim, and keeping my fingers crossed.I thought I'd take pics at each step and share those here as I progress. It might be boring, or it might be helpful. I'll leave the verdict on that up to you. ;-) I didn't get very far tonight because it was already late when I started. But progress is still progress, right?I started by serging/overlocking the non-seam edge of the yoke piece for the pocket bag and then pressing the piece before sewing it onto the pocket fabric using a medium zig-zag over top of the serged stitching. Next was sewing the pocket facing to the pants front. I trimmed the seam allowances with pinking shears, pressed the seam open and then pressed the facing to the inside of the pants, rolling the edge just a bit. This pic shows the pants wrong side and the front inside of the pocket-to-be. Topstitching the pocket edge was the next step. I'm using two strands of poly sewing thread in the topstitching needle instead of topstitching-specific thread.The next step was to serge/overlock the pocket facing and bag together along the curved bottom edge of the pocket. I then basted the pants and pocket pieces together at the waist and hip so they will act as one piece when I'm sewing the pants together. I also basted the pocket closed so that the pocket will not distort during all the handling/trying on to come. Next, I fused interfacing to the fly extensions and basted them together, returning to regular stitches along the front crotch curve. At this point, I'm ready to sew in the zipper. Again.Yes, again. I had the whole dang thing sewn in, topstitched, and basting ripped out. Only then did I see that I had sewn the zipper in WRONG SIDE OUT. ARghhhhh! Obviously, I'm more tired than I realized. I gritted my teeth and ripped it all out so that when I start again tomorrow, everything is back to being ready to go."},

Basically butter cookies with raspberry and apricot jam centers. Half are plain, half are rolled in chopped pecans.2. Chocolate Revel Bars. Lots of semi-sweet chocolate, oatmeal dough, and chopped walnuts.3. Lemon Square Bars. Lots of sugar, eggs, fresh lemon juice & rind.4. Peanut Butter Chocolate Kisses. I use crunchy peanut butter instead of the creamy every recipe I've ever seen for these calls for. BTW, one of those has a Tootsie roll stuck in it. DS#1 thought he'd be funny.5. Neopolitans, with a Christmas Flair. Usually these are brown, pink & white. The stripes are different flavors. Brown is chocolate (duh), green is mint, and the red is almond, which tastes like cherry.6. Pecan Bars. Tastes like the classic Southern pecan pie but in bar cookie form. This made a HUGE mess on the bottom of my oven as the pecan \"filling\" overran the pan. Oops.7. Sugar Cookies, with buttercream frosting. DS#2 did the decorating, can you tell?8. Peanut Brittle in the center. One of DH's favorites so I don't expect this to last long. The recipe is really easy, completely done in the microwave, so if he twists my arm, I may be encouraged to make more. ;-)9. Chocolate Snowswirl Fudge in the pan next to the cookie spread. The \"snow\" is marshmallow marbled through the chocolate, and there are chopped walnuts in there too. The pan is back in the frig setting up as this was made about 30 minutes before taking this photo.The rest of my day will be spent wrapping a few things and then in my sewing room working on my next pair of pants, with the football games going.Tonight the kitchen will open up again as I get tomorrow's breakfast ready to go. Tomorrow, I'll be making turkey dinner a la Thanksgiving, per DS#2's request. Can you tell that I spoil the \"baby?\"Here's hoping none of you need to venture into a store today!"},

Hung 2 pictures in the living room. Nope, not on yesterday's list. This one was a bonus.6. Reviewed the alterations made to Simplicity 4068 pants, adjusted pockets and fly to match alterations, doublechecked sewn pants against revised pattern pieces.7. Cut new pants from olive denim. Sewed pocket facings to pants fronts, trimmed, pressed, and turned.8. Watched DH's tape prep and ceiling painting at various stages during the day. (That's new ceiling paint in the pic. Wall paint tomorrow.)9. Thought about painting the backs of the dining room doors but didn't actually progress any further than that. 10. Folded some laundry and put in another load.11. Picked up pizzas for dinner.12. Sent some email and cruised the forums.13. Other boring stuff.14. Blogged about it all and went to bed.Good night!"},

She doesn't know that I already did (even before she asked) and found the quote above in her sidebar. I wish I had thought of it, because it is SO me! I always have more sewing ideas than what ends up in my closet, and more remodeling ideas than energy or time or money. So anyway, Hi Amy! Nice to meet you!Now to answer your question, Amy … Do you think Martha really paints her own doors?? Nah! If I had hired painters, I'd have them remove the doors. But since it's only me and DH, no, you don't have to remove doors to paint them. You should tape over the hardware, though, and if you know how to put them back, completely remove the knobs. Otherwise, tape over/around them too. I wish DH had taped hinges when he primed because he did paint some of them and since he did, I had to too. Oh well. I don't think anyone will notice or care, unless I point it out. And if I ever end up with spare time, we could always remove the paint on the hardware or replace it. Yeah. That'll happen. ;-)Many of the doors in the Money Pit were actually removed when DH spray primed them. Spraying— using one of those \"pro\" type sprayers not cans of spray paint — goes really fast. The problem is that it makes a MESS and uses twice the amount of paint, most of which gets disbursed into the air, landing on anything and everything nearby. When DH was spray priming, we didn't live here and none of the rooms were finished (most still aren't!) so the mess factor wasn't an issue.Here is a pic of some of our doors being painted … in the kitchen, before it became an actual kitchen:Now that we do live here, I really didn't want to take down doors that have been put back up, drag them and the sawhorses outside, spray, hope bugs didn't stick in the paint (we live in Florida — lots of bugs), and then probably have to run to the store for more paint. With the brush painting I've been doing, I started with a new gallon of paint and so far I've multi-coat painted all the crown and floor molding in the living room, and the 3 doors yesterday and I still have 2/3 of the gallon remaining. Brush painting is definitely more economical, even if it's also more hand work."},
{"title": "Next on the list", "date": "Thursday, December 21, 2006", "text": "I went to the grocery store yesterday and loaded up on cookie baking supplies. Tomorrow I start in. Today I continued painting doors. I started with one in the living room on Tuesday and then got on a roll. That one is done, 3 coats later. I also painted the double doors that lead into the dining room from the kitchen. I was SO tired of looking at the dull white primer coat and holes for the missing knobs. The new knobs had been sitting on my kitchen counter mocking me for about 3 months, I think. Maybe longer. Those doors took 2 coats, but I only painted the fronts and sides today. Hopefully, I'll still be motivated to paint the backs (dining room sides) tomorrow while cookies are baking.The last door was the bi-fold front hall closet door. First coat only, and then my light ran out. Plus, I'm going to have to empty the closet to get to the areas of the frame that show when it's open. We actually have winter coats in there. Hahahahahaha!! It's 80 degrees outside.  So, whose bright idea was it to paint all the dark doors semi-gloss white anyway?? Oh yeah. Mine. ;-) I figure at this rate I'll have all the doors in the house done by the time DS#2 graduates college (he's 14 now).Now that I'm in house mode this week, I'm optimistic that I can convince DH to paint the walls up the stairs that connect with the foyer and also paint the ceiling over the stairs while I'm baking tomorrow and Saturday. There's no way that anyone could pay me enough money to get on a ladder that high, balance, and paint. I hate open heights. But DH says he's fine with it. He may want to eat his words. I'll give him some cookies instead. ;-) Those walls have been painted as far up as I'll go for about a year now. Ugh. I'm so SICK of looking at them half finished. And we have the paint, so it's not like it's going to cost us anything extra to just get it done. Unless I get tired of the color before we ever get it finished. See, more incentive for DH to start in.We've also agreed to tear apart the family room after Christmas and lay the floor in there. Before we start the floor, though, we have to demolish the ugly brick hearth that runs the width of the room and sticks out almost 2 feet. I want the floor space. We're going to cover up the fireplace (with furniture) for now because, really, who the heck needs a fireplace in Florida? And hey, we always have the campfire out in the yard. So that will be a bigger project than just laying the floor, but once we get that done we can unpack lots of boxes, move the rest of the furniture-in-waiting out of the dining room where it's just being stored, and soon thereafter finally finish the dining room. I'm starting to see a teeny-tiny itsy-bitsy light at the end of the tunnel. We still have a long way to go in this Money Pit, but we are making some progress. Yay! As for sewing … that's on my list too. I can only paint for so long so I know I'll be firing up my machines again really soon. In fact, I'm thinking of heading up to the sewing room right now and deciding on my next project."},

Bah Humbug! ;-)My younger son decided he wanted to camp out in the yard with his friend. DH dug a firepit and the boys gathered dead wood from the property. Sometime around 10 PM we all (DH, DS#1, me, and the 2 original campers) gravitated to the fire, and there we all five sat until nearly 3 AM. Make that seven, to include the dog and the cat who were hanging out with us too.There were some late-night runs into the woods on the ATV for more firewood, experiments in burning items from the trash, roasting marshmallows and making S'Mores (mmmm), roasting hot dogs and feeding them to the dog as well as themselves, trying to cook an egg on a brick (don't ask), and lots of jokes, bodily emissions (from the men), and general silliness. I had quite a glimpse into what goes on when they're off at their male-bonding camping trips.DS#1 pulled out a sleeping bag and joined the two younger boys in the tent for the night. I slept in my bed, thankyouverymuch.The firepit is still hot this morning and the boys are now on another wood run for Campfire #2 tonight. Last night was fun, but I think I'll let tonight be an entirely male experience. ;-)"},

The colors are off in these pics — both are more purple than the red/burgundy shown here. These jeans are straight out of the dryer so I do expect them to stretch out after I wear them, but they do fit like jeans (tight) and yes, the bengaline pants are much more flattering. Hmmm.Here's a really unflattering back view. ;-) Shadows and twisting for the pic are creating some wrinkles that don't really exist with a more normal stance. But hey … they're done, right?And with that, I'm off! I'm going to write up a review for the top later but now I've got to go change into those flattering bengaline pants since we're finally going out to that restaurant dinner tonight and DH will be home soon."},
{"title": "A little progress", "date": "Thursday, December 14, 2006", "text": "I was hoping to have this done by now but life got in the way. I'll have it finished today though, after I finish typing this and eating my lunch. All that's left now is to sew in the sleeves, stitch up the sideseams, and the hems.I added 1/4\" to each front seam by sewing smaller seam allowances, for a total of an additional inch across the front. That was an educated guess as I haven't tried it on yet. I'm guessing worst case is needing to take it in at the waist but with the polyester buttermilk, a little loose is preferable anyway. I also cut it extra long and will cut off the excess after I try it on and decide where I want the bottom hem to be.This probably isn't the best fabric to use with all the seaming details since the print is so busy, but it's what I picked. To highlight the seams, I reverse coverstitched with 3 embroidery threads, stitching the seam allowances to one side of the seams.Binding the neckline with a strip of the buttermilk fabric through the binder on the coverstitch machine was (expletive deleted) challenging. After 3-4 tries I finally got it to cooperate. The neckline is looking a bit floppy in the photo above but that's more the fault of the hollow-chested dressform than anything. On me and with the sideseams sewn, it will lay flat.I do like this pattern a lot, especially since it fits well with very minimal fussing. I'll definitely be making it again and will probably cut a vee neck in the next version, but a deep scoop is a nice change once in a while.Starting tomorrow at 12:30 p.m., DH and DS#2 will be away for the weekend at a wrestling tournament in Sarasota. DH has volunteered to be a chaperone. I volunteered to stay home and sew. ;-) Next up is a WOF jacket with 462 pieces. Maybe by the time they return on Sunday, I'll have it traced and a muslin cut. Emphasis on \"maybe.\""},
{"title": "Testing, 1…2…3", "date": "Tuesday, December 12, 2006", "text": "Rant: Why does Burda have to remove WOF back issue info from their website so soon, and really, ever?? This is the internet, after all, dominion of more information than you'll need in one lifetime. Sheesh. I had to resort to taking a pic of the pic in the magazine. So anyway, this is what's up next in the sewing room. Issue 1/2006, Pattern #131.As long as I was infringing copyright and taking pics of the magazine, I snapped this one of the line drawing too. I think it's a cute tee. I've thought so since January. I may actually be wearing one this January. There's always a euphoric rush on PatternReview when the newest issue of WOF starts arriving in mailboxes. Well, it's December 2006 and I'm sewing from the January 2006 issue. Apparently, I don't share that sense of rush. ;-) This morning I traced the pattern, cut it out of a sacrificial knit, and now I'm assessing (assessing, not obsessing!). I think it's pretty good and there are only a few tweaks before cutting the good fabric. Not bad, considering the only \"alterations\" were to trace between sizes as needed. I started with the 44 at the shoulders & armholes, tapered to 46 at bust level and tapered out all the way to the 50 at hip level. No real FBA whatsoever. Amazing. Especially so when you consider that the model is not overly endowed in the boobage area.This knit has the stretch and recovery of a swimwear Lycra, but it's not as thick. In other words, it's quite stretchy and form fitting. I'm planning to use a buttermilk print and this mimics the buttermilk's qualities closer than any other knit I was willing to demote to muslin status. I cut this with 1/2\" seam allowances and I think I'll sew them at 1/4\" at the bust areas and maybe below too. The buttermilk has firm recovery but not as much as this knit. I can always take it back in, right? The puckers you see at the seams under the bust are from fast sewing w/o trimming, not fit. I hope. ;-) The sleevecap has too much ease for this fabric. It poofs at the shoulder. So, I'll reduce that a little when I slash/spread the bicep for a bit more ease there. I cut the 46 sleeves to fit the 46 armholes I traced. They aren't too tight, but my sausage casings upper arms look better when sleeves aren't so form-fitting as these would be without alteration.We were supposed to go out to dinner tonight but DS#2 dropped a homework bomb last night and so he's going to need some editing help after he finishes writing up a paper. We'd be too full and tired to work well if we go out, so home it is tonight. Again. While he's writing, I'm hoping to be cutting and sewing the real top.You paid attention during 97% of high school!  85-100%  You must be an autodidact, because American high schools don't get scores that high!

I don't think I actually learned a lot of this stuff from the school system. And what's with that \"old chap\" stuff?"},
{"title": "What is this \"Bengaline\", eh?", "date": "Sunday, December 10, 2006", "text": "Addressing some of the comments in my last post — I hope Belinda will jump in and correct me if I'm wrong or just add whatever I've left out, but as far as I can tell …It's a Nylon (or Poly), Rayon (Viscose), Lycra (Elastane) blend. But a woven, not a knit. And the stretch runs lengthwise on the fabric, parallel to the selvege. It's got a sheen on one side and is more matte on the other. I used the matte side as the right side for my pants.Yes, Touran, it does feel a bit rubbery but not in a bad way. Kind of like \"control\" pants but without being constricting or \"girdle-y\" in any way. The fabric does \"swish\" as you walk, so that is different (noice, diffrent, unewesual for my Aussie friends) but in a good way. Belinda says there are different qualities of this fabric, and what I have is the \"good stuff.\" Yay for the good stuff!Susan, no, it's not Ottoman or anything like it. CJ's Ottoman is a knit and this stretch bengaline is most definitely a woven.It's used in some RTW pants and skirts here in the U.S., but if you Google \"stretch bengaline\" you'll get mostly maternity garments (ugh. that hurt). It's far more common in Aussie and Kiwi RTW (non-maternity). I've never, ever seen it in any online or brick/mortar fabric store. I don't think it's the same thing as the \"RPL\" (rayon/poly/Lyra) that EmmaOneSock sells from time to time because (1) I've got some of that and while it's nice too, it's not this. And (2) the stretch in RPL runs widthwise as we'd expect.I wish I could buy it here (or online) because I'd have pants in every color!"},
{"title": "My New Favorite Pants", "date": "Saturday, December 9, 2006", "text": "Attention All Aussies: Send more stretch bengaline! NOW!! ;-)OMG, I love this fabric! It makes me look slimmer, it even makes me feel slimmer, it glides over my legs because the inside feels slippery like it's lined (it's not), and it's easy-care, easy-sew. The only thing I don't like about it is that I ran out. Ahem. Aussies? That's where you come in. It's just not commonly available here in the States. I have no idea why not!In case you joined us in the middle, these are the pants I planned to make from KS 3277 way back on November 12. They were to be the final. All the others (the UFOs referred to yesterday) are the wearable muslins leading up to these. I did actually finish them not long after November 12, but needed to wait to find new shoes in order to hem them. They are now complete! And very wearable! Yay! Can you see me dancing? And they match my favorite top so perfectly. I love it when a plan comes together. ;-)OK, stop dancing, Debbie. The back isn't perfect. But I already knew that and have since decided that the crotch curve in KS 3277 isn't the best for me. But still, they aren't too bad and it's not like I go around looking at my own backside anyway.Hemming them was an exercise in creative thinking, though. If I turned up a full hem, they were going to be a tad too short. Not highwaters, but not the best length for the new shoes, or the old legs. What to do, what to do?? If I had had any sizeable scraps available, I would've faced the hemline and turned up the facing. But I barely had even threads left over. Hmmm. On to Plan B.Plan B turned out to be facing the hemline with Seams Great. If I had had black, I would've picked that instead of the glaring white on the brown bengaline. But I was on a mission to finish these and I wasn't going to interrupt my momentum with a trip to the store. White it was. (I think this is 1-1/4\" wide, but the package is upstairs and I'm not.)I used a 3/8\" seam allowance and attached it the bottom of the pants in the round, overlapping at the join about 1/4\". Then I pressed the SA's toward the Seams Great and then I pressed the Seams Great and SA's under to form the hem, rolling it toward the inside so the white wouldn't be right at the edge.I first tried a basic straight stitch hem. That worked great technically but looked kind of cheap and icky on the outside of the pants. Too much stitching. So, I tried a machine blind hem (I avoid hand sewing at great lengths.) Looked great on the outside, but not so good on the inside. But really, who's going to see the inside of my hems in real life?? I kept it. The Seams Great is exceptionally thin and even though the edge \"picot-ed\" a bit with the blind hem stitch, it really adds no bulk at all. It doesn't look like it in the photo below, but trust me. Or look at the next photo.This shows the finished hems. No stitching shows, no bulk, and only a glimpse of the white … if you're looking UP inside my leg. Problem solved, mission (and pants) complete.And just for added reassurance, I took a pic of the hems with me wearing the pants. Still no white showing, even with my leg raised up. (It was fun trying to balance on one leg and take a photo at the same time!)"},
{"title": "We Interrupt This Jeans Report To Bring You …", "date": "Friday, December 8, 2006", "text": "… more PJs!I finished the purple jeans and tossed them into the laundry to remove the glue basting (back pockets) and chalk/pen marks (all over). And then I had no more excuses for ignoring the KS 3277 test sews in various stages of completion still strewn about the sewing room. I want to make a top to wear with the jeans, and then a jeans-style jacket, but all of these unfinished potentially wearable muslins are making me nuts. I don't really like UFOs and clutter, and work better when I've finished one thing before moving onto the next.I finished up two of those test pants last night and have the other two pairs still to do tonight. From last night's sewing, one will be wearable outside the house and the other turned into this PJ set. Yeah, forget what I said about finishing one project before starting another because in the middle of trying to finish these, I decided they needed a matching top. Which means I started something else without finishing all of the test pants and also created more mess when I added the tee fabric the mix. But rules are made to be broken, and hey, at least I also finished it. Plus, it's going to be very cold here tonight (even non-Floridians would consider it cold, maybe), so I really wanted some nice new snuggly PJs and a top with long-ish sleeves. These fit the bill rather nicely (if I do say so myself!).The pants are a beefy cotton/Lycra blend with great recovery. The top is 100% cotton interlock. While the lime green top does actually match the green in the pants in real life, I wanted to tie both pieces of the to-be set together a little more. So I bound the neckline and sleeve hems with the pants print and then I created an iron-on transfer for the front of the top.To make the transfer, I scanned a scrap of the fabric and separated out some of the motifs. Then I re-combined those into a new design, which I outlined with more of the green and printed off onto opaque transfer paper. (Love that stuff!) Voila! The sun is down and it's dark outside now. It's only 6:30 PM but I'm very tempted to strip Zillie of her new outfit and start snuggling in my new PJs.In the meantime, we now return you to the regularly scheduled jeans. This is one of the back pockets. After sewing it on for the second time. If you squint, you can see the deco stitching in the bottom right corner of the pocket. It shows up nicer in real life and I like the subtle effect. If you keep squinting and look at the pic of the PJs above, you can see the completed jeans hanging behind Zillie."},
{"title": "This …", "date": "Wednesday, December 6, 2006", "text": "… is what I've been doing in the sewing room for the last day. Look familiar? It's The Ghost Threads of Topstitching Past. I'm guessing you've seen this ghost a time or two.It visited me while I was working on the purple jeans. I had them complete except for hems last night. I'd been trying them on and adjusting the whole way through. I sewed and topstitched the sideseams. I sewed and topstitched the crotch seam from back to front. I sewed the back pockets on, and topstitched and added a decorative stitch. They were perfect. And finally, I sewed the waistband on and topstitched it. It was perfect too, one of my best.Then I tried the jeans on again and I could take them off without undoing the zipper. Arghhh. Sometimes, no matter how many times you've done this before, something just doesn't work out. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it, because really, I have no idea why it didn't work out as basted and pretested.To fix the problem would mean taking in the waistband at the center back and tapering a slight \"dart\" down the center back seam. To do that meant ripping out part of the waistband and all of its perfect stitching and topstitching, then ripping out all of the topstitching on the crotch seam. Which then meant that the back pockets would end up too close together to look right to my eye.Fast forward. I've now finished all the ripping out and have resewed/topstitched the crotch seam and waistband. Next up will be re-attaching the pockets and topstitching those. And then I'll be back to where I was 24 hours ago.The jeans are OK now but they're not going to be a favorite I don't think. Maybe a few days out of sight while in the Magic Wardrobe will fix that. We'll see. Sigh. At least they stay up now when I sit or bend over and I don't have to worry about being mistaken for a plumber. ;-)"},

These are what followed me home, although there were plenty others who wanted to join them.1. Wonderful brown doubleknit. I wish they had more. There was only 2.25 yards on the bolt and I bought it all. It will probably be \"yoga\" pants. I've been living in the black pair I recently made.2. I didn't buy this on Saturday, but it's here so you can see it next to #3. I bought this from Joann's last winter. It's cross-hatched denim (no Lycra) and will be the jeans I'm currently working on. It's cut and I'm in the middle of pin-fitting.3. Paisley textured stretch denim, 3 yds. This will be a casual, unlined jacket.4., 5., 6. Heavyweight denims (no Lycra), 3 yds each. #5 is a brushed denim, very nice. These will all be jeans. I'm still on the look-out for solid brown heavyweight, non-stretch denim/twill. I have a lot of brown print knits in the stash that want to become cool weather tops to wear with brown or blue jeans. Again I did not come home with a big cutting mat, but only because I didn't see any. The whole sewing area of the store had been re-arranged since my last visit (but in a good way!) so I probably just missed it. Plus, I was too enchanted by all of the nice fabrics on display. Yes, nice fabrics at Joann's. Imagine that.I also bought an entire bolt of muslin and used my 50% off coupon, saving myself over $12. Woo hoo! Love those coupons. I used the 40% coupon for the brown knit (saving approximately another $10), as it was the only non-sale fabric. Then I used my ASG discount card for an additional 10% off the rest of my purchases. So all of those fabrics, two magazines, and one clear ruler for less than $100. And, I came back with ZERO patterns, even though Simplicity was on sale. I looked but nothing really spoke to me.

But this is the best I could do at night with a tripod.And, here's the pattern: The red lines are the wedges. The upper wedge is for high hip. (I added the high hip wedge lower on the front than I really wanted, but I was trying to keep the pocket area unchanged. Because the first sew of these pants resulted in a bit of poofiness at the front crotch, next time I will add this wedge higher and redraw the pocket.)The lower wedge is to add length at the inseam.After my first fitting in fabric, I also incorporated the alterations shown in yellow and blue.The yellow lines reflect (1) removing hip width, (2) lowering crotch depth front/back, (3) lengthening the rear dart, and (4) returning the crotch points to the original pattern lines because I didn't need the extra I added. (Truing the grainline is also shown in yellow but I did this before cutting the fabric.)The blue line at the back crotch curve shows where I deepened the curve.The black lines are original pattern seam and grain lines. You can see that these alterations do not throw off the grainline very drastically.This blurry photo is my first fitting. The red arrow is pointing to folds which were removed by that crotch scooping shown in blue on the pattern. This shows that crotch scooping as sewn:Below is my Spongebob pattern laid over the Simplicity 4068 pattern. They turned out very similar, which lets me know that I got grainlines, etc. right on the Spongebob pattern. The back crotch angles are actually more alike than they look here because Simplicity added a \"just in case\" seam allowance to the center back seam like what you see in men's slacks.Oh, and lest you think that my pants look perfectly wrinkle-free all the time. Here's what they look like when I actually move. My usual one-hip-out stance, instead of the for-the-camera pose. Yeah, pants still wrinkle when you move. Imagine that. ;-)Although I think I've got most of the rear fit issues worked out now, I don't really like this pattern. It's OK for slacks, but I'm a jeans girl and these are slacky-jeans, not jeans-jeans. I'll be looking through my Burda WOFs for a true jeans pattern I can morph with this one and I'll be testing out my new alterations to see how they transfer.

Yes, I'm glad to see the waistline details but there's only two variations so we don't need five photos of tucked in tops. Whatever, and I'm probably being too critical. Apparently it didn't stop me from buying it or from making it my next project. ;-)Yesterday I used my new altered pattern to adjust this one and was quite pleased with how few adjustments I needed to match things up between the two, and pleased again with how easy those adjustments were. A quick tissue fit told me I was on track and another quick fit of the pin-basted pants in real fabric was still good. So, I'm optimistic that maybe, just maybe, I've found a solution I can apply to any pattern. I'm hoping to finish sewing these today."},

{"title": "Today, I'm thankful for PANTS THAT FIT", "date": "Thursday, November 23, 2006", "text": "Yes, I'm also thankful for the many other blessings in my family and will later enjoy our turkey dinner together. Even though our routine has been to almost always eat dinners at home, sitting around the table and sharing the events of the day, lately it's been rare for us all to be here at the same dinner time since 17 yo DS has both a part-time job and a full-time (true love!) girlfriend and14 yo DS has started up with wrestling team. I'm very thankful we had many years of sitting down together but I'm more thankful that my sons are healthy and active and growing up normal (term used loosely!), even if it takes them away from the family fold more often. Back to the pants …Below is what I've been trying to correct. See how the fabric is bunching and wrinkling into a quasi-X shape? Try to find *that* in yer fittin' books. I dare ya! Does it look like I have knock-knees? Maybe a tiny bit, but not really. Especially if you imagine those legs without the thigh fluff (which I do on a daily basis!). But that's the alteration I need. Not because that's what my body type is, but because that's how the made-up pattern fits me. Or, more correctly, doesn't fit me or my thighs. Because my thighs require more fabric (LOTS more) at the inseam than thinner legs, the fitting issue mimics knocked knees, or to be more PC, \"inwardly rotated legs.\"  The pants below (pardon the upside down Spongebob boats) are the last in a series of muslins cut and sewed during yesterday's self-declared Pants Work Day. I'm pretty darned pleased with the results. There are absolutely no more diagonal wrinkles or false crotch smiles. There's a tiny bit of vertical fold under the cheek that the camera is picking up but which is not glaringly noticeable to my naked eye looking in the mirror. Besides, if I altered out those wrinkles, chances are I wouldn't be able to walk without the pants tugging my legs. One has to balance fit with function, and comfort.Here's the front view. Again, I'm pleased. And again there are wrinkles that I choose to ignore. I like my pants snug at the tummy. I feel more \"contained\" that way, especially since I almost live in jeans and I'm used to their snug fit. What I'm most pleased about is that the crotch is high and snug (not too snug). Before this alteration session, I needed to compromise because if I pulled pants up to where I prefer wearing them in the front, then the back would diagonally wrinkle even more. Now I have the best of both worlds — snug at the crotch front and back and no fabric bunching under my butt. These pants feel like they were made for me. ;-) I used to think a fisheye dart (FED) was the solution, but I've changed my mind. I'm female, so I'm entitled! While a FED did help a lot, it never quite got me all the way there. If you look closely at the results pic for that link, you should be able to see (very) subtle diagonal wrinkles wanting to point to my inner thighs. Yes, it's hard to tell because this is a still shot, but trust me, as soon as I took a step or pulled them up snugger in the crotch, they were easier to spot. I also used to think that the fit problems were because fabric was getting hung up on extended calves and to some extent, it was. But that's only because it wasn't hanging correctly from up above. I.e., from just below the crotch to the knee. So, if not the FED, then what? Below is the final pattern (still marked up from the experiments). I'm not sure what to call the changes I wound up with. An inseam wedge? An inseam cross-twistie? The lines on the left are the wedge, which I found in Fast Fit. I slashed the pattern at the crotch line and rotated just the inseam side downward to add more length between crotch and knee. Those results were pretty darn good but I thought I needed just a little bit more inseam length and a little less outseam length so I tried a cross-twistie. That is, I slashed at the knee line and used the center point as my pivot point to add more length to the inseam and remove the same amount from the outseam. If you think you might need this too, keep in mind that both the inseam wedge and the cross-twistie shift the angle of the leg. (BTW, both of these alterations mean you must redraw the grainline and other reference lines.) If you don't need that shift, you may also need to add a step of moving the leg back and truing up the seamlines. I think the Singer Sewing Pants that Fit book has a knock-kneed alteration that does just that. For me, the wedge just seemed to address what I needed. Your mileage may vary!"},
{"title": "Is it pants yet?", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2006", "text": "The answer is a resounding NO!Pants are so frustrating, aren't they? My custom pattern block described in my last post was pretty close the last time I worked on them (last summer), but it still wasn't the ultime perfect that I'm after.After more discussion with the Fitting Fairy God-dess-mother and book/article research, I decided I need to either lengthen the sideseam or lengthen the inseam. I plowed ahead and decided to start with a lengthened sideseam trial. I had to pick one, right? We were questioning whether the diagonal wrinkles were pointing to a need for more sideseam length which meant it was Trial and Error time (heavy on the Error, as I found out).I traced and altered my pattern yet again. I cut out the test fabric with 1\" seam allowances and basted the seams with a 1/2\" allowance. Tried them on and ... no cigar. Too baggy in the legs to really tell a whole lot. But hey, at least the lying crotch smiles were gone. I called it a night and vegged in front of the TV watching Tivo'd shows with fitting books spread all around me.Today is another day. The kids are home from school in anticipation of Turkey Day tomorrow and since there's nothing truly urgent to interrupt my time, I've decreed it a day off for me too and a Pants Work Day. I re-basted the seams with the full 1\" seam allowance and ... those same blasted diagonal wrinkles were again looking back at me in the mirror. Sigh. Not the crotch smiles, though. I think I've banished them for good by using a pattern with the correct center back angle for my backside.I ripped out the inseam on one leg from just below the crotch to just above the hem and this time I saw perfection staring back at me. The only problem: I can't exactly walk around town with my inseams gaping wide open. I re-basted (again) the back inseam with a smaller seam allowance, keeping the front at 1\" to see if it was a simple matter of needing more ease in the back. It wasn't. The diagonals were back.Time for another scissors and tape session. I removed the added sideseam length from last night and traded it for increased inseam length. Between inner thigh fluff and underlying bone structure, my gut has been telling me I need a knock-knee alteration. I.e., adding more length to the inseam. I ignored said gut last night, but today I'm listening. I added more length between crotch and knee. I hope my gut is right. I'm just about to cut out another muslin and sew it up."},
{"title": "Whoooosh!!", "date": "Tuesday, November 21, 2006", "text": "That was the entire last week going by. Where did it go? Did I do anything fun? Well, hmmm. I guess it depends on how you define fun. I have been sewing, but not anything worth showing off. Or, apparently even finishing if the carcasses of unloved pants in my sewing room is anything to go by. Remember last week when I typed about the black KS 3277 pants, \"The back has some crotch smiles so I still need more thunder-thighs room for the next pair. Not a big deal to fix.\"?Famous. Last. Words.I now have four, count 'em, FOUR more incarnations of this pattern, 3 of which are lacking waistbands and all of which are lacking hems. All except one pair are from replaceable fabric. The others are the brown bengaline. Sniff, sniff. But I do think they'll be wearable, as long as I don't look at my butt in a mirror. Something I try to avoid anyway, so that shouldn't be a big problem. I just wanted them closer to perfect than they are.So, I cried out for help to my Sewing & Fitting Fairy God-dess-mother, and she answered, telling and showing me things I actually already knew but needed a big thump on the head to see what's been staring me in the face. She has a gift for making what is frustrating to understand, straightforward and almost simple. I'm not calling her by name in case she doesn't want to be inundated with pleas from the masses, but you know who you are and if you're OK with being \"outed,\" I know you'll let me know.So, what have I learned?1. Crotch smiles can lie. This becomes glaringly obvious when one has added so much extra at the crotch points that one could also fit a small child inside her pants legs and yet, the smiles still remain. (On the pants, not on my face! Although the thought of a small child in my pants is kind of funny.)2. Less is more . Sure, we've all heard how wonderful the Burda crotch curve is because it's got that great bias back angle. However, you can end up with too much of a good thing if you're not careful. Case in point:The pattern on top is my nearly perfect \"block.\" This is the pattern I spent countless hours and days perfecting and fisheye-darting, and it is 99% perfect. (Why did I leave it? I'm asking myself the very same thing today.) The pattern underneath it is the latest altered version of KS 3277. I'm sure you can see (as had to be thumped into my head) the significant difference between the crotch angles. The less severe angle of the top pattern fits me better. The other one just makes the fabric hang weird and bunch up at the crotch because I don't have enough outward butt curve to fill out that space. And that's (probably) what is causing those lying crotch smiles. I say probably because I haven't made it up to the sewing room today to actually test this —I'm supposed to be working— but I do have previous pants made from that pattern that fit 1,000% better than the KS pants and which do NOT give me lying smiles.3. Don't deny yourself. Read fitting solutions for all body types. We tend to be blissfully unaware, or in denial, of some aspects of our bodies so we tend to skip information we think doesn't apply. I know I have large thighs so I always zero-in on that information. But, did you know that full inner thigh flesh can also mimic in fabric the results a knock-kneed figure would see? Yep, I didn't think so either. Until I realized that adding all the fabric in the world to my crotch points still wasn't getting rid of those blasted smiles and then started looking for other reasons/answers. If you look at the patterns in the photo above again, you should also be able to see that the legs in the upper good pattern have a different \"shift\" to them. This fits me much better since it gives me more fabric along the inseams where I need it. I still need to work on and perfect this, but the reasons I get twisty wrinkles in addition to the lying smiles from the KS pattern is so much clearer when I see both patterns together like this.4. Don't trust the experts. Well, not blindly. I have many, many fitting books and articles. Much of the information is brilliant as well as accurate. But some of it is not, at least not for all body types and/or all fitting dilemmas. Which leads me to …5. Trust your instincts. If you see one expert's telltale sign that you need X alteration to fix the problem but yet it doesn't seem to work, don't assume it's you. Sometimes it's them. Or, sometimes it's that their particular method isn't correct for your particular shape. Move on. Find another method or make one up yourself. Pin. Slash. Spread. Study. And Experiment. It's only fabric and time. 6. Be patient. All of this experimentation and edumahcation ;-) takes time. Don't rush it. Make those muslins. Take notes. Transfer changes and markings to pattern and/or muslin now instead of trying to remember them later. Take many breaks to think things through and re-energize. You'll get there eventually. And when you do, you're going to know so much!7. Resist pattern book temptation. (See below.)I'm tossing that KS pattern, never to be made for this body again. Tonight, I'll start back in with my block. It's so close to perfection that I can almost taste it. Slap me the next time I try to deviate from it, will ya? I will spend far less time modifying this pattern into different styles than I would spend altering the pretty styles in other patterns to my body."},

Grab your compass!First, on the Stitcher's Guild message board I saw a link to a fascinating Discovery Channel \"How It's Made\" video which shows the industrial methods & machines for making a pair of jeans, start to finish. I thought I'd share it here in case you don't read SG. It's worth the watch. Click here.Next, I did actually finish my black yoga pants yesterday and I'll be wearing these a lot. Can you believe this is the only pair of black pants I own? The fit is pretty good — perfect from the front, so I'll only look at the front. ;-) The back has some crotch smiles so I still need more thunder-thighs room for the next pair. Not a big deal to fix. I need to clear away the project debris in the sewing room so I have a clear view to the mirror. Then I'll post a pic or two. Note to self: Remind DH to hang the dang mirror already.This morning, I transferred my fit-as-you-go alterations to the pattern paper (yes, I actually cut a Kwik Sew pattern!) and started laying it out on the bengaline. It ain't gonna fit. At least not without some creativity. So I've stalled and will have to regroup. I'm thinking I could do a crotch gusset, since it's the mega back crotch point (thunder-thighs, remember?) that is making the pieces just a bit too wide to lay side by side. In case I didn't mention it, the stretch in stretch bengaline runs lengthwise, not widthwise as you'd expect. Otherwise, I'd have more than enough.I'm about out of time to make good on my 2006 resolutions so this one will have to roll over for 2007, but a project I've wanted to do is a tailored, lined jacket. I don't have anywhere to actually wear such a jacket, but I still want to do this just to do it. Over the weekend, I ordered the Palmer/Pletsch \"Jackets for Real People\" DVD. I have the companion book on fitting, but I wanted the video so I could watch Marta Alto constructing jackets. The other P/P construction videos I have have all been well-made, so I expect to enjoy this latest DVD too.This is one of the candidates. I've been reading the \"couture\" instructions and am morbidly fascinated. I say \"morbidly\" because I'm so NOT a hand-sewer. But, still, something is calling to me and I'm thinking I might just try it. If I do, it will likely be 2008 before I'm done because this isn't something I could work on exclusively until it's done. I've also got tons of current and back issues of Burda WOF, each containing multiple jackets. As long as I have my other resources for construction steps and info, those are a possibility too."},

Go figure.I've now traced and cut KS 3277 (above), the plus version of KS 3115 (below).I thought this would be my muslin for the Bengaline but the fabric I'm using doesn't have as much stretch so it will only be a quasi-muslin.

It's done and I'll take pics & review it soon, but I just have to shout from the rooftops. Plus the Colts are beating the Patriots and I have to get back to the game to watch them finish the job.In the meantime, here are a couple of pics showing some of the reasons I love this top. The gathering at center front is a great dart alternative, I'm always a sucker for empire lines, and the tie makes a great vertical line for my fluffy self. (You can click on the pics for bigger versions.)As you can see, the tie actually comes up behind the neckline binding, and the gathering is adjustable so you can decide how low you want to go.I'm a bit burned out from doing muslins and fittings so a forgiving knit was on the cutting table today. That's it above. I like how it picks up on the undertones in this skirt, (which you would think is a regular denim blue ... until you put it next to anything other than white).The chosen pattern for this top is from Burda WOF 06/2005 (#111). It's a pattern for a woven but since when does that ever stop me? ;-) I traced the Burda pattern last night and a quick pin fit told me it was going to be more alteration work than I wanted to do. (See above re being burned out.) So I opened up my pattern software and started doodling. This is the line drawing for the Burda pattern pieces.This is what I came up with after some dart rotation on my standard empire bodice pattern (the program creates that for me) and a couple of manual changes to the hemline and cuff. I printed it out and taped it together.This morning, I tried on the upper bodice pattern before committing it to the fabric and decided that I needed to dart out some of the spread at the neckline or else it would probably fall off my shoulders. So I reverted to low-tech. I squooshed a dart in the paper, cut it apart and taped it into a 3D cone/dart. Then I cut a slash roughly where you see that line in the upper bodice piece above and spread the paper until the pattern laid flat again. I reshaped the front gathering area and called it done. I'm not making a muslin. If the top works, I'll be thrilled. If it doesn't, I'll be sad to see this Textiles Studios fabric wasted … but I'll get over it.

I think this makes the 7th time I've cut it out, but who's counting. This one is already better because it's lost the Lunch Lady look. ;-)I extended the neckline/shoulder area toward my neck and redrew the collar. In the pic below, the original collar pattern piece is shown to the left of the yellow line and the new extension is to the right. This piece is to be cut on the fold, so I added about 4 inches in total length. This new collar matches the line drawing much more closely and I like it so much better. I didn't actually cut these collar pieces on the fold (in case you're wondering) because I'm dealing with stripes and I wanted the collar points to be symmetrical. I added a seam allowance and center back seam so I could cut each half separately. While I was making collar pieces I also made a separate pattern for the undercollar, trimming 1/8\" from the front and outside edges, so the top collar would naturally roll to the underside, as shown.  I'm not going to topstitch the neckline edges until I baste the rest of the pieces together and try it on. Six times burned, seventh time shy ... or something like that.

Sigh.I spent some mirror time today trying to figure out what I needed to do to fix this. I decided I can't. The biggest problem is the neckline and the second biggest is the collar. The neckline is too wide up at my front neck/shoulders. It fits fine at the back neck. The collar is too short and shallow. I even added 1-1/4\" to the length of the collar before I cut it in this fabric. If I hadn't, it would've been sitting at my shoulder seams.Look at the line drawing for the pattern. Pity there's no photo representation on a live human. The collar is much longer and the points are much deeper in the drawing than in reality. That's one of the reasons I liked this top. No wonder I'm not happy with this version. Since I can't add fabric at the neck, I don't think I'll ever be happy with how it looks, or feels, on me.I do think I can fix the pattern though. I've got all the other fitting issues taken care of, so at this point I'd only have to redraw the neckline and collar.

{"title": "Separation Anxiety", "date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2006", "text": "A new topic showed up today on a sewing message board. The topic starter asked readers to rank various sewing machine features in order of preference. As I looked over the list, I started to mentally re-order them into my must-haves.That's when I realized that while my machine has those must-haves, I've been doing without many of them for some time because I can't bear the thought of leaving my baby for repair. I mean, what if I want to sew? Yeah, I technically have a backup machine -- a BOL mechanical Kenmore -- but it hasn't seen the light of day (or touch of oil) for over 5 years. And after our move last year, I'm not even exactly sure I know where it is. Excuses, excuses. See. I'm good at justifying why not to pack her up and take her in.Which means that right now I'm sewing without my needle threader, without a machine light (bad board that eats bulbs), without the low bobbin indicator, and the worst -- without reverse. So, are they really must-haves? Apparently not, because their absence hasn't stopped me. Oh, and my machine is also on a recall list, needing a transformer swap out, which I suppose means I'm risking danger everytime time I turn it on. Extreme sewing, eh? ;-)The upcoming week will be a non-sewing week for me, so I've promised myself (again) that I will take my machine in for a long-overdue servicing. Hopefully by publicly announcing my intentions this time, I'll actually follow through. Please keep me honest and ask me about it next week. And who knows? If I start to get the shakes, maybe I'll dig out that Kenmore and see how she's doing.* * * * *As for my Simplicity 3990 top ... It's nearly finished but. Yep, but. The crossover neckline is very gape-y. I know I didn't stretch the bias edge because I stabilized it right away and everything fit together as it should. I'm guessing the fabric is a bit more forgiving than my muslins and that overall everything probably loosened up a bit as I was sewing. The top is in the washer/dryer cycle right now and my finger are crossed in the hopes of some residual shrinking happening.I have a photo of it, unhemmed so I know it's too long, but still, it just looks so ... so ... matronly. It's really not like this in real life, but in the photo, I feel like I should be wearing it while working in a hospital or cafeteria. What do you think?Oops. There's the washer bell.

I really like working with this fabric and I'm sure it's going to be very comfortable to wear. I bought another color too which is going to be moving to the top of the To Use list now.Now that I've got the fitting issues resolved, I love this pattern again, though I'm not thrilled with the collar. This one turned out OK, but I really should've cut a separate undercollar piece since Simplicity didn't provide one. Why not? They printed 3 separate bust sizes for each view. What's another collar piece at that point?? But I made an Executive Decision to be lazy since I knew that the silk would be forgiving. Another fabric won't be. When I finish this, I'll make an undercollar pattern so I don't forget. Famous last words.I'm hoping to work on this tonight around multiple loads of teenage boy laundry. There's really not a lot left to do so I might even finish it. Again, famous last words."},
{"title": "The last muslin. This time I mean it. Really. I swear.", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2006", "text": "As someone who doesn't often sew true muslins, I'm really going overboard now. I made the last adjustments detailed in the blog entry just below this one and cut another muslin. That makes number 5, if you're counting. I won't bore you with how I screwed up those last adjustments and ended up 4 inches wrong on the sideseams, only because I have no idea how I did that. I untaped and started over and everything lined up great for the second go. Whew! I must've still been in shock that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won yesterday in the last 30 seconds of the game.So there it is. And for an added happy accident bonus, I love how the stripes ended up on the side panels, so I'll definitely be incorporating that somehow into the final version. I say \"happy accident\" because I had to cut those panels on the crossgrain as I was short on fabric. Making all these muslins sure is putting a dent in the ugly section of my stash, and that particular fabric was leftover from cornice boards I made for my previous house. The cheetah print? No, not so much. I'll be losing that. (And the crowd sighs in relief.)The only changes left to make to the pattern paper are to (1) narrow the shoulders, which is a regular adjustment for me. I left it until last to see just how much after final muslin and sleeve were sewn. And (2) to scoop out a bit of the front neckline so the crossover happens at a more visually pleasing location. I.e., not at the exact center of a boobie. You can see how I've folded it over on the muslin. Oh, and (3), I might make the collar a bit longer but I'm still deciding on that.During this journey I've learned that I have a Short Upper Rib Cage, per Fitting & Pattern Alteration, A Multi-Method Approach (Liechty, Pottberg, Rasband). I've kind of known that I was shorter from shoulder to bust than most patterns, but I didn't think *I* was particularly short there nor would I ever have called it a Short Upper Rib Cage. In fact, it took me a few tries to even find this in that book (page 277) because I wasn't thinking ribs and totally skipped over that section in the index.\"The bones forming the upper rib cage area are lighter than average; the spacing between the adjacent ribs maybe closer. The length decreases from theshoulder to the bustline. [Ah HAH!] The length variation may affect the length of the joints or the space between the arm hinge and the bustline. [Double Ah HAH!]\"Sometimes just for kicks, I read the descriptions for figure anomolies that I don't have ... the descriptions are so strange and clinical. Yes, I'm easily amused.Here's one I particularly like:\"The muscles and the soft tissues forming the contour of the inner thigh areas are less developed than average. When the person stands, there is a definite visible space between the legs from the crotch nearly to the knee.\"Now how good does that sound to a thunder-thighed woman like myself? It makes those enviable thin thighs (\"shallow\" in F&PA speak) sound like a figure FLAW! As if.But seriously, I do like this book and find myself looking to it as often as I take Fit for Real People (Palmer/Pletsch) off the shelf. F&PA includes diagnoses and solutions for a lot more figure idosyncracies. But the two books definitely go hand in hand, because although F&PA has more analyses, the solutions are often cryptic and hard to figure out exactly what's been slashed, pivoted, or otherwise altered from the drawings. FFRP gives you a good foundation for slash/spread, which helps to figure out F&PA.Will I cut the real fabric today? I hope so, but first I've got to return some tuxedos to the rental store, get some groceries and do a few more errands."},
{"title": "Muslins everywhere and not a thing to wear (yet)", "date": "Sunday, October 22, 2006", "text": "(Click on the photo to enlarge it if you want to see more details.)I'm still battling with Simplicity 3990. I was nearly ready to just toss it all and make a tee shirt or pillow or something else easy, but the OCD in me makes it very hard to just give up or give in.Yesterday, I found myself with a couple of hours between errands and getting my sons ready for their big dance and I decided to try on my various muslins and take pics hoping either I or the camera would see something that I've been missing. My Aussie friend Belinda often advises me to put a frustrating garment into the \"magic wardrobe\" (wardrobe = closet in Aussie-speak). Again, this advice was spot-on except this time instead of magic wardrobe it was magic heap-on-the-floor as that's where all those muslins landed.My first muslin isn't pictured as I had ripped it apart when my mom was here. As I mentioned in a previous entry it did show me that I needed more bust room than the D cup pattern piece provided. That led to Muslin 2, above.My try-ons of Muslin 2 last week were also disappointing and being short on time, I thought I'd go the easy route (hah!) by recreating the style with my pattern software. Muslin 3, above, is the first version of that pattern. Still not happy with the front neckline gape and back neckline shape. Which led to tweaking some things, another print-out/taping session for the next pattern and Muslin 4, above. Meh. Muslin 4 is no real improvement, most likely because I was overthinking at that point and making changes about which I really knew better. Sometimes I'm \"too smart\" for my own good. Sigh.Which brings me back to yesterday's photo session. Muslin 2 is clearly more flattering in the waist and generally overall, although I do need a scootch more room in the derriere area. I also need to fold out more from shoulder to bust for the front, and shoulder to waist for the back. In the photo, I've taken a fold across the entire back and on the front side just below the camera (my actual right side -- remember this is a mirror image). That fold at the front makes things close to perfect. The neckline isn't gaping as it is on the other side. The bust point is correct and where the princess seaming hits is good. Why didn't I see this last week??Muslin 3 (from my software) is boxy and the neckline is gaping and too low. Muslin 4 (software) is better than 3 but I'm still not loving how the neckline hits on me or how low it seems. Muslin 4 is pictured with seam allowances outside so it looks bigger than it actually is.On deck for today during football games: Start with Muslin 2, transfer the fold out from shoulder to bust/waist onto the pattern, add more width across the back hips, and cut out the flippin' final fabric. Oh, and make a note that the shoulder-to-waist tuck is something I probably need to do for most patterns, especially Women's (Plus) patterns.This all illustrates one reason I still buy patterns even though I'm pretty good with my pattern software. There are often stylistic and shaping subtleties that can easily be lost in the translation (or impatience!) from pattern line drawing to pattern software. Commercial patterns, where a designer has already done all the hard work, really are a bargain at any price. And when they're on sale, they're priceless.Pattern software is great, don't get me wrong. I use it a LOT! But if I had to choose between knowing my pattern software and knowing how to alter patterns to fit me, I'd choose the latter every time. Thankfully, I'm lucky and don't have to choose because many times they work hand in hand and almost every time I use one or the other, I learn something new. So while this multi-muslin meandering was frustrating, it was also educational. Once I put all this behind me and am wearing my new blouse, I'll appreciate the learning experience even more. For now, I just want to get this blasted thing done. ;-)"},
{"title": "Proud Mom Moment", "date": "Saturday, October 21, 2006", "text": "Please indulge me while I show off my handsome sons. This is Homecoming weekend for their high school. It's somewhat bittersweet as this is DS#1's last Homecoming. But at the same time it's DS#2's first (he's the one with the mohawk). Yes, TWO tuxedo rentals and all the related expenses in one week! What fun they're going to have!I hope they stay safe tonight. I'll be up until they're back and in their beds.ETA: Maria asked for an explanation of what Homecoming is. Here's the short version Maria. Homecoming is an annual tradition in the United States where high schools and colleges come together, usually in late September or October, to welcome back former residents and alumni to \"come home\" to their former school. It is built around a central event, usually a football game and often coincides with the last \"home\" game of the season. During the week preceding the football game, there are other student activites including parades, dress-up days in school colors and other fun themes, pep rallies, etc. That week is called \"Spirit Week.\" The students also nominate a \"Homecoming Court\" of a certain number of males and females who will be voted on by secret ballot to choose a Homecoming Queen and King from the senior (or graduating) members of the Court. The Court is usually presented during the halftime of the football game and the Queen is crowned, often by the previous year's Queen. At some schools, the King is also crowned then and at others (like at my sons' school), the King is crowned at the dance the following night. Being in the Court, or King or Queen is an honorary and only-for-fun designation. The week culiminates with a big dance, either formal or semi-formal dress, held either on or off the school campus. As you can see by the photos, my sons' school dance is formal. Their dance was held off-campus."},
{"title": "Rocky 2", "date": "Thursday, October 19, 2006", "text": "ETA: DS did get a pic of the squirrel when he made his second appearance. He left it in the camera as a surprise for me to find. Like I need any more squirrel surprises!No, not *that* Rocky. Rocky, as in Bullwinkle. Yep, another squirrel. And it scared the BEGEEZUS outta me. Just how do they know when I'm home alone??Yesterday afternoon and DH had just called to tell me they were in the car and on their way from airport. I fiddled around a bit in the kitchen and then went into the family room to turn on the TV and veg with Rachel Ray for 20 minutes or so until they came home. As I started to walk over to my chair of choice and grab the remote, something jumped up (besides me) and went scrambling. And it kept scrambling, all over the tops of my wall unit pieces. Yikes. I nearly peed my pants passed out. Then it started making cute little squirrel noises and I relaxed a bit. Just a bit, because, well, I still had a squirrel in the house.I opened the door to outside and waited. It kept making its little noises, almost like it was scolding me for being in the room. I took the hint. I ran upstairs to get the camera. As you can tell by the absence of a photo here, I never got a pic. When I got back to the family room (after being gone 15 seconds, tops) everything was very quiet and I never heard the noises again.DH gets home, I tell him I think the squirrel is still there but I haven't seen or heard anything in the last 30 minutes or so and I'm wondering if maybe he did escape out the door after all. DH does some furniture moving and looks behind the wall units as best as he can. Nothing. We all agree that the squirrel is gone. We close the doors, go on our merry way, eat dinner and I go upstairs.Later, when I come down again, DH tells me that the squirrel never left and that they'd managed to chase it outside through those doors ... where it promptly ran right into the pool and started to dog (squirrel?) paddle like no one's business. DH rescued it with the pool pole/net and it's now free to come into the house yet again. I know, it's probably not the same squirrel, but still.Yes, DH needs to cover that chimney. But our huge ladder doesn't reach all the way to the top of the chimney and I'm not willing to risk DH's life just to have the chimney covered. I supposed we'll need to rent an even bigger ladder for an hour or so. Yeah, like that's at the top of the list."},
{"title": "3 Steps Forward, 2 Steps Back", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2006", "text": "Those are my muslins for Simplicity 3990. I had high hopes for this pattern, with its separate bust cup sizing, but those hopes are long since out the window.My first try-on of my STP (Swedish tracing paper) tracing seemed to fit. But upon closer inspection, I realized I actually didn't have enough bust room, even using the D cup pattern piece. Not really surprising since I am a DD, not a D. So I made a FBA (full bust alteration) and cut a muslin. The bust fit was great ... if I yanked the bust area up about an inch and a half. In other words, there was too much length between shoulder and bust. So I pinned that out, transferred it to my pattern pieces and cut another muslin. That was better but still not the \"great\" I was after. Little things were off, like where the princess seams hit, the back neckline and how low the armholes were. I started watching the Top Chef marathon on Bravo and ignored the sewing room.After watching the last half of Season 1 (I'm now hooked, thankyouverymuchBravo, and boy does this show make you hungry!), I decided to stop trying to reinvent the wheel. I copied the style lines using my pattern software (PMB) and printed out a pattern I knew would fit. I should've done this from the start as the style is really quite simple and very easy to copy ... and I would've had a finished blouse by now.Apparently mom knows best because when she was here and watching me alter after the first tissue-fitting, she asked why I wasn't using a TNT pattern since surely I must have a similar pattern that already fits. Grrrr. I hate it when she's right.So today I will try to decide which good fabric I'll use for my PMB version of this blouse and hopefully move along on this project. Tonight, I'll be watching the season finale of Project Runway and then I'll have to stay tuned for the premiere of the next season of Top Chef.* * * * *BTW, I do have a separate web host (a few actually) where I could put photos and link to them (but thank you anyway Amber), it's just that it ticks me off when Blogger doesn't work like it should. I like to keep things in their places and putting some Blog pics here and some in other places just feels messy to me. I do get over that when I give up on waiting for Blogger, but I still don't like it. ;-)"},
{"title": "A Good (Long) Weekend", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2006", "text": "My mom arrived Wednesday night. We spent a bit of time in my sewing room on Thursday while I traced and cut out the muslin for my Simplicity 3990 blouse. Then we were off for my Football Mom errands. Home again for a couple hours, long enough to sew up the muslin and have a quick try-on, then off to the game. I snuck in some pattern alterations on Friday and that's the stage it's still in. I decided to go to Plan B for the family get-together outfit and not to stress over a blouse.Mom and I left here Saturday around noon and arrived in plenty of time for the party start time of 3 PM. Follow the red line on the map above and that's where we went -- from the west coast of Florida, straight across Route 60 to the east coast. I saw cousins I haven't seen in over 10 years, aunts, uncles, and more. It was a fun time with great conversations and great food & drink. We went back to my cousin's house after the official party and partied some more. My family is nothing if not party animals, even the \"old\" folks. In fact, I think they may be the worst offenders! Most of my aunts/uncles and mom's cousins are nearer to my age than my mother's and we've always been close and now that my first cousins have grown up, there's not such a feeling of a huge age difference so I had lots of people to talk to and laugh with. But I can't believe my cousins are in (or close to) their 30s now, some with kids of their own. It's too bad that DH and my boys had to stay home. They were missed and they would've had a blast.Apologies for the low-detail cellphone pics. I forgot my real camera in my suitcase.My mom's cousin's husband Joe (did you follow that?) took 9 of us out on his boat (above pics) for a few hours on Sunday. The weather was perfect (I have a pink face and arms to prove it) and the boat ride was fantastic. The best part of the trip was all the dolphins in the water, who jumped and played and came up alongside the boat to race us. I've lived in Florida for over 16 years and this is the closest I've been to dolphins outside of Sea World. It was very cool!Mom left a few hours ago, with my menfolk who are on their way to the Meadowlands in NJ to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers tomorrow night. DS#1 has been waiting his whole life for this concert. I'm home alone dogsitting, and I'm sure I'll squeeze in a few hours of sewing here and there. ;-) Although I didn't think it about since Friday, the blouse is starting to call to me again.I also remembered to snap a pic of me and The Blouse That Would Not End while I was wearing it today and before I laid down for a quick nap to recharge after the weekend. Two months later is better than not at all, right? It's linen, it's wrinkled of course, and the color is off but there it is. It's a very comfortable blouse. I also had about 2 inches of my hair chopped off last week, which was perfect for the boat trip yesterday. It's a great cut ... those flippy ends do that all by themselves. The older I get, the less I want to waste time fiddling with hairstyles that my hair isn't made for. It's right up there on the list with comfortable shoes. Boy am I getting old or what!* * * * * * *Just a little rant here ... While I've surprised myself by actually liking and continuing with this blogging stuff, I absolutely HATE the delays with Blogger when uploading pics. But I'm too cheap to pay for this stuff so I'll just clench my teeth and try to deal with it."},

{"title": "Home from shopping, with everything and ... more", "date": "Monday, October 9, 2006", "text": "I must've been kidding myself when I thought I'd avoid crowds at Joann's by not shopping over the weekend. Sheesh. But then I remembered it's Halloween costume time and I was very glad I passed by the fabric because the cutting line was out the door.Here's the patterns I came home with. J's did have them all in stock so I didn't have to deal with the Walmart service (?) desk for price matching. Apparently, it was my Khaliah Ali day ... although there are a few others in the mix. The scrubs pattern is for my sister. The men's shirts patterns are for all the guys in the family. Now that I'm typing this, I realize I should've bought two of the shirt patterns so I wouldn't have to trace. Oh well. I also bought the thread I was after. My local Joann's sells Maxilock serger thread for $2.49 every day, although it's clearly marked $4.99 on the package. They had Maxilock Swirl which was marked $9.95 on the package and on the shelf. No, thank you. It looks cool, but not that cool. Gutermann was 40% off, which I didn't know, so it was picked over. But I did find the basics I needed in the drawers underneath the display -- 2 white, 2 off-white, 2 black. I know I need others but I forgot to make a note of which and when I do that and buy anyway, I always seem to buy the same colors so I tried to be smarter today.I also went by the Husqvarna Viking store inside of Joann's and had to almost tie my hands together. They have SO MANY new goodies on display and I was salivating. But I left with only the one thing I was after -- a button sewing-on foot. It's really cool ... it has a slot to slide the button into which holds it in place while you machine-sew on the button. I nearly always sew buttons on by machine but I also curse when they slide around. This foot should take care of that. I'll try it out later and let you know how it works.HV has also come out with a few new clear feet and an adjustable edge foot. I was tempted, but I stayed strong. The clear feet are duplicates of metal feet I already have and use all the time and a quick look at the adjustable edge foot looked interesting but it wasn't a must-have for today. Viking feet are on the pricey side, but maybe next time. I love machine feet BTW and have almost all that Viking makes for my machine, so it's probably only a matter of time before I weaken. The last item I came home with was most definitely NOT on my shopping list.A speeding ticket. Grrrr! And about 1/8 mile from my house. I swear I wasn't speeding. (Yeah, they all say that, don't they?) I was coming up on a stop sign at a 4-way intersection. The cop was coming towards me on the opposite side of the road and says he \"clocked me going 60 in a 40.\" Sheyaw. So, that means I'll get to spend a day in court fighting this ... which I will definitely do. I haven't had a speeding ticket in over 20 years and besides, they are EXPENSIVE in Florida. This one is $210.50 if I were to just pay it and move on. Do you know how much fabric I could buy for $210.50?? And you thought tourism was our major industry. ;-)ETA: OMG, I totally forgot about the cutting mat I was going to buy. Sheesh, what a dork. Well, looks like I have an excuse to go back to Joann's when my mom is here. The skirt is done and I really like it. Photos do not do justice to the fabric at all. The crosshatch pattern is much nicer than what shows here. I'll take a pic of me in it and will probably write a review (there's only one on PR and with no photo) after I have a top to wear with it. But no, I still don't know what that top will be. I can't decide if I want a blouse or a tee or a tunic-y thing. I think I'm going to try on some tops I already have to see what basic shape works best with the skirt. Maybe that will give me some direction.Then I'm off to Joann's to hit the last day of the Simplicity pattern sale. I avoid J's on weekends because I hate crowds. But I really need white serger thread before I run out and I need to restock some basic colors of regular sewing thread. I might even also break down and buy one of those big white cutting mats for my cutting table. I've hesitated so far because they're not self-healing. But I'm going to try hard NOT to go near any fabric. I hate most of what J's sells but sometimes there's a gem or two hidden near the miles of poly silkies and fleeces. Just because I've cleared a bit of space from the stash closet doesn't mean I need to rush out and fill it back up.If J's is out of the patterns on my list, I'll hit Walmart for a price match. I need to go there anyway because I've decided I need some self-tanner for my ghost legs if I'm going to wear this skirt to the family thing next weekend and not scare my relatives. My boys' play football at night now so I've missed a season of Saturdays in the sun and my legs reflect (and I do mean reflect!) that."},

This fabric has the perfect amount of drape for the side flounces and cut-on godets and a try-on after all seams were sewn tells me it's going to fit well.

I can see that this is going to be a favorite pattern that I'll use many times.As I near the completion of the skirt (while peeking at the football games) I'm starting to contemplate a top. I have a few ideas but nothing is decided yet. I can't decide whether to start with fabric or pattern and so I'm having a small case of analysis paralysis. I've still got a week to get it done.

{"title": "Next Up", "date": "Saturday, October 7, 2006", "text": "This afternoon I traced the View B skirt from Kwik Sew 3287 above. I'm going to make it with the nice lightweight cross-hatched denim sent to me all the way from Australia by my good friend Belinda. The pattern is a regular (i.e., non-plus) sized KS pattern and since my ample posterior is just outside the sizing range, I had to add a little bit of width. It's a simple, pull-on skirt with only 3 pattern pieces so the alteration was quick and easy -- just slash through the middle of the panels and spread. I think the fabric is drapey enough to be complemented by the inset flounces on either side, without sticking out all stiff and ugly and the seaming will look good topstitched. I'd really like to wear a new casual skirt to a family gathering (my great aunt's birthday) coming up next weekend so I hope I'm not off-base with my assessments.After that's done, a new top to wear with it and new PJs for the overnight portion of the trip are on the short-list. My mom arrives Wednesday night so we may be doing much of our visiting in my sewing room -- which should be OK with mom, since she's a sewer too. It's either that or getting handed a paintbrush!"},

I'm back, everything's OK, but I'm only just now catching up with my world again. Whew!This project was started a few weeks ago. I/we finally finished it today, save for painting doors and installing one of them. It's technically the living room, and hopefully will be again after we build our addition, but for now it's my office-slash-living room and so hosts a slight mix of living room and office furniture. Still, I'm pleased and it is definitely a huge improvement over how the room has looked through all of its iterations since we bought the house almost 4 years ago.We've had this flooring for a couple of years, just waiting in boxes for us. We decided that the time was upon us and figured a long weekend and we'd have the floor in. We've been at this remodeling for a while now. We should've known better. We didn't figure time for the baseboards which needed to be painted, cut and installed. Or the crown molding. Or completely tearing out and rebuilding a door frame because the \"new\" (vs. how we bought the house) drywall in the family room extended out past the existing frame by a good inch. Or an unexpected mad-dash trip. Or the 1,001 other little fiddly things (like actually locating and then unpacking the boxes which hold the living room knick-knacks) which need doing when you're finishing a room. Laying the floor was relatively easy and each of the other projects weren't too difficult either. But add them all together and it's more than a weekend. Or two. This is the finished room ... except for those doors and hanging some pictures on the bare walls.This is what the same angle of the room looked like with the previous owners' stuff in it, complete with dark panelling, built in Formica cabinets, and decades old, yellowing photos on the walls . Lover-ly, ain't it? You're lucky this isn't Scratch 'n Sniff, as the house used to smell as bad as it looked.Fast (?) forward 3+ years and this is my view out the (newly framed) window. I love it! Not so much on the icky concrete edging and weeds out there. All in time, all in time.The chairs sitting at either side of the window belonged to my parents. They are quite 1970s and will be replaced at some point after all the remodeling dust settles. But to my eye they almost sort of go with the whole look in the room, and they bring back memories of my childhood which feels as comfortable as actually sitting in them. So for now, they'll be around and I'll laugh at their outward ugliness and smile at their inner beauty.If you want to see the whole project from start to finish, here are the links:Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3 If you want to try out a cool nail gun or learn how to lay floors, c'mon by.

{"title": "Bits and snips", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2006", "text": "This is the carpet under my cutting table, after a week. I recognize all the snips except that yellow-ish one in the middle. What/where did that come from? I'm sure you can all relate. So now before I start another project, I feel the need to vacuum. It shouldn't be too hard because the vacuum is actually still in the sewing room from last week. I've been tripping over it for days, which somehow didn't spur me on to actually using it and putting it away. The biggest problem with vacuuming in there is that as soon as I finish, the threads and fabric bits will jump back onto the floor in the blink of an eye. A creative room definitely doesn't equal a vacuumed floor.In other bits mostly unrelated to this or each other ...It was the pockets of DS' jeans that I slightly screwed up. There is a row of satin stitching and a row of regular topstitching across the center. On one pocket, the satin stitching is the upper row. On the other, it's the lower row. Not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but not what I had intended. I'm over it now but those little goofs do bug me when they happen, being the OCD idiot that I am. And if it had to be, why couldn't I notice it before I attached the pocket to the pants and thus have a less labor-intensive opportunity to fix it — or, even better, not notice at all?DS#2 has been into me sewing for him lately. He doesn't want to go to the mall (yay! neither do I) but he wants new things. I think seeing the stash out of bins and now quite visible in the open closet has given him a mental green light for shopping it. I like sewing for my sons because they usually have a unique style or design in mind and so in a way it feels like we're collaborating. Which I guess we are. It's also quite ego-boosting that they believe I can make anything. Lucky for me they aren't wanting 3-piece suits.I started and finished this shirt last night.It's Simplicity 4207, reviewed on PR here. DS' input was on the iron-on transfers. He had sketched it out and laid it on my desk without me knowing and I found it afterward. Isn't that cute? How could I refuse? He did love it, but he's not about to grin in any 6:30 a.m. photo! I made the shorts he's wearing too, the test shorts here. Gotta love a kid that asks for sewing and then wears it too!"},

MaryB clued me in to Bloglines when I first started this blog, by asking me to add the Bloglines button to my sidebar. (It's at the top right if you're looking.) When she asked, I had no idea what Bloglines was ... being a blog newbie and all. So I looked into it, liked it, and have been using it ever since. Thanks Mary!Bloglines is free, easy to use, and makes keeping track of new blog entries a snap. It's like an email client for blogs, except there's nothing to download or install on your computer. You join, set up a profile and then access your \"feeds\" via the web. I keep my personal Bloglines feeds page set as my \"Home\" page for IE so that when I open IE or click the Home button, I can see at a glance what's new in Blog-land. It's so handy!Looking at the screenshot above, my folder with my list of favorite blogs is (partially) shown expanded in the left column and the latest entry for the selected blog (mine for illustration purposes) is shown in the right pane. If you look closer at the list on the left, you'll see some blogs have bolded and/or grayed numbers after their name. Bolded means it's new/unread and the number indicates how many entries are new/unread. The grayed numbers are those which I've clicked on and then marked \"keep as new\" to return to when I have more time to read or if they mention something I want to note for later.You can choose to be a public or private subscriber to a blog. If you're public, other subscribers will see you in a list of subscribers. If you're a private subscriber, you're an invisible lurker to all. Also, if you're public, the blogs *you* subscribe to are visible. Sometimes I like visiting the blogs subscribers subscribe to. I've found some interesting reads that way.There are many options for how you subscribe to others' blogs, how those blogs are organized, displayed and updated on your Bloglines page, and other stuff I'm forgetting. It's straight-forward to set up with the defaults, though, and as you become more familiar with the options, you can start playing with them.To read or add comments, you'll still need to be on the actual blog page and some feeds don't show all the photos, but no problem ... Just click on the blog entry title in the right pane and a new window with the actual blog entry will open. Easy-peasy.Anyway, I just thought I'd mention Bloglines. There are other subscription services out there but I'm only familiar with this one -- commentors please feel free to plug any others."},

DH got it out of the house shortly after he got home that day. He blocked off the doorways, opened the french doors to the outside, cleared a path from the fireplace and opened its glass doors & screen. He then sat down to wait until the squirrel ventured out, which only took about 5 minutes. Although DH was armed with a broom, the squirrel seemed to have overheard the plan and went straight for the outside. Whew! No, DH has still not screened over the chimney. Sigh."},

For now, it sits right in front of the fireplace (which is semi-visible inside the red circle). It's Florida -- who needs a working fireplace anyway?So this morning I'm mindlessly checking emails, reading blogs, message boards, etc. and in the background I hear the neighbor's lawnmower running over branches and chopping them up. Nothing out of the ordinary there. Except, wait. The neighbor has finished mowing and I'm still hearing that chopping. And ... it's coming from INSIDE the house. Like in the NEXT ROOM!Of course, DH is gone for the day and I can't make ask him to initiate the hunt. Which means I have to start exploring ... and dreading what I might find. Remember, this is the house with owls, raccoons, wolf spiders, and heaven knows what else for property-mates.I've got the sound narrowed down to coming from the fireplace but it's too dark behind the TV to see just what is making the noise. And do I really want to know? So I go upstairs figuring IT and I can wait for DH.And then the phone rings. And I have to go downstairs to find the info the caller wants. And the noise is even louder.Putting on my brave face (for who? it's just me and the dog, who by the way has shown absolutely NO interest in the The Noise), I peek behind the TV again ... and this is what I see. Except before the flash illuminated the entire fireplace interior, all I could see was the little paw sticking out over the top of the door. So that's where we are now. DH is on his way home, but we still have no idea how we're going to get the squirrel out of the fireplace without chasing him around the entire house. Oh, and did I mention that we found a dead squirrel in the fireplace the day that we closed on this place, over 3 years ago? I think this will serve as the reminder for DH that he was going to put a screen over the chimney.In other miscellaneous \"news\" ... This is what my old sewing set-up in the corner of my bedroom looked like shortly after we moved in. If you've been reading, you know that I finally have a real (nearly completed) dedicated sewing room now. This is what I moved in to fill the space my sewing stuff used to occupy. And, I've ridden it for the past two days. I hope I can keep it up, and also use the other exercise crap equipment piled up next to the chair. (Yes, this room is also still unfinished. There's a reason we call this place The Money Pit.) Wish me luck!"},

{"title": "Knocking Off Sunshine", "date": "Sunday, September 10, 2006", "text": "This is my finished \"muslin.\" I've been wanting to make a top like this after seeing similar tees in the stores, on the street, and patterns such as the Hot Patterns Sunshine Top, and Kwik Sew 3418 (not sleeveless on me though!). Then Gigi starting hers really motivated me to start mine. Thanks Gigi! :-) I'm looking forward to seeing how yours turns out.I wasn't sure how all the gathering would look on my full bust, but since this tee is more fitted at the waist than a flowy peasant blouse or tunic-y tee, I think it's actually OK and doesn't invoke the is-she-or-isn't-she maternity question.Because I have a great base pattern using my pattern software (Pattern Master Boutique), I knew it would be easier (and lots cheaper!) to start there and morph this style than to start with a purchased pattern and alter. So, that's what I did. I used the editing module of PMB which makes the editing fast and easy. If you have a similar TNT (tried and true) pattern, you can make this top too by copying the steps below with a pencil, scissors, a curve, and a ruler.I started with my darted tee pattern (1). I reshaped the neckline to a low scoop and then added a 1.75\" band (2). Next, I cut the band from the bodice (3) and extended the dart to the bust point (4) in order to rotate the dart (below). I rotated the side bust dart to the neckline (5) and then spread/slash the neckline an additional 3 inches to create more gathering (6). The final step for the front was to true the neckline where I had spread it. (7). Now onto the back. I aligned the shoulders of the front and back pieces (8). I used my original front pattern from (2) above so I could transfer the neckband shape/size onto the back. Since I have a very narrow back shoulder dart, I just eliminated it when I drew the back neckband (9). I cut the neckband from the back pattern (10).After reshaping the hems to a slight curve, the final step was to add seam allowances to all pattern pieces, as shown below.Edited to Add: A (blurry) photo of me wearing the top."},

{"title": "Grand Intentions, Humble Actuality", "date": "Saturday, September 2, 2006", "text": "I had lots of plans to be sewing today, thinking it wouldn't take too much more time to settle into the new digs. Hah! I'm still puttering around in there and it's after 10 PM. Tomorrow is another day.DH hung my thread racks today, which means my bureau top in the bedroom is free and clear again (and in sore need of a thorough dusting). I originally thought the racks could be hung over the pattern cabinet but I realized I wouldn't be able to reach spools on the top left rack without a stepstool so Plan B went into effect.While DH was working on the racks, which took a LONG time because of hard-to-screw-in toggle bolts into paneling, I decided to organize the last 18 months or so of my Burda WOF magazines. I had stopped separating the parts right before our move and hadn't picked it back up because most of the mags were still in boxes.Now I'm current with the pattern sheets being filed away in the pattern cabinet.The newsprint line drawing/construction sheets are filed in the two big white binders on the left side of the 4th shelf down in the bookcase below. The magazines (or the remains thereof!) are stacked at the right side of that same shelf. And, of course, a football game is playing on the little TV.Oh, and isn't that just a fabu light \"fixture\" atop the shelf?? Everyone needs a 500 watt shop light in their sewing room. I just hope it doesn't melt a hole in the ceiling before I buy a more suitable replacement. The rest of the pics are the 50¢ tour of the sewing room still in progress. There's no permanent flooring at the moment, just some temporary throw rugs that mostly cover the floor. It's going to be a major PITA to move everything when I finally do put the final flooring in, but there are worse things to contemplate so I won't complain ... too much.(I haven't mentioned it before but I hope that it goes without saying that you can click on all pics in my blog entries for bigger versions.) No. I still haven't sewn the buttons on yet.Can you spot Gumby and Pokey, and Melbourne, Australia? The 3 stacking boxes are sewing themed and I've had them almost 2 years waiting for this moment. I've moved my button stash (most of it) into the biggest one for now. I really want something clear for the buttons at some point.I made those little houses atop the closet back in my \"crafty\" days. I also made the redheaded wooden doll you can sort of see in the bookcase pic above.I really need to paint the last coat of white on the closet doors so I can put the knobs back on them. I meant to do that today too but I forgot until it was too late to not be interfering with DH's thread rack installation. And then I didn't feel like it. I'm sort of fighting a slight cold. I don't feel miserable, but just enough different to know I'm not entirely 100%. What a drag ... literally.This and the next pic are the areas of the set-up that still bug me and I'm going to keep thinking of a better solution. There is room to walk around the table and get to the bookshelf so it's not horrible. I just don't like the little shelf at the end and how cramped my ironing board feels. I need some storage up on the walls, which will come when I've had a chance to think about what I really want."},
{"title": "The Christening", "date": "Friday, September 1, 2006", "text": "The new sewing room has officially been used to make something ... other than a mess. Woo hoo! I love all the room to spread out in there. This was an easy project but that's just what I needed right now after the busy week of moving things in and around, plus the usual football Team Mom duties.This tee is for DS#2 and is made with my TNT (tried and true) tee pattern for my sons, Kwik Sew 3299. He doesn't know I've been making it so he'll have a surprise when he wakes up tomorrow. Since tomorrow is a Game Day (for his brother's Varsity team), I'm not sure if he'll wear this or a football theme tee shirt. We'll see. I won't be insulted if he chooses the latter. (5 AM Update: He chose the Metallica tee!)Once again, I used my favorite \"embellishing\" trick for my teen sons' mom-made tees — iron-on transfer paper for dark colors. I love this stuff because it has an opaque white background. Anything white in the image stays white after it's ironed on to the fabric. Most transfer papers have \"show through\" where white would be and are best used on plain white fabric. This paper gives results much more like screen printing and you can use it on any color, even black. It also washes well and the print colors don't fade. I made the first tee shirts using this transfer paper a couple of years ago and they are still in great shape. My review for this pattern is here.I used to buy Epson brand transfer paper at Office Depot until they stopped carrying it or Epson stopped making it — I'm not sure which. I bought my last supply at http://www.printonit.com/ (NAYY). I bought 50 sheets for about $1/sheet. I can usually get two designs per sheet if I lay them out carefully. Still, the fabric was \"free\" since it's been in my stash forever and the pattern has been used many times making it nearly free too ... so $1 for a design paper is pretty cheap I think (especially if you add in the \"looks RTW and not homemade\" factor). If you don't want to spend $50, you can also buy in smaller quantities for just a tiny bit more per sheet. (Hmmmm. Maybe I should think about coop-ing this stuff.)Here's a close-up of the design. I grabbed my sharp, pointy embroidery scissors, plopped myself down in a chair, and custom cut the design to incorporate the dripping outline. I think it turned out pretty darn cool.The colors are a bit off in the photos. In reality, it's an olive drab tee with a darker olive rib at the neck and the inside of the transfer design matches the tee fabric perfectly. From a short distance it looks like an outline instead of a filled shape.Here's another close-up showing the contrast coverstitching around the neckline and shoulder seams. Gosh, I love that little coverstitch machine! As for the sewing room ... boy is it ever nice to walk to my pattern notebooks, pick out a pattern, pull it from the drawer, cut my fabric, sew, press, serge and coverstitch ALL IN THE SAME ROOM!"},
{"title": "About the shelving", "date": "Tuesday, August 29, 2006", "text": "A few readers have commented here and privately about the shelving, wondering what it is and where to get it, so I thought I'd answer here in case others were also curious.It's track shelving from Home Depot, brand name Closet Maid, and this stuff is GREAT! Very, very easy to install. Much easier than the wire shelving that fits into brackets which must be leveled and installed separately, like this. With the track shelving, the only part which has to be installed level is the main/header track across the top. You can sort of see the header track in this old pic of my previous sewing closet (and the Home Depot pic linked below).Next, you slide on the vertical rails shown below and secure them with screws or toggle bolts into the wall (depends on your wall).Next, the brackets which hold up the shelves snap into place in slots on the vertical rails. These are completely reconfigurable if your needs change since they snap in/out easily and when/wherever you want.The last step is to snap the wire shelving into the brackets. Again, the shelves are removable and reconfigurable, no tools necessary.We reused shelving from the previous house so some of these are doubled-up which you can see at the left side.Otherwise, the shelving is sold by the foot and a Home Depot person will custom cut it to the length you specify.Here is a pic from the Home Depot website which shows one configuration. There are also lots of options you can add-on besides just shelves -- hanger poles, drawers, shoe racks, and more."},

(No photo on THAT!)Nearly everything is in there, save for maybe a few pieces in the laundry room or buried under the mess on my cutting table (mess created during stash organization).So here's a rundown of what's what in there.Top shelf: Fleeces, sweater knits, weird stuff like faux fur, vinyls, double-sided prequilted cottons (from my Vera Bradley phase)Next shelf down: Flannels, seersuckers & woven stripes, blouse weight woven prints, drapey silks/rayons/polys, dressier wovens, and knits that wouldn't fit belowNext down: Rib & lycra knits (mostly cotton, mostly for sleepwear), buttermilks and other similar knit prints, solid denims/twills, denim/twill printsNext down: Solid knits in half the colors of the rainbowBottom shelf: The knits from the other half of the rainbowFloor bins L-R: (1) Crafty scraps, felts, etc., (2) ugly stuff for muslins, (3) knits that wouldn't fit on the shelves (oops), (4) quilting cottons (most less than a yard) and ribbing, and (5) outgrown jeans that I steal from and larger denim scraps (for patching or playing).No, I don't know how many yards or dollars this represents. Ignorance, in this case, is bliss.You saw that empty SPACIOUS closet in the previous post, right? Well, it's empty no more. In fact, I'm still unpacking fabric and the closet is getting precariously FULL. Uh oh.I think I have as many buttermilks as Linda herself at emmaonesock. Those prints sucker me in every time. I also found Powerdry a'plenty. Denims and bottomweight twills? Not as many but still plenty. Silks, some. Jerseys in all shades of the rainbow? Yup. Shirt cottons? Of course.In fact, the only thing I'm proud of is that I have far less fleece than Joann's. Yes, I have some, but there's only 2 cuts that have never been used. The other pieces are largish scraps from past projects and even then, it's not a whole lot. So, at least there's that.Right now I'm just working at getting everything into the closet in some kind of order that makes sense to me. I know I have a rearranging session in my future, but out of bins and onto shelves is big progress so I'm going to be happy with that for a while before I even think of redoing it.Here's what the closet looked like around noon yesterday.

Grrr. $28 down the drain.So then I laid paint cards all over the floor and looked at them for weeks in every possible light before making my next decision. Which was also WRONG. Sigh. But it was close enough that after I toned it down with a 1:1 mix with white, it was going on the wall. And so it did, today.This is what the sewing room looks like tonight.And this is what will start becoming the stash closet this week, after I unpack the various bins and boxes that have housed my fabric for the past 10 or so months.

{"title": "YAPOS", "date": "Thursday, August 17, 2006", "text": "(Yet Another Pair of Shorts)Here's the back view, complete with chalk marks and everything. They're in the washer now because they look too new. They need some distressing on the seams, hems, etc. to look less like Mom made them and more like What Everyone Else Is Wearing. I was a teenager once, I know how it is. They'll be done washing/drying by the time DS gets home from football practice and then I'll see if he's agreeable to another modeling session. (Edited to add: He did, here and here.)Here's the front, a bit plain here but they really do look better in real life.I shamelessly stole a few ideas from a pair of his RTW shorts.First, the coin pocket construction. I wasn't even thinking of adding a coin pocket (or earring pocket as DS uses it) until I looked at the RTW shorts and saw how easy it would be to add. Instead of a separate little square pocket turned under and topstitched all around, the RTW version had a second layer on top of the hip \"patch\" on the pocket facing. I was already planning on using lighter weight fabric for the pockets and then adding the \"patch\" of denim to the area that shows. Three layers of denim for pockets is about two layers too many.The second layer for the coin pocket is identical to the patch except that it does not come to the top edge of the patch. Instead, its top edge is just turned under and topstitched where it will show and the pocket is situated on the patch to be about an inch below the waistband seam. It's then overlocked around the bottom edge to act as one with the patch and the whole shebang is zigzagged onto the pocket facing.Here's a pic after all that has been done. Easy, eh?Here's a pic with the wrong side of the other front pocket on top.Before completing the pocket bag construction, I fused a strip of Design Plus bias stabilizer along the seam edge of the front of the pocket to help it from stretching out.Here's a shot of the inside showing the completed pockets. As you can see, I don't care too much about matching my thread to the pocket bags. The only one who will see them in actual use will be me on laundry day. I was already changing threads at what felt like every other seam to do the topstitching so I wasn't about to add another spool to the mix. His RTW shorts look 10 times uglier than this on the inside. The next time you're stressing about your sewing, take a look at the inside of RTW.Another detail I stole from DS' RTW shorts was the cell phone pocket on the side seam. Again, easy construction. The top was turned under and topstitched. The bottom and right were turned under and topstitched to attach them to the shorts. The left was ... well ... left, to be sewn into the side seam.The back hip pockets were also just turned down about 3/8\" and topstitched. You know how most patterns have a \"facing\" area about an inch wide for patch pockets? Well, RTW doesn't. It's just turn and stitch. I like that. The denim is sturdy enough that it doesn't need a facing here.The tag is my idea. I had two of these \"Epidemic\" tags I removed from a pair of the other DS' jeans about 4 years ago. I knew they'd come in handy one day. Here's a close-up of the bigger one I sewed to the front hem area.The last \"style\" changes I made vs. the envelope instructions were (1) a fly shield from the same twill as the pocket bags (less bulky) ...and (2) double belt loops all around. I don't know what made me do this because I hate sewing on belt loops, but I thought it would look cool, and it does. No pain no gain, right?"},

I've reviewed the pattern with more detail on Pattern Review, here.I'm just stopping by today on my way in and out between numerous football activities at the school. Both sons are now on the high school teams (Varsity and Jr. Varsity) and I'm going to be seeing a lot of the road between school and home for the next 3 months.

Oh wait ... look online Debbie! Here it is, 2713.) I changed the construction order so I would end up with a center back seam up through the waistband to allow for easy taking-in (or letting-out) after the try-on. I basted the waistband on, basted the center back/crotch seam, and serged the in- and outseams separately in case I have to redo those too. I also left off the back and side pockets. I'll put on the back pockets if these are a Go. I'm hoping we'll be close on this first pair. He's so not-picky that if they fit at all, he will want to wear these even if they are technically a test. Maybe I'll get them done by tomorrow morning, but maybe not. I have lots of Football Mom stuff on my plate for the next week or so.While I was in sewing zen, I also decided to finish the wearable muslin for my turquoise Burda WOF blouse. Why I didn't decide this before I changed the serger and machines threads to black for DS' shorts, I don't know. So, all threads are now white and I'll have to change them back. Why do we who sew dread those thread changes so much? They take what — three minutes, tops??

This top from the August 2006 issue of Burda WOF is what I'm making. But I'm doing it in a knit and with short sleeves because I need more tees. The goof-up was that I cut the center front as two pieces instead of on the fold because when I traced it, I added a seam allowance to the CF and forgot to mark it as Cut on Fold. I was a little distracted yesterday so I suppose some little oddity was to be expected. That's my excuse and I'm stickin' with it!I'm using a subtle (vs. shocking) lime green interlock. It goes beautifully with the skirt I made up a few days ago.

It is the pump and while we're having that replaced, we decided to go for the whole enchilada and replace the 30-year old holding tank too since it has a small leak and also seems to be where all that sludge was coming from. Big sigh. Thirty years is a long time for a pump and tank to last. I just wish we had had more of those years instead of the previous owners.On the bright side (yeah, right), Well Repair Guy Dave seems to be a pretty straight arrow and a pleasant guy. I know his pricing is fair since we had previously looked into replacement at a future time. (The future is now.) Dave agreed to not charge us for the service call since he's going to get the whole job. We could've ended up with a lot worse from a desperate last-minute weekend service call. I hope I don't have to eat my words, or if I do, I'll be able to wash them down with some clear fresh water.After Dave left, the skies opened up and deluged us with rain. Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink. But DH had the \"brilliant\" idea to set out a slew of buckets so we can flush the potties through the evening. You can see where his priorities are!I finished tracing the Burda WOF pattern. We've got frozen pizzas in the oven and a jug of purchased iced tea for the beverage. The rest of the evening should be relatively calm and maybe I'll even cut and sew the pattern I traced. Today was supposed to be a PSD, as in Personal Sewing Day. The menfolk took off for the movies and left me alone to do with my day as I wished.I went upstairs and that's when I realized that I had completely forgotten to prewash the fabric I was planning to use. Sigh. OK, I can delay since I need to do some laundry anyway. I gathered up the dirty clothes, made my way to the kitchen to clean up after lunch makings on my way to the laundry room and ...PSD turns into Personal Stress Day at the Money Pit. We have a well for our water and it seems that the pump that brings it into the house isn't working. Instead of water, we have stinky iron colored sludge, splatters and air coming out of the taps.DH and Well Repair Guy (who charges $125 just to show up) are now out at the front of the proprety fending off mosquitos and trying to assess the problem.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we'll have water before the weekend is over, but I'm not optimistic. There's only a couple hours of daylight left for today and unless it's an easy problem to fix, we'll be waterless until ... ??Needless to say, the sewing mood went away. But since I don't have much else to think about right now, I'm going to try to distract myself by tracing a pattern from the latest Burda WOF. And, boy do I wish I had filled up my iron this morning when I first thought about it.I wish I had straighted this up on Zillie before snapping the pic, but you only notice these things after the photo session is over. Oh well. Here's the 100% finished blouse. Wooo hooo! The buttons are just simple pearly white plastic buttons but until I find something better, they'll do. Otherwise, the blouse would remain a UFO and I wanted this done and off the list.I took a few more pics of some of the details. This one below is the right side of the collar/fringe.This next photo is of the wrong side of the collar. The fringe is sewn as an applied strip and then the excess seam allowances of both the strip and the collar pieces are cut away. This will fray like mad in the laundry for the first few washings, but eventually it will fray itself out. The two passes of stitching are hopefully secure enough to hold it all together.Next, a blurry (sorry) shot of the inside neck, showing the bias facing.And finally, the buttonholes. As you can see, the top buttonhole is sewn on a slant. The placket where it joins the bodice is angled at the top and the buttonhole really wouldn't fit without the slant. I matched the angle of the empire seam and I think it looks fine. It works well too, keeping the top of the placket neatly together. Form and function together, how nice when that happens.Tomorrow is a PSD. I'm hoping to cut and sew another pair of denim capris. I find myself living in the two pairs I've already made."},
{"title": "Semi-Done", "date": "Tuesday, August 1, 2006", "text": "I'm calling it quits for a day or two on this blouse. I'm just plain sick of it right now. All that's left is buttons and buttonholes, which will turn out much nicer if I'm in a good frame of mind about it. So, I cut out and sewed a skirt tonight after I put aside the blouse. The stinkin' blouse took over two weeks. The skirt? An hour. Sigh. There sure is lot to be said for TNT patterns.I like the blouse. But I'm just really, really tired of working on it. I'm an instant gratification kinda girl. It's looking pretty wrinkly in the photo, but it's linen so it's going to always look wrinkly. I also goofed on the collar. But kind of on purpose. The fringe is a strip that is applied as you sew the upper and lower collar pieces together (WS together) and because it's not bias, it doesn't really want to \"bend\" around the notch shape on the pattern. I don't hate the shape I ended up with, but I'd like it better if the notch was more defined. Oh well.It also looks slightly \"saggy\" on my dressform. I think Zillie needs a day at the reshaping spa because, hard as it is to believe, her butt is bigger than mine and the back of the blouse hangs up on her but not on me. I'll get a pic of me in the blouse at some point after the buttons are done.I really like the turquoise linen with the print of the skirt. The blouse also goes nicely with a few more things in my closet. Big surprise, right, since I've been sewing turquoise and green for a while now."},

So I walked away. Went to bed and slept even. Got up this morning, put it on again and still, it wasn't right.I flipped open the magazine to look at the pattern photo and try to figure out what IT was (or wasn't). What exactly did I like about this particular pattern? What style elements called to me? The empire seaming, yes. The fringe ... not so much, but I went ahead and added it to mine too. Oh, wait — it's the DARTS! The darts in the photo are at an interesting angle to the empire seam. I really like that. But, when I looked at my final blouse, they're almost straight up and down. Then I tried on the muslin and there's that cool angle again. Which means that somewhere between muslin and alterations, I lost the dart angle. Rats, and double rats because ...Of course the darts have already been sewn, pressed, and topstitched, and the empire seam has been sewn, pressed, overlocked, and topstitched. Of course.So, here's what the darts looked like this morning.And here's what they look like now.Time to make dinner for the menfolk. I *will* finish this $#@&! blouse tonight. Or die trying."},
{"title": "15-plus days and counting", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2006", "text": "Holy cow! I never take this long to finish sewing projects. (And no, I'm still not done.) Chalk it up to other obligations and not much time spent at the sewing machine for the last couple of weeks.Picking up where I last left you (on the edge of your seats, I know), I added more width at the biceps to my sleeve pattern, cut two new sleeves, ripped one sleeve out of the muslin, and sewed one new one in. Success. I will finish this muslin to be wearable because as I look at it, it only needs the other sleeve, hems and buttons. It would be silly to just toss a perfectly wearable blouse. I may keep it but more likely I'll donate it. But I won't finish it until after I finish the final version. I'm bored with it. I've been looking at it on my dressform for more than two weeks!This afternoon, I spent a couple of hours adjusting the front upper and middle bodice pieces. At first, I thought the solution would be to add a bit to the bottom of the upper piece at the underbust area and scoop out a corresponding bit from the middle and so I did that. Then I pulled out my good fabric and starting laying the pattern pieces on it for cutting. I actually cut out the back upper bodice piece and then I started second-guessing my alterations. I'm glad I did because I don't think they would've worked. By adding and then scooping, I decided I was essentially making no adjustment! Duh.So I pinned the pattern pieces together, draped them on me and started fiddling and figuring out. I knew I needed more length over the girls to get that empire seam a bit lower. If I slashed too high, the neckline would be too low. If I slashed too low, the dart and seam angle would go wonky. What I ended up with was a slash that added about 3/4\" near the center front but tapered to zero at the sideseam so I wouldn't screw up the length there. Doing this, however, added 3/4\" to the upper empire seamline and so the adjoining piece had to be adjusted so they would fit together. I slashed that adjoining piece vertically, starting at the underbust curve, spread it 3/4\" and tapered to zero at the bottom. I didn't want to spread the entire piece evenly outward because its bottom seam has to join up with the \"peplum-y\" piece below it and I didn't need any more width across the waist/hips than what I'd already adjusted for earlier. With the second series of adjustments done, I trued up my seamlines and finished cutting out. I'll detail these adjustments in more details (pics) later, if/when I ever finish this darn blouse.This is the fabric I'm using. It's a medium-weight linen. I still have lots of summer to go here in Florida even if the calendar says otherwise and so autumn sewing isn't even on the horizon yet. We tend to dress tropical here in Florida long after autumn officially rolls in.So far, I've sewn the darts and topstitched, sewn the upper bodice to the middle, overlocked and topstitched that seam, and sewn the shoulder seams together for a quick try-on. I think it's going to work. And the topstitching looks a lot better on the solid fabric."},
{"title": "Progress (very little) Report", "date": "Monday, July 24, 2006", "text": "I bet you were expecting to see a photo of my finished wearable muslin. Me too. But the Sewing Gods had other plans. Or maybe it was the Flabby Arms Gods (or are they Demons?).But first, let me back up to go in the order I sewed yesterday ...The collar is in and bias faced, with NO HELP WHATSOEVER from the Burda instructions, tankyewvellymuch. In fact, I turned to Kwik Sew 2927 after my 7,948th read of the Burda instrux. Really, I'm usually pretty good when it comes to written instructions of any kind. Except those darn WOF instructions. I usually get the general idea and already know a good/better method even when I don't fully get their step-by-steps, but yesterday I just couldn't get past a particular sentence (I'll add it later so you can share in the crosseyed-ness) and there I sat. Stuck. I tried a few ways I thought might work, but I wasn't particularly happy with those attempts. Rip, rip, rip. So I flipped through my personal pattern catalog to see if I had anything even slightly similar. KS 2927 to the rescue and I was back on track.Until the sleeves. They went in perfectly -- nary a pucker. Which should've been a tip-off right then and there. But since this was a muslin, I already had figured they'd go in perfectly because they don't really count. Thankfully, I did have the foresight to actually try them on my arms before overlocking the seam allowances. And that's when I discovered they were too tight. A look in the mirror also showed the neck and shoulders now bunching up horribly. Arghhh.Time for a sleeve sacrifice. I took off the blouse and slashed the sleeves from just above the hem area straight up overarm to the shoulder seam. Ahh. Much better, and confirmation that the neck/shoulder bunching was because the too-tight sleeves couldn't get down my arm to where they needed to be.I'm still deciding whether to re-do the sleeves for this. I have enough fabric, but I'm getting kind of sick of it at this point. I really want to move on to the real version. But, will it be Catch-22 if I don't do another sleeve test?? Of course it will. Except that it would be so much easier at this point to just make this blouse sleeveless and bind the armholes. Oh! Idea! I could do one sleeve, baste it in, and revert to Plan B — Sleeveless Wearable Muslin. Hmmm. Now that has possibilities. On another front (pun definitely intended), I'm going to be reshaping the empire seam under the bust like in the pic below. If you look closely, you can see the blue marker line I drew on myself while wearing the muslin. That line follows my actual underbust curve. (Thanks for the nudge, Belinda.)So that's where things are at the moment — close, but no ceeeeegar!"},

I did work on the collar a bit last night (or this morning, depending on how you view post-midnight timeframes).

But I did take a couple of pics over the weekend after my first try-on with the sideseams sewn. So far, mostly so good. I think it wouldn't hurt to lower the empire seam about 1/2\" but I'm still debating on that. If I put an empire seam at my true underbust, it makes the girls really prominent -- more than usual even. If I \"fudge\" the seam, it helps to minimize the bust. But there's a fine point between fudging and fitting. I think I'm there, but I'm not sure.The back is also looking pretty good. I haven't yet sewn the waist darts because I prefer to fit them to me and not just where the pattern indicates.I'm also still deciding whether I will finish this completely to make it wearable or keep it as a tester. I think that will depend on how the collar turns out. ;)"},
{"title": "A Wearable Muslin", "date": "Sunday, July 16, 2006", "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with muslins. Yes, I think they are necessary and more helpful than not. They save the \"good fabric\" from potential disaster, and let you test out fit and techniques. Those are the parts I love. What I hate is wasting all that prime sewing time on a wadder, because if you use true muslin fabric, it will end up in the bin. So I usually compromise with potentially wearable muslins sewn from the more-aged/less-loved fabrics in the stash. But ... this means (a) I may end up with two of the very same garment when I really only wanted one and (b) I may be tired of the pattern by the time I finish the tester and the \"good fabric\" version, the one I really wanted but had to test first, never gets made.Last night I finished cutting out the blouse-in-progress (#109 from the July Burda WOF). This afternoon I've been sewing it together off and on around other household stuff going on. The photo at the top is how it looks at this very moment. I stopped because of that love/hate thing.I forgot that I wanted to add about 1.25\" to the bottom piece so the blouse will hit a more flattering spot on me. To fix my mistake means I have to rip out those bottom pieces, recut 3 new pieces (2 front, 1 back) and re-sew the front. Here's my dilemma. I don't really love this fabric. It's plain semi-cheap cotton from Joann's. It's not really *my* colors or style but it's OK. If I don't make it longer, chances are I will never wear it but it will serve a purpose in testing fit and style. If I do fix it, I probably will wear it. But it still won't be loved — and never a Holy Grail — because I don't love the fabric. So how much will I really wear it?Switching gears a moment — I took a photo in progress to see if I liked the topstitching I added. The Burda instructions have you topstitch the dart and the lower seam on middle piece where it joins the bottom piece but you are not supposed to topstitch the underbust seam. Well, I like the underbust seam and want to emphasize it and the line it creates on me. I topstitched one side and not the other, took a pic to compare and ... you can't really see the difference because of the print!Here's the two sides. The one on your right is topstitched. Yeah, I know. You can't tell.Here's a close-up where you can see the topstitching better. If you squint. But in a solid, I know I'll prefer it so that's what I'm going to do.Back to the length ... I have cut out new pieces and because I'm quite anal, I'll most likely fix it. OK, I already know I'll fix it otherwise I wouldn't have cut out the new pieces. Thankfully, I hadn't yet overlocked the seam allowances on these pieces so ripping out will be easy. In fact, if I had just done it instead of writing about it, I'd be finished by now!"},
{"title": "Thinking Out Loud", "date": "Saturday, July 15, 2006", "text": "Earlier I was taking out some clean laundry from the dryer.

Until I found them again, I had forgotten how much I like wearing these capris and so they've now moved to my \"wear-first\" list especially since they perfectly match a new favorite blouse made for this summer. I really have plenty of clothes to make it through between laundry cycles but I find not all of them actually make it into the weekly laundry which means I'm not reaching for them first, which in turn made me start thinking ...One of the reasons I sew is for fit. I really prefer my sewn clothing because it just plain fits me better than most things I can buy. But I think I'm starting to move beyond just the fit criterion now as my pondering in front of the dryer today keeps running through my head.I think I'm now on the quest for *all* of my clothing to be on the wear-first list.

{"title": "Slowly Unslumping", "date": "Friday, July 14, 2006", "text": "I'm sporadically working on a pattern from the July 2006 issue of Burda WOF. I love the lines in this blouse but to get it to fit me will take some alteration and probably a test in fabric.(No, that's not me.)I traced the pattern on Wednesday night after watching the season premiere of Project Runway. All that cutting, draping & sewing motivated me to actually start something and this pattern was calling to me in the loudest voice. I still have no idea what final fabric I'll actually use, but in the meantime I'm enjoying the pre-flight process. BTW, I love what Amber's written about PR on her blog. I love reading what she says about most everything. The first step was an FBA (full bust alteration). To start, I pinned the existing underbust dart closed and slashed the pattern to create a horizontal bust dart opening so I could keep the underbust shaping from the pattern. Then I filled in the spread with more tracing material.I needed to add a good 2 inches of FBA (an XLFBA??), which really whacks out (technical term!) the armscye. So, I decided to see what I could come up with using my Pattern Master Boutique (PMB) patternmaking software. My trial pattern piece is laying under the de-altered pattern piece in the photo below. I know this armhole fits so I morphed between my PMB pattern and the Burda tracing, keeping the exact Burda neckline (so the collar fits) and re-angling the PMB underbust dart to match the Burda dart angle. If I didn't have PMB, I would just continue on with the FBA I started by rotating the side bust dart back to the underbust, which will somewhat open up the armhole again. But since I already know I would also need to adjust the Burda sleeve pattern (bigger), I just took the easy way out and used my TNT armhole/sleeve from PMB. Why reinvent the wheel, right? You can see that the PMB pattern piece is wider in almost the exact amount as the \"manual\" FBA added.Here's the re-adjusted pattern tracings pinned together for a quick fitting on Zillie (my dressform). So far, so good.Now to raid the stash for fabric I only mildly like so I can further test my alterations. I already know the peplum-y thing has to be a bit longer in lieu of the tummy not being flatter, and I'm thinking the neckline may end up too low. Time (and fabric) will tell.I've been sort of in a sewing and computer slump and the days have been whizzing by filled with errands and other not-fun stuff, so the blog has been on the back burner. From other blogs I read, Slump Fever seems to be going around. In my case, I think it's a bit of slump mixed in with decision overload, or analysis paralysis as my friend and I have dubbed it. I've got a lot of sewing projects I want to work on but I'm having trouble deciding what to start on and which fabric to sacrifice ... er ... use.Plus, a pair of striped capris left in a state of almost-done had me stalled too. I wasn't loving them and so I left them in a heap on the cutting table unfinished. But then I couldn't make myself start anything with them mocking me every time I went near. Finishing them meant a fair bit of ripping out and well, blech.In the meantime, my sister called to remind me of her upcoming birthday but mostly to drop not-so-subtle hints that she really wanted me to make her a couple of new scrub tops. Since these are easy and fast, I decided to grant her wish ... thinking that sewing *something* would ease me out of the paralysis. I always have fun putting together fabrics for her scrubs and I even had fabrics earmarked for scrubs prewashed and ready to go.Well, those capris were still staring me down so I plopped myself in front of the TV, seam ripper in hand, unstitched where needed and then put them out of my misery and finished them. I still don't love them but at least they are done and off the table, which left me now both mentally and physically free to start the scrubs.But then I started overthinking again. I have a much TNT (tried-n-true) scrubs pattern I've used many times for my sister. Four easy pieces, dolman sleeves, a fast sew. But could I be happy with that?? Nooooooooo! I decided my sister needed a new style scrub with set-in sleeves and an FBA'd front bust dart. So, it took me a day longer than I had first thought, but Monday's mail had one TNT and one untested scrub on their way to my sister in Richmond. She should've received them yesterday so I'll call her tomorrow to see how the new pattern and my \"educated guess\" alterations worked out."},

{"title": "The jury's still out", "date": "Thursday, June 29, 2006", "text": "So this, the free preview & premier issue of Blueprint (a Martha Stewart Living publication), arrived in my mailbox on Tuesday. At first glance, I'm not sure what to think. I will say that my overall initial impression is that it's hard to tell the content from the advertisements and the layout is a bit too cutesy for me. Why I'm mentioning it here, though, is one of the editors, Katie Hatch, is a sewer and her bio blurb says she makes most of her wardrobe herself. So maybe there's hope for the fashion portions of this new rag?? We'll see. I don't know how many others will read the \"fine print\" on the editors or if there'd be any impact at all even if they do.There's also a free dress pattern download (designed by Katie, natch) for a grown-up version of what I've known as a pillowcase dress. Blueprint refers to it as \"elegant.\" I know I'm not a fashion plate, but somehow a sack belted in the middle doesn't meet my expectations of elegant. Cute, comfy, casual -- now those are the adjectives that come to my mind and this would work for a fun summer frock on a slimmer figure than mine. I also found the cost breakdown of the outfit interesting. The fabric and cord were $76 (the fabric is $35/yd. silk twill). The belt is $150, the earrings $50, and the bracelet $449. For a total of $725. Hmmm ... maybe that's why the Blueprint editors dubbed it elegant??But go ahead and download it, even if you know you'll never sew it. Hopefully Blueprint will be tracking the downloads and if this one is popular, maybe there will be a next. And maybe that one will be elegant. We need to encourage all the home sewing promotionals we come across.ETA: Drat! I had links which should've put you directly at the magazine contents, editorial, and download pages, but they're not working as they should. You should be able to find everything easily though once you're on Blueprint's site."},

But in actuality, I was still sewing long after midnight. I called it quits sometime around 2 a.m. WHY do I always get these Bright Ideas at the last minute?? I never did get to measure his RTW shorts inseam so these were wrapped with serged but unhemmed legs. It only took 10 minutes to finish them this morning and DH has been wearing them ever since.I should've just hemmed them because I had guessed correctly -- adding a 1.5\" to the length and then sewing a 1\" hem seems to be the perfect length. Oh well, better safe than sorry and DH really didn't mind. (He's great that way.) Since I was running behind, I also made the Executive (time-saving) Decision to just go with the Velcro waist closure instead of a button. DH doesn't seem to mind that either and since I had some No-Snag Velcro, I'm hoping I won't mind come laundry day.All of the details and more photos can be seen in the review for Pattern Review, here.

He's already getting concert tickets to see one of his favorite bands from the 70s/80s (Little River Band) but I thought I'd add something he can use a little sooner since the concert isn't until August.Tonight, I've cut out Kwik Sew 2936 from a khaki twill that's been aging in the stash longer than I can now remember. I wanted to measure the inseam of his favorite similarly-styled shorts but of course he was wearing them today. So instead, I guessed my best and added an inch and a half to the length and I'll hopefully be able to sneak a measurement tomorrow (or at least sometime before I have to hem them).Pattern changes I have already decided on include leaving off the eyelets and drawstring at the waist and using a button/buttonhole closure instead of the Velcro recommended by the pattern directions. I hate what Velcro does in the washer/dryer when males (at least the ones in *this* house) forget to stick it to itself before tossing into the laundry bin. The pattern has side cargo pockets and one rear pocket. I may need to enlarge the rear pocket because DH's wallet is the larger bi-fold type. Another measurement to sneak in when he's not looking.Now, off to check the thread and zipper supply to see if I need to make an early trip to Joann's before starting.No, not the panties shown above -- I'm just continuing on the racing theme title from my first test post.So, here I am, too, writing a sewing (and probably other stuff) blog. Do you think it's too crass to start off with a photo of my underwear?? Well, maybe if you're a diva, but I'm not. It's just my latest project and I had to start somewhere, right? Hey, at least they're clean. ;)I'm not sure where this blog will go and I can't believe I'm looking at HTML code again, which I used to do all the time before I decided I'd rather be sewing. I'm hoping to chronicle on a (semi?) regular basis my sewing projects, thoughts about them and other things, and to maybe instruct, inspire and entertain along the way. As I arrange the virtual furniture in this place, certain layout features may change (or not, if I'd rather be sewing). I hope it doesn't make you dizzy.So, back to the undies. Yep. I sew my own underwear. Five years ago I would've bet the farm that I'd never utter that sentence, nevermind that it would be true! But then I decided, well, why not? I always have plenty of knit scraps because I seem to regularly buy at least a half yard more than I need and what's better under the street clothing I make than a foundation that really fits.My TNT (tried-n-true) undies pattern is Kwik Sew 2908. There's a variety of styles (and sizes) although I haven't made any view other than View A. I reviewed this pattern on Pattern Review if you'd like to read all the details. (I sure hope these links are working the way I plan. If not, stay tuned and I'll sort it out eventually.)Speaking of five years ago ... that's when I became obsessed with sewing. I think I'll save the \"About Me\" stuff for another post because right now I have a pattern and fabric waiting to be cut, and well ... I'd rather be sewing! My DH has been especially nice the last few days so I'm going to sew a new pair of casual khaki shorts for him. Oh, and his birthday is on Tuesday so maybe I'll even get them done by then. More on those later too."},

{"title": "Review: Viking 936 Serger", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2005", "text": "Price: US $1100.00Features* Semi-Computerized/Sewing Advisor* Free Arm* Adjustable Stitch Length and Width* Adjustable Presser Foot Pressure* 3/4/5 Thread Serger* Differential Feed* Coverstitch* Rolled HemLikes:Overlocking Stitch Quality: I'm very happy with it for overlocking and find the stitches are 99.99% uniform and consistent no matter what my fabric or thread.Sewing Advisor and Memory: I hardly ever have to tweak the recommended settings since they are almost always exactly what is needed. The times I do tweak usually seem to be on lightweight knits, which means I press a button to adjust the differential feed just a bit to even out the stitches and fabric feeding. The settings are easy to read (and adjust) on the front-and-center positioned LCD screen, even for my 40-plus eyes. I do sometimes use the memory settings during some projects but I wish there was a way to name them and store that name with the settings because unless you have a great memory of your own, you'll need a little notebook near the machine as a cheat sheet to remember what is saved in each memory slot. So, I don't tend to use the memorized settings across multiple projects as I've forgotten what I saved and why by the time I get to another project.Ease of threading: At first, going through the threads paths was awkward, but part of that was my newness to sergers and their thread paths in general. After about 2-3 months of use, it became second nature. The thread paths are clearly color-coded and diagrammed in the manual and on the flip-down cover. I also took 3 owners classes offered by my dealer, where she sat us down, cut all of the threads and \"made us\" rethread until we could do it on our own. Doing that gets you over your panic of breaking a thread and needing to rethread in the wee hours faster than if you just hope it never happens. :)That said, I still find it faster to just tie on and pull the new threads through. But, I *can* thread it from scratch when I have to and without any trouble. Inevitably, you'll mess up something on your own (ahem, I could cite volumes on that) or run out of thread before noticing and you *will* have to rethread the \"correct\" way. You just can't expect threading 4 thread paths to be as fast as threading the 1 thread path on a sewing machine.I noticed in the comments of another 936 review that someone has problems because of the thread order and having to rethread in order. While it's correct you do have to thread in order, if you do break a thread, you don't have to completely unthread everything and rethread entirely from scratch. You can just unthread the needle eyes and the end of the looper thread paths. Then rethread the ends in the correct order and away you go. So really, you're only rethreading the broken thread from scratch. The others you're only rethreading the very last parts. It's easier to do than describe.Lay-in Tensions: I noticed that in some of the other 936 reviews, there were complaints about the first thread path. I've honestly never noticed this. I find the lay-in tensions to be great. I know by feel that my thread is seated correctly and there are no holes to thread through, which can sometimes necessitate the use of tweezers or bifocals. I have long fingernails and can thread without tweezers up until I get to the needle eyes, which is the same for me on each of my machines. My coverstitch machine does *not* have lay-in tensions and I do miss them on that machine.Presser foot lifter: I love that the presser foot lifter is to the right side of the machine so I don't have to try to reach my hand behind the needles to lift the foot. Yes, this is in a different location than most sewing machines, but since sergers are NOT sewing machines, I don't think this is a problem at all and I think it makes more ergonomic sense where it is. Since you don't actually lift the presser foot as often as you do on a sewing machine, you don't use this feature at every session, but when you do need it, it's nice to have it handy for your right hand to grasp without taking your eyes or other hand off of your fabric.There is also an \"extra\" lift feature for the presser foot lever (just pull up on it a little more than usual) so you can position extra thick fabrics with relative ease too.Needle up/down: *All* Viking machines (sewing and serger) have a needle up/down feature accessed by tapping on the foot control once. If your needles are down, one tap and they're up. If the needles are up, one tap and they're down in the fabric. Thought I'd mention this specifically since this may be news to some of you not familiar with Vikings.Presser foot tension adjustment: Changing presser foot tension is as easy as turning the dial on the left side of the machine.Rolled Hems: Rolled hems are almost instant. No needle plates to change or accessories to add on. For 3-thread rolled hems, you just remove a needle, set the Sewing Advisor, and pull the level to set up the stitch finger. For 2-thread rolled hems, all of the above plus moving the built-in looper guard thingie into place.Safety Features: These aren't a big deal to me but part of the reason is because I don't know better since this is my first and only serger. This machine will not let you stitch if the presser foot is up, or if the cover is open, or if you've overloaded the machine with too much fabric thickness. For those who are new to serging and \"afraid\" of sergers, these features will be reassuring .Speed Control: By default, the serger sews at medium speed, which is good for going around curves or if you are new to serging. When you want to serge at Ludicrous Speed (reference Spaceballs movie!), just push one button and you're there. I do like this feature.Speciality Feet: Viking makes a lot of specialty feet for their sergers, and I do use some of them, the gathering and elasticator feet most often. While I do have others that were part of my initial purchase deal, I don't use as many as I do on my sewing machine -- but that's because I'm in a comfort zone with my 936 and haven't been experimenting like I should. I've been kicking myself for not trying the elasticator foot earlier. Now I love it for making panties. And I'll never gather on the sewing machine again.Dislikes:Coverstitching: As much as I like my 936 for overlocking, I never use it for coverstitching. Before I had my separate CS machine, I still didn't use my 936 for coverstitching and instead faked it with twin needles on the sewing machine. It's not that it's particularly *hard* to switch over for coverstitching, it's just that I have to switch -- period. I don't use coverstitching only at the end of a project, but also in areas in the middle of the construction phase. To keep switching back and forth is just too tedious for me to want to do all the time. Plus, the 936's coverstitch quality is not as good/consistent or as easy to control as my standalone CS machine.Needle replacement: Although I can replace needles fairly quickly now, I think this is a feature which could benefit from a bit of re-engineering. The needle holes aren't particularly easy to find when you are new to this machine and I do recommend a dental mirror or similar to save yourself frustration.There is no automatic needle threader and the \"tool\" supplied is not very user friendly. I use my serger tweezers and never have a problem threading the needles with it.Comparisons With Other ModelsWhile I said in my review of my standalone coverstitch machine that if I had to do it over, I'd probably have purchased the 910 and saved the money I paid for the CS features of the 936, I do want to point out that the 936 does have 5-thread capability and the 910 only 4. I've not used the 5-thread safety stitch in my own sewing, but I know there are times when I should. I've just gotten a bit lazy and I will give it a try one day. This 5-thread stitch is an important feature to many serger users so I did want to mention it here.My standalone coverstitch machine is a Babylock, with jet air threading. Honestly, I find the jet port to be a bit of a time waster when trying to set up the port and then feeding the thread into it, and usually I just tie on to my existing looper thread and pull the new thread through so I would never say that jet air threading is the end-all be-all. But that's me. I realize others swear by it, but you definitely pay extra for this Babylock-only feature.I also prefer the extra table space on the 936 over most other models of sergers (esp. Babylock), and the free arm which I do use often. It's not small enough to pull a baby's sleeve around, but for my usual sewing, it's just fine."},
{"title": "Review: Babylock Coverstitch Machine (BLCS)", "date": "Monday, May 24, 2004", "text": "Price: US $799 (I should clarify that the price I paid is because it was a demo machine. A very short life as a demo, but still a demo. The machine's suggested retail price is US $1300. Way too much, so negotiate, negotiate!!)Features:Stitches:Triple Cover StitchWide Cover StitchNarrow Cover Stitch (left and right narrow cover stitch)Chain StitchJet -Air Threading System for the chain looperColor-coded threadingCover Stitch width 3 mm or 6 mmStitch length 1 mm to 4 mmFull featured differential feedSnap on presser footAdjustable tension knobsAuto tension releaseAuto drop feed when presser foot is raisedThread cutter (not automatic)Sewing speed up to 1300 stitches per minuteBuilt-in accessory storageCabinet mounting bolt includedWarranty - 10 year parts, 5 year electricalI love this machine! After some practice runs to learn what tensions settings are best, the stitch quality is great and it sews over anything. It is super easy to thread with the jet-air looper threading and easy needle paths, and I like that you can thread needles/looper in any order.I also have the Viking 936 serger which has a coverstitch. I've had that for about 2 years. Since buying it, I've learned that buying a serger with a CS option was a total waste of my money. :) I wanted to buy a serger I would not grow out of. Live and learn!! :) It's such a pain to have to switch over and back during the same project that I just never did it. Well, I switched it once during my initial new owner class, and again at a serger techniques class. It was during this second class that I cemented my decision that I would never use the CS on the 936 and it was time to shop for a CS-only machine. It's not that it's so difficult to switch the 936, but that I knew I just wouldn't want to bother. Who wants to stop, find tools, change plates, move needles, rethread, etc. in the middle of a project and then reverse all the steps to overlock the same project?? What a hassle.I sewed up a knit shirt the other day and it was so nice to move to the serger for overlocking, move to the sewing machine for stitching, and move to the coverstitcher for topstitching and hemming. And each machine was set up and ready to go. All I had to do was feed the fabric in and step on the pedal.ETA: One of the best things about this and other standalone coverstitch machines is the great accessories available for binding, hemming, making belt loops, and more. They work and work very well! Click here for more information and examples.If you're thinking of buying a serger with a coverstitch option, my advice is to stay with a regular serger and spend the extra $ for a dedicated coverstitch machine. You'll be much happier and more productive.The only things I think could be improved are:1. Sometimes there is not enough room to the right of the needle for when you might want to sew in the middle of the fabric and not just the edge. For lightweight fabrics, you can just \"scrunch\" the fabric, but this wouldn't work for heavier fabrics too well. ETA: I've now had this machine for years and, really, the harp space has not been a problem for me at all.2. In the tension path there is a little hole you have to thread through. I wish it were a lay-in threading system instead, because my eyes aren't as young as they used to be. It's not hard to thread at all, but it could be perfect if Babylock redesigned that area."},
{"title": "Review: Viking Spanish Hem Foot & Plate", "date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2001", "text": "Price: US$35What is this notion used for? This is a  presser foot and plate used for bridge stitching (faggoting). The plate attaches to the machine and keeps the two edges of the fabric spaced and feeding evenly under the needle. My Designer 1 has specialty stitches especially for this type of decorative sewing.Did you get your money's worth after the purchase? Well, technically not yet,  because it's a pricey foot, but that doesn't stop me from buying every foot Viking puts out. ;-)Is this notion easily available? Yes, from your Viking dealer.Would you recommend it to others? Yes. Using this foot is a big help when doing this type of decorative stitching.Below are photos of a pillow I made using the foot/plate. The  bridging is along the top and bottom edges.Price: ~US$100.00-$150.00Many (all?) of the other reviews for these types of dressforms (My Double, Twin Fit, etc.) complain that no amount of turning the dials makes the dressform match the reviewers' measurements. After reading other reviews for My Double (not Deluxe) dressforms, I feel the need to address those complaints.Dressforms are like patterns. They are standardized to some mysterious \"ideal\" figure. How many of us have that ideal figure and can fit a pattern right out of the envelope with NO adjustments? The same is true for dressforms. Unless you've had a dressform cast from your own body, you *will* need to make some adjustments. And by adjustments, I mean more than turning the dials.This link  will take you to the photo narrative of how I padded out my dressform. The whole process took a few hours. Not too long, and not at all difficult. The time invested was well worth it as I now have a form very much like me and one which is a tremendous help when adjusting patterns and previewing garments. If you buy this type of form, spend the time to pad it and you'll be much happier.This thread  on the PR message board is extremely helpful and covers many dressforms and the reasons why or why not they were purchased. It also covers the processes and materials some of us have used to pad our dressforms to be just like ourselves.Also, Kathryn's tip, here, here, is a must-read in how to make your standardized dressform conform to your own shape.All right, on to the review ...Features:• 10 Auto-set dials - Press & turn for easy adjustments• Adjustments can be made in 1/2\" increments• Foam-backed nylon cover for easy pinning and marking• Adjustable neck with pin cushion & Adjustable Height• Hem LevelerObservations:I purchased the My Double Deluxe form (MDD) in late-January 2006 from Joann's online. They were on sale for half price (which I think they always are online) and at the time, there was a free shipping offer. I paid approximately $163 with tax. Joann's charges sales tax for internet purchases. The MDD arrived in approximately 2 weeks.I ordered a Medium because this size could be made significantly *smaller* than my measurements. Since I knew I would be padding it, I knew I needed to start with something smaller than me. I recommend you do the same for any non-customized dressform. It's a lot easier to make a small form bigger than it is to make a big form smaller.The quality of the form itself is what I expected. It's not the best but it's far from the worst. It's lightweight plastic (shell) and aluminum (stand). Now that I've had it for a while, I can see that it's not really as low-quality as I first thought. It's very lightweight, which is nice because I tend to move her around in my sewing area a lot.When it arrived, it came in a thin corrugated cardboard box with no interior padding. (The plastic must be sturdy to have survived the UPS ride from J's warehouse to being dropped -- and I do mean dropped -- at my home!) There is some assembly required. Specifically, you must insert the feet of the tripod into the stand and then you must attach the stand pole into the torso pole. It's not hard, requires no tools, and because the form is lightweight, it doesn't require any strength. You just need an area large enough to lay the stand down on the floor or a table.The dials are fiddly and a bit awkward to adjust. Put on a pair of rubber dishwashing type gloves before you start so you don't scrape up your fingers and then you'll be fine. I didn't do this but in retrospect, I probably should have. I never could quite figure out how to adjust the dials so that the numbers on the metal strips actually meant something. But that didn't matter to me too much because I just used my tape measure and adjusted until it reached the measurement I wanted. There were very generic \"instructions\" included but they covered more than this specific dressform and were overly simplistic. They were adequate but with much room for immprovement.Some of the adjustments require that you reach up inside the form. You might want to make your adjustments before you put it on the pole as it's probably easier to wrestle with it standing and laying on a table than on the form. But that's a personal preference thing. I made all the adjustments with it on the stand and just knelt on the floor and reached up.I chose this form after seeing a Medium MDD on display in a brick and mortar Joann's. It looked more like a \"middle-aged\" (ugh!) figure than the perkier Twin Fit or Simplicity forms. The bust is a B cup but the bust points sit a bit lower than those perkier forms and the waist curve is more gradual, thus matching me better before I ever started padding it out.The most noticeable difference between the MDD and the My Double (not Deluxe) and other \"cheapie\" forms is that the MDD has a lower section with thighs for fitting pants. Before purchasing the MDD, I thought this would be a great feature. It probably is, but I haven't used it yet, mostly because you have to completely separate the center pole from the torso in order to slide a pair of pants on or off. I can just see me wrestling on the floor and it's not a pretty picture! I do think that if you've padded the lower body to match yours and you use it to fit *before* you sew the last sideseam, that pants fitting can be accomplished without taking apart the form. But once both sideseams are sewn, there's no other way to slide the pants on without a wrestling match (or without rigging up some way to hang the dressform so it doesn't need the pole for support).Likes:1. The overall quality. It may be mostly plastic, but it seems like it will hold up for as long as I need it. (Four years going strong so far.)2. Price. I wasn't sure if I would actually use a dressform so I didn't want to break the bank to find out, especially if it turned out I didn't like it. $150 is still significant money, but it's a LOT cheaper than many other dressforms available so I felt I got a good deal. (Turns out I use it a lot!)3. Now having a dressform that matches me!Dislikes:1. The tripod stand. It works fine, but I would prefer a dressform on wheels. But since it is lightweight, it's not a burden at all to move it. Just that my personal preference would be wheels.2. The difficulty in getting pants on/off as mentioned above.3. The fiddly dials. They work, but they definitely feel/act cheap. There is a reason this is NOT a $600 dressform. Don't expect it to be gold plated and you won't be disappointed. :)Price: ~US$25.00I'm the first to admit I have a serious addiction to presser feet. I own 99% of the feet Viking makes for my machine and a few others Viking doesn't make. I'm sure I'll have them all one of these days. Most of the feet work wonderfully. Many I can't live without anymore and some others mostly collect dust, and yet I still can't bear to part with them. The button sewing-on foot is one of the gems.Before Viking came out with this foot I would still sew buttons on by machine, using the hump-jumper thingie and a piece of tape. It was fiddly and I'm not really sure if it was actually easier or faster than sewing them by hand but at least it wasn't sewing on by hand! ;-)The Viking foot comes with this little button grabbing tool. You squeeze it slightly and insert the prongs into the holes in the button. The tool expands a bit and the button is \"stuck\" on it until you squeeze the tool again to release it. This removes all the fiddly-ness from placing the buttons into the foot and in position over the fabric.The foot itself has a \"shelf\" where you rest the button. When the presser foot is in the full down position, the button is sandwiched securely between the two layers of the foot. There is also a finger that can be moved in and out for creating thread shanks of varying height.Here's the grabber tool still holding the button after I've put the button into the foot. I leave the tool in place until I put the foot down.Here the foot is down and I'm ready to stitch. Pardon all the lint on my machine. It was cleaning day today and the machines all got a thorough going over, but not until after this photo was taken.My machine has a specific button sewing stitch, which is basically a zigzag stitch set for the width between most button thread holes. I say \"most\" although I've not yet had a button for which this stitch wasn't perfect so maybe I should amend that to \"all.\" It's a handy stitch and coupled with this foot, it's the answer for sewers like me who prefer not to sew on buttons by hand.If you have a Viking, you must get this foot! If you don't have a Viking, other brands do have a similar foot and there are generics, but I don't think any of those come with the little grabber tool. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about that.)You've now been enabled. Again. ;-)"},

{"title": "Tutorial: Serging Inside Corners", "date": "Sunday, April 1, 2001", "text": "Serging inside corners doesn't have to be impossible. I learned this trick from the Palmer/Pletsch Serger Basics DVD. I'm illustrating it with a sample fly piece because that's usually one of the more difficult places to serge in one pass.Pretend this is your fly piece (or just any other inside corner). The trick to serging the inside corner in one pass is to pleat or fold at the inside corner, as shown in the pic below, so that the serging can be done in one smooth action. I'll show you how to do this on a serger in the next photos.Here is the fly piece and I'm coming up on that inside corner.I've pinched the fabric so that the inside corner is pulled into a straight line. It's kind of like making a dart, with the dart point ending at the inside corner.I keep the fabric pinched as it passes through the blades and needles.I'm past the inside corner at this point and am going to round the curve of the fly extension.You can start from either end. I just happened to choose this end  because it was a sample and the rest of the pants leg wasn't attached.If you start at the other end (the top of the pants), you'll round the  curve first and then make the pleat/dart at the inside corner.This is how the inside corner looks immediately after being serged. Unfold the pleat/dart and lay the fabric flat. If you're like me, you'll be smacking your forehead wondering why you didn't think of this before.How many bad-fitting men's tees like this do you have in YOUR dresser drawers?? (No comments please about the groovey PJ pants!)It's time to remake them into something a little more flattering on a woman's body.If you have a choice, buy the men's tee 2-3 sizes larger than you would wear. This gives you some wiggle room for placing the front pictures, etc.First, cut apart the tee.1. Cut off the sleeves at the seam attaching them to the tee. Cut apart the underarm seam so the sleeve lays flat. Keep the sleeve hem intact for later.2. Cut the sides of the tee where sideseams would be.3. Cut off the neckband. Save for another project or toss it.4. Cut apart the shoulder seams.When you're done cutting, you should have 5 pieces which look similar to this:Next, fold the front of the tee in half vertically and lay your front pattern piece on the fold, and cut.You may need to redraw or reshape the pattern neckline if the tee's original front picture/design is in the way. Since all logo tees are different, this step may take a bit of fiddling to get both the best picture placement and pattern placement where the fabric is.My original pattern neckline is shown in pink in the photo to the right. In order to be able to include all of the tee's front design, I had to cut this neckline as shown by the blue line. Don't forget to include seam allowances if you're planning to turn the neckline under. I bound my neckline so my tee remake was cut without neckline seam allowances.What helps to make the remakes more flattering — besides the overall better fit — are (1) the lower neckline, (2) the shaped sideseams, and (3) the shaped hemline. All of these features can easily be incorporated into the tee pattern you use for the remake.Next, fold the back of the tee in half vertically and place the back pattern piece on the fold and cut.I like shortcuts whenever they make the most sense. So, I lay my sleeve pattern on the tee sleeve pieces so that I can keep the hems. If your sleeve pieces allow enough room for you to do this, don't pass up the opportunity to save the step of hemming later!(Those yellow and pink tabs you see are stickers I use to mark the front and back of the sleeve piece.)Sew your \"new\" tee pieces together as instructed by your pattern, or using your favorite method.Here's a close-up of my bound neckline, applied using my coverstitch machine.Below are more football tees I've remade.Before:After:Comparison:Another After:Another After:Before/Comparison:After/Comparison:Back, After:Since my tummy is decidedly *not* flat, I've found that I really like the firmness and \"hold-in power\" of taut waistbands. I love how my jeans feel when I first put them on, but after an hour the waistband is stretched out and the tummy is flopping. On my last few pairs of pants (even non-jeans), I've been adding wide elastic to my waistbands and I love the result.In Power Sewing Step-By-Step, Sandra Betzina shows a similar method. Mine differs, however, because I do not change the length of the original waistband. My waistband would still fit me without the elastic. The elastic is really just a very firm interfacing which acts to snug in both the waistband and my tummy. Sandra's method allows you to feast at the Thanksgiving table without undoing your pants. Mine probably doesn't. Keep that in mind in November.To begin, I sew the waistband to the top of the pants as usual, and then press the seam allowances up toward the waistband, as shown in the photo below. This particular waistband will be folded over, but this method will also work with straight waistbands which have separate front and back pieces. The key is to cut (or finish) the waistband so that it is 2x the width of the elastic, plus seam allowances.I used a fold-over waistband because I was also trying out Sandra Betzina's tip for cutting the waistband with the selvege as one of the long sides. If you're not using the selvege, overcast this inside edge of your waistband.With the waistband attached to the top of the pants, it's now time to attach the elastic. I'm using 1-1/4\" elastic. I have a 50 yd bolt of this stuff so you can guess that nearly all of my finished waistbands are 1-1/4\" wide.You can also see a bit of fusible interfacing in the photo below. I stop the elastic at the button/buttonhole areas because buttonholes are bad enough without contemplating making one through elastic! The fusible is to add body and stability for the buttonhole and button to be added later.Pre-stretch the elastic 2-3 times and then cut it the length of your waistband minus buttonhole areas and then minus 3-5 additional inches depending on what's comfortable for you.Slide the elastic behind the seam allowance as shown below. This is just so you know where I'm talking about. Once you know where the elastic sits and is stitched, you can skip to the next step.Zigzag the elastic to the seam allowance as shown in the 2 photos below. Do not sew through the waistband, only through the seam allowance. Stretch the elastic as you sew. You may wish to quarter mark and pin it. I pin, but I just eyeball the quarters -- no marking.To sew, flip the waistband down toward the pants so that both are on your left with the waistband on top. Then align the long edge of the elastic just inside the seam stitches and zigzag. This way the bulk of the pants are to the left of the needle, the elastic is to the right and on top so you can see where you're stitching in the seam allowance. Neatness doesn't count because no one (even you) will ever see this stitching when the waistband is finished.This waistband has a center back seam and the resulting intersection of those seam allowances so I just skipped over that area, which allows the waistband to still fold down neatly in the next step.Next, fold the waistband toward the inside *snugly* over the elastic and press. Although this is not hard, this is probably the trickiest part because you're going to be fighting the elastic wanting to gather up. Just fold over and press a few inches at a time. Again, the waistband police will not be ringing your doorbell.Finish the ends of the waistband around the fly (or other) opening per your usual method, trim seam allowances and corners, turn, press and slipstitch closed. Then fold under the \"seam allowance\" of each end of the waistband at the top of the zipper and press. (I forgot to take a pic of this, but I will add one when I make my next pair of pants.) The goal is to clear the waistband long edge seam allowances away from the top of the zipper while also catching the top of the zipper inside.From the right side, stitch in the ditch between the waistband and pants, catching the inside edge of the waistband. Use thread that very closely matches your pants, and start and stop stitching where you pressed the seam allowance under at the zipper in the previous step.You can pin the waistband down in a few key areas or you can just stretch the elastic as you sew. I find it easy enough to stretch as I go.Below is what the stitching looks like from the right side. It's more visible in this photo than in real life because the light of the flash is bouncing off the shine of the thread. Trust me, no one is going to be inspecting your waistband seam so even if your stitching *does* show a little bit, don't worry about it.This is what the stitching in the ditch looks like from the wrong side. Notice that the seam allowance is *not* turned under. How fast and easy is that?? (Remember, it *is* turned under on the wrong side at the top of the zipper -- I just don't have a pic yet.)This is the waistband off of my body. It looks like your regular bulky gathered waistband, doesn't it? Well, look at the next pic ...This is that waistband on me. It's flat when I'm wearing it. My waistbands don't stretch out and become too loose because the elastic is keeping it snug, and my tummy gets a bit of restraint in the process. If only I could exhibit such restraint around the cookies and chocolate!(For anyone without a tracing \"accessory\" who traces patterns w/o seam allowances.)While thinking about sewing a pair of Burda WOF pants for my DS and before I actually started, I had an epiphanal moment. I don't mind tracing patterns, but it's always a bit more tedious to add the seam allowances to Burda WOF patterns which are printed w/o any. The epiphany was when I thought of adding the seam allowances with my sewing machine!I traced the patterns onto Swedish Tracing Paper and then rough cut them, leaving about an inch around each pattern piece.I measured out 1/2\" in a small spot on one piece, brought that piece to my machine and using my widest foot, I aligned the left edge of the foot with the sewing line of the pattern piece and moved my needle to match the 1/2\" mark. I saved this stitch setting to my machine's memory.With my machine loaded up with really cheap thread and one of my leftover bobbins of an odd color from another project, I sewed around the pattern piece, which had the effect of adding a 1/2\" seam allowance marking. I can sew a whole lot faster than I can measure and add a uniform seam allowance to a traced pattern, so I am definitely going to use this method from now on. It's so fast, and completely brainless!I also tried it without any thread and I like that method too, although it wouldn't be as visible on light colored fabric.Swedish Tracing Paper is my usual medium for tracing patterns because it's sewable, and it \"sticks\" to the fabric when cutting out. I didn't fine-cut the pattern pieces after adding seam allowances until I had the pattern on the fabric, which is my usual method.Don't forget you may need to add in extra allowance for hems manually. But for adding seam allowance around curves and other tricky areas, this method is so fast and accurate.You can also use any width for the seam allowances as long as you're consistent and use this same width when sewing the garment.Add'l hints:1. Use a longer than normal stitch length, and maybe loosen your tension depending on your machine.2. If the stitching puckers after you're done, use a seam zipper and just break the top thread every few inches. This will relax the thread so the tracing paper lays perfectly flat again.With Thread:Without Thread:Close-up:"},
{"title": "Techniques: Applying Picot Elastic for Lingerie", "date": "Sunday, April 1, 2001", "text": "After cutting the elastic to length, I overlap the ends about 3/8\" and loosely join them with a zigzag. This creates very little bulk at the join.Next, quarter-mark the elastic …… and the waist (or leg openings).If you're new to sewing elastic while trying to stretch it at the same time, you might want to mark in 1/8 intervals instead so you have less to stretch between pins as you sew. Remember to take it easy, go slow, rearrange as necessary, and do not stretch so much that it puts stress on your needle or you will bend/break the needle. One hand behind the needle stretching from that side helps to avoid too much pressure on the needle. Also, many times you will want more stretch in elastic in the backs of leg openings and less stretch at the front. Just remember adjust your marks to compensate for that.Match your quartermarks from above and pin the elastic to the opening with elastic wrong side (non-plush) to fabric right side, and the picot edge away from the fabric edge. Gently stretch the elastic between the pins as you sew (with one hand in back of the needle and the other in front). Attach the elastic with a very narrow zigzag, close the picot edge, as shown below.Turn the fabric over and trim anything that sticks out past the edge of the elastic. Even if nothing is sticking out past the elastic, you may want to trim to reduce bulk — your preference. When I'm sewing assembly-line style, my preference is to trim as little as possible so I only trim what's sticking out. ;-) After trimming, fold the elastic in toward the fabric wrong side. Gently stretch the elastic as you stitch using a very wide 3-step zigzag. Stitch at the edge of the elastic opposite to the picot edge to catch the un-picot edge of the elastic, as show below. This is what it looks like from the right side. The farther from the picot edge you stitch the first line of small zigzags, the more the edge of the elastic will show when you fold it inside the waist/leg, as shown below.This is what the inside looks like when you're done (my sample is sewn 1:1 with no stretch just for clarity). Remember, if you're using bobbin thread to match the elastic instead of contrast like this, it won't show.When you're done, the elastic may be stretched out and a bit flat, but it will snap back after a run through the laundry, or a few blasts of steam. The panties on the left below were just finished and the elastic is pretty darn flat after sewing it on. Those on the right (same size) have been through the laundry. You can see how the elastic shrunk back to size. In other words, toss what you've done into the washer/dryer first before thinking you haven't done it right. ;-)This is how I make fly fronts on jeans, merging together methods originally learned from Betzina, Kwik Sew, and Palmer/Pletsch. I've had requests to make a tutorial and, well … here it is.Finished view on actual jeans. The rest of the photos were taken using sample pieces so proportions will not be accurate. Also, these steps will result in a fly that opens like men's pants (left over right), which is common for jeans for both sexes.1. Front pants pieces with extended pocket facings in place. The shape of these facings isn't exactly right so I hope you can use your imagination for that. I extend the section of the facings that meets the center front so that it covers most of the vertical fly facing area. I prefer this for stabilization instead of fusible interfacing on the fly facings. The edges of the fly facings, front crotch curve and pocket facings should be overlocked (or otherwise edge-finished) before starting. The pocket facings and fly facings are not serged together even though they sort of look like it here.2. Baste from the waist to the red dot where the fly facing starts to curve. Lock stitches and then straight stitch between the dots using a regular stitch length. Stop about 1 inch from the inseam.3. Clip the fly facings at the bottom of the curve. I clip diagonally so the cut is on the bias and won't fray.4. Press fly facings open from both wrong side and right side to create a crisp fold.5. Use a big jeans/denim needle. For heavy denim, I use 110/18.6. After pressing, the first step is to top/edgestitch the center front of the fly. I use my center rudder (stitch in the ditch) foot with the needle in the far right position. Don't forget to increase your stitch length for topstitching, especially with heavy thread.The completed edgestitching.7. Now for the zipper. Use a zipper that is longer than the fly opening. It will be cut off at the top after the waistband is applied (not covered in this tutorial). I also never insert a zipper without Collins Wonder Tape. Apply a strip of Wonder Tape on each top side of the zipper tape, starting at the bottom metal stop and for as long as the fly opening. Do not peel off the paper yet.8. Peel off the Wonder Tape paper on the left (as you're looking at it face up) side only. Turn the zipper right side down and align the now left edge of the zipper with the center front seam. Finger press on the right side of the zipper to stick it onto the fly shield. The only part of the zipper which should be stuck is shown by the red line below.9. Move all layers to the left, except for the zipper and the fly facing it's stuck to, as shown below.10. With a zipper foot, stitch close to the zipper and again close to the edge of the zipper tape. I swear, I usually sew straighter than this but I was hurrying to make this sample and so it is what it is.11. Turn zipper over and remove the paper from the other strip of Wonder Tape.12. Turn the assembly face down again and pull the zipper over to the other fly facing as far as it can go without rippling. Because denim is thick, the fly facings won't lay flat at this point. Just keep things even and neat and you'll be OK.13. Move all layers to one side, except the zipper and the remaining fly facing. Stitch close to the zipper and again near the edge of the zipper tape. I stitch bottom to top for this side.14. Turn the assembly over and remove the center front basting. Stop ripping when you get to the regular length stitches!15. Unzip the zipper and press the underlayer flat. Steam/press out the fold from the basting seam and press in a crease next to the zipper.16. Use a template to chalk in a guideline for topstitching the fly. Unfortunately, I think the templates I use aren't being made anymore. A piece of oaktag or the back of a zipper packet will work too. Be careful that your chalk line doesn't cross the zipper stop or you'll break a needle when you're topstitching. 17. Topstitch along the chalked line. I use the ditch foot for this too, as the rudder stitcks up and makes it easier for me to see where I'm going. An applique foot would work too, but this foot would already be out and I'm lazy.18. Fly shield. (If you don't want a fly shield, skip to Step 20.) I use good quality cotton for my pocket bags and fly shields. It holds up well, doesn't get all wrinkly in the laundry and doesn't add the bulk that the same pieces in denim wouldFor the fly shield, cut a piece of fabric the length of the zipper facing and twice the width. Fold in half lengthwise, wrong sides together and press. Zip the zipper and then place the raw edges of the shield over the overlocked edge of the fly facing. The fold of the fly shield is being pointed to by the red lines in the photo below.19. Overlock the raw edges of the fly shield to the zipper facing. You can include, or not, the pocket facing (the section behind the fly facing) in the overlocking. Next, overlock just the bottom edge of the fly shield. I missed getting that in the photo.20. Open the pants front to expose the fly shield.Using the ditch foot and left needle position, stitch to the left of the zipper coil from waist down as far as you can before hitting the zipper tab. See the red line in the photo below.21. With all layers smooth and flat below, bartack from the top as shown below. You are trying to catch the flyshield with the bartacks. See the photo below with the bartacks circled in red.Voila! You're done. Don't cut off the top of the zipper until after you've sewn on the waistband so that you don't accidentally zip the tab right off the top of the zipper coils.When you are edge/topstitching along the Center Back and crotch curve seam, use the ditch foot with the same needle position as in Step 6 above and all the stitching will line up perfectly. With the jeans inside out, start at the CB and stitch along the seam, catching the seam allowances underneath. Stop at the front where your fly topstitching ended, pull the threads to the back and secure them."},
{"title": "Alterations: Cheater FBA", "date": "Thursday, March 1, 2001", "text": "With knits lately I've been \"cheating.\" Instead of doing a regular slash/spread FBA, I've just been blending between sizes as I trace or cut, like this:I'll start with the size that corresponds to my upper bust measurement. For this drawing, that would be the Gray size inside the black outline. Then I move out at armhole level to the size that corresponds to my full bust. Here, it's the Blue size. And then I gradually morph downward to the size that corresponds to my hips. Here, it's the Purple size. I end up with a pattern that resembles the Gray plus Red outline.This cheating method works for me because I also usually also have to increase the bicep width in sleeves and the morphing shown above does increase the sleeve size needed. But now, instead of actually slash/spreading the sleeve, I just use a similar morph between the sleeve size that matches the Gray size I started with and I extend the underarm seams to the Blue size, like this:As I said, I use these cheaters mostly for knits. (And before you ask, No, I don't find that the front bottom hem rides up. Your mileage may vary.) I will also sometimes use these morphs as a starting point for wovens too, because then I'll need a much smaller dart/spread when doing a traditional FBA.First, the pattern is slashed and spread and a dart is added to the non-darted tee, using the method in Fit For Real People (Palmer/Pletsch), shown here. The alteration shown is a large FBA, even for me, but the pattern I started with was about 1-1/2 sizes down from my usual size and required a bit more extra width.In order to transfer the horizontal bust dart to the center front shirring, the pattern is slashed 3 times at the shirred center front. The slashes are cut up to, but not through, the bust point (where the horizontal bust dart is currently pointing to). Three slashes are added so the dart can be transferred incrementally over the bust area instead of transferring the dart to just one place.The horizontal bust dart is closed by sliding the dart \"edges\" toward the center of the dart. As this dart is closed, the slashes added in the step above spread open, transferring the dart to the shirred front area and at the same time, adding additional length to the area which will be shirred. The additional length is needed by full busts, so this is a good thing!Spread the slashes evenly (they are not even in this pic!), add additional pattern material underneath and secure the alterations to save as your final pattern.This is the finished top. The full bust alteration adds needed width at the bust and also extra length to go over a larger bust. By transferring the horizontal dart to the center front shirring, the style of the original pattern is unchanged.There's not a whole lot to say. Well, maybe there is, but not from me. ;-)The above illustration is how I do a square shoulders adjustment on my sewing patterns. I lift the outer edge of the shoulder (usually 3/8\" - a little goes a long way here) and also lift the underarm the same amount. This keeps the armhole the same length so that sleeve adjustments are not necessary. I usually just draw these adjustments on the tissue before I cut out or trace the pattern so I don't have to go back and add tissue for the adjustment later. A straight edge for the shoulder line and a French curve for the armhole are handy. And that's it.For sloping shoulders, you would do the opposite. I.e., lower the outer edge of the shoulder and drop the armhole the same amount."},
{"title": "Alterations: X-Wrinkles Wedge Adjustments (Pants)", "date": "Thursday, March 1, 2001", "text": "This is how the back of my pants usually look, RTW or sewn-by-me. I've been calling it the X-wrinkles. The X-wrinkles are wrinkles and folds that radiate from my inner thigh to knee at the back.While a fisheye dart (FED) seemed to cure most of the problems, it never quite resolved all of the X-wrinkles. As my pants fitting continues to evolve, I think I've found my solution by addressing the X-wrinkles as two separate fit issues (high hip, full inner thigh) and altering for each by incorporating a \"wedge\" to add more fabric length where it's needed. In other words, adjusting where the X-wrinkles are pointing to.If the FED works for you, keep using it! The adjustments below and/or here (Minott) and here for full inner thighs are what I think works better for me. The photo above shows my FED pattern (white) laid over my wedge-altered Simplicity 4068. You can see there is a leg \"shift\" difference between the two.The altered Simp gives me more fabric at the upper inseam and at the high hip. (Pardon all the lines and scribbles on the FED pattern -- I was experimenting.)In addition to the FED alteration, I had also been altering for full thighs by adding to the crotch points. Yet, I would still have rear \"crotch smiles.\" So, I would add more. And still I would have those crotch smiles. Clearly, this wasn't working.So I dug out the fit books and realized that while I have full thighs, the fit alteration I really need was one aimed at knock knees because my full inner thighs were mimicking the results a truly knock-kneed person would see. And the light begins to turn on …I found the inseam wedge alteration in Fast Fit (Sandra Betzina) and coupled that with another wedge at high hip to add the extra length needed to go over that area. It's almost like splitting the FED into two, which for me is what I need because each side of what would be a FED needs a different size wedge.Below is my altered Simplicity 4068 pattern.The red lines are the wedges. The upper wedge is for high hip. (I added the high hip wedge lower on the front than I really wanted, but I was trying to keep the pocket area unchanged. Because the first sew of these pants resulted in a bit of poofiness at the front crotch, next time I will add this wedge higher and redraw the pocket.)The lower wedge is to add length at the inseam.After my initial pin-fitting in fabric, I also incorporated the alterations shown in yellow and blue. The yellow lines reflect (1) removing hip width, (2) lowering crotch depth front/back, (3) lengthening the rear dart, and (4) returning the crotch points to the original pattern lines because I didn't need the extra I added. (Truing the grainline is also shown in yellow but I did this before cutting the fabric.)The blue line at the back crotch curve shows where I deepened the curve.The black lines are original pattern seam and grain lines. You can see that these alterations do not throw off the grainline very drastically.This is the result, standing with my legs together …… and with my legs slightly apart:And this is how I usually stand, one knee locked, one bent, and one hip higher than the other. Yeah, not every stance is a perfect view. Once you move in real life, you *will* have wrinkles. LOL!Thanks to Kenneth D. King and his Trouser Draft CD book, the lightbulb came on for me when removing excess fabric from the back legs of my pants drafts. Hopefully, this little explanation of what Kenneth King's book showed me will help you too.Here's the problem, illustrated.In my particular case, excess fabric hangs up on my extended calves. In the top photo, you can actually see my calves sticking out.I also have excess fabric just below the cheek, although with these two pants, since the back crotch point still needs to be extended for my full thighs, some of these wrinkles and folds are for that fitting issue too.You may have figured out that what you really need is to remove a fisheye-shaped bit of fabric in the problem area. So, you pin it out and all seems well, as shown in this pic. But now what?? How do you actually transfer that strangely shaped dart to a place where you don't have to sew a seam across your butt?Read on.First, mark the grainline on your pattern/muslin. Next, draw a horizontal line perpendicular to the grainline and below the crotch point. Draw your fisheye dart the width of what you pinned out on your muslin and center it over the horizontal guideline.Your fisheye dart may be drawn lower than mine; that's perfectly OK. The idea is to pin out the excess where you need it pinned out. The location may lower or higher than my excess.Next, draw two lines parallel to the center line of the fisheye dart which are each 1/2 the width of the dart away from the center line. In other words, one line crosses the widest part of the fisheye dart at its top point and the other line crosses at its bottom point. Measure the distance between those last two parallel lines on both the inseam and the outseam. It is important to measure accurately.If you haven't done so already, trim away the seam allowances.Next, fold out the dart as one horizontal fold. To do this, make those last two horizontal lines shown in last photo above meet. The inside of this fold is the center line of the fisheye dart.FYI, the reason the crotch point in this photo is folded over is because folding the dart made the point lay crooked and it was easier for me to just pin it out of the way temporarily since my excess hits right at the crotch point area.Now for Kenneth King's \"magic.\"Remember those measurements you noted earlier where the parallel lines crossed the inseam and outseam? Now is when you'll need them.Extend the waist at the outseam up the same distance as you folded out on the outseam.Extend the top inseam/crotch point up the same distance as you folded out on the inseam.True the extensions onto the pattern piece, and voila! You've now removed a fisheye shaped area from your pattern.Here's my final result. Look ma -- no folds!Note: Fitting is an ever-evolving process and I've now decided the fisheye dart (FED) is *not* the alteration I need. To read more on about the wedges I used instead, follow this link to my blog entry with the details. This is not to say, though, that the FED isn't what you may need. Read both and compare for yourself, and maybe one of these methods will be helpful to you. — DC.I started with McCall's 4652, a knit top with a twisted front and empire seam.First, I loosely joined the upper and lower bodice pieces with tape.Next, I made my usual Full Bust Alteration (FBA), spreading the pattern about 1-3/8\". You should be doing the FBA with additional tissue under the pattern as shown in the next photo. Otherwise, you will have to reposition everything again like I did. :)Next, trace the sideseam onto the tissue underneath, as shown in red here. The traced line must be dark enough for you to see under one layer of tissue.To eliminate sewing a horizontal bust dart and maintain the bust alteration and sideseam shaping, close the dart by rotating the pattern clockwise. Draw the sideseam traced above onto the rotated pattern, as shown in blue here.Cut away the tissue outside of the traced sideseam. You have now rotated the excess of your bust dart to the sideseam.Secure your new tissue additions (tape, glue, etc.) and then cut the upper bodice section away using the original pattern shape as your cutting line. True the upper and lower sections as necessary. Add a seam allowance to the top (empire) seam of the lower section. Where I cut already incorporated the seam allowance for the top section, but cut away the SA from the bottom section, which is why I only added a SA back to the bottom section.Because this top is a 4-way knit, there really isn't any other way to \"tissue fit\" the knit except by using the actual knit. After cutting one bodice section in the fashion fabric and roughly holding it up to my bust as a test, I decided I still needed additional length in the upper bodice section, since by cutting on the original upper bodice empire line to maintain the shape of that seam for piecing later, I really didn't add any add'l length (which I need) to the bust piece yet. I slashed the pattern under the armhole and spread it vertically to add about 3/4\" more to the overall length of the upper section. I have a DD bust cup and this fabric is very stretchy -- your mileage may vary.The finished top.(Also how to rotate bust dart OUT at sideseam)Size Medium traced, then slashed (in red) and spread using the Fit For Real People method for non-darted bodices.After FBA is complete, trace the sideseam onto new tissue below.Close the horizontal bust dart by rotating pattern, while over sideseam tracing on under layer.New adjusted pattern is shown in red. Horizontal bust dart has been moved to the side seam and excess dart uptake is cut off.Final pattern as retraced, with markings, etc. The \"bump out\" at the bust area sideseam will be eased to the back piece. I also curved up the bottom hem area a bit to compensate for the added length from the FBA.This is the pattern as drafted, except that I forgot to take the pic before I cut off the little dolman sleeve. It's Simplicity 4229. It has a waist dart but no obvious horizontal bust dart. (The slashes you can sort of see are the results of the steps shown below.)FBA (full bust alteration) begins.First, I cut off the sleeve (see above) so as to mimic a regular armscye. (You need that \"seam\" as a pivot point for an FBA.)Next, I transferred the waist dart to a horizontal bust dart by marking my bust point on the tissue and slashing the pattern to that point where a bust dart would be. I then spread open this new dart/slash enough to close the waist dart.Next, I slashed and spread the tissue as you'd do for an FBA with a set-in sleeve. Because the waist dart in this pattern is shaped, it will not look completely straight as would a slash through a waist dart in another pattern. Use your best judgment to gauge where the \"center line\" of this dart would be -- parallel to the grainline mark in this instance is a safe bet. :)Because I wanted to keep the waist dart and lose the bust dart (to stay true to the pattern design), I rotated the bust dart closed againI filled in the spread gaps with tissue. Although the original pattern has the waist dart open, I filled this in too (shown in blue) so the fabric would be there when I cut out the pattern, which would let me fine tune how much dart uptake I wanted to sew in as a dart and how much I wanted to sew out at the waist seam. For this top, I ended up sewing about 1/2 as a dart and sewing out 1/2 as waist/hip shaping. I tried leaving the excess at the sideseams but the top would've been a sack with too much flare at the hip (not a good look on me) and too much ease at the waist. After I decided on the final waist dart uptake, I serged off the excess seam allowance, leaving about 3/8\".The last step which is not pictured, is to tape the sleeve back onto the pattern. It probably will not line back up *exactly,* so use your best judgment, true the seams/cut lines and fill in with tissue where necessary.The final top. The empire \"seam\" is not really a seam -- just applied lace."},

If your bra cup size is more than B, pick the pattern sized based on your UPPER BUST measurement as the bust measurement. By choosing your size based on bone structure rather than fluff, your pattern will fit through the shoulders and upper chest with minimal upper body alteration, if any, necessary. It's easier to adjust patterns for a full bust than to grade down for a proper upper body fit.These illustrations show an armhole princess bodice. The alteration is the same for a shoulder princess, just adjust the armhole slash point accordingly.Slash the side front bodice, as shown below in pink, leaving pivot points at the armhole and bust point.If using a pattern with seam allowances included, the armhole pivot point should be at the sewing line, not the cutting line.Spread the slashes apart the distance needed to meet the pattern center front to your center front (per your initial tissue-fitting), or the difference between your full bust measurement and pattern full bust measurement (per envelope), keeping the vertical and horizontal spreads parallel to the slash lines.A full bust alteration will add length under the bust. Move bottom center piece straight downward to match pattern bottom.See animation below.Add tissue behind pattern to fill in, leaving the side dart unfilled.Slash the pattern piece as shown in blue near the bust point.Rotate the unfilled side dart until it's closed and lays flat on your work surface.

{"title": "Coverstitch: General Hints & Tips", "date": "Monday, January 1, 2001", "text": "NeedlesBabylock and Janome recommend Schmetz ELX705 needles for their stand-along coverstitch machines (The Brother 2340 can use all standard Schmetz needles, same as for your home sewing machine.)The ELX705 scarf is longer than a standard sewing machine needle so when the looper passes it picks up the thread better. There is also a long groove at the back of the EL needle to hold the thread as it goes into the fabric to prevent abrasion and thread breakage. The Schmetz ELX705 needle point shape is similar to the light ball point Schmetz \"SES\" needle.I use both Schmetz ELX705 and Organ SY2922 needles interchangeably in my Babylock CS, although the Organ needles are available in more sizes (#11/75, #12/80, and #14/90) and are usually less expensive so I've been using Organ needles mostly.Thread netsAlways use thread nets on your needle threads. You may also want to use a net on your looper thread, especially if using Wooly Nylon. The nets provide an extra bit of tension needed to form prettier and more uniform stitches. See photos below. I must thank Belinda for urging me to use the nets already included with my machine's accessories.They really do make a big difference.How to treat the beginning coverstitch needle thread, or when you start a coverstitch, can you just clip the threads, or do you have to pull them to the other side and tie them off?There are various answers depending on what you're doing ...If I'm coverstitching in the round (like a sleeve hem), I will pull the starting needle threads to the back so it looks neater. But that's me. The beginning stitches won't come undone easily so you can just snip them, but for added \"insurance\" you might want to either (a) start with a very small stitch length for a few stitches and/or (b) if stitching in the round, stitch over the first few stitches before pulling the ending threads to the back.If I'm stitching flat and the stitches will be enclosed in a seam or crossed by other stitching, then I always just snip them.Where to buy attachments and how to attach the generics? Babylock, Brother, and Janome all have some attachments designed specifically for their branded CS machines. The Babylock CS machine can use \"generic\" industrial attachments without modification and they cost a fraction of the cost for the identical attachments sold through Babylock and its dealers. See photo below which shows a Babylock binder with generics. Which is the Babylock and which are the generics?The other CS machines can also use most generics but you will have to somehow modify how you attach them to your machine. Blu-Tack or Sticky Tack or even duct tape and masking tape have all been used by owners of those machines. See the links below for Belinda's page and the Janome thread on Pattern Review.Janome sells their own binder which comes with a flat plate which is attached to the bed of the Janomes before attaching the binder. I think Janome CS owners will have much better results with the generic binders if they first purchase the Janome \"kit\" so they can use this plate with the generics. See photo of Janome binder below.I bought my generic attachments from an Ebay seller. His old Ebay ID was CutSewSupply but he is now selling under the ID of SharpSewing. Click Here for his Ebay store. I have absolutely no affiliation with this seller and he tends to not reply to most emails so I can't help you with that. I do know that he is reputable and any items you order will be received.Sew Link on Amazon seller also has some generic binders (not a monetized link).What size binder(s) to buy? Well, here are my favs ... The binder I use the most is the 1-1/8\" A style. This makes a 3/8\" binding that is folded twice on top and only once on bottom.My next fav is the 1-1/2\" B, which makes a 3/8\" binding folded twice both top and bottom.After that, the one that makes 1/2\" bindings folded twice (which is the *only* one I bought from the Babylock dealer).I like the 3/8\" bindings for girl stuff and the 1/2 bindings for the guys.What size belt loop folder to buy? Your preferences may differ, of course, but I like the 3/4\" cut size belt looper folder which will make strips finished at 3/8\". I think this size replicates RTW belt loops.Other Coverstitching Links• Rebecca's Sewing Corner YouTube Double Fold Bias Binder Tutorial and check out her other GREAT tutorials on YouTube here• Gail Yellen's YouTube CS Binder Tutorial• Babylock CS Clear Foot on Amazon (not a monetized link)• Bev's 900CPX Cookbook• Melissa's (Fehrtrade) article in Seamwork• The Last Stitch's Master the Coverstitch Machine (book)• Sure Fit Janome CS Tips & Techniques Video • Janome Coverpro message board topic on PatternReview.com• Gigi's Photo-Tutorial for Coverstitching Over Serged SeamsThere are many varieties of feller/folders. Some turn the fabric edge down one time, some turn down a double fold, others turn the fabric edge up, and still others will create felled seams between two pieces of fabric as you'd see on jeans, menswear shirts, etc. The photo above shows many sizes of clean finish, or double fold, feller attachments. In general, for home coverstitch machines, you'll use the single downturn feller to create topstitched hems with a covered raw underside edge, as shown below.Fellers attach to the bed of the machine with thumbscrews. Some of the larger fellers (like the 1\" feller below) can only be attached with one thumbscrew. That's OK -- just tighten the screw enough so that there's no play or wiggle in the feller.It will take a little bit of experimentation with scraps to learn where to position your feller so that the underside of the hem is coverstitched without leaving excess to trim away. Once you have this position, keep the feller attached and remove the fabric. Use a Sharpie marker to mark the needle positions directly on the feller as shown below. From that point onward, you'll now be able to quickly line up your mark with the needles or needle markings on the foot and no more experimenting will be necessary. You may also want to mark the thumbscrew location onto the attachment.If the screw holes in the bed of the machine do not alllow any further side-to-side adjustment, you can reposition the feller on the attachment bracket after loosening the metal screws just to the left of the white thumbscrew in the photo below. Once your feller is positioned as desired, don't forget to tighten those screws again.To begin, finger or iron press a \"starter\" fold about 2\" long and the width of the feller spec. My examples show a 1\" feller, which means the finished width of the hem is 1\". So, I would finger (or iron) press under a 1\" width along the first 2\" of the fabric.Lift the presser foot and slide your raw fabric edge into the attached feller and allow the feller to turn the edge of the fabric the amount you marked. This sounds more complicated than it is. The feller will do most of the work with only a little guidance from you. You may need to slide the fabric back and forth under the presser foot a couple of times to seat the fabric into the folding curls of the feller.Once the edge is seated, pull the fabric under the foot and put the foot down. Start stitching. The foot and feller will hold the fabric in place with only minimal guidance from you to keep the fabric from \"dragging\" in your lap, which could distort the felling action.With a properly positioned downturn feller, this is how the fabric will come off the machine. The hem is topstitched on the right side and completely covered by looper stitches on the wrong side, with no excess to trim away. You can see a little bit of distortion as my fabric is leaving the feller. This is because I'm trying to stitch and take photos at the same time and the fabric is dragging below the machine bed. I needed my third hand!Beltloop folders will have a \"cut width\" and a \"finished width.\" Cut your fabric strips exactly the width specified for the cut width. If they are too narrow or too wide, they won't feed into the folder properly. You can use either knits or wovens.Attach the folder so that the needles are centered over the exit point of the folder. I prefer to use the widest coverstitch (6mm) when making beltloop strips.Once the strip is fed through and under the foot, start stitching. The folder does all the work! Your presser foot should hold the strip tightly in place so that you only have to provide the slightest guidance with your hands.When you're done, you'll end up with a long strip which can now be cut into individual belt loop pieces.The beltlooper folds both raw edges toward the middle while the machine coverstitches over the raw edges. It can't get simpler than this!Thank you to Bryden S. for sharing this method with me. I hope everyone finds it as useful and timesaving as I do!I use a stand-alone Babylock Coverstitch machine. You should be able to follow along with different brands, but some of the steps may be different (releasing tension, for example). Belinda has put together an excellent tutorial for ending the coverstitch on the Brother 2340CV, here.Let's begin:1. Stop stitching with the needles in the highest position, or turn the handwheel to raise them if needed. Next, raise the presser foot and release needle tension. (On the Babylock, raising the presser foot releases tension at the same time.)2. With a long, skinny tool (I use the needle allen wrench which came with my machine), sweep under the presser foot and behind the needles, \"hooking\" the needle threads.3. Continue sweeping forward until the needle threads are pulled out in front of the presser foot.4. Continue pulling the needle threads until you have a thread loop about 4\" long.5. Snip the thread loop in the center so both needle threads are cut at the same time. (I usually snip while the skinny tool is still pulling the threads out, but I couldn't balance the tool, the scissors and the camera all at the same time.)6. After the needle threads are cut, pull the fabric straight back.7. Continue pulling straight back until the needle threads are pulled to the underside (this will happen as you pull the fabric back), and stop when you have about 5-6 inches of needle thread. (In this photo, you see the needle threads that were cut from the needles laying on top of the fabric. The needle threads in the stitches have just disappeared to the underside by my pulling the fabric.)8. Turn the fabric over and there are your needle threads on the underside!9. Cut the looper thread, leaving a 4-5 inch tail at the machine for your next project.10. Needle and looper thread tails ready for next project.11. Underside. These stitches will not pull out. Try it! You can finish the tails by threading them under the looper stitches with a wide-eyed blunt needle, tying a knot, or applying Fray Block.(If you are hemming or stitching in the round, you will need to manually pull the needles threads at the beginning of your stitching to the back before you get to the end so you don't stitch over exposed thread tails. I usually stop hemming right before I get to the end to do that, and then I continue the last few inches, stitch over the existing stitches for 2-3 stitches and then use the method above to pull the ending needle threads to the back.)Finished binding should look like the photo below. The twin-needling is at the down-folded edge of the binding next to the main fabric and the coverstitch loops cover the raw or folded edge on the reverse.It should not look like this:And in most cases, nor like this. Although there may be times that you want the topstitching to straddle the binding edge as a design element and in that case, it's OK!If your stitching does not fall on the binding like in the first photo above, you need to change how the strip is folded by adjusting one or both of the two screws at the top of the binder. These guides control how much of the strip is folded into each section of the binding. Screw 1 below adjusts the top guide. Screw 2 adjusts the bottom guide.The reverse of the industrial type binders is shown in the photo below. Your specific brand binder may look slightly different. On a properly adjusted binder, the top fold guide (1) will protrude slightly more than the bottom guide (2). Exactly how much depends on your binder, your machine, and whether you are using an A or B style binder. If the underside fold or raw edge of the binding is not covered by the looper stitches, loosen the right screw (when viewed from the front of the binder) and slide it a tiny bit to the right. This will pull in the guide for the lower fold and result in a binding with less underfold sticking out.If your top stitches are straddling the binding edge (and this is not a design choice), loosen the left screw and slide it a bit to the left to make the binding top fold land a bit to the left of the underside edge.With both of these adjustments, you may also need to adjust where the entire binder sits in relation to the needles. Once I have the binder position finalized on the bed of the machine, I mark it with a Sharpie marker so I don't need to fiddle with it again."},
{"title": "Coverstitch: General Binder Set-Up Info", "date": "Monday, January 1, 2001", "text": "Binders will have a \"cut width\" and a \"finished width\" for the binding. Cut your binding strips exactly the width of the cut width. If they are too narrow or too wide, they won't feed into the binder properly and your binding may look messy and uneven. Now, having said that, there *are* times I purposely cut the binding strip a bit wider than required. This is mostly with very thin knits with a lot of stretch. The binder tension will stretch the strip too much making it feed through narrower than a less stretchy strip. The little bit of extra width counteracts that.If using a knit, cut the strip across the stretch of the fabric so that the stretch runs the long length of the strip. If using a woven, cut the strip on the true bias (45°).After cutting my binding strip, I cut a point at one end to make it easier to feed the strip into the binder.I use the point of a straight pin to \"push\" the binding through the folding area.After the end has poked out of the binder, I grab the strip with my fingers and gently pull, allowing the strip to be properly folded by the binder.I keep pulling until I have a long enough length to pull around toward and under the foot.After the binding strip is positioned under the foot, feed the other end through the serpentine guides (if your binder has them), as shown below.Binders are available for many binding sizes and two finishes. A \"raw finish\" or \"A style\" binder folds the strip twice on top and once on bottom, leaving the top edge encased and the bottom edge raw (to be covered by coverstitching). A \"clean finish\" or \"B style\" binder folds the strip twice on top and twice on bottom, leaving both raw edges of the binding strip encased.The photo below shows an A style binding:The photo below shows a B style binding:The photo below shows a B style binding being fed through the machine. Notice that both edges of the binding are turned under toward the center.Below is a close-up of an A style binder.Compare with a close-up of a B style binder, which has an extra folding \"tube\" for the fabric strip to pass through.What is a coverstitch?A coverstitch is the twin or triple needle stitching you see on the hems of most ready-to-wear (RTW) knit garments. The top looks like parallel rows of straight stitching and the underside looks like serger loops which *cover* the turned down raw edge. Sometimes the \"wrong\" or loopy side is sewn on top as a design feature, especially in activewear.Coverstitch machines can also stitch single needle chain stitches.Are there coverstitch machines for the home sewer?Yes. Many top-of-the-line sergers/overlockers have a coverstitch option. However, there are also currently 4 brands of stand-alone coverstitch machines, Babylock (which I have), Brother, Janome and Bernina.There are subtle differences among all of the above machines, including price, available stitches, features, and accessories. Click HERE for a comparison chart.There are also industrial coverstitch machines available to the home sewer which have even more stitching options, such as coverstitch loops both top and bottom at the same time.Why would I want a stand-alone coverstitch machine? Sergers/overlockers with a coverstitch option must be converted from overlocking to coverstitching. Some machines convert more easily and faster than others, but all combo machines *must be* switched over somehow in order to coverstitch. Because a coverstitch can be used on the garment in places other than just hems and because some sergers/overlockers are convoluted to convert, it becomes a time and hassle factor to keep switching back and forth between overlocking and coverstitching during the construction of a garment. A stand-alone coverstitch machine is always ready to coverstitch and keeps your serger/overlocker always ready for its best task. Stand-alone coverstitch machines also produce more consistent and pleasing coverstitches than combo machines because they are built and engineered for just this one task. This means the stand-alone machine's foot and the space for it do not have to be \"second fiddle\" to a serger/overlocker's knives and feed dogs.How about accessories?Most of the above 4 brands of stand-alone home coverstitch machines have custom accessories available. These include specialty feet, binders, fellers, and beltloopers. See the Comparison Chart.In addition to buying \"brand name\" accessories from your dealer, generic \"industrial\" attachments can also be purchased on Ebay for considerably less cost. See the \"Where to Buy\" info on the General Tips page. The generics fit the Babylock without any modification and are nearly identical to the Babylock branded accessories. Slight modification and/or \"rigging\" is sometimes required to fit the generics onto the other home machines, but owners of all brands have reported success with attaching and using the generics. See the General Tips page for more info.What is a binder?A binder is an attachment for creating and attaching bindings in one pass on a coverstitch machine. You feed a precut strip of fabric through the binder and it folds the strip around the edge of a second piece of fabric, such as a neckline or sleeve hem, while you coverstitch the binding into place. Binders are available for a variety of finished binding widths and work so well that binding is a breeze!This is one of the Babylock branded binder attachments for the Babylock Coverstitch machine:And this is one of the industrial generic binder attachments I purchased from an Ebay seller. There is absolutely no difference (except price!) in design or functionality between the generics and the binders sold by Babylock dealers.Below is a Brother branded binder attachment.This is the Janome branded binder attachment, along with the plate needed to attach the binder to the Janome CP 900/1000.Below are binders which will fit onto many overlocker/sergers with a coverstitch option. Some are \"plain\" or single-fold, and others are \"2 fold\" or double-fold. Plain binders will fold the binding strip in half, leaving the raw edges flat and unfolded (unfinished). The 2 fold binder will fold the binding strip in half and will fold under both raw edges resulting in the clean, folded finish you're probably more familiar with.These are made by Babylock for the Evolve:Below are examples of some of the generic versions. The attachment plates are adjustable and/or removable to adapt to your particular overlocker/serger and/or stand-alone coverstitch machine.  What is a beltloop folder?A beltloop folder is an attachment which feeds a strip of fabric, turns under both raw edges toward center while you to coverstitch down the center of the folded strip. Belt loop sections can then be cut from the longer strip and applied around a waistband using your usual method.What is a feller?A feller (or folder) is an attachment which turns a hem, either single or double-fold while you coverstitch the hem into place. Because the fold down is precisely aligned with the stitching, no trimming from the reverse is necessary. Fellers are available to downturn and upturn, in a variety of hem widths.• The Basics• General Hints & Tips (and links to resources on other blogs and websites)• Comparison Chart• Coverstitch Project Examples• How To End a Coverstitch• The Difference Between A & B Style Binders• Binder Set-Up Info• Adjusting a Binder• Beltlooper Set-Up & Usage• Feller Set-Up & Use• \"Lazy\" Hem• Serging Bound Neckline"}
