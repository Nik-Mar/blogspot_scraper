The file cabinet needs to be replaced as the top drawer mechanism is breaking but I do try to go through many of the files once a year. The bottom drawer though is genealogy mostly and just sits there pretty packed.Decided that two 5 gallon paint containers left by the sellers in the garage laundry/storage room are unusable and will go to the hazardous waste disposal next week along with some pesticide containers. Still need to assess the smaller paint cans."},

Bought and sold houses both with 30 day escrows. Moved from southern Cal to Northern Cal with a puppy using U-haul after giving away lots of stuff. Gave away lots more after the move. Had all the electrical, plumbing and termite damage identified in the home inspection fixed and also treated for termites.¬†Replaced the sump pump and had the furnace hung to avoid further flooding damage. Did an earthquake retrofit and completely re-landscaped the yard front and back including adding new hardscape and trying to improve drainage to avoid future flooding in the crawl space.We celebrated with and hosted family and friends. Provided some child care and simply enjoyed our grandchildren and the ease of short visits with them, our son and DIL. Found the services and providers we needed. Learned our way around. Found our exercise routines and walked the dog many times a day which helped us meet people. We think we have met some potential good friends.¬†Identified a few go to restaurants for take out. Explored a bit. Made an effort to stay connected to the friends and family we left behind and farther flung ones.We were at once stressed, tired, worried about the amount we were spending and delighted that we had moved to a nice home with nice neighbors and near our younger son and his family.¬†We are so ready for an easier year full of joy and connections and less work LOL.Happy New Year and wishing that you get all you want from 2024!"},

After the first hard rain since we moved in we found a leak at one of the windows. Hubby was able to caulk the opening after it dried out. Another rain and it didn‚Äôt leak!2. The long piece of what I thought was metal threshold left in the garage turned out to be kitchen cabinet baseboard and end caps. The cabinet installation by the previous owner was a bit sloppy in places and there was no end cap in the most visible spot. Hubby cut one of the new pieces to fit and it is visually much better. We need a dab of glue to hold it though and will have to buy some.3. I was given loose tea from Portugal for Christmas and thought of using our French press to steep it as I have no teapot. Worked fine and the tea is quite nice.4. ¬†üßùüéÖüç™One of Santa‚Äôs elves left a bag of cookies on our porch Christmas Eve. I suspect the main elf is about 9 years old and lives up the street. Will be investigating the identity of the elves so we can thank them and let them know they are delicious.5.

Sounds like it will be perfect for us and provide a dose of live holiday music.Fine Tuning the HouseWe continued to adjust our use of gas, electricity and water primarily for environmental reasons but also to minimize spending while staying comfortable.¬†This house has a gas furnace, water heater and stove. Hubby continued to fine tune heating by getting a different style floor register for one spot and slightly adjusting the duct dampers ourselves. We also replaced a broken electric space heater as sometimes you just want to warm up the space where you are.He also worked on getting hot water in the shower without running a lot of cold first by adjusting the temperature mixer and then we were able to turn down the water heater temperature. I was pleasantly surprised to see on this month‚Äôs gas bill that we stayed in the lowest rate band despite using the furnace a lot.¬†Although everything else is electric including 2 space heaters, we were successful in making the majority of our electricity use fall into the lowest rate time frame.¬†Other frugal things1. Spent way too much time getting the lint off a king size fleece blanket that sheds when washed. I use it over the down comforter as the dog gets on the bed and it is nice and warm. I tried replacing it but sent two different new ones back for various reasons. So we have this one, a lint brush, my time and savings.2. Returned an item bought as a gift and used a box we had saved. After shipping it is only a partial refund but still worth it.3. Skipped a holiday gathering that felt more like an obligation than fun. It also required both a food contribution and a cash donation.4. Accepted some free tangerines and they were delicious."},

The ferry ride was short and very pleasant.Almost all Christmas gifts have arrived and been wrapped.¬†Hubby put together the 3rd bench for the backyard.

Clearly I walked a lot more than that as I only carry my phone on actual outdoor walks. There were also lots of stair climbs with a two story house again.My back hurts less.¬†Pilates sessions with a very good trainer is addressing the issue well. Much thanks to my son for finding this trainer who diagnoses and customizes extremely well. I like her as a person too.So much for reducing grocery costs in November:¬†I thought we could keep our November grocery, household, toiletries and alcohol spending similar to October. I was way off.¬†Having 2 more adults to feed for a week, Hubby‚Äôs birthday dinner party for 7, and providing significant hors d‚Äôoeuvres for Thanksgiving added almost $200 to our spending for the month. Happily spent I should add as the family time was lovely and fun. Today is my local DIL‚Äôs 40th birthday party so, although my older son is sick and stayed home, my DIl is back for 2 nights. They will be gone much of December and January visiting her parents which makes these visits all the more precious.¬†We still have spent less in these categories this year than last and I have lowered the budget goal a bit further for 2024.Insurance costs and coverage: Once we decided not to switch insurance companies we took a close look at our homeowners, earthquake and excess liability policies. Raise a deductible here and get an earthquake retrofit discount there and it adds up. Plus we noticed the earthquake insurance still listed us as owning 2 homes (there was a few weeks overlap) instead of one and the homeowners insurance had not noted the recent roof replacement.¬†Now I just have to go to city hall and get copies of all the permits for the property and hope there is one for updating water pipes!Speaking of city hall: I submitted the form and documentation to get part of our city transfer tax refunded because of the retrofit. This is enough money to care about.The county is slow: Still no word on our property tax credit for seniors who sold and bought a home in California. We are owed a discount on our property tax and submitted the form 7 months ago. To be fair, they did say it would take at least 6 months.Our 2 year old furnace is oversized: With colder weather we have discovered that the expensive furnace the sellers put in is about 50% oversized so it was shutting down because it got too hot. Hubby found an experienced technician knowledgeable about this brand and he was able to make an adjustment to the gas flow so it works ok and doesn‚Äôt overheat. Whew. We did not want to have to buy a new furnace.Planning for 2024:¬†The new year definitely will see me focusing away from the house and yard. I‚Äôm starting to get excited about it!"},

I‚Äôm not showing the pre-existing patio because it is bare at the moment since it is quite chilly these days.Eventually there will be tall shrubs providing a screen along the back fence plus the camellias and other plants blooming.

Every surface is dusty and it even is inside some kitchen drawers, etc. The yard project made all the screens and windows filthy on the outside too.I don‚Äôt expect to get it all done in one month but it really needs focused work and effort. I‚Äôll look for decluttering and reorganizing options as I go.

At that time they lived in Kenya and live in Taiwan now. We haven‚Äôt met his younger daughter and only he made the trip this time. It was great to catch up in person and he got to meet our son‚Äôs family for the first time.Home Improvement Projects:¬†We are near the finish line with our yard project. This week lots of plants were put in the ground including the beautiful silver sheen in the corner. Our son and DIL gave it to us as it was already too large for their yard.¬†We still need to select and purchase the smaller plants and get them in the ground. Then the drip irrigation will be set up and bark mulch put down.The yard is looking great and the pup is enjoying it both for running and sniffing. It is mostly an adult space, but future owners could easily convert some areas into play spaces by replacing gravel with real or artificial grass.¬†We bought 3 of the benches in the top photo which are very comfortable. We will be getting a small black metal patio table back from our son and have some chairs and a patio umbrella. Also an outdoor rug that was left with the house. We ordered hoses for the front and back even though the plants will be on drip irrigation as there will still be uses for them.The railings for the old concrete patio stairs still need to be selected and installed. We are holding off on repainting the old patio until we see what it is like during the rainy season this winter after pressure washing.We have been diligent about returning any items we don‚Äôt use for the yard project within the return window, giving things away and patiently putting trash and green waste out each week to minimize our dump hauling cost. The dump haul won‚Äôt happen until we are sure no more waste will be generated by the project and we hope to share a load with a neighbor.Taking care of our stuff:¬†I washed and put back together the dog‚Äôs favorite bed which will probably last another 6 months or so as he digs at it trying to bury his favorite toy and that is destroying the foam inside. It was a gift from former neighbors after their cat rejected it. We will look for a similar bed once it falls apart as he likes it so much.Discretionary expenses:¬†I replaced our king size down comforter by purchasing one from The Company Store during their 30% off sale so the cost was $300. The king size one we have had for 6 years doesn‚Äôt have fill in some areas anymore as it seems to have migrated! Made for not so cozy nights. We really like the queen size one we purchased from The Company Store so I called and made sure I was buying the same weight. They were able to look it up even after 3 years.Food, household, toiletries & alcohol purchases:¬†Very happy with our total three quarters of the way through the month. We did go out for pizza one night with our son and the baby which was a nice break ¬†and our treat but is a separate part of our budget.

{"title": "Earthquake Retrofit - The drilling, sawing and nailing begin", "date": "Friday, October 20, 2023", "text": "The earthquake retrofit, the final costly project, started today!¬†We were a bit concerned it would be delayed when we learned earlier this week that they submitted the wrong info for the permit. The city came through with approval of the correct one quickly though and there was no delay. Once the work is done and approved we can apply for a partial refund of our city transfer tax but you only have a year from purchase to do that. We should also get a discount on our earthquake insurance.What is involved in an earthquake retrofit? For our home design it involves cripple wall bracing and foundation bolting. Our chimney would still likely fall down but addressing the chimney and its soft mortar is down the road as we don‚Äôt use the fireplace. The info below is from the California Earthquake Authority website.¬†Cripple Wall BracingCripple walls¬†are short walls that rest on a house‚Äôs foundation and support the floor and exterior walls. When these walls are not braced, they may shift during an earthquake. When this occurs, the chances of severe damage to your house and injury to individuals increases. Bracing cripple walls strengthens structures by increasing stability, and the process typically helps minimize damage to houses. See the image above to understand how new elements in the crawl space enhance the house's earthquake resistance.Foundation BoltingHouses that aren't bolted to their foundation can move during an earthquake. Houses that move off their foundation will cause significant damage and may be costly to repair. The bolting process requires that holes are drilled through the sill plate on a foundation and anchor bolts are installed. Sometimes, there isn't enough space to drill, and steel plates will also need to be attached. These bolts must be properly installed to be effective."},

Everyone was happy and full.- Planned dinners for the week again and we only grocery shopped for what was needed but of course the total was more than last week as we had used up a lot of things.- I suggested to a neighbor that we combine our dump hauling needs from our yard renovations to try to save money and she thinks it is a great idea.- I received 2 plastic kid size bowls from Buy Nothing for future grandbaby use. Now I just need toddler size utensils and sippy cups as I received plastic plates earlier.- We enjoyed our gifted third of an apple ü•ß¬†Decluttering- Making the hard decisions to get rid of mementos that I have no place for and that have been in my life forever.

That is ok as there are other things that have to be hauled away.- When I reach for something to use I am asking myself if the items surrounding it are useful to us now or are they just taking up space.

We are figuring out when to open which windows to cool down the house. I did run the heat to take the chill off the house on Tuesday morning before the heatwave arrived. Reprogramming the thermostat was successful although I may tweak the settings a bit as it gets colder here.Our property tax bill arrived. We knew it would be huge but seeing the number is another thing. Just a reinforcement to watch our other expenses. The county still has to apply another credit/adjustment related to the sale price of our previous house but that will be relatively small.Home/yard project expenses were only two inexpensive items for minor home improvements and one bag of topsoil. We both worked on the yard a lot to move things along and save money. Hoping to be ready to buy compost, plants and mulch this week.The hardscape is all done and paid for! We put two old patio chairs on the new back patio and are enjoying sitting in the shade.We are trying to get rid of the 2nd large batch of rubbish from the yard project without paying a lot for hauling. So far I posted 5 pallets and crate pieces on Buy Nothing and someone says they want them. Hoping they do take them. I also cleaned up most of a pile of old rock and will use a bit before posting the rest. We are going to try to sell the leftover flagstone pieces once we are sure we don‚Äôt need any of them. We have used a couple so far to help with drainage and stop erosion. Our trash can is small so the rest will be disposed of bit by bit over many weeks and by paying someone to do a dump haul.We received our free COVID tests and they are good until late January. I also got 2 boxes from the library that expire earlier so we are covered for now.We purchased a little food, a few household supplies, beer, and no toiletries. In September we spent over $948 on those items. Our food, household and toiletries pantries are well stocked so we should be able to spend less each month the rest of the year. Sadly I had to throw out a 4 pack of sea bass because it smelled and had obviously thawed and then refrozen.

It is kind of like a home painting project in the respect that you prep, prep some more, and then get to the nice part. There were more surprises in the destruction of the old front yard.Why put weed cloth, soil, black plastic, soil, more weed cloth, and then more soil down? We are astonished anything grew there!Why would you pile dirt against the bottom chimney bricks and mortar in a wet climate? It is not surprising the mortar needs repointing!Why were there old termite bait stations all over the yard yet there still was a termite problem? At least we have already addressed that with termite treatment that actually works.We are taking care of all of this and more but üòüI was busy all week but my to do list is pretty much unchanged although a couple of things did move forward.

Since the grand-baby burst into sobs when left with us briefly this week, we have concluded she has reached the stranger fear stage and we realized she had been asleep the last few times we were at their house. Ages in baby time since she was familiar with us being around lol. The plan is for me to spend big chunks of time at their house before babysitting so she is used to us again and we know her current schedule/likes/needs and how to use the high chair, etc. Babies change so fast at this age. As I told my 40 year old son, we haven‚Äôt taken care of a 7 month old baby since he was one!With lots of advice from the local Benjamin Moore store staff followed by internet reading, we have a tentative plan to fix the slippery paint on the large old concrete patio. Right now it seems the sequence is to pressure wash, lightly sand with an orbital sander, vacuum and wash again, perhaps prime depending on what the surface is like, and then paint with an anti-slip acrylic coating. The final coat can be made any of their colors so that is a plus. Our son lent us a handheld power orbital sander to test on a small area. Then we will decide how much of this to do ourselves as we could rent a larger orbital sander that you stand up to use and our landscaper will pressure wash. The store staff also carefully picked and recommended 3 small company painters for us to contact for bids if we want to hire a crew.Got stuff doneSon and the grand-girls came over for dinner Wednesday while DIL worked late.¬†Cleared off my desk and that checked off at least 7 things on my 20+ items still on our move to do list and also got pile of paperwork filed.Cleaned the high chair so it is ready to useExercised a bit more and ate fairly healthily¬†Bought 2 long sleeve tees after checking my wardrobe for fall.

I really enjoyed starting to get to know her.And at the end of the week I got the RSV vaccine for those of us over 60. Now that we are around kids and working folks more I want to try not to have transmission either way this winter. Next up is probably the new COVID booster in mid to late September and then the flu shot in October.

Moving into a new house can be like that. You‚Äôve heard about the repairs and improvement project spending so here is the thrifty side.1. We ‚Äúsaved‚Äù $2500 on the termite repairs and treatment (at least on our minds) because I kept thinking the cost was the total on the proposal. However Hubby did some of the work so it was way less. Mentally transferring that money to the yard project but in fact our overall home improvement costs lower because of Hubby‚Äôs work.2. Speaking of the yard project, we were very aware of prices when selecting the flagstone which is sold by weight but still got what we really liked. The price per ton was around $500 vs over $1300 per ton for others we liked. The gravel is also sold by weight and we picked one of the most expensive but the costs are in a small range.3. Happily accepted free mangoes and a sweater from Buy Nothing group members as well as green beans from our son‚Äôs garden and dinner out courtesy of the same son (we take turns paying)4. Went to a milestone birthday party for our DIL‚Äôs Mom and Uncle. Took consumable gifts that weren‚Äôt very expensive but were what they really like.5. ¬†Limiting our purchases to needed consumables, family time, and what is on our need or project lists. Exception for beer and wine if you are being picky.üç∫üç∑ We also did well keeping most of our electricity use during low rate hours but I‚Äôm going to try to improve on that.

The missing bottom step and railings will be added. Plants along the fence and pots near the house.Everything within the white flags in the yard area will be flagstone set in sand and provide play and other use areas by having a lower level patio and walkway. Then areas of gravel next to the stone and then planting beds with bark mulch. The main plantings will be along the back fence to screen the neighbors messy area from our view from the balcony. They won‚Äôt interfere with the expansive view of San Francisco Bay though. There will be other plants but a lot of open area. We aren‚Äôt focused on native plants per se, but definitely low water ones on a drip irrigation system.The front and side yards are getting a drip irrigation system, being regraded so water runoff is better, and almost all new plants with bark mulch. We have discovered a couple of stumps that have to be dealt with and have more plants needing removal but the drip mechanism has been installed next to the faucet. The rarely used walkway to and down the side of the house will be flagstone stepping stones not a closely placed walkway like in the back.Lots to do to make this a reality so we, the pup and family and friends can enjoy the outdoor part of our new home.This week we are making decisions about the flagstone and gravel so it can be purchased and delivered. We are also setting up an appointment with a painting company to find out how to fix the patio and to get an estimate plus figure out how to sequence that work with everything else to be done in the yard. Hopefully more progress in the front too.The need to redo the yard was a major surprise after moving in. A big expensive surprise but since we are doing it we want it to be something we really like. We are saving plants that we think can be used in different spots but there weren't many that were pet/child safe and the right size."},

She also had us do a pretend cooking competition where she mimicked the announcer so perfectly that we all were laughing a lot!¬†Other highlights \"camp\" for me were that she wants to hold hands when we walk anywhere, how happy she and the pup are together, that she was a trooper while we went to the rock and stone yard to decide what to buy, how creative her play has become and that mostly she is cheerful all day!¬†We wrapped up our 3 day camp with seeing the new Little Mermaid movie at a funky movie theater in Oakland that has couches and other kinds of chairs for seating. We also bought dinner there and ate it while watching.The removal of all the mulch and weed barrier from the backyard revealed that they had covered 2 drains (!!!) and there were lots of operating drain pipes close to the surface and some old ones that weren't connected to anything. Also lots of 3 year old termite bait stations to dig up. Sigh. What is done for staging a property to sell.On a positive note, having to lay out the flagstone vs gravel vs planting areas has gotten us a little excited about the outcome of this unexpected & expensive project. Now to solve the how to fix the slippery when wet paint that was used on the large patio. It says right in the product description that it is slippery when wet - DUH!The vertical blind for the balcony sliding door was installed and now we know how crooked the house is! The installer had a heck of a time figuring out what would look best and ended up aligning it with the sides of the door frame so the panels would hang in line with them.

I have been very good about not buying an6 books and we have rarely gone out to eat and if we do it is for family time which is a big priority for us and the whole reason we moved.We kicked off the month with some heavy yard work to uncover the bamboo in our yard so it can be removed properly and not just cut off and covered with weed barrier and mulch. I don‚Äôt think we found it all but we were pooped. We had to rake back the horrible mulch, cut and remove the weed barrier and now we are supposed to water the area so every bit will grow. Hubby also shoveled a lot of the mulch we raked so he could put it in the green waste bin for this week‚Äôs pickup.¬†We keep telling each other that we are old and can‚Äôt delay fixing up the house and yard so we can enjoy our time here as long as it may be lol.

This little boy and the one across the street adore our dog so we have lots of interaction with them.- I gratefully accepted some small plastic bins, toddler plates, and baby board books from the Buy Nothing group. Sent more unneeded stuff out of the house to other members of the group.- I gulped and then signed a contract and paid a deposit for termite and fungus treatment/repair work.

I am thankful we can afford to do the repairs and upgrades.¬†- The electrician is finally booked for Monday.- At the gardener‚Äôs advice, we uncovered the bamboo growing under the weed barrier in the back. You do have to see what the size of the problem is before you can deal with but it is painful!- Hubby removed another massive clump of wild iris in the front yard so 4 are gone and 6 left to go. Each clump fills the green waste bin so it is one a week for it to be hauled as trash.- I went to the dermatologist for an annual skin check. Two freeze off spots and one small biopsy.- Hubby hung a heavy decorative mirror and 3 large pieces of art so there are just a few smaller pieces left to deal with."},

The issues found are very similar to the seller‚Äôs inspection report but much more thorough and the repair cost is lower. Also they will get city permits where appropriate. We feel much more confident that the work is necessary and will be done well.¬†Hubby can fix a few small soft spots in the window trim, etc. but the work in the crawl space takes professionals. Most of it is the do it once and be done type of repair on an old house. The chemical treatment for termites has a 2 year warranty and of course new ones can show up and start eating at any time so that is not permanent.We signed the contract for the earthquake retrofit and paid the deposit. Now to wait 4 to 6 months to get the work done which is fine because the termite and mold work has to be done first. BTW, there are standard retrofit solutions matching current building codes for typical single family structures and that is what we are going with. Bolting, shear walls, braces, etc. Another do it once and be done expensive project.More stuff gone through Buy Nothing postings: 2 small table lamps, dog chews that weren‚Äôt hard enough for our super chewer, 4 CDs, and a small piece of non skid under rug stuff.

I was invited to lunch by a woman in the AAUW group I joined. Our older son and DIL will come for a visit sometime in the second half of June as they returned in late May from almost 4 months abroad.On the other hand ‚Ä¶This was the last week of school for the 6 year old grand girl and now she begins her summer camps so we won‚Äôt have our one afternoon a week with her as far as I know. We will have to set up some family times.Baby grand girl doesn‚Äôt start daycare until July 1 so we will continue to babysit some in June when our son has medical appointments as DIL has returned to work.¬†We are waiting on an appointment for a landscaping consultation. I still need to get a clear plumbing list together and try to book that work plus some new railings and chimney repair/retrofit and, before the baby is mobile, a fireplace screen insert. Houses are always endless work but fixing the problems you acquire with and older home is a lot of work quickly lol.The electrical work is postponed due to the electrician being injured on his last job. Since he is the only one who even responded we are waiting on him.We are not enjoying the May gray weather which will segue into June gloom. Being much nearer the coast now it is worse than it was at our previous location further inland. Summer weather here is more mid July to mid October although a new acquaintance said don‚Äôt put away any clothes for any season because you may want them at any time!We are both still tired from the intense last 4 months and all the changes in our lives . We are missing the friendships we had developed and comfort in navigating our daily lives after 6 years in the previous location. I recall the same feeling of letdown and sense of ‚Äúwhat the heck have we done‚Äù from previous moves and know it will pass with time.Onward into June."},
{"title": "Frugal Friday", "date": "Friday, June 2, 2023", "text": "I recently read a library copy of ¬†The Buy Nothing, Get Everything Plan¬†by the creators of the Buy Nothing groups. The book was written before the pandemic which meant that they talked a lot about creating community and how this gets people meeting each other IRL which it isn‚Äôt happening so much right now despite our recent dog play date that came about that way.¬†However the other points about reducing our impact by reducing new purchases and of course saving money are all still valid. We are almost through our shopping for things for the new house with just a few indoor and outdoor items left and my local group has helped with a variety of things passed on and will continue to reduce our costs I‚Äôm sure.- Inspired by the book I made huge progress clearing the garage by giving away more than I received if you don‚Äôt count consumable food items. The food items are definitely frugal. The baby toy and under bed storage box just need cleaning so no cost for them.¬†- Other than food, cleaning supplies, toiletries and weed killer, I only bought some Command hooks for the back of both bathroom doors and have ordered a bamboo bench with shelves for the upstairs bathroom.- I learned the local Petco groomers are competent and quite a lot less expensive so I will made pup an appointment there instead of the highly recommended but very over booked very expensive one. I really only care that he is treated kindly during the process and the result doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect."},

Trying to reduce our recycling.- Booked the pup with a different groomer recommended by a neighbor. They are so booked that he is going to be one hairy dog by the appointment though. We will be asking to be put on the wait list for an earlier appointment.- Over the holiday weekend I posted 27 items/groups of items on Buy Nothing as an attempt to finish clearing out the garage (now that we know what we won‚Äôt use here) so we can organize what we are keeping in it! ‚ÄúGifted‚Äù 19 by Tuesday evening. One more will go in the recycling bin and two to the community sharing shed at the recycling center so just 6 remaining from this batch. I‚Äôll list more for this weekend.Things that were taken ranged from a CD player, lots of CDs, speakers and a stereo receiver to used Kong dog balls, a craft kit, empty boxes and sheet protectors! Through the process I met a nice woman who invited me and the pup over for a dog play date. I will shamelessly use him to make friends lol.The converted garage storage/laundry room is looking much better though there is more left to remove.

We will see what his self control is like when she is a floor baby or wants to grab his fur!Grandbaby, being 3 months old, looks at him but then loses interest.

Turns out I only need to shop Target about once a month for items we can't get at Trader Joe's or Grocery Outlet. Also a once a month dog food order from Chewy since no store locally carries the right one.Returned 4 items to Amazon that didn‚Äôt work for us. Still have some solutions to figure out.Getting a second opinion on the termite damage and fungus problems identified in the seller‚Äôs termite inspection report as the report info was minimal and the proposed repair work cost high.Ordered cases of 12 cans each of two types of reduced sodium soup and one kind of low sodium pinto beans from Amazon for half the regular store price. I can easily store them in the closed off garage/laundry room and they have distant best by dates.And a lot of free food from a Buy Nothing member who is moving across the country: grains, flours, sugars, oatmeal (so much oatmeal), fruit spread, dried fruit, canned beans, maple syrup, prepared enchilada casserole sauce ‚Ä¶ and lots of hot sauces and seasonings that aren‚Äôt our thing. If our son doesn‚Äôt want them I‚Äôll offer the remainder back to Buy Nothing.Walked to the library and back to pick up real books. I prefer e-books but they aren‚Äôt always available. Glad to be able to combine exercise and free books.On the not frugal front ‚Ä¶ maybe -The earthquake retrofit will likely cost over $10,000, but could save our house and lives as we live near the Hayward fault. We may be able to get a small discount on our earthquake insurance after it is done and ¬†that will add up over time. Waiting on the bid.We got the electrician's estimate and it is quite reasonable. Fingers crossed that some of the higher cost possibilities aren't reality! No potential for electrical problems/ fires plus some minor upgrades ¬†to improve quality of life are good and frugal in the long run.Frugal for others -My DIL returns to work next week and my son still has PT and Pilates appointments plus primary child care for a while. I offered to babysit the grandbaby whenever he needed me to so he could keep those appointments. The baby will go to daycare when 6 months old but that is a few months away. Then we have one week in August where we are doing Nana and Papa camp for the 6 year old. We will have her over some days during other weeks this summer hopefully.My DIL is in charge of fundraising at a major local non-profit. We babysat the kids the night of their annual fundraising gala & we knew we would be too busy and tired to fix dinner although our son offered to prep the food before he went. We ordered takeout that turned out to be costly and very mediocre but we all ate! Both girls behaved very well as did the dog and the kids went to bed easily at 8pm so we got some rest lol. We are feeling our age."},

A painting my Mom did was hung over my dresser by Hubby.2. I decided to let the CD player, receiver, speakers and most of the CDs go (after noticing that the radio we have had for years and keep in the kitchen will play one CD at a time LOL). That means 3 boxes of stuff can be removed from the garage eventually through the Buy Nothing group. Also giving away some hangers.3. Earthquake latches were installed on kitchen cupboards by Hubby to reduce broken glass and dishes when we have the inevitable earthquake. They latch the cupboard door shut when there is a good shaker. He also hung another of my drawings in the kitchen.4. Speaking of earthquakes, we had Quake Busters, an earthquake retrofit company, come by to discuss what we need to do to strengthen this old house. Good news is that there are some positives in how the house was strengthened when the 2nd story was added to half the house.5. The upstairs shower stall is now usable as a back up. Hubby finished all the caulking of the shower and floor. We have extra towels and a bath mat. The shower opening is not standard but we found a shower curtain that will work. We also decided to hang one of the items from our picture & mirror collection as decor. Now to find a bathroom bench with storage underneath, towel hooks for the back of the door, and some kind of in shower toiletries holder that fits.6. Took one of the dog gates stored in our garage to our son‚Äôs for use to block the entrance to their front porch. Our pup ran out their front door last week to race up and down the street before Hubby caught him. Since he doesn‚Äôt listen as well as he could yet (still?) our son suggested a second line of defense on the porch which will also help when the baby gets mobile. The other gate will stay here to block the bottom of our stairs for baby protection in the future."},

I sent in the form for his new license. His only reaction to the vaccines was taking more naps that day thank goodness. I‚Äôm so conditioned to my prior chronically ill dog that each more normal reaction to things is lovely.We were shocked to learn that the provider group here after Kaiser does not accept Medicare patients. We will probably change to Kaiser at the next open enrollment but after spending about 3 hours at it I was able to find a doctor in the Stanford Health network and get an appointment so I can continue my prescriptions. We haven‚Äôt yet found an urgent care facility or emergency care though. Scary.It was easy for me to walk to the library and back which was a goal for this month and since it is a pleasant walk I‚Äôll keep doing it to build up my endurance.Our first full month gas and electric bill was quite reasonable despite running the heat often.

We have concluded the windmill pumped water from the well and the vine covered building is the well house.I discovered 1918 is an important date because El Cerrito was incorporated as a village in 1917. ¬†Refugees from the 1906 San Francisco settled in what became known as the refugee camp of Rust after the local blacksmith. The residents didn‚Äôt like that name and changed it to El Cerrito or ‚ÄúLittle Hill‚Äù after a nearby geographic feature now known as Albany hill. There are lots of hills in El Cerrito some of which are natural areas and/or connect with the Berkeley Hills¬†The new ‚Äúcity‚Äù incorporated not only the camp of Rust but also several other communities whose names are reflected on local roads and government agencies. The creation of El Cerrito caused the end of cattle drives up what is one of the main streets and which was also once part of the Lincoln Highway.¬†Now it is the focus of redevelopment and very near the BART line. The walking and bicycling path under the BART line is named the Ohlone Greenway after the Native American group that lived here. I‚Äôve also seen names of parks and other things that reflect the early land grant names (that is also true in S.

Two weeks in our new home and this is how that has played out for us.Fixing:The water heater pilot light was out (discovered when trying to take first shower) but good old Google came through with clear instructions and it working now. That led to discovering that we had to keep it set to very hot to have hot water in the shower so adjusting the shower faucet temperature mixer is now on the plumber list so we can turn the water heater temp down.Lots of cold air was coming in under the kitchen sink but Hubby purchased an outlet cover and gasket plus some safe insulating material and very little air comes in now.The kitchen fan vent was not connected to the outside so Hubby fixed it. He also fixed the sink stopper in the upstairs bathroom.The frig and freezer were not cold enough on the recommended settings so I bought an inexpensive friend/freezer thermometer and finally got the settings food safe.Buying:In addition to the small items to fix things we ordered more costly items to address the lack of storage -¬†A dresser for each of us, floor shoe rack for me, wall mounted coat hooks for entryway, a standing towel rack with a clean towel storage rack on the bottom.¬†The microwave that came with the house was not well suited for us so a new one was purchased along with other¬†things like a doormat, drawer knob lost in the move and hamper. We did return an¬†expensive faucet that we had brought with us thinking we would replace the kitchen faucet.Grocery Outlet: After discovering that Safeway here is way more e pensive than Vons was (and ‚Äúsoulless‚Äù as my son said) we went to grocery outlet and found that over a year it would save us so much. We still need to check out Lucky for the things that Trader Joe‚Äôs and Grocery Outlet can‚Äôt provide. Moving requires changing your shopping.Buy Nothing Want Fulfillment: There is a very active Buy Nothing group here that I have joined and it is lovely.So far it has provided a very long coloring poster and some felt animals to make that I hope my older granddaughter will enjoy doing.We also discovered there is a very thorough recycling center system in the city and county that also has a sharing space for books and items in good condition,Buy Nothing Gifting:¬†Gifting the stuff you no longer want is a big part of these groups.

Today we go to our DIL‚Äôs mother‚Äôs home for an Easter egg hunt and dinner.The weather is definitely cooler here and wetter at least this year. The pup loves his yard but after a rain came in needing a bath as th3 ground cover is not dog friendly. Put re- landscaping down as another project. Most of the boxes are unpacked, my computer is set up, most clothes put away and this coming week will be focused on life admin. Finding doctors for all three of us and all that. I am so thankful we have the energy and health to do all this!The pup loves his window on his new world (and having a yard to run around) and has picked his favorite spots downstairs and upstairs.

Just CVS to go to hit the main 5 lol. We have ordered dressers and unfortunately also a microwave as the one that came with the house makes a very loud strange noise. A new dryer is in our near future too as it took a very long time to dry. Do they even make Kenmore dryers anymore? The washer is great though.

We also had to leave on Saturday afternoon for the buyer‚Äôs inspection to get done. Everything that gets checked off is something we are done with!I'm¬†tracking what this move is costing beyond the purchase price of our new home. As I mentioned last week, there were some surprise repair expenses already and then there is what we know about - sewer lateral upgrade (required by water district & scheduled for after we move in), electrical work, plumbing work, earthquake retrofit, water drainage improvement, more insulation, etc.¬†At least once all those are done we should be done for quite a few years on the house systems and infrastructure upgrades/repairs. Then there is everything that falls into the category of wants (furniture, landscaping and such). As expected we are finding it challenging to throw out things given our small trash can and to dispose of usable furniture we are not taking. We are working on both in hopes of not having to pay for hauling.¬†I am very grateful that there has so far that the place we are selling only requires some wood replacement due to termite damage/dry rot, a bit of foundation repair and getting the ice maker working again. I'm suspect the buyers will have something they want fixed or a credit for fixing themselves. Their inspection was yesterday so we will know soon. All the little costs add up to like have to pay to notarize some escrow documents.There is also¬†small extra bits of money coming in. Medicare refunded Hubby's overpayment from last Fall due to the overlap of his quarterly Medicare payments prior to taking Social Security and when it started being deducted from his SS. We also got a very small refund on an umbrella insurance policy when we had to switch to a different one to cover the new house and our state tax refund. There is a small check sitting at the new house for escrow overpayment.Once the house sale is finalized we will get homeowner's and earthquake insurance refunds too. However our car insurance will probably go up. So much more $$$ going out than is being refunded but we knew that when we started this journey!"},

The IRS and state tax board say it takes up to a month to change your address. Then there are all the ones you need to do at the last minute online.¬†One nice thing so far about having the house near our son is that they were able to anticipate using it the night their power went out and they were concerned about keeping the newborn warm enough.

People to meet!) while his humans got a couple things off their to do list (new dog address tag ordered & a library stop). Then a visit to the local brewery's outdoor seating. OK, that was for the humans but pup proved to have good ‚Äúbistro dog manners‚Äù as he was worn out and we took something for him to lay on plus water and treats.¬†¬†On the moving front: Monday Hubby loaded a 10 foot U Haul truck with boxes of stuff and most of our light weight furniture. Tuesday he drove to the new house and got the keys. ¬†He gave me a FaceTime tour once he was there and I do really like the house even better than from what I saw in the photos.¬†Wednesday he unloaded the truck and had the furnace and sump pump serviced. As feared the furnace was installed incorrectly as the crawl space gets wet and the sump pump is not adequate. He contracted to have both fixed and they were done by midday Friday.¬† An unplanned expense but we expect lots of those in an old house no matter what.¬†We are making a prioritized list for the other systems and structure repairs we do know about.Thursday he returned the truck and flew home, took the train to our stop and I picked him up there. After he got home he acknowledged that despite all his bike riding the house stairs made muscles ache. It will be getting back in stair climbing shape for both of us!He had some nice family time. Our 6 year old granddaughter started her campaign for us to pick her up from school every Wednesday and bring her to our house for after school care. Apparently that is the day she has to ride a bus to her after school program and she doesn't like doing that LOL.

They would be very happy that we are going so we can be hands on grandparents creating lots of ¬†memories with our grandchildren.Our realtor did the final walk through today and this was the view from the upstairs family room while she was there. I‚Äôve been told the Golden Gate Bridge is visible a bit at the right angle.So how are we saving bits here and there?- Our realtor got a small seller concession for something the seller usually pays for in that market. She also got a great bid for the mandated sewer line work we have to do quickly.- The sellers are leaving us a nice storage unit in the garage that may find its way into the house.- I finished using my CA gas tax rebate debit card on this week‚Äôs groceries. I still have money on a health insurance incentive debit card and REI coop rebate to use.- I got a two for one deal on new glasses and sunglasses that kept the cost reasonable even with all the upgrades to maximize my vision.- Returned my HOA gym key fob and got a whole $6 back.¬†- Eight free Covid tests are available per Medicare recipient through early May so I picked up mine today because there is that new baby granddaughter to protect.- Made sure to schedule my 2 already paid Pilates sessions before we move.- We are moving ourselves and hiring loading/unloading help for the heavy stuff on the second load.- Trying to use up everything in our fridge and freezer before we move. At least this time we can move our pantry items easily as the drive is just 7 hours instead of many days from Atlanta almost to Ventura so we don‚Äôt have to take everything in one trip.- We continue to figure out what are the most important items to move from liking, remaining lifespan, use and cost perspectives. Everything we own won‚Äôt fit into the two truckloads that use truck sizes safe for Hubby to drive. I‚Äôll drive the car with the dog as passenger. We are fortunate that the new house comes with washer, dryer and frig so we don‚Äôt have to consider moving ours.- Hubby scheduled a furnace service for the brief time he will be there next week to make sure it is safe to operate and to learn how to service the high tech filtering system himself. He‚Äôll also get the keys, drop off a load of our stuff and meet the new granddaughter!- We learned our new house home warranty will cover rekeying the locks and will use that to eliminate that expense.- Worked with our current insurance agent to match homeowners, earthquake and umbrella policies at our new location for a reasonable price although the costs are higher due to location. We will comparison shop later when we aren‚Äôt on a short deadline.- We learned a lot staging our Atlanta home for sale 6+ years ago in a slow market and are using that for our current home. We also talked today about the fact that we could rent it out at a profit if we don‚Äôt get the price we want. We would rather not be landlords but it is an option as sales prices have dropped in the last 6 months.- We will cancel our water softener service before the next billing cycle. I‚Äôm sure there will be a fee for reconfiguring the pipes though.- Going to keep looking for ways to do what we want with the new house for less money.¬†- I‚Äôm sticking with free library books for now.Meanwhile Hubby is enjoying researching all the interesting sounding restaurants near our new home including Himalayan food!

Most everything was recently updated including new roof, furnace, flooring, landscaping plus the kitchen and main bathroom redone. As with any house built in the early 1950‚Äôs there are things to fix, but only a few things that have to be done soon. I mean who knew that sewer laterals have to be replaced and a certificate of compliance obtained due to water pollution from old ones leaking. We do now.The neighborhood is flat with good sidewalks and trees and we have been told that the neighbors are nice. The main floor has living room, dining room, kitchen, 2 bedrooms and main bathroom plus¬† attached one car garage that has been turned into a laundry, utility and storage room. One step up into the house, one step into the garage and one step into the fenced small backyard with a nice patio and drought tolerant landscaping. All good for aging in place.The upstairs has a large family room with a balcony where you can watch the sun set over San Francisco plus another bedroom and full bath. Great for the grandkids to play in, Hubby to play his drums, a tv room, guest suite, etc. Once it isn‚Äôt feasible for us to use the upstairs regularly it can still be a guest room, teen hangout, caretaker space, etc.We did well I think although the speed things have to move in that market is daunting. Onward to moving money into escrow, getting insurance and oh so much more before closing.¬†The funny element to getting the house is that I was sitting in the train station parking area waiting for Hubby to get there after his trip to see the house and there was no cell service.

It is interesting to get to the ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt buy a house without that‚Äù point when available houses in your target location, minimum size and maximum price range are few and the market is very competitive.At this point when a new listing comes up that might work with our list, we:* read everything posted,¬†* check several real estate sites to see estimated sale prices as they all sell for a lot over the listed price,¬†* examine the photos very carefully & look at the map to see how close it is to our son and to noisy things (metro, freeway, noisy businesses or roads), and at the street view and satellite images to see the neighborhood.¬†If we think it might work we then either ask our realtor for the endless pages of disclosure and inspection documents (inspections are done by the seller in that market) or we ask our son to check out the neighborhood/street and do a walk through during an open house. Lastly we decide if my husband will fly up to see the property during the typical 10 day window from listing to offers accepted date. Did I say the market is competitive?!!!So far he has only gone to look at one property which we decided not to make an offer on. Thursday one came on the market that sounded good but the photos weren‚Äôt up before the first open house on Friday. Our son went and checked it out and, if the inspection report doesn‚Äôt have any deal breaker issues, Hubby will fly up early next week to see it.¬†It is interesting not only for meeting our short must have list items but because it was just updated including furnace, roof, etc. so an older parent could move in but then that didn‚Äôt happen. That explains why it is being sold furnished too although furnishing are minimal and not an obstacle ¬†for us. Not the cabinet or other colors I prefer but that has moved to the wants list as long as we both can live with it.You may think that is being picky as it is just paint, but there was a house Hubby liked in a neighborhood we both would love to live in but everything from the exterior to kitchen cabinets to walls were various shades of cool blues except for the kitchen tile backsplash which was bright yellow. Those are colors I can‚Äôt even wear without looking ill. I didn‚Äôt feel like I could live in it and it was so themed that it would be hard to change without spending a lot. There were other issues too but the color was my dealbreaker.So what is on our much shortened must have list? Mostly things related to aging in place that would be hard to change but also location.* A low barrier entry to the house* bedroom(s) and bath on the main floor or stairs that could easily accommodate a chair lift,¬†* laundry hookups accessible from the main living space, or bedrooms if they are upstairs (many houses require steep basement stairs or going outside to another space),¬†* yard that is fenced or can be with access from house main area,* a neighborhood where you could go for a walk preferably without steep hills,* no noise from metro etc. heard in house,¬†* sufficient space and a layout for us to live happily on a daily basis.¬†We have also narrowed the areas we will consider. The new listing is 3 miles from our son‚Äôs and further from stores and other things that we prefer, but that is looking like a trade off we have to make. Right now we are ok with driving, Uber is ubiquitous in that area, and our son or DIL could easily drop things off for us if needed and vice versa. Fingers crossed!"},

The rest: The pup will have an easy time with his neutering surgery and recovery. There will be a house on the market that we want & can afford to bid on (fingers crossed). I will exercise regularly and read some of the many books I bought in January. We will stay healthy!How was my week? Pretty low key and mostly at home.I managed to catch up on club commitments, attend a club board meeting and visit with friends, get books at the library, read a lot, treat myself to lattes & pastries, have a takeout dinner of shrimp & veggie tempura plus salad.I worked out at home and one session with the Pilates trainer, did lots of small household chores including putting away things I am tired of dusting which resulted in a more minimalist but nice to look at decor. A visual change is good!Not sure about this poor plant my DIL gave me although I do fertilize it and it is in the best light location I have. I keep trying to help it grow better but there really isn't a good spot for plants inside our house. I may give up on it and try to find something that is happier in our low light space. I am happy I put away the out of date family photos that were on this table in our dining room. The candlesticks are an old favorite and were on a living room table that is now just has a lamp.We also took the pup to the pet store to get a brush for his thicker, curlier adult hair. He was very excited to go out and loved browsing the dog and cat food aisles lol.¬†No rain so far this month but in January we had 8 inches which is more than the average annual rainfall for this area recently.Decluttering and upgrading:¬†Just the easy stuff for now - don't use, too many, not in good shape, why do we even have it, etc. - and more will go if and when we move.¬†Total YTD¬†- 51 items decluttered, 6 put away for less dusting, 11 upgraded."},

We are feeling discouraged by the probable selling prices of homes that need lots of work, are too small or have too many stairs inside or out. We are getting clearer on what tradeoffs we are willing to make and how much we are willing to spend. Also we are getting better at examining the online photos and wading through inspection reports, etc. I'll let you know if we make any real progress.On the bright side, nothing else has broken in our home and Covid cases are low in most counties in California right now. I am feeling comfortable going out to eat, to the library or to meetings without a mask however I‚Äôm still putting one on for the grocery or drugstore, etc. What is your experience of the pandemic like at this point?I‚Äôve done lots of mending, almost finished deep cleaning the kitchen appliances, went to a lunch meeting and did lots of club related tasks, had a private Pilates session that kicked my butt once again, and more.Decluttering and upgrading:¬†Just the easy stuff for now - don't use, too many, not in good shape, why do we even have it, etc. - and more will go if and when we move.¬†Total YTD - 51 items decluttered and 10 replaced with upgrades.I‚Äôm being very thoughtful about what to let go and what to keep as this isn't the first round lol."},

Bottom line? Half the living space was in the basement and Hubby said the stairs felt unsafe for an early 70 year old couple especially since the laundry, garage and lots of living space were down there.¬†He went to an open house for another one while he was there and it was too small for us. We have learned a lot from this first excursion into the market and we have another house that interests us. They are starting to come on the market regularly. I remember how many houses we looked at and how many months it took to find one before buying our all time favorite 35 years ago!I contacted each bank/investment co where we have our money and found out what we would need to do to wire transfer money to escrow when we do buy a house. We started researching local realtors for selling our current home, but won't contact them until we have a new home. Here it is easier to sell your home if you have moved out and that is certainly easier than keeping is spotless all the time and leaving with the pup on short notice for someone to view it!FAMILY (including the pup):We agreed quickly to have our granddaughter visit for a week during the summer. Of course that will look different if we do manage to move by then.Our local DIL's parents are visiting and staying at their home for a month during the worst of Michigan winter. They all came out to have lunch at our local brewery, go to the coast to sightsee, and then back to see the delighted and excited pup. This son and DIL are off now for a month in Thailand with friends and then 3 months in Portugal (thanks to a home exchange). We joked that if we move while they are gone we will give them the new address!The pup is showing more and more signs of maturing in terms of behavior now that he is almost one. He puts himself to bed in his crate and accepts staying in it when we have to leave him home. He is figuring out how to tell us when he needs to go outside, etc. And he is learning to better calm and entertain himself instead of demanding attention when we can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt give it to him.¬†Once we get through his neutering and recovery in late February I think for the most part he should be a well behaved adult dog though still hi energy and very social as his breed is. He‚Äôs a sweetie and we are glad we chose him although he is adding an extra set of requirements to our house hunting!HEALTH:¬†My private Pilates sessions are a strenuous 55 minutes and I seem to only sleep for 4 hours the night after before waking for the day. I am getting stronger though and my leg and ankle strength are more balanced. I have learned though how much weaker my left arm is and the arm muscles that are strong vs not depending on the type of motion. I've decided to limit the sessions to one a week for now.HOME:¬†The new second bath shower faucet works great and the small hole in the wall is repaired and ready to paint with pain we already have.Decluttering and upgrading:¬†Just the easy stuff for now - don't use, too many, not in good shape - and more when we pack to move.The kitchen and laundry room are finished for now. I‚Äôm enjoying the less cluttered and rearranged kitchen space despite having to remember how I rearranged it! After following a lot of British bloggers, I also decided to get an electric kettle instead of our stovetop one. We'll see how that works out.This week - 2 out & 1 upgraded; Total YTD - 47items decluttered and 11 replaced with upgrades"},

Now to decide about a specific house.We have selected a realtor near Berkeley and our son has screened two houses for us by doing extensive tours. Hubby is flying up on Tuesday to meet with the realtor and carefully view a house we are quite interested in.¬†The main living space would be smaller than what we have now but there is somewhat usable finished basement space although the ceiling is lower than upstairs. Nice little yard, flat area that is very walkable to stores, restaurants and just to walk. Only a mile from our son's home.This may happen sooner rather than later although it is hard to gauge how competitive the market is there right now. Right now I'm alternating between excited, hopeful and having second thoughts!!!HEALTH:¬†3 workout sessions. Miles walked outside was less than last week due to major storms moving through although the pup and I slogged through the downpours and puddles as necessary.¬†I have successfully stopped taking over the counter allergy medicine every day which was a habit. Waiting for sneezing weather to start again.HOME:¬†The hopefully last of the plumbing work on this house is to be done on Monday. Then we will have to get the hole in the bedroom wall fixed. At least everything working well is a selling point!Decluttering and upgrading status: 14 kitchen cupboards and 7 kitchen drawers done.

I set up a simple exercise tracking system limited to Pilates at home/in studio, stretching at home, and miles walked outside. Now to up the number of checkmarks.HOME:¬†We continued to repair our home. Replaced the kitchen faucet and main shower drain cover. We learned that fixing the guest shower faucet requires a hole in the adjoining bedroom wall so we bought the faucet set and the plumber was scheduled for next week.I started going through our house with the intentions of reducing \"inventory\" (less to manage & potentially pack) & upgrading/replacing as needed (less annoyance). I'm asking myself - How many do I need/use? If too many, which are my favorites? Do I need more or to upgrade? I'm also doing a deep cleaning as I go. Five kitchen cupboards done. YTD: 14 items decluttered; 4 replaced/upgradedPut away the Christmas decor and added Christmas wrapping supplies, cards, napkins, etc. and the few Thanksgiving items to the same container so none is in our daily use spaces."},

The next day the toilet in the other bathroom started leaking but on the 23rd that was fixed and the shower hole was drywalled, textured and primed. Hubby painted it (we had paint on hand) and now it looks like it never happened! Or at least it will once the switch plate and painting are back up. We are really enjoying the new, water saving shower fixtures.¬†¬†A friend and I removed leftover Christmas items from the ongoing ‚Äúboutique‚Äù we have at the clubhouse for purchases by renters and members. We still haven't finalized replacing the clubhouse furnace (installed in 1972 we think) but the price keeps going up and will be at least $35K so we need to raise money any way we can.Christmas weekend was fun and low key with our nearby son and DIL staying over two nights. We cooked, took walks in the warm weather, played with the dog and enjoyed our stocking gifts. The pup was pretty excited to get a new chew bone and soft toy in his stocking!We are spending New Year's Day at the same son's home.

I've been aware of him as a performer and activist, but never searched out his music. YouTube suggested his album \"A Touch of Jazz\" which I really enjoyed. That led me to read his Wikipedia entry so now I am going to search out his varied musical performances since the band Police stopped and they all pursued individual careers.Besides that it was an unusual week in that I had something scheduled every week day.¬†Monday was my annual Medicare Wellness visit which thank goodness has added to it scheduling the normal type of physical tests.

He also went with me to the pet store to pick up his new ID tag and enjoyed walking the aisles.Forward MotionDecluttered by donating prior dog's crate, other smaller dog items, a lap quilt, small rug, shoes, book, guitar. Recycled or trashed papers from files, an old garage light fixture, other garage items.A fabulous club meeting and 2 more new members! That makes 4 in the last month. All are high energy and very interested in active involvement. Two even jumped in and helped wash dishes after lunch (very old building so no dishwasher). Two very interested guests too so at least one more new member soon I would think. We also raised some money with our Holiday Boutique sale which moves on to the district meeting later this month.Engaging ProjectIt looks like we can afford to move even with the future scenario of income decreasing due to death of one of us. So now the question is do we want to make the leap? We will take a couple of hours to drive by houses currently for sale while we are visiting so we can get a clearer idea about neighborhoods.Prudent Spending¬†The new dishwasher is installed and is working great.A rush trip to the vet did get the bee stinger out of pup‚Äôs paw and medication into his system to forestall worse reactions than the 6 bouts of vomiting that took us to the vet. Pup was fine the next day.Frugal Things¬†¬†I bought a sleeveless top and two scarves from ThredUp and a short sleeve top from Goodwill.¬†And a Random Odd Event¬†¬†I just happened to look outside at the moment when a termite swarm was resting on our patio. Glad I had stocked up on bug spray as we used a lot to try to eliminate all of them. It was better than when a swarm came in through our kitchen skylight a few years ago lol."},

My favorite was titled \"I want to be reincarnated as Gloria Steinem\" as it was both touching and clever.I sent my granddaughter the next volume in a book series she is loving.¬†Watched two PBS series online: First 2 episodes of Magpie Murders and season 2 of Miss Scarlett and the Duke. Really enjoyed both!¬†I went to book discussion group and out to lunch with friends. I don't think I mentioned the marvelous concert we had at our club meeting on the 13th, but it was a mix of opera and Broadway songs performed by the professional singer daughter of a member accompanied by her parents on piano and drums.Forward Motion¬†mostly was increasingly long walks with the pup to try to wear him out a bit so he doesn't engage in unwanted types of play in the house. We also decided to start taking him more places for more experiences and the stimulation of being out and about someplace new.¬†We bought him new toys to give him new things to do. You can see the alligator toy (possibly now dubbed Lyle, Lyle Crocodile after the kid's book) in action here. He really likes this toy and it is different from the ones he already had.:Engaging Project¬†Currently this is our discussion of the pros and cons of moving, how much we could afford to spend on housing if we do and the logistics of doing it. At this point we both think it would be a positive for us emotionally and family wise so we need to crunch the numbers further, think through timing and process, etc. A big decision, more expensive cost of living and a major lifestyle change if it happens.¬†We are leaning towards doing it and buying a house to live in for the next 10 to 15 years of our lives despite the great cost in that market. The cost of housing, property taxes and insurance do have me swallowing hard though.Prudent SpendingThings that came with our house are now needing fixing or replacing. We can definitely afford these but it is a hassle getting it all done but both scheduled for the second week of November.Repairing the 7 year old Bosch dishwasher would have cost at least almost half the price of a new one. We chose a new one rather than hoping something else wouldn't break in the old one.The Grohe shower head and faucet system that currently has little ability to adjust temperature? ¬†It too needs replacement. Of course they have to open a wall to fix it. Sigh.Our 2011 vehicle has under 84,000 miles on it. Hubby looked at 2 hybrids that were of interest and wanted to also see a plug in hybrid model that is not in stock yet. He found that the dealers are tacking on a \"just because we can\" $6,000 - $8,000 cost making them around $50,000 right now. So we put better tires on the car for a better ride and steering and will keep fixing it as needed for now.Then there is the strange noise the automatic garage door is making and the closet doors that won't close all the way. Not to mention the buzzing light in the garage. Those are next up.Frugal ThingsNo cost to us beyond our monthly HOA fee was fixing our front yard sprinkler and drip irrigation leaks. Hubby sanded and stained the chair leg the pup chewed. It‚Äôs not exactly the same but is fine. He also took down a useless light in the garage.I have been trying to replace my athletic/walking shoes and remembered I had a pre-bunion surgery pair stored away. They fit now and have hardly been worn.We need a crate at our son's in Berkeley for the pup so son was going to try to find us a secondhand one. Turns out they had one stored at his MIL's. Sweet teenage pup can‚Äôt yet be unsupervised. He would also want to get in bed with us without a crate to sleep in and then only he would get sleep!Out of curiosity I added up the coupon/membership/special deals savings for this month's credit card purchases at Vons and CVS. $92.24 makes it worth continuing to do so even though most of our food and paper goods are bought at Trader Joe's which doesn't alter posted prices. We spend more than that on eating out but it is easy to do to save that much.WHAT IS COMING IN NOVEMBER?We will go to Berkeley for our granddaughter's 6th birthday party on November 20th and hubby's 70th birthday on the 21st. We are taking the pup which will make it quite an adventure due to his over the top enthusiasm and energy. We will have a quiet Thanksgiving by ourselves as our local son and DIL are going to her parents.I have club meetings: 11/3 board & 11/10 lunch meeting. I will miss book group & the District meeting and holiday boutique due to our Berkeley trip.¬†Lots of daily life stuff plus dog grooming, haircut, dentist and I'm sure there will be eating out in there - at least I hope so. I'd really like to start serious room by room decluttering & cleaning. If we do sell it will be after the winter holidays so prep will need to happen rather quickly.What is your November looking like?"},

Several lunches with friends, club monthly meeting which was a wonderful performance of Opera and Broadway songs by a professional performer, book club, a lovely dinner out with Hubby, dog park visits with the party pup, lots of books read and more.I flew to Berkeley and spent a long weekend with my son, DIL and granddaughter. Good long talks with my son. Laughs with DIL. Swim lesson observation, working on puzzles, listening to beginner violin practice, picking garden produce, helping a large Amazon box become a ‚Äúkitty (and child) castle and mail station‚Äù, baking a cake and more with granddaughter and family.Yes, those are her mailbox creations. The sign on the front says Kitty as in Kitty Castle but the entry is a girl sized opening. Several hours spent with the 4 of us writing messages and getting them. Eventually the dog and cat got mailboxes set on the top of the box so they could be included.Frugal Things: The usual day to day stuff. My big clothing expenditure was a 6 pack of no show socks from the Jockey outlet store. Used coupons and Von‚Äôs online app to increase our pantry which is pretty stocked now. I bought a few more emergency prep supplies (emergency blankets and headlamps).¬†Our high temps are bouncing around mostly in the 70s with an occasional hotter day so little us of the AC which will hopefully lower the electric bill.Several things do need repairing but hopefully not replacing. Problems with the dishwasher and one shower temp control. We have a good appliance repair person and I just asked for plumber recs so need to get it all booked. Holes from critters in the drip irrigation line but that is the HOA‚Äôs responsibility so they just need reminders to act on it.It also turns out we are not going to make it through the pup's adolescence without some furniture destruction. This happened although we didn't witness it so don't know if he was chewing on a toy right next to it and just moved on over or if he went for it specifically. We'll wait a while and then figure out how to stain it.Experiences and Giving:¬†I spent freely to fly to Berkeley, take us all out to dinner, buy puzzles for my granddaughter, etc. In line with give freely, I bought raffle tickets at our club meeting and won a homemade pumpkin bread. It is quite tasty.Forward motion includes decluttering now done in 10 to 15 minute bursts, planning a club sale at the November district meeting, shifting how I keep the house clean so there are smaller bursts of targeted cleaning instead of the dreaded cleaning day and so on.¬†Engaging Project:¬†We are once again seriously thinking about moving to the Berkeley area as we imagine our lives for the next 10 to 20 years and think we would like very much to be physically closer to family who indeed do want us closer. A big decision. It would give me a big project though!"},

Lots of empty stores, few shoppers and s poor selection in the stores. Back to online shopping and giving the outlet mall in town a serious try.Some frugal things -1. I moved some money around to get a better interest rate.2. Used white vinegar, baking soda and a brush to get rid of some ‚Äúslime‚Äù in the toilet tanks. Love non-toxic low cost cleaning.3. Realized the stack of frozen corn tortillas was aging and made a black bean and corn enchilada casserole which gave us two night‚Äôs dinner.4. More mending of clothes and dog toys.5. Our living room furniture has lasted very well for 20+ years and we still like it. Took a chair seat cushion to have the innards replaced using an upholsterer recommendation from a friend. If I like the result then the big couch seat cushion is next.7. Got a book from a friend at book club and put holds on lots of library books.8. Free outing and social time for pup and Hubby is now going to the dog park for small dogs near us. They both seem to spend more time with the people than the dogs!

But clean them I did.I happened upon the suggestion to look in the toilet tank if your bowl had a ring that wouldn't go away. Apparently the rusty brown growth in our tanks was caused by iron bacteria and must be due to the years of having hard water before we added a water softener. Vinegar, baking soda and a good scrub later it is visibly gone and now I have a new routine task of adding vinegar to the tank every once in a while. The care of our stuff.The day only improved from there although knowing the slime was gone for now is a good thing. And OMG, the heat wave finally broke!!!!I made oatmeal walnut muffins and had one for my morning coffee break. Yum.Picked up new next level of hardness chew toys for the pup who is now 7 months & working hard on getting his molars. He has stronger jaws and lots of adult teeth now. After a long time just looking at & licking the new toy he spent an hour chewing on it until I took it away for a while!Got sidetracked trying out a new Style Visualization mini-course so I could give feedback.

Cal town.Heat waveDrives us indoorsTo chill_________________________After my 3 days of birthday celebration (thanks Hubby, son, DIL and friends) we really hunkered down from mid-morning on this week through the worst of the heat wave. It has been relentless and I can only imagine our electricity bill to come. We are lucky to have ceiling fans, good windows, attic insulation and windows we can close but still and plantation shutters we can close but the AC is running a lot! We aren‚Äôt used to this here.BTW, I‚Äôm doing well with my at least ‚Äúone more use‚Äù for every plastic bag. Produce bags, cereal and frozen waffle liners, toilet paper wrapping, store bags son handed over, etc are all good.The exception is the bags Amazon is now using for shipping. They are too stiff for poop bags and too small for trash. There are actually websites ¬†about what to do with Amazon packaging that suggest using them to store documents or clothes in a waterproof way but that was the only idea. Not something I need and I‚Äôm not shipping things so can‚Äôt reuse them that way.Any ideas?What am I spending our money on? I‚Äôve increased contributions to local food banks and shelters. That is a benefit of watching our spending elsewhere. Food, toiletries and household supplies have finally skyrocketed here and people are struggling. The electricity bills resulting from this heat wave will be another blow for many.My frugal five this week:1. Laundry and dishes before dawn! I do try to do this anyway to catch the low electricity rate window and stress the grid less, but I really didn't want extra heat in the house.2. We made dinners like¬†pasta with stir fried shrimp and fresh veggies,¬†tuna chef salad and garlic bread,¬†omelet with Canadian bacon and green beans on the side.¬†Less fuel used, less heat in the house, using what we have on hand.3. Trying to only use the library system and did enroll in kindle unlimited after thinking I wouldn‚Äôt.4. Before the 10 day-ish heat wave hit, we received an email from S. Cal Edison regarding how to help reduce grid strain. I implemented some of the ideas I hadn't been doing like charging everything in the morning and turning off the desktop computer before lunch both to get the lowest rate and stop those uses before grid stress increased with the heat.5. Future frugal planning: After grocery shopping this Wednesday morning and seeing the current price differences between regular discounts and digital coupon discounts, I finally downloaded the store app. I‚Äôll be using it going forward."},

Plastic bags! We have to bag our trash in plastic bags which seems wasteful but protects the workers. Poop bags are necessary too. I‚Äôm making an effort to use every plastic bag that comes into our life for trash/poop purposes. The LLBean packaging from my slipper order & the plastic grocery bags left by older son after last visit = kitchen trash bags. Bread, produce, toilet paper or waffle bags = poop bags. I did finally find the right size trash bags for a high price at CVS and used a 30% off coupon to stock up for 3 months.2. The plantation shutters in the dining room lost a connecting wire but Hubby found it, watched some YouTubes for solutions and fixed it.3. Used all of our ceiling fans to help the AC run as little as possible during our heatwave which continues into the middle of next week.4. Served pasta salad with lots of veggies, tuna salad and leftover cornbread the night son and DIL arrived. Easy to flex as they were driving from LA airport at rush hour. Also frugal and used up raw veggie bits.5. I really cleaned up our patio including removing or pruning plants. I cut a couple pieces off the succulent we like and am trying to turn them into two more plants to fill the bed.Frugal Fail: ¬†Found close to Trader Joe‚Äôs an environmentally sound (recycles water) local car wash that also cleans the car interior. $22.95 plus tip later my car was sparkling clean for the first time in many months. Next time the weather will be cooler and I‚Äôll do the inside and go to the $8.95 one a bit further away. The drought means we can‚Äôt wash it ourselves as we have almost always done."},

So here are mine with an emphasis on being frugal so as to not waste resources or stress the environment even more.1. Monitoring the outdoor temp and opening windows and turning on ceiling fans as soon as it is cooler outside than inside so AC is not used. Also opening in the morning. The grid is stressed enough.2. Used up cornmeal son and DIL gave us as they are off traveling soon for 2 or 3 months by making cornbread. Serving with leftover homemade chicken and lentil soup and salads.3. Mending again ¬†- this time another tear in a dog toy and a sheet hem come undone.4. Neighbors offered to take our two large trash items to the large item trash disposal tomorrow. Just a wood cutting board that has cracked and the old top dishwasher rack. The bottom rack is still on back order due to supply chain issues. One less car idling in line saves us gas and the environment emissions. No extra trash disposal fee.5.

Last night he was up at 2am to go pee and then crashed on the couch with me.¬†His eating pattern is also off and he has been unhappy each time I've put him in his crate so I could go somewhere. The funniest thing was when he sneaked into the garage without me seeing him do it and I shut him in there. He DID NOT LIKE being by himself in there and hasn't been trying to get out there again.But boy did he enjoy all the action in our house last week. I've never had such a social dog. I need to play with him this afternoon in hopes of wearing him out before bedtime.Today's minimum to do list in addition to the daily tasks: (strikethrough means done!!!)ExerciseClean kitchenDustMake club phone callsPrep email to club membersWater flowerbedsFinish mendingMake chicken lentil soup (veggie scrap broth already done)Practice dog training assignmentPick up Hubby at train stationBonus to do's:Self manicureDog bathClean patioFile club paperwork/scan as needed"},

We had our train the humans first session for our dog manners and basic commands class. Next Saturday we take the dog to an outdoor group class. Our pup is now an ‚Äúadolescent‚Äù and we want him to be as well behaved through that phase as possible. He responds well to training so our consistency is the critical element. It is interesting that now they recommend waiting to neuter a male dog until they are a year old as it reduces the likelihood of hip dysplasia and a type of cancer. We‚Äôll have to see how he behaves month to month as there are signals to do it sooner.3. Our one burner propane stove arrived and will be part of our emergency prep supplies. Also received two more plug in emergency lights to replace old ones. The old one that still works went in the garage.4. Bought a pair of Clark‚Äôs sport sandals on sale and they are so comfy! My others are well worn but still usable.5. Unfortunately Hubby has to have a root canal plus two possible crowns and I had to replace my upper retainer. I had recently gotten two crowns and replaced the other retainer. This is a summer of dental work but our health has been good otherwise.6. Fortunately after his root canal Hubby felt well enough to go on his scheduled discovery flight in a single engine Cessna.

Not freaked out about anything.He has never been on a leash before but we have managed about 8 walks with him doing ok. And 2 accidents in the house but it is early days yet with lots of change today in his life.He is so cute and funny and won't be a puppy forever. Anticipating he will be about 22 pounds when full grown. We are going to sign up for puppy school that starts July 9th and try to get some basic training in before then.¬†¬†Thanks for the comments about the care our county provides stray/lost/surrendered animals. It is amazing and the animals diverse. In addition, when there are serious wildfires they set up a shelter at the county fairgrounds (right by the ocean) for all evacuated animals from horses and goats to chickens and more.There are dogs available for adoption right now - they just don't fit us at this time although there is still one we would like if he recovers from parvo and is back to being available.Our last lovely dog was a 1 1/2 year old mini-poodle who was traumatized from abuse when we got her. She turned into a happy, well adjusted dog but it was a lot of work. She developed Addison's disease at 3 1/2 and we were able to keep her healthy by managing that disease for the next 9 years until kidney disease did her in. We were happy to do all that, but not wanting to start that way again.Secondly, we want a companion dog that is between 10 and 25 pounds full grown. We do not want a very elderly dog as our loss is too recent. The shelter has lots of little dogs available that don't fit what we want (chihuahuas and terriers) and lots of big or harder too manage dogs (pit bulls, shepherds, lab mixes, dobermans) plus a few elderly or chronically ill dogs. The types we want go very quickly and don't show up often.I have found a close by business that focuses on cavapoo and goldendoodle puppies of various sizes and reached out to them yesterday. Hoping to hear back today. They presently have two 4 month old cavapoos of different sizes who didn't find homes quickly for a now fixed health problem in one case and an underbite in the other case. Four months is easier than 8 weeks for a puppy! If that doesn't work out we will look at the new puppies and find one to reserve.Crossing fingers and hoping we are making a good decision!"},

June started by feeling like summer and so far just a few June Gloom days interspersed so far.New season, new beginnings.1) We are trying to adopt a dog from the shelter and have struck out on 2 and based on discussion with the staff are waiting for 2 to become available. You have to sign up for them online and be the first person to do so once they are adoptable. I'm sure it will work out eventually and have come to really respect how the county has built and staffed the no kill shelter. The animals are really taken care of well and great effort made to place them in a good situation for their particular temperament and needs if they can't get back to their family. I knew they had dogs, cats and rabbits galore but they also have everything from birds to chinchillas to turtles and more.2) I actually made a menu plan of sorts given all the food we were gifted including bits and bobs of things. Then our neighbors begged us to take some frozen dinners. They will be emergency back up as they aren't our preferred type of food, but serve that purpose well.We finished the gifted crackers and made a big dent in the coffee beans. I might have finished the chocolate too! I did throw out a few things we decided we wouldn't eat.These are recent meals using gifted or silent auction foods (underlined). I also made cranberry¬†pumpkin pecan muffins.* roast turkey slices, sweet potato, Waldorf salad* beef¬†tostados with avocado* tilapia, coleslaw, garlic bread¬†- twice* pork chop,¬†summer squash, beansWe also had -* stir fry tofu and vegetables over rice* green lentil, tomato and carrot soup with green salad (lots went into the freezer)* \"doctored up\" frozen pizza* turkey burgers, sauteed onions & mushrooms, coleslaw, cantaloupe3) We finished cleaning more than half our windows, shutters & screens and all ceiling fans. Woo hoo!4) I decided to take a different approach to my Summer capsule wardrobe after buying 2 dresses and . I don't mind wearing outfits on repeat so I imagined 18 outfits that suit my current lifestyle and expected weather variations over the summer months. I've worn 6 that I like so far - 5 that are suitable for being out & about; 1 for at home/taking a walk - and tried 3 that I won't repeat. It is getting warmer so others will come into play soon.5) I resumed monthly donations to causes I want to support : this month it‚Äôs public radio/tv and the county food bank as well as our granddaughter‚Äôs college fund.6) Working with 2 others the club office and storage rooms were vastly decluttering and rearranged after sitting idle for over two years. We ended up tossing lots of things and wondering why things were kept for decades or at all.7) I began the work to get a crown with another one to go after this is done.

{"title": "More Out Than In", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2022", "text": "No, I'm not talking about our social life or cash flow! I'm talking about the perpetual need to declutter, minimize, manage household inventory or whatever you call it.I am resolute that we send at least as much out the door as comes in unless consumable lol. In the 5 years since we moved here we have acquired a fair amount which is not surprising considering how we minimized so as to have less to move. Still, it adds up and lives in cleaning/organizing chores, in visual clutter or too many decisions to make.In addition to going through storage areas that are frustrating to me because they house things never used or are cluttered, I've also come up with some key questions to ask in different situations.For example, our lovely maple cutting block has developed cracks and warped which makes it both potentially unsanitary and frustrating to use as it wobbles. Our instant thought was to shop for a similar new one but in the meantime I pulled out a smaller pressed wood one that we rarely use. Some research showed that type never cracks and rarely warps but if it does it can be fixed easily most of the time. So it seems we already have something we can \"use instead\" so now we just have to figure out how to dispose of a heavy hunk of maple.I'm finding the \"What can I use instead?\" question be one of the most useful to ask before replacing something or adding something new.¬†Another question that is helping right now is \"Would I buy it again?\" which has been particularly helpful with my less loved or worn clothes. In the case of a pair of shoes that were hurting my feet, the answer was yes and I ordered the same ones. In the case of a few tops that I have never reached for first, the answer was no and they went to the thrift store without being replaced or were cut into rags if too worn for that.And then there is¬†\"Would any one be happy if I gave it to them or kept it for later?\" which is most helpful for those things you feel you should keep but don't use or put out to enjoy. I have a trio of those right now all antiques that might work for stage props or delight just the right person but I don't want to look at or care for them anymore.¬†How do you approach the ongoing editing of belongings?"},

Throw in a get-away and an amazing art museum special exhibit plus some restaurant meals and nice warm weather - Wow, its been quite a while since all that came together.I mentioned that we were going to Santa Barbara to see an art exhibit and have dinner with our son and DIL. We also walked out on the wharf, had a bit of a walk down the newish pedestrian streetscape on part of State Street and enjoyed a great breakfast at the B&B. It felt both weird and wonderful after the past 2 years.The art exhibit,¬†Through Vincent's Eyes: Van Gogh and His Sources, had a few marvelous Van Gogh paintings plus work of 60 other artist's who influenced him or were contemporaries. It started with how the ink illustrations in the Dicken's books he read as a child influenced his early drawings and went from there. An art history lesson with original art!The highlight was of course this painting.I also really liked this one by a different artist and it reminded me of the Depression Era public works murals. The frames are marvelous too. This was the only exhibit I have ever attended where you could take photos as long as you didn't use a flash - so I did.We would definitely go back to see other exhibits and it is only an hour's drive so we wouldn't have to stay over.¬†The bonus for that week was our Son and DIL stayed over on there way up to there dog sitting gig and also Mother's Day weekend on their way back.This past week was all about my club's monthly meeting where we awarded four $1500 scholarships and installed our new board. Three of the four local high school seniors receiving scholarships were able to attend and bring parents and/or sisters as their guests. What busy and accomplished young women and men!¬†Otherwise, just enjoying sitting out on our tiny patio, taking walks, a trip to the Ventura Pier and boardwalk for lunch, and reading as usual.Hope your May is going well so far.

Quite mild though with tiredness and sore arm the main reactions and just for a short time. I am quite grateful for the vaccine regardless!¬†Btw, I also went with the Pfizer booster because there is some medical evidence that switching types is more effective in triggering protection. I don‚Äôt believe that is definitive although the pharmacist agreed it might be the case. Pfizer is also the version most readily available right now where I live and it was easy to get close by.In recording this booster in my log of vaccines I noticed that it will be 10 years in October since I last got the tdap vaccine so I double checked if that was still the right timeframe and it is. Interestingly, the pharmacist brought up the exception that if I was going to be around a pregnant person or newborn a lot the timeframe was shorter.¬†I didn‚Äôt know that but as far as I know there are no plans for further grandchildren so it will be flu shot in September and tdap in October. Then, other than annual flu shots and any further Covid boosters, I am good until 2027 when a pneumonia booster is called for."},

I‚Äôll let you know if I feel the same way after we drive to and from Berkeley.And the ophthalmologist says my eye that was treated for dry macular degeneration has regenerated some. No more treatments right now.¬†Wow, those last two items make me feel like the old person who only talks about their health!Onward to my March round up:¬†I accomplished some of my March intentions before hurting my back slowed me down considerably.Tried some new recipes to break up the routine, went to a live concert, bought tulips for the table and went out to lunch with friends twice.Reduced the number of days I had alcohol and did really well at making sure I ate my vitamin C and had 5 veggies a day. Still room for improvement on making sure snacks are healthy and limiting the calories in them. Late afternoon is my downfall as I think it is for many people.I started March with lots of exercise and finished it with Tylenol, Ibuprofen and the chiropractor.¬†We got some home improvement and maintenance done which was great.April Intentions:* Spend a week on trip to visit Berkeley based family* Spend time IRL with friends* Carefully restart exercising with both stretching/Pilates and walking. Goal is to do both daily by end of month.* Reduce digital time and replace with going out and about, drawing, time with friends or long distance connecting, etc.* Work on healthy snacks in afternoon and other strategies to get me past my energy slump.* Create a Spring & Summer bucket list and/or reading list"},
{"title": "\"A House is a Hungry Thing\" and our thoughts on living here ", "date": "Sunday, March 27, 2022", "text": "We are now at the ‚Äúbest laid plans of mice and men often go awry‚Äù stage of living here and can‚Äôt blame it totally on the pandemic.When we moved 5 years ago we thought we would likely be here three years or maybe a bit more and then move again after my FILs death. He died sooner sadly and we made an effort to find a place in the Berkeley area but didn‚Äôt work that out. Then the pandemic hit and we hunkered down here and that was ok as this was a nice place to get through that.Now we are picking our heads up from pandemic inertia and realizing we have not made an intentional decision about where to live the next part of our lives. Also we are realizing that inertia is a powerful force when there is not a goal to move towards. We are chatting a bit about what we each want going forward but a long ‚Äúthink‚Äù is yet to come!In the meantime any house and home does need maintenance and I‚Äôve had a burst of energy in that area as the reality that we are still here and probably will be for some time has sunk in. So we have been checking off things that are easy to delay in the best of times and extremely easy to delay during a pandemic. Many years ago I had a co-worker who said her European MIL called a house a very hungry thing and I love that image because it is so apt! Houses eat up our time and money not to mention space in our brain.As mentioned, we have converted 27 recessed ceiling lights to LEDs on dimmers plus put LED bulbs in the 4 of the 6 remaining recessed ceiling lights and about half the remaining lights and fixtures. That leaves more lights to do including odd ceiling fixtures, bathroom recessed lights, garage lights, closet lighting, etc. We have also considered installing solar panels but not seriously and will see how the new lights plus time of use billing plays out. We would also have to factor in when our roof is scheduled for routine replacement by the HOA and if our next car will be a hybrid that needs charging.Our carpeted areas were pretty dirty between us and our dog these past two years. I had those cleaned plus the dog's favorite sofa and chair. More furniture could probably benefit from cleaning as could a large area rug but I only have so much interest in cleaning even if I‚Äôm not doing it!We noticed the stucco at the base of our front door and entry walls was falling off and that is the HOAs responsibility. I turned in a maintenance request and they have shown up and fixed it! They have been very short staffed due to the pandemic and it wasn‚Äôt urgent so I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the work was done. It looks great.So I‚Äôm on a roll with taking care of the house and have the next 2 or 3 priorities defined. We need to clean the windows and screens which is an annoying job but we do it ourselves. Just have to get started. Another high priority is replacing the cushion inserts in my favorite chair‚Äôs seat to restore its comfort level after 25 years of use.I do think something more enjoyable also needs to be on the list though. I really enjoyed framing and hanging some of my art and one should enjoy their home not only have it working well. I will have to brainstorm on that.Do you have any projects ¬†lined up to help you enjoy where you are living?"},

All for joining the¬†Studio Channel Islands¬†which is both an art gallery and artist studios in an old elementary school campus.It dawned on me to see a chiropractor for my back and I was able to get a same day appointment.

Also hopefully it will include a visit to the SB art museum to see their current special exhibit. I am going to purchase a membership and try to get tickets.The concert at the local art gallery was part of our new membership there. We used to go to events in that space and it was nice to be back doing that.The fundraiser is the offering of a fellow club board member to raise money to help child victims of violence or abuse attend summer camp.On March 19, 2020 California declared a statewide stay at home order.

Sadly I am very hungry when I wake up but I don't eat after dinner at least.- Watch portion size - Yes!- Drink more water. I have read that drinking a cup of water and waiting 10 to 20 minutes will take away most urges to snack. A good reminder.Eating out is a challenge in some cases. We are taking Hubby's 93 year old aunt out for lunch tomorrow and the deli menu is high calorie, high fat, high sodium, etc. However they do serve breakfast all day so I am thinking 2 eggs over easy, rye toast and fresh fruit is the answer. Not that I don't like all their less healthy choices lol.We finally received notice that our Federal tax return was delivered by USPS but no word on the state return. I have to go to the post office to see if they can track it or if I need to resend.¬†I hurt my lower back in the middle of last week doing a different Pilates video and it has really affected how much I can exercise. However, I have been doing a bit and trying to get the lower back muscles to relax. This too will pass.However, we teamed up to finally wash and clean our car. I still need to vacuum once my back is better but I did the rest of the interior cleaning and am enjoying the results. Hubby washed it per our usual division of labor as I can't reach the middle of the roof without a step stool. Next up are all the windows and doors inside and out.Our county's COVID death and hospitalization rate has really dropped which is encouraging as we have tickets to a concert in the gallery this Friday at the local artist's studio housed in an old elementary school. The tickets are a perk of studio membership and we will feel quite free to leave if it is too crowded but I am looking forward to live music.Family visits - yeah! Our local son and DIL came out for lunch and a visit last Friday and we are going to join them in Santa Barbara at the beginning of May.

My Mom was diligent about making sure we had orange juice or grapefruit every morning. Me not so much.5 a day: I was already pretty good at the two fruit and 3 or more veggie servings a day, but now even better as I am consciously thinking about it.Healthy snacks or none: This is a tough one in the afternoon but I think I am making progress. Late afternoon is when I crave carbs which are ok in moderation but easy to overdo. Taking a walk some days around that time is helping so I think that needs to be my focus.Reduce added sugar: The main sources for me adding sugar were maple syrup on waffles and honey in tea. I've done ok so far at this but not great.Less alcohol: Pretty good but room for improvement. Hubby had initially joined me on this but is back to a moderate level of beer drinking so there is always something around.

There were several gyms for weight machine workouts, Pilates, yoga and swimming plus physical therapy and walking.

So, it is DIY time and dredging up memories of how the trainers created my programs. Then I will go up a step when these become easy or not effective.I think I have landed on the right mix for me for the rest of March which is the first month I am seriously sticking with this. It has taken some trial and error the first week which showed me my current limits or starting point that sill enable progress but won't discourage me.¬†Here is where I have landed for exercise. I'm trying for 3 Pilates and 3 stretching sessions per week. After each I will do a few shoulder PT exercises.

It won‚Äôt be quick so it has to be steady and incremental. Been there and done that before, Right now it is Pilates and serious stretching. Walking a lot will have to wait a bit.Today I started with 30 minutes of barre exercises, cleaned out one side of the pantry and reorganizing it a bit, did two loads of laundry, changed the bed and pruned a very overgrown spreading plant on our little patio. I‚Äôm tired but managed to make the coleslaw for dinner and am now going to start the rice. Hubby will cook the chicken.We also sat in front of the computer together and did our federal and state taxes on TurboTax which took quite a while as Hubby hasn‚Äôt been paying as much attention to finances and past tax returns as I have. So I had him do the entry and answered his questions as we went.¬†Good news is we got refunds on both tax returns and applied them to our estimated taxes for this year. Bad news is e-file didn‚Äôt work as last year‚Äôs federal return is still in their pile of undone work. So tomorrow I get to solve that problem probably by mailing in the returns so the federal one can add to the pile of unprocessed returns.

Moderate ¬†cost and healthy using frozen trout from Trader Joe‚Äôs, spinach and mixed greens with red pepper, tomatoes and a bit of avocado, and microwaving a sweet potato.I was able to have the second laser treatment for the eye that has early dry macular degeneration.

Having realized that I can start finding ways to reduce it. One way is to find more outlets for my creativity and problem solving strengths in combination since I truly enjoy that. I decided I wanted to do something with a stack of printed our recipes and made a recipe binder using a photo of an old painting, a 3 ring binder I had and those sheet protectors I was going to donate. Now to come up with a solution for tabbed dividers that is creative.I'm trying to be thankful that we have the financial reserves to cover the lack of property insurance for the exterior of our condo.

I moved the occasional use items to a less convenient drawer and it has made a difference not having to sort through so much each t8me I reach for something. I‚Äôve now applied the same principle to my sewing/mending supplies and it worked again. No decluttering the things now organized by frequency of use makes my life simpler.On the other hand I was pulling out some manila envelopes to organize our fire safe paperwork when I saw that I had saved a big pile of sheet protector pages although I rarely need one. All but a small number went into the donation pile.It seems that for me this combination approach along with revisiting how much ‚Äúinventory‚Äù we want to keep on hand is the way to go. Some of our stocking up during the pandemic has left too many items stored and that is going to change too.How are you managing your ‚Äústuff‚Äù at this point in your life to ensure that it isn‚Äôt increasing your mental and physical workload?

Anyone else eat the wrong things or too much when stressed? Well I do and my weight gain this past week shows it. \"Movement\" in the wrong direction!On the other hand I know I have to be kind to myself when in a stressful situation. Early last week was dealing with the rapid decline of our dog and then her death and the sadness afterwards. Carbs in too large a quantity called my name.¬†I decided to take advantage of our very warm weather and took walk first thing in the morning starting the day after my dog died. It is a good stress reliever. Friday, although I was feeling even sadder, I took my morning walk and ran into someone I like who I hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time. We chatted for quite a while and other people stopped to talk too. I got to pet a few dogs.¬†Also on Friday Hubby and I went to a small art gallery here and saw some interesting and amazing art which was very enjoyable. We were the only ones in the gallery. While there I picked up the form to join the organization which I have been meaning to do for a long time. Then we walked down to Mr. Frosty for swirl cones.Saturday we drove quite a way to Hubby‚Äôs elderly aunt‚Äôs assisted living facility and had lunch outside so we could visit safely. We hadn‚Äôt seen her in quite a while and she is a gem so that was lovely too.The other uplifting thing that happened was that we were able to donate our dog‚Äôs prescription food and doggie diapers to the animal shelter and some other supplies to a cousin on a limited budget. Too soon to even contemplate whether or not we want to get another dog, but the easily replaceable or illness specific items can go to new homes where they can be used and appreciated.So this past week was a fail for physical wellness, but the focus on emotional well being paid off in less stress. I hope everyone is also being kind to themselves whether they are having a great week or a difficult one."},

I will miss you and remember you.", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2022", "text": "I am starting my first day without my little dog companion of 11+ years and feeling both very sad and sure that we did the right thing for her. So what was her story?When we lived in Atlanta I had a favorite coffee roaster and coffeehouse I could walk to. Loved that place. They had a community bulletin board and one day I saw a picture of a sad looking little poodle with info saying she was a rescue in need of the right home. We hadn‚Äôt had a dog for 7 or 8 years at that point but I tore off the phone number and took it home only to throw it out. Repeated this a few times until my husband finally said ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just call?‚ÄùThe next day we went to her foster home (which became her boarding home when we traveled and she sure did love that family). We met ¬†a very scared little 1 1/2 year old dog who couldn‚Äôt stop shaking as she sat on the couch between us. She had a sad backstory and had come a long way in her foster home and they had turned down about 15 potential adopters trying to do the right placement for her. Hubby asked if we could come back the next day and see if she had any interest in us and she did. It was a match.Start of a mutual love story, the blossoming of a dog who was very sweet and gentle but still recovering from being abused, and lots of adventures together that are fun to remember. She loved baths but hated the rain hitting her body, loved her stuffed and squeaky toys, loved walks with good things to sniff, loved her people, loved to \"bake\" on the hot pavement, and loved looking out the front window at our home in Atlanta. A friend called the latter \"Lola TV\".She developed Addison‚Äôs disease 2 years after we got her and a great vet diagnosed it before it was too late. Same with her kidney disease that was diagnosed in 2020. She made it to 12 years and 8 months of a mostly happy life and as our much loved little companion with a big personality and a gentle heart."},
{"title": "Wellness Sunday: Moving forward for health & happiness", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2022", "text": "MOVEMENTForward with a look back to find wellness destinationsI'm joining my friend Leslie who blogs at Once Upon a Time and Happily Ever After¬†to set and move forward on some priority Wellness Goals for the rest of the year.¬†I asked for help finding a word for the year that fit and was meaningful. A great suggestion was¬†\"movement\"¬†and I am trying that out with these goals and with the image above which was taken years ago right before we took a hot air balloon ride in Aspen. The sensation of joyful movement I experienced on that ride is the type of emotional wellness I would like to recreate.After my January insights about how my personality based habits were impacting my ability to move forward, I spent some time trying to think about it differently.Then I spent some time listing what I liked about my wellness in the past in terms of physical, mental and emotional well being. The second step was brainstorming how I could regain some of those things in my current circumstances. So here goes!____________________________________________________________First up was that I liked having a Pilates body that was also shaped by walking hills and stairs a lot. The outdoor walks were in an interesting, beautiful area where there were things to see and/or destinations like a great coffee shop. It also truly was a case of walking uphill both ways due to the terrain, lots of stairs in our home and lots of very physical yard work. I let all that go after moving 5 years ago to a single story home with no yard in a flat area with no nearby interesting destinations, but this is not the first time I have had to remake my physical health and exercise habits.¬†I broke it down with allowance for still recovering a bit from foot surgery, living in an uninspiring walking area (boredom reigns), and being both out of shape and heavier than I want to be.¬†1. Start Pilates again.¬†I can't work with a trainer at a studio (thanks COVID) but there are great resources online. I found a 25 minute standing beginner workout that is perfect for right now at The Girl with a Pilates Mat. I looked it up and two to three times a week is a good starting point. I'll send her a donation at the beginning of each month to pay for my classes.2. Take one or two Challenge Walks each week. Work on distance, speed and climbing (hills/stairs).I will walk where there are hills or stairs or balance challenges and drive to a starting point if needed. I brainstormed some ideas and came up with mall walking (stairs), a walk to the closest Starbucks or deli, a walk to a nearby park, and walking the very uneven Ventura pier. I'm going to see what may work for me. Then I'll look into any trails or other walking routes that may be nearby once I am more fit.3. Cut way back on alcohol.¬†I didn't drink at all for at least 2 years after coming back from a previous health crisis and then only very occasionally for several years after than. Like many, during the pandemic I have gotten in the habit of a drink before dinner basically every day. I don't need the calories and my liver and sleep patterns would certainly benefit from less imbibing. Starting with February being a very limited alcohol month.____________________________________________________________Secondly, I really liked having more mental stimulation and sharing it with people with whom I could be fully myself.¬†This one is much harder for me to visualize and operationalize.We used to go to a world class art museum, lots of small live theater, outdoor art shows or walks. We went out to eat regularly with Thai food being one of our favorites. I was a member of a very interesting book club that also had parties and took weekend trips together. I took lots of art classes. I had a close friend with whom I could talk about anything.¬†Then we moved to a very suburban area where I had no connections and just as I was finding some of these things the pandemic hit. I do have some nice local friends who I enjoy and who are great emotional support, but not that feel free to bare your soul type of best friend one.¬†I am determined though that staying healthy and getting stimulation can't be mutually exclusive despite the challenges of COVID.1. Take full advantage of the local artists' studio and all their exhibits and events.¬†Look into becoming a member and perhaps volunteering in some way. Find any other art exhibits in the area.2. Find a way to spend time making art again.Try¬†drawing a series of pictures with a theme. Perhaps try a class with one of the artists from the art studios. I know there is a figure drawing workshop, glass art and I'm sure many others.3.¬†Read what I really enjoy and write reviews of it.¬†Period or other location mysteries anyone? Victorian, WWI or WWII. Paris, London, etc. Go to the small local bookstore and see what they have.¬†4. Figuring out how to increase the types of friendship connections I crave.¬†Who might I have met or meet who could be a kindred spirit? How can I get together with people to deepen connections during this endless pandemic?"},

I‚Äôve been unable to figure out the interaction of the two companies in terms of how we are charged despite having a Ph.D. and an affinity for math and complicated information. However I admit to a lack of interest in spending a lot of time on something that should be communicated so that it is easy to understand.¬†So I used the inaccurate comparison tool to pick the best time of use plan and went with it. They all have higher rates from 4 to 9 pm so that part is a wash. We will run the dishwasher and do laundry at low rate time but everything else pretty much is time independent or weather dependent although we could adjust the thermostat a bit more perhaps. We‚Äôll see if it lowers our energy use and/or our energy cost.We already improved our attic insulation and dealt with drafty windows and doors so no further gains to be had there.I also got out the dishwasher, washing machine and dryer manuals and looked for possible setting changes to conserve energy. Made a few setting changes and again we shall see what happens.It is also time to reschedule the electrician to come and replace more incandescent ceiling can lights with LED fixtures as the Covid infection rate is dropping and we have bought better masks so I feel comfortable having them in our home working.We aren‚Äôt faced with the difficult choices I understand many European‚Äôs are having to make given the greatly increased cost of heating, etc. there but I would like to be a good steward of natural resources and our own resources.Have you made any changes to reduce your energy use as prices have risen?

My foot was a bit swollen after but not bad. Also checked off a few of my tech and home to dos, and had a fun outing to the Ventura pier.I only bought two kindle books instead mostly relying on the local library, its digital partner libraries and sharing by friends. Late last year my library more than doubled the number of other libraries from which you can check out digital books, so although it takes time to check all 9 partner library websites, it is a great resource. Since I only end up liking and finishing about half the books I start, not buying many of them is useful.I bought 3 items and decluttered about 35. ¬†Purchases were a new addition to the house (small single step folding stool) and replacement sets of measuring cups and spoons. That's it.We got takeout twice and thoroughly enjoyed not cooking dinner.I think it was an ok month and it certainly highlighted some things I need to change to shake off my pandemic ennui."},

Part of the challenge is that Hubby can't let go of any hobby items even if they aren't used for 20+ years. Ya never know ...So half the closet will be devoted to his hobby history and some to storing the suitcases and an air bed. I'll have to see what is left that I can remove.This has led me to wonder if I can declutter 2000 non-consumable items from our home this year and personally bring in fewer than 22. Hmmm.I also read last year about the idea of visual clutter bothering some people and for sure it does me. So I‚Äôve been putting things behind closed doors to decide about later. It also makes cleaning a bit easier and there is always a lot of dust here probably due to the farming not very far away.The concept of resetting your home also appeals to me but I am taking it slowly as I want to do one or two spaces at a time and clean thoroughly at the same time. To start that means my office with some time on the small bedroom closet too. One very visible space and one closed door storage space.So far I‚Äôve found 29 items to remove and am clearing my office of visual clutter and rethinking what I want to have in there yet again.

She continues to lose weight so we are enjoying each day that she is happy and comfortable.- I got the electrician booked to do some home improvement work in mid-January (installing LED recessed lights in more rooms to replace conventional ones)- All is calm and healthy in my family - thankful and hoping it continues for a long time."},

Plenty of space and masking is expected.- Attending another club's event did not feel safe. Despite the county & state mask mandates plus most attendees having age as a risk factor plus probably others, only my friends and I put our masks on after eating. We we were sitting together and although we felt fine driving over in a car together unmasked because we know we all are vaccinated and boosted and wear masks out and about, we did not feel especially safe at this gathering.¬†- The ophthamologist's waiting room was too full for comfort but at least everyone was masked correctly.- Our club book group met at a member's home for brunch and I was somewhat comfortable again because I know everyone is vaccinated and careful. I won‚Äôt do something like that again though until we see what Omicron is going to do here.By Friday I had exceeded my limit of exposure to others tolerance for the week and skipped another library event and just had a close friend over for coffee instead.¬†Starting Saturday, we are only going out as absolutely necessary to have 12 days of very limited exposure before visiting our son and his family. They are all vaccinated as much as possible including the 5 year old so I'm not concerned about them exposing me but since I have been out so much I don't want to expose them.That means I turned down an invitation to have Christmas dinner with friends and have no plans to do anything with others before we leave to visit our family.¬†Going forward I expect I am going to skip gatherings with food/drink service unless I know for sure everyone is vaccinated. Even then I may not attend for the next few months if the Omicron variant does turn out to be ‚Äúas contagious as measles‚Äù as one article I read quoted. Measles are one of the most contagious viruses out there.¬†I‚Äôll be looking for more library activities and invite one or two of our local family or our closest friends at a time to our home until it is warm enough to sit outside at a restaurant again. I will consider going to a couple of local art galleries and to the local live theater that requires proof of vaccination once this Covid wave subsides.¬†Otherwise it will be walks, take out restaurant dinners, scenic drives, etc. that will be possible given my risk tolerance right now.Are you seeing a clear path forward for yourself for the couple of months after the holidays?"},

A habit I will continue.This week‚Äôs list:- I bought our old dog a couple of sweaters to wear on colder days because she is so thin, as is her hair, and our house stays rather cool no matter the thermostat setting. Doesn't she look pretty in pink?- The first email I opened Monday morning included a photo of our granddaughter proudly showing off her first lost baby tooth smile. I had been wondering when this would happen!¬†- It rained heavily Monday night and Tuesday. Then we had light steady rain Thursday. Not a big deal many places but in California right now it is.- Spending time with four friends driving to and from a meeting. Seeing three of the same friends the next day at an author presentation by one person‚Äôs husband. And then a total of ten of us at a friend‚Äôs home for a holiday book club brunch. A friend came over for morning coffee and a chat. Got my social needs well filled this week.- I took bookmarks as gifts for book club as did someone else. Another gave homemade holiday ornaments, plus others gave little bags of candy and soap. Nobody expected anything but I know I wanted to show how much these women have sustained me these past 2 years and others did too.- I am slightly encouraged by the data coming out of S. Africa that so far shows the Omicron Covid variation to be highly infectious but less likely to cause serious illness or death. Doesn't prove how it will act in the US but looks like a glimmer of hope."},

I got an immediate response and we are back in contact. I am very thankful she and all her family are all well.- I helped pack donated homemade cookies for my club‚Äôs cookie sale. I made chocolate crinkle cookies and we ended up with a big variety.- I got all my Christmas cards in the mail. And I gave some of the club sale cookies to a neighbor.- Our older son and DIL will be at her parents for Christmas so brought us our present early. It is perfect. 4 kinds of homemade frozen waffles (blueberry, eggnog, cornmeal, pumpkin) and two unusual syrups (apple cider and coffee infused maple). I think they will be a month of Sunday morning waffles.- At our club meeting we talked about holiday traditions and sang holiday songs which triggered some memories that haven‚Äôt surfaced in a long time. Especially fun was remembering the year my church youth group went caroling on a cold snowy Illinois evening.- Grateful for the dog groomer who is so kind and gentle. When I went to pick up the dog she was walking around the grooming area all relaxed and just hanging out with her friends.

So fortunate.- I'm carefully considering my \"winter\" wardrobe and only keeping what fits my current lifestyle and body really well, is modern and versatile and lets me have great for me colors near my face. Happy so far.- Once again I'm delighted to have silk undershirts so I don't have to layer up so heavily in our house while keeping the heat temp down.¬†- I treated myself to coffee and a donut at the library caf√© and sat outside reading for a while.- My brother called and we had a nice chat including reminiscing some about where we grew up and our parents.- I decided to send Christmas/holiday cards this year and found non-religious ones I really like. A fun winter scene on the front and inside is says \"The world's a merrier place because of you!\" I think they are perfect.

{"title": "Thoughts about 2021 and 2022", "date": "Thursday, December 2, 2021", "text": "I‚Äôm sitting here early in the morning with my little dog curled up tight and asleep snuggled against me having my first cup of coffee. It is very quiet but then it usually is where I live. It is totally fogged in outside and still dark. I‚Äôm warm and relaxed though and I try to keep these kind of things in mind when I‚Äôm not so content.2021 is almost over and while I‚Äôm not wishing it gone faster than it will be it has been difficult in some way for almost everyone and in very horrible ways for the world. So I am very thankful to simply be here still.That feeling doesn‚Äôt make for happy hours and days though so I‚Äôm going to say that for me 2021 was simply ok. Not great, not horrible - just ok overall.I‚Äôd like to improve on that when I end up rating 2022. So here are my thoughts on how to do so given what is in my control or ability to influence.¬†I sure can't control the pandemic, other people's behavior/choices, many aspects of my/other's health, the weather and so on. But I can control my own behavior to an extent (I still will be me for better and worse lol).¬†So here goes my hopes for change in 2022 by changing the way I behave and my choices.- I really want to spend more time with my immediate family. I may have to do that by myself since for both of us to go means managing the dog coming too or not leaving her long. With one car it is a challenge but there is the train or I could suck it up and fly. Have to think on this.- I want to resume more activities that I enjoy.¬†I have found one local live theater that is open again plus an art gallery. Nearby is one small art museum I enjoyed before. There must be more that has restarted safely.- I want to make at least one more good local friend. I‚Äôm lonely and too reliant on a couple of friends, but then aren‚Äôt so many during the pandemic and otherwise. Need to think on what I can do within my Covid comfort level.- I want to learn something. I need to get back to OLLI classes preferable in-person so I can meet more people again. I could also try learning a new hobby related activity.- I need to limit my screen time and news scrolling.¬†This is a new habit which needs to be wound back down to pre-pandemic, pre-surgery levels.- I really want my stronger body back. The last 1 1/2 years have included 12 months plus of recovery from foot surgery but that is over with (almost) I keep saying I will exercise and eat better so this year is the time to re-discover my strong willpower and goal orientation and make it happen.¬†The obstacles present for many aren't for me. I have generally good weather for being outdoors, a car and available funds.¬†My town has good grocery stores and a farmers market, gyms, Pilates/yoga studios, a lovely community indoor pool, community exercise classes, bike lanes, walking trails, etc. plus free access within my HOA to safe if boring walking routes and a small gym, outdoor pool and exercise classes.¬†Where did my willpower and determination disappear to? I need to find them!SUGGESTIONS?"},

Very thankful for veterinary medicine and a thoughtful, competent vet who looks carefully for the right solutions carefully for the dog's medical problems but doesn't push any treatment after carefully explaining our options and the pros and cons.That being said, we are adding a 4th pill to her daily regime (plus a once a month shot and prescription food) to hopefully keep her happy and bouncy despite significantly worsening kidney disease indicators.¬†I've said it before but she really is a sturdy little medical miracle. She survived abuse as a pup, developed Addison's disease at 3 1/2 but a different and equally wonderful vet in Atlanta diagnosed that and got her on treatment and thriving before it was too late. Now she is 12 1/2 and we are still treating Addison's plus kidney disease and high blood pressure. She also is sleeping a lot more and I just realized she may be \"leaking\" pee during the night because she is so sound asleep for so long. Toddler bed washable pads to the rescue there.We do know that she is on borrowed time but as long as she is happy and feeling ok we are enjoying her as we have for the past 11 years.

So one day after I had made blueberry muffins I brought some to give to him. He told that story to our son, DIL and granddaughter yesterday when they called to wish him happy 69th birthday. That story came out because I made him blueberry muffins yesterday morning before he woke up. He added in ‚ÄúI think she liked me‚Äù - cute.We took the whole day off which was lovely. The highlight was going to Ventura and having lunch at the restaurant on the pier. We both got the salmon platter and a beer and watched the sail boarders zooming by. With windows on 3 sides of the restaurant it was as usual a lovely view.There were high winds blowing out to sea so the water was more like a lake and it was low tide. Loads of shore birds from large to tiny hunting for food and resting on the ocean quite far out as no waves.¬†After lunch we walked the pier and walking back was quite interesting with the wind gusts but also exhilarating. We were glad though that we had parked close as the sand was blowing into our shoes once we were on the boardwalk. I woke this morning to no wind so we made it through without any wildfires.

{"title": "Wednesday randomness", "date": "Wednesday, November 17, 2021", "text": "Our younger son called last night while DIL and granddaughter were at figure skating classes. During the conversation he mentioned that in the process of transferring everything to his new laptop he discovered that he still had some bitcoins despite having thought he closed the accounts out years ago. Then it was the hunt to find the passwords lol. He got into one account and found it was worth $800 at the minute he looked at it. He was still searching for the other password and deciding what to do with the accounts but was quite pleased to find money he didn‚Äôt know he had.That got me thinking about how our finances have changed during the pandemic. Some things are obviously the same for many people including no travel except driving within the state, much less eating out and substituting streaming services for movies and live theater. I have spent less on haircuts as we switched to a mobile hairdresser who charges much less than the salon I was going to. Clothing has been about the same as has home maintenance and gifts.¬†Of course right now our food, household supplies and beverages cost more than they did as does gasoline. Starting in January we will be charged more for Medicare and our supplemental insurance and I‚Äôm sure our homeowners insurance will go up as will our HOA but that always happens.So really not a lot of bottom line spending change but our income increased what with stimulus checks and my first mandatory minimum withdrawal happening next month.I realize we are extremely fortunate financially but what has really hit me recently is that I am finally feeling like someone hit the pause button on my life both because of the ongoing pandemic but also my desire to stay away from crowds as a result. Living in a very quite suburban environment rather than a vibrant city doesn‚Äôt help.So I am both curious as to what you see looking back over the pandemic and how you are reclaiming a vibrant life at this point?"},

While our program is about the local Chumash Indian history, our inspiration and chat is about service members who have inspired us in some way.I found 3 quotes that resonate with me. The first makes me think of my Dad who when he was 23 -24 years old flew 33 missions over Europe on a B-17 as flight engineer in the Army Air Force. Although he had asked to be transferred from his posting in Alaska to the European Theatre, he did not expect to survive his tour of duty since the survival rate of bomber crews was very very low at the time.His next posting was to Chanute Field near Urbana, Illinois where my Mom lived and the rest is history as they say. Here they are on their wedding day with my Dad's older brother on the right. He also served as crew on cargo planes in Asia where they flew supplies over \"the hump\".¬†‚ÄúThe Hump‚Äù was the nickname Allied pilots gave the airlift operation that crossed the Himalayan foothills into China. It was the Army Air Force‚Äôs most dangerous airlift route, but it was the only way to supply Chinese forces fighting Japan ‚Äî and things weren‚Äôt going well for China. The fact that they both survived is amazing.Dad's diary of his tour of duty describes horrible things in a very matter of fact way including when he tied a rope about his waist and lowered himself part way out of the plane while it was flying in an effort to close the bomb bay door. His plane had lots of near fatal damage, his helmet was hit by a piece of shrapnel, he saw planes explode with no \"chutes\" so no survivors yet he was very matter of fact and continued on.That last bit describes my Dad totally. He got on with it and mastered his fears at least as far as I ever knew."},

So 5 new GFI outlets, a bunch of new dimmer switches that will work with LEDs as we slowly replace all the recessed lights in the house plus 4 new LED recessed light fixtures to fix the problem we called them about!At least now we have an electrician I would highly recommend and for that I have my neighbor to thank (and believe me I have thanked her).I get home ownership joy times two as we are trying to find a carpenter or skilled handyman to replace the treads and railings (hopefully not the supporting structure!) on two sets of exterior stairs at my clubhouse. Add in that it is a county historic landmark and everyone who is good seems to be incredibly busy and we have yet to get anyone out to give a bid. We may have to close one set for safety and have people enter at the other side of the front porch.We did manage to switch our commercial property and liability insurance to a different company before the current policy had to be renewed so that is good. There are fun sides to being club President but it is really a business as well as a nonprofit that is both social and service oriented plus owns this large old building. I've learned a lot and mainly that we need to really increase our membership with people who want to volunteer!We are currently getting a nice soaking rain thankfully nothing like the damaging storm that hit N California yesterday.¬† The dog used her little yellow raincoat for the first time in a long time.

And of course getting your flu shot doesn‚Äôt guarantee that you won‚Äôt get the flu but it significantly reduces the likelihood.Last year‚Äôs flu season was mild because we were all holed up at home and wearing masks.

Enjoyed it as usual. Then the card he gave me he added \"you may be 72 but you will always be 27 to me\". I had to do the math and yes that is when we met!I had a long an fun lunch with two friends who have birthdays within a few weeks of mine. We either celebrate all of us at once or individually and this year it is individually. Look at my gift sitting on my desk - perfect for reminding me to be thankful!Cards, Facebook messages, emails and texts from friends and extended family plus day of calls from both sons and their families rounded it out. I am feeling loved.Labor Day weekend trip to see Berkeley son, DIL and granddaughter¬†This was a lovely and much needed dose of time with family. Plus a mocha cake with buttercream frosting and chocolate glaze made by DIL and granddaughter! Yum.An in person service club meeting with puppies (program is about raising puppies for guide dog training) with only fully vaccinated allowed to attend and with masks as county requires but at least we can get together!Six dogs for a lunch meeting and only one had challenges staying quiet the whole time. Very interesting program, nice box lunch and a chance to see friends and meet a few new people.Continued to increase strength, flexibility and endurance through PT and other exercise as able.Although I have been diligent about PT I have also realized that regaining my strength, walking speed and stamina after 18 months of pandemic and two foot surgeries will take more effort than rehabbing my currently recovering foot. Onward to being more active and strong.Bonus points for getting my flu shot though.Continue to spend time with art activities as the process is quite stress reducing and relaxing for me.I have continued to play around with color and design plus some coloring pages occasionally. Very relaxing and I want to move to more original work.More safe outings probably including a walk along the ocean boardwalk, art gallery visit and farmer‚Äôs market.Had a lunch out with two friends. Went to the house where my local son and DIL are pet sitting for a visit and lunch. Went to book discussion group. Didn't get to the listed outings!Planning family get togethers for granddaughter‚Äôs 5th birthday and for Thanksgiving.Chatted about it and decided to wait and see if the birthday party goes forward with Covid restrictions at the time.More reaching out to East Coast family members (brother, SIL and cousins).My brother called for my birthday and I wrote 3 cousins.Get a recommendation for an electrician and get our broken ceiling light fixed.Got a recommendation from the neighbor across the street.¬†Go through fall clothes and buy anything needed.I don't actually need anything so I think I am only going to replace/add if I have trouble getting dressed in outfits I am happy with between laundry rounds.I need a project that isn‚Äôt club related so I‚Äôm thinking of getting back to improving our emergency preparedness, doing some thrifting and getting better at alterations, a bit of home redecorating or?Apparently that project is tech updates!¬†I bought an iPhone SE and signed up for Mint Mobile.

So Date Night activities will probably be at home but doing something deliberately together for fun is the plan.¬†HEALTHY ME: I think this is pretty self explanatory. Doing it is the challenge.CLUBBING: Sounds more like what the 20 somethings are looking forward too! My version is part of engaging with others and strengthening friendships.My club activities and friends have been a lifeline through the pandemic and I am hopeful that the virus will not shut down in person meetings since we are all vaccinated. However, we will continue one way or another and get our property management, charity and social activities done.CREATIVITY: I wrote about haiku but I may instead work through some of this book¬†or make bookmarks to give away or do some doodling art like these that I found on Pinterest.¬†I recently sat on the couch with my feet up and did this sketch using fine tip markers and following a drawing from Pinterest and it was fun to do.¬†The point is to spend more time on creative activity rather than just thinking about it."},
{"title": "How long might I live and how to increase odds of life quality?", "date": "Friday, July 30, 2021", "text": "When we consulted a financial planner while still working, we asked her to assume we would live to at least 100. Does that seem optimistic to you?My dad lived to almost 89 and my mom to 93. Both had serious health problems well before 70 (multiple serious heart problems and cancer with heavy chemo respectively) that I haven‚Äôt had. Hubby‚Äôs dad also lived to 93 despite being a heavy smoker to the end. So we think past 100 might be a possibility and have known people who lived to 107 with their mind and most of their body in good health.How does this all relate to the idea of embracing my 70‚Äôs?I remember clearly my Dad‚Äôs 75th surprise birthday party and how vital and active he was. Ten years later that was not the case although his mind was still good. Same for my Mom but add 5 years as she was still doing pretty well at 85. I also remember that at some point they simply stopped moving and getting much physical activity. Understandable but not good for them.¬†Our modern lifestyle (internet browsing, texting) plus my inherited love of reading makes me at risk for the same fate.They also both stopped reaching out to friends or planning activities that would take them out of their home. This was partly due to living in a rural area in a northern climate with long winters and eventually the inability to drive. However I saw the effect of social isolation on my mom once my dad died. She was lonely and craved some friendly social and physical contact but didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbother‚Äù anyone to give her a ride so they stopped asking. She also wouldn‚Äôt move to assisted living or closer to my my brother or myself.¬†My tendency to not reach out to initiate social activity puts me at the same risk especially since we were not successful at moving really close to either of our sons so far.That leads to the first things I really need to develop strong habits for during the remainder of my 70‚Äôs.- An exercise habit that I enjoy and that keeps up strength and flexibility¬†- A social network where I can reciprocate well and stay engaged with people I truly care about- Regular activities that get me out in the larger world and feed my interests and keep me interesting¬†I‚Äôm starting this thought process at nearly 72 because - well, the pandemic. Better late than never."},

{"title": "What has worked really well for my second bunion surgery", "date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2021", "text": "This time I tried to remedy everything that was tiring or made recovery longer. Obviously I couldn‚Äôt fix everything but I did make some changes that really helped.Of course I have a live in helper/caretaker in my Hubby and would have to have done many other things if I was trying to deal with this on my own or with occasional help.1. It is more tiring to use the knee scooter on carpet than hard floors so I set up a table in the guest room and put my clothing on it. No going to our closet in the carpeted bedroom to get clothes.2. The first surgery I thought it was important to wear the walking boot all day. That ended up with my ankle being frozen. This time I am wearing it only when walking or as time progresses for a couple of hours a time.3. I was too cautious about moving my ankle once the cast came off last time. This time I am rotating, flexing and pointing it several times a day. Much better range of motion at this point.4. I didn‚Äôt prepare frozen breakfast foods the first time but did this time. Still tiring to get my own breakfast but easier on me and Hubby.5. The retractable leash purchase has enabled me to let the dog out in the morning even from the knee scooter. Again much easier on Hubby.6. Hubby suggested using Tupperware as bowls or plates for breakfast as less likely to spill. A good solution.7. I bought a knee scooter with a basket and it is wonderful at reducing the number of trips for things.8. I looked up exercises that could be done for leg strength with a cast on and have done them occasionally. Frequently would have been even better. Same with how to stretch leg muscles while lying down and upper body stretches while sitting.9. Make sure your knee scooter is adjusted with the proper height seat and handlebars for maintaining good posture and then try to use it with good posture. It is way to easy not to.¬†10. Don't slouch while sitting or lying with your leg elevated. Last time I tried to use one of those reading in bed pillows but it didn't work for me.¬†11. Once you can stand with bare feet work on body alignment as the walking boot and scooter will throw it off. No need for additional aches and pains.12. Figure out the easiest ways to get around your house, make your bathroom work for you and practice with your mobility aids before surgery! I did this the first time but again the second with the learning from before.Things I wish I had done!1. Rearrange some dishes and food items in pantry and frig so fewer trips were required to get them and they were within easier reach.2. Have more clothing choices including PJs that would fit over my cast.3. Figured out more easy outings as I am really sick of my home at this point.4. Watched even more YouTube videos on how to be mobile, recovery tips, etc. There are some great PTs and other health care professionals who have created useful ones.Medicare Factors1. According to my podiatrist Medicare only pays for one walking boot every 3 years. That seems to also apply to the compression stocking so you may want to use an elastic bandage at night when you need wash it or buy a second one.Hope this helps someone else.¬†If you want to see the difference between one year of recovery and 4 1/2 weeks just compare my feet in the photo below."},

My other son and DIL are at their house as they were going to pet sit so now they will have a family visit instead. I FaceTimed with them too. All the adults are vaccinated and the little one tested negative Sunday. Very thankful! And hoping a vaccine for children is available soon.My brother received his 75th birthday card and called so we had a nice catch up.I was able to walk down the sloping driveway and take a progressively longer but short walks on the sidewalk with crutches and walking boot. It was lovely to be outside.I have very belatedly discovered that Hubby makes way better tuna salad sandwiches than I do and he made one for my lunch Saturday.A friend brought over lunch and visited for a couple of hours on Monday which was lovely.The giant but dying pine tree near our house was finally taken down on Tuesday. They also trimmed to even larger one behind our neighbors home. We‚Äôll miss the shade but not the concern when the strong winds blow. Yeah!Oh my goodness but my little 15 pound poodle was so cute Wednesday morning. I was doing my short walk outside on crutches when she came along with Hubby. She simply would not budge for him if they got too far ahead of me in her opinion and she kept looking back to make sure I was still moving forward. What a good little protector to her injured pack member.The giant pine being down we now get direct morning sun on our patio and into my office and our bedroom. Hubby went to Lowe‚Äôs and got an umbrella so now the patio will be more enjoyable to use with ¬†both shade and not so many tree droppings.

The cast comes off and the stitches out in a week which will be great. Off course that means the boot goes on.

{"title": "Same surgery, different recovery experience", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2021", "text": "I was expecting to experience pretty much the same things during the first week or so of recovery from bunion surgery this year as I did last year. In many ways that has been true but in others not.Perhaps it is because of expectations but I have experienced less pain this time although I took the prescription painkiller for the same amount of time. Certainly we were able to make some of the mobility challenges easier by arranging things differently.What has been different this time I think is my reaction to the over the counter medications for pain and inflammation and need to cut back on them to eliminate side effects. I also feel like I am sleeping a lot more which I suppose is good for healing and may result from my being in less pain and thus more active.¬†I have been making a concerted effort to do more for myself which has been good but tiring. It has helped Hubby be less worn out too.All in all 10 days out it is going well and I am pleased with progress. After the year and a half of COVID restrictions though it is sad to have to say no to upcoming social events like a wedding celebration and listening ¬†to a friend‚Äôs band play . I know I won‚Äôt be able to handle the drive and the actual event physically by then though without feeling miserable so there is no way to go.¬†First I have to get feeling like being social as I haven‚Äôt yet taken friends up on offers to come visit!

I was able to wash my hair in the kitchen sink the day after surgery which was great because I wash my hair every day or every two days.3. ¬†Day 3 post surgery I was able to let the dog out first thing rather than waking Hubby. We bought a retractable leash ¬†just for this purpose so I can stay inside and she can reach the grass. She figured out what to do right away being a smart little poodle.4. I am very thankful for effective painkillers . Ironically as I write this there is a news headline that Johnson & Johnson is paying $230 million to New York State to settle the damage done by opioid addiction. Luckily I know I won‚Äôt get addicted despite my gratefulness for ¬†Percocet. All I have to do is take off the anti-nausea patch and I won‚Äôt be able to keep one down. And they make me itch!5. Phase two of recovery started Tuesday with a regular cast put on my foot and lower leg. Dr says it all looks good in the X-ray so only two weeks in the cast.

I had to wake Hubby up way to early to help me and I am trying not to do that to him this go around.¬†Fine now but we also forget to lay out my breakfast last night so it was a hassle to make coffee and get breakfast today. The knee scooter basket is making it all much easier in general though as I have fewer trips to take around the house and that is keeping my knee from getting sore so far.So here are my notes to myself to make this phase of recovery easier.1. Lay out breakfast night before so can make it with ease and then take it into the den where I have parked myself until able to walk without support.2. Put some cracker or another easy middle of the night small snack by the bed. Eat and then wait a bit before takin medication in the night.3. Starting soon as my concentration is back, work on a written project each day in addition to reading a lot and frequently occupying myself with sites on the internet.4. Get dressed each day after taking a sponge bath. Wearing pajamas all day is comfy but not helpful to my attitude or sense of progress.5. In a couple of days start connecting with family and friends via a written note, call, email/text.6. Start Thankful Thursday again.7. Also keep a journal of successes .

I have a COVID test scheduled for Tuesday morning. No reason I shouldn't be ok with that so I'll be at the hospital no later than 5:45 am on Friday morning with surgery scheduled at 7:30. Last year it was delayed an hour but oh well.This past week went well as I checked everything off my to do list.Yesterday we had a lovely party at my social and service club to celebrate our ability to meet in person again and also the completion of the front yard re-landscaping and interior stair repair. We were also celebrating our upcoming partnering with another local club to provide earthquake survival kits for each classroom in the local school.My older son and DIL joined us at the party and then took us out to dinner for Father's Day and spent the night.This is what the front yard looks like right now on the side of the new patio area and the low impact planting side. A lovely change from overgrown plantings and splotchy grass/green weeds.And we got our new banner up on the busy street side hoping to explain more about what we do.The building was originally a one room school house that had a cloak room and bathroom. It was sold at auction to the club in 1924 for a token amount as the word went out not to bid against the women‚Äôs club. It was remodeled in the early 1930's with the kitchen and (I think) the stage and office area added. In about 1960 a separate entrance annex was added on to rent as the local library. Now it is rented to an engineering firm but has had various lives including as a dress shop. It is a registered county historic building.We are entering a new \"community recreation center\" phase of use of the building as we will have renters who provide martial arts classes to children, a long time area yoga studio, and 3 different dance class groups. We actually had to block out days for our own use as the place will be so busy.

Fortunately she told me again just a few days ago when I was wondering why I am putting myself through the pain and slow recovery of another foot surgery when my foot doesn't even hurt when I walk!!!¬†Since I'm not going to get younger and my foot will only get worse this needs to happen.¬†We just mailed in our passport renewal applications so I am clearly hoping for international travel in the future. Perhaps the pandemic end and my foot full recovery will coincide.I'm glad all the pre-op is as far in advance as possible.- Monday I had a 7 am appointment for my blood test. The employee who showed up 5 minutes after that didn't have the right key to unlock the door and had no idea how long it would be until someone showed up with a key. Fortunately there is another location in town so I hopped over there and had the blood drawn.- Tuesday I went to see my internist and it turns out the lab didn't do one of the required tests. Sigh. But at least I passed the EKG, etc. I also learned that the holdup on a referral for something else was that she had put the wrong info in the referral request. Thank goodness it isn't anything serious or urgent.- Today (Wednesday) after the dog sees the vet for her monthly shot I will go back to the lab and give some more blood so that can be checked off!- Thursday I see the surgeon and then it will just be follow up to make sure all the forms get turned in on time, my last minute COVID test is actually scheduled, and I know when to show up at the hospital.All that will be left then is to have the COVID test, rent a knee scooter, pick up the painkiller and anti-nausea prescriptions (the painkiller causes me to vomit lol) and set up the house for recovery.I have to say the vet and vet's office is much more organized, less cumbersome to navigate for care,¬† and always follows up without reminders.¬†So what does it say about the American healthcare system when my dog gets better organized care than I do?"},

And since the club is a non-profit corporation this has been some good thinking, decision making and planning exercise. Then of course there are the straight unhired labor parts lol.Insurance review -¬†We own a building built in 1895 as a schoolhouse, acquired at auction in 1924 for $250, first used for club meetings in 1935,¬† renovated extensively in 1940 with a small addition for the town library added in 1960 and maintained ever since and designated a county historic building.¬†It would cost over $1.1M to rebuild plus more for building code upgrades. Then there are the contents plus liability insurance. We at least don't have to buy Director and Officer insurance since we are a CA corporation.This makes our business insurance costly on our budget yet quite important. We had trouble getting information about the coverage we currently have based on decisions of prior officers so we asked for a quote from a second company. A 2 hour phone call gives us a pretty good idea of coverage requirements and options and now we have to make some serious financial decisions.Bylaw revision -If the pandemic taught us anything about running a nonprofit organization it was that we have to have flexibility in our governance documents. While the CA Secretary of State ruled that no matter what bylaws said any nonprofit could conduct business electronically for the duration, the pandemic rules are ending soon and we have to adjust our bylaws. It has been an interesting thinking exercise but we are very close to being able to send out the proposed revisions for the required 30 day notice before voting occurs.Preparing to reopen our clubhouse for meetings and additional renters -¬†California plans to open up with no occupancy restrictions on June 15th although there will still be public health guidance which is expected to follow CDC's recommendations. County rules can be different though.¬†We were able to continue with 2 renters during the pandemic as we have 2 separate spaces. The addition is rented to an engineering company and the large space was used by a martial arts children's program that obtained and followed county approval. The club met entirely by Zoom.Now we are preparing to rent to a yoga studio and a dance group as well as hold our own meetings at our building. We are preparing to kick off our return and the completion of re-landscaping the front yard by holding a \"patio and porch\" party on June 19th. We will have the building open too of course. Then in July monthly meetings will start inside. This makes our meeting planning process more complicated as we have always had luncheons. Now we will ask people to bring their lunch or they can order a box lunch that we will pick up. An ongoing process of flexibility.Fiscal year planning -¬†Our new fiscal year starts June 1st so we are also in the midst of budget preparation, annual plan preparation, etc. and we need to catch up on some things that we couldn't do during the pandemic like an inventory.And then there is the unpaid labor -¬†Later today Hubby and I are heading to the clubhouse to try to clean the coils on the frig and see if there is a simple solution to the frig part running too cold. Plus in trying to find the model # yesterday I saw that is really needs cleaning inside. The only other labor I do is maintain the Little Free Library but other members do the landscape maintenance, small repairs, etc.¬†We do have funds to hire the larger things and right now that is to replace the unsafe railings on the stairs to the stage. The building skirting replacement is going into this year's budget plus I'm sure there is more. Our dream is to add handicap access via a lovely ramp up to the front porch but that design and approval process was halted by the pandemic shutting city offices and reducing our income drastically.¬†So if you read this whole thing I applaud and now you know why I haven't been posting! Four weeks until bunion surgery and then I'll miss the club's July meeting for sure and probably August as there is no handicap access (waived as a historic building)."},
{"title": "Hmmm, hadn't thought about that happening. ", "date": "Friday, May 21, 2021", "text": "Wow, our emergency preparedness really needs some work!¬†We got almost caught short twice in two weeks and it is partly because I had defined emergencies as natural disasters or power outages not supply chain shortages or medical emergencies.So problem one was when I had to go to the ER two weeks ago because of suspected food poisoning. If it had been caused by our dinner then Hubby would have had to go too. Fortunately he didn't as our back up dog care is our local son and DIL and they were on vacation in Mexico!Now you may not think dog care is such a big deal but our dear old dog is medically complex and we are keeping her alive with 4 medications and prescription food due to her having not just one but two metabolic diseases (Addison's and kidney disease) plus high blood pressure. So oops on back up care. A neighbor has agreed to be our very local back up until one of our sons could get her and we will back up her cat care. Now I need to put together even more thorough instructions.Our second oops was also dog related. We struggled to find a prescription dog food she would eat and she lost a lot of weight in the process. She likes her current frozen food regime. We were almost out so we were pretty shocked to find out it was out of stock at the store and by mail order from the manufacturer. We do have some shelf stable food for her for true survival emergencies but it isn't prescription.Although we finally did find some at another store we also go a new prescription for the slightly less on target food the same company makes which was not out of stock. We do need to think this through even more though.I'm sure there are many other things we aren't prepared for and am thinking that getting our emergency plans and to do list really thought through will be a good \"couch\" project while I recover from my foot surgery."},

Regardless, I am thankful that they let me do it instead of having to show up, take a written test, eye test and photo.I was also thankful that we were able to get the final inspection for our attic re-insulation scheduled quickly and it is done.I know there are lots of problems with Amazon's management practices yet I was thankful that I could order a couple of items rather than keep trying to find a store nearby that carried them. I'm training my dog to go outside in the morning using a retractable leash so that Hubby won't have to get up so early to take her out during my recovery period. The close by pet store doesn't carry them. I also really wanted some Chai green teabags and couldn't find them at the 3 stores tried. Enter Amazon for both.I also replaced a rusting muffin tin and now have 2 really nice ones. We like muffins.I may have already mentioned that our Friends of the Library bookstore is now open on a limited basis. It was so nice to be able to walk in there and buy some used books for when I am couch bound and support the library at the same time.The biggest thanks are reserved for a nice long visit from my older son and DIL last Sunday.

Also frozen mac n cheese and veggie burgers.The rest of the plan is to prepare double meals the 4 evenings before and have them ready in the frig as leftovers.

Not to worry, I am doing fine now but last night was a different story.Symptoms like food poisoning or stomach flu (norovirus) with the latter the likely culprit as Hubby wasn't sick. I got quite dehydrated and weak so he call the paramedics who were great and then spent the wee hours of the morning in ER where they patched me up and then sent me home. Glad he decided to call as I wasn't in any condition to decide.Hubby was asleep at 3 am of course but came and got me and brought me a coat and slippers as I was only in pajamas and socks. Remember it is cold in an ambulance and ER and grab something warm to take with you! The staff were all wearing fleece pullovers.Anyway, I count myself lucky to not have been in an ambulance in 71 years of life. Now I have and I'm sure the neighbors are going to be asking what happened as the security staff first responders, fire truck and ambulance all showed up. Not an uncommon site in a 50 and over community and they have a wonderful response time. Still, a first time event at our house.All this means I wasn't able to go to our first since February 2020 in person book club this morning. I was so looking forward to it but too little sleep and the possibility of infecting others kept me home.Anyone else find riding in an ambulance makes them car sick? That was on top of everything else so they gave me a shot to stop the nausea which was great.Today is already a better day so onward."},

Walked out with nothing done for now and a list of priorities for when I am ready to proceed. Thankful.Also thankful the dermatologist found nothing of concern. As a teenager I put on a bikini and suntan lotion and layer on the concrete deck of the public pool for hours. Many a sunburn but I guess most in my generation did the same.

I really like having Bob's Red Mill Potato Flakes on hand to make mashed potatoes very easily.I did 3 loads of laundry including bedding and towels. Did the dog's bedding on Tuesday right after we got home thankfully. Called Amazon about a mix up on credit for a returned item, returned another item via UPS, call Kiwi Co to change the Kiwi crate subscription for our granddaughter to the 5-8 year old range instead of 3-4 one. Caught up on emails. Picked up a book at the library and was able to go inside which was great and strange at the same time. Stopped at the clubhouse to discuss repair options for a loose stair railing and the potential of a new steady renter. Got our key back from our lovely neighbor who brings in our mail and packages while we are gone. Got anniversary card in the mail for son and DIL we just visited. Plus all the regular stuff.Today is call the vet to confirm if dog needs the test scheduled. Cut down last 2 drawings and take them to framer. Pick up 2 completed ones. Try to renew driver's license online. Help Hubby pay bills online to refresh his memory since I do it and it is not a good idea for only one member of a couple to be up to date on all that (his request by the way).

My other fully vaccinated son and DIL are on a trip to Oaxaca for a much needed change of scenery and new experiences. We expect to see them when they get back.¬†2.

Yesterday I had my suspicions of a UTI confirmed and started antibiotics for that. It was surprisingly hard to get the lab test ordered and then to get the prescription filled took persistence. I did get a laugh as the quite young pharmacist faced with a prescription for penicillin asked a colleague if it wasn‚Äôt the oldest antibiotic produced. Yes, and it saved my Dad‚Äôs life when he had a ruptured appendix back when it was newly available. That means I am here to get its benefit too.I delayed my mammogram until mid May based on the recommendation of waiting 6 weeks after your second COVID shot to help avoid a false positive due to lymph node swelling from immune system response. I was able to book the bone density test to be done right afterwards at least.Now I am trying to sort out pre-op blood work, EKG and in person doctor visit and avoid the blood work and Zoom doctor visit as follow up for my physical. Don‚Äôt have the answer yet if they will let me combine them or insist on separate tracks.Again, very happy it is all available and I can pay for it but thanks pandemic for bunching it all together in the space of a few weeks to be followed by foot surgery!Then there is the little old poodle‚Äôs healthcare. We now have her blood pressure under control but her kidney function tests still are showing poor results. The vet is switching one of the blood pressure meds to see if it does a better job on kidney function. At least her quality of life is back to being good, she is energetic and playful and she is eating like there will be no more food if she doesn‚Äôt eat it all right now. So there is that to be very happy about. Maybe it is our age or the pandemic but we are all about prioritizing quality of life right now.I‚Äôm not sure how people who aren‚Äôt comfortable with using computers get their healthcare organized these days. All this not only took lots of computer messaging to the doctor‚Äôs office but also the persistence, time and willingness to make repeated phone calls.

I was about 8 - 10 I would guess.So Sky King, Rawhide, Bonanza, Gunsmoke and more. I loved horses at that point (still do) and so this quiet time with Grandpa was a favorite. I also realize as an adult that I loved spending time with him because he didn't ask anything of me except for me to just be there and be me. What a gift.Not to leave Grandma out although she was usually cooking and doing housework as she was a businesswoman and worked 6 days a week at the store she owned. I would walk over to their house in the summer or on Saturdays and she would help me earn pocket money by giving me small tasks to do. Or I'd just hang out and again the total acceptance of being me was such a gift.These grandparents were my Mom's step-parents and actually not significantly older than her - about 15 to 17 years older. She cherished them especially her \"Mom\" who married her widowed father when my Mom was quite young.Now that I write this I think I need to make more of a point to make sure my granddaughter feels the same level of total acceptance. She is perfect and enough all the time just as she is."},

So goodbye to some paintings and old drawings of mine and my Dad's that won't get hung in this house.* I realized I want to keep the best of my Dad's pencil drawings and some of my drawings and small paintings that won't get hung. And I'm ok with that.* I decided to hang a 3rd grade art work that my Mom had framed for me. Double memories. Still thinking where to put it.¬†* I found 4 drawings that I had done that we want to frame and hang. We picked out some likely spots to hang them once I get them matted and framed. My photos aren't great as all the backgrounds are white not beige.I really enjoyed seeing again some of what I had done in art classes in Atlanta. I'm really out of practice on both painting and drawing and it is not what I want to do right now. Perhaps I will take classes again in the future. For now I'm enjoying remembering and appreciating what I did.I love seeing art on our home's walls and mostly we have family art which evokes great memories. No point in having it all in a closet!Finance month continued: Our taxes are done and mailed in!Tech month continued:¬†This is always at the bottom of my to do list lol.

While I was refreshing the Little Free Library at our clubhouse I found a book I've been waiting for from the library FOREVER (or so it seems when time is stuck in slow motion by a pandemic lol.) The Thursday Murder Club is now mine to read and return to its place later.7.¬† Now this is S. California so it looks like Spring elsewhere but the clubhouse is looking gorgeous with flowers in full bloom, the Little Free Library moved to be right by the front walk, and a new patio, sitting area and raised bed being built.¬†Eventually we will be able to use the inside again but love the new \"face\" we are putting out there. The original building was constructed in 1895 as the Somis school and my club took ownership in 1924. The bell tower was removed at some point and a small addition put on to rent out first as the local library, then a women's clothing store and then offices. What a legacy to protect and improve."},

I updated passwords, deleted lots of old document files and emails, organized what was left better, replaced an app that wasn't working, etc.Made some decisions too.1. I'm going to stick with Dropbox for backup for now and learn how to use it better/more fully.2. I am going to do our taxes manually this year and mail them in but pay any taxes owed online.3. I'm going to give my son back his old iPhone as it is too small for me and I don't really want to switch.4.. I'm going to keep on top of deleting club emails once the relevant documents are saved.5. I will remember to ask myself how I can use technology to do something! For example, I misplaced the address for mailing in an insurance privacy choices document and didn't want to sit on the phone trying to reach a human. Emailed our agent and he suggested scanning it and emailing it to him. Done.Continuing to work on financial matters I finished reading our property and earthquake policies. We need to upgrade the property coverage so I have been emailing questions to our agent. I did see that our cost for that policy increased 47.6% but then the horrible past fire season impact has to be felt somehow. It is still quite affordable though.Onward to March's focus which will be adding more things that bring me happiness to my activities, food, home, patio and wardrobe.

Easy returns on the others.6. Between Hubby and I we encouraged two neighbors to get signed up for their first vaccine shot and both got it earlier this week. Please get your friends and neighbors to persist and get signed up when they are eligible.7. When we cleared out my Mom's house after she died in 2014 I brought this garden ornament home to Atlanta and then moved it to California.

Have added to my list creating a back up of phone numbers in case they aren‚Äôt accessible on our phone during an emergency.We have been having a big think and some serious discussion with our younger son about w(at the science says about our visiting them once we are two weeks past the second shot. We are all researching whether we might put them at risk of being infected ( could we still get infected, not know it and transmit it?) as they are too young too get vaccines yet. And then there is the question of whether or no that Grandgirl could infect us and would we get sick?

Our in person meetings were pleasant but all business. Sort of a silver lining?2. Thankfully the second company we asked for a shower door bid sent someone who observed COVID precautions, took careful measurements and notes and followed up. They also repair screens and I had just noticed one had a hole in it - done! We approved the bid and paid our deposit. Onward to dealing with the wired noise the frig is making.3. Do you get hooked on series by an author. I do and then Amazon gets my money as the library doesn‚Äôt have their books. Thankful I don‚Äôt have to ponder if I can afford this ‚Äúhobby‚Äù.4. A club board member had a great idea for a time limited service project to help homeless women. There is a lot of energy around making this happen in March. Yeah for a team with great ideas!5.

We were talking recently about how we think the 1918 flu pandemic was the only other pandemic to infect such a high percentage of people in the entire world at the same time (except New Zealand!). At least this time there are better treatments and some vaccines.For me this all means focusing on the little things that I am thankful for is even more important.1. My husband and I make home repair decisions quickly and come to the same conclusion. The old shower door in the master bath started leaking. We concluded it wasn‚Äôt worth repairing or patching the problem and are working on getting a bid to template it.2. I have loved to read since I was able to. My mom would take us on the bus to the library to pick out books. I do remember reading every horse story I could find - Black Beauty comes to mind. Still reading down the library. Thankful for the pleasure it brings and continued good eyesight.3. We have been cooking at home during the most recent COVID surge in S Cal although I think there were sub sandwiches for lunch one day. We decide it was time to get upscale dinner take out on Wednesday night from one of our favorite restaurants that is still hanging on and it was a lovely treat.4. I stopped by our clubhouse to check on the little free library contents and was so happy to see that it is being used. We had it moved to a more visible location and that seems to have worked. Restocked it.5. Amazing what a few inquiries to the right people can accomplish. After listening for a year to the no progress reports about transferring administration of the club‚Äôs Facebook page I solved it in less than a day.

Pandemic sluggishness and bad habits cannot continue and meet my goal of exiting the pandemic in very good health.

My only real hobby is reading so I need more ways of happily spending time.That seems like enough very large changes. I am liking having monthly areas of focus to be more productive.

I do feel so sorry for those who thought until the end that Trump would remain in office. I hope they find a way to let go of their delusions and become focused on a positive reality and help move the country forward.Back to regular blog programming and what I am particularly thankful for in the past week.1. A week ago my club had a most interesting speaker, Sarah Lynn Shreegen. She is a social worker who works mainly in the schools with at risk kids and a local author of books for children and youth that help them develop the skills to navigate social emotional challenges. Several club members had given grandchildren some of her books or read her latest youth book and said they are great.2. Thank goodness for a DIL who was willing to give a go at trimming my hair at my back neckline . It is so much better and she did just what I hoped for.3. We found a source of dog food that is suiting our little pal. No more trying to cobble together something and she is doing well physically.4. I learned that the laws governing nonprofit charitable California organizations have a section covering emergencies. As a result all of the things we have done during the pandemic are legal although not covered in our bylaws. Not that my service club is big enough for anyone to care but we want to be good stewards. Thanks to the Secretary of State for issuing this guidance.5. We had gale force winds for 24 hours and the half dead pine near our home didn‚Äôt drop any limbs of significance. We have asked the HOA to remove it but there are many others in more dire need so we wait and cross our fingers when the high winds come. The developers of this community were from New England and planted trees they knew from home. Now they are all old, way too big and not suited to the climate."},

I can only hope.I feel I need to keeping noting what I am thankful for each week just to keep my own mood lifted so here it goes again.1. The people who are still volunteering during the pandemic. I dropped off some old paint and a fluorescent tube at the monthly hazardous waste collection site staffed by volunteers. It was the same at the animal shelter on Friday when we dropped off some food our dog won't eat. Another person mentioned a recent blood donation so thankful for those who are stepping up to still do that.2. Antibiotics! It seems our dog may have had an undiagnosed UTI that was causing her decline (and very frequent peeing!). Since finishing a round of doggie antibiotics she is back to almost her normal self.3. Once again the steam mop I purchased. Where has it been all of my life? Can't believe how much dirt continues to come off our tile floors even though we vacuum and mop regularly.4. The glorious weather we have been having which is perfect for being outside. It is supposed to be in the low 80s today and tomorrow with plentiful sunshine.5. My DIL has agreed to try to trim my way overgrown hair. Hubby was concerned about doing any of it. I had a pixie cut September 4th so maybe 1 1/2 to 2 inches of growth? Pretty shaggy especially at my neck where I can‚Äôt see to do anything about it."},

We decided to make monthly food bank cash contributions in addition to another large contribution to my club‚Äôs scholarship fund for this year‚Äôs graduating seniors. Those are the ones we feel are most important right now.There will be smaller contributions to our 3 local NPR stations and the PBS station. Also a cash one to the animal shelter. So many needs.2. I decided to use TurboTax to file our taxes thanks to a reader recommendation. Now to pick the best version for our situation. I am assuming I would look at which schedules were used last year that will continue and buy the one that includes those. A task for later this month.¬†3. I updated our spreadsheet to check off all the info needed to file our taxes. As it comes in or is available online I enter it so I can be sure we have everything.And just routine financial activites:4. Hubby once again fixed the kitchen faucet so the water pressure returned to the correct level. We probably need to replace it but that might not solve the problem and we don‚Äôt want a handyman in the house right now. This recurring problem may be related to very hard water leaving scale in the pipes and our installation of a water softener is pulling them loose and then they clog the screen in the head of the faucet. Anyway Hubby‚Äôs effort saved money and hassle.5. I took my list to CVS and wasn't able to get one item. Spray n Wash is not available at my Vons or CVS. Amazon to the rescue where I bought a larger refill bottle which saved money and since I use my own spray bottle is perfect."},

No leader of defense, homeland security, treasury, etc. due to their not wanting to seem to have accepted Biden‚Äôs election until after their personal safety was at risk from a violent mob. Only one hearing has even been scheduled and that for the Secretary of Defense.On my little home front I am so fortunate to live in a little healthy and safe bubble but as I walk I do see Trump supporting banners and signs on some people‚Äôs houses. So disturbing.

A neighbor who just started chemo was outside and said so far so good. She is still working although perhaps fewer hours than previously.

Can the damage done by the current Justice dept and the Education, EPA, Interior, Homeland Security, HHS etc, cabinet secretaries all be reversed? More hope with a Democratic Senate now.I am hating that Pence and McConnell are getting praise for the one time they stood up to Trump‚Äôs insanity but at least they did. There was one death due to violence during the insurrection that Trump kicked off and a second now that a Capitol police officer died as a result of injuries from assault during it. I won‚Äôt blame him for the 3 deaths from medical emergencies but they might not have happened if their was no riot. Will he be held to account in any way?And yesterday a new record of more than 4,111 residents of the US dying from COVID-19. In just December 140,000 more jobs were lost. Even the Murdoch controlled WSJ has called for Trump to resign.All the officials of Trump administration are complicit in enabling this awful and deadly administration. And resigning in less than 2 weeks before the administration ends isn‚Äôt an act of conscience or courage. It is rats jumping a sinking ship.Not that I have strong feelings about the situation lol.¬†So no thankful Thursday today but on the personal front things were more positive. We were finally able to return borrowed medical equipment to the HOA office, dropped off a bunch of food our dog won‚Äôt eat anymore at the animal shelter, and returned the puzzles and games a friend lent for our Christmas. The club‚Äôs Little Free Library if getting lots of use in its new location. We made our favorite turkey and bean chili for dinner and added a salad.

I expect this year will be essentially the same although we are increasing our donations and contributions to granddaughter‚Äôs college fund.¬†In addition, since our taxes are simple we are thinking of going back to doing them ourselves.

Thankful once again that our sons want to see us badly enough to basically isolate for 2 weeks in advance. We are doing the same of course for Christmas with our local son and DIL.4. We were able to order the dog‚Äôs newly prescribed renal support food online so no going out required for us.

It dawned on me to ask to borrow some puzzles and games from a friend instead of buying anything. Now we have a lot more options of things to do while son and DIL are with us over Christmas.

We really enjoyed having some variety and are glad to add a new dinner option to the rotation that fits our goals of healthy, tasty and fast to make.7. We found a neighborhood that went all out on Christmas lights this year and had our traditional drive to admire the results of other people‚Äôs hard work.

We can do everything in our power to stay physically and emotionally healthy. We can learn new things and find joy.

Retirement is so unstructured vs work and parenting life where so few hours were open for nonessential things that focus and drive meant a lot got done.

No more worries about not being able to get the car out to evacuate.3. We have two sets of best neighbors. Directly across the street are the couple we met first upon moving in. We socialize, cover for each other when on trips and one of them is my Hubby‚Äôs drum teacher. Then later the sister and BIL of Hubby‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs widower (got that?) moved in two doors down.

I have struggled since we moved in to get the large expanse of tile floor in our house really clean. Do not put textured ceramic floor tile in heavy use areas! It came with the house though so I finally bought a steam mop and man does it really do a good job.5. The first person I met after we moved is my neighbor across the street and she and her partner have become good friends. We had a nice chat this past Saturday at a distance of course.6. It is time for me to lengthen my walks so I headed out today on my longest pre-surgery normal route. Hubby agreed to stay by the phone in case I needed to call for a ride part way. I didn't make it all the way as my toe started hurting so I turned around and walked home. Still my longest walk to date and I wasn't in pain afterwards. Go recovery!7. I was able to give the dog a bath for the first time since surgery since it requires being up and down on the floor. I enjoy doing this for her because she loves it so much.8. Our diligent vet called about some test results that indicate our little poodle‚Äôs kidney function has deteriorated a bit.

So we changed it up with a hike, leaf raking to music and non-traditional meals We had a lovely day instead of a sad one. That was a good start to the idea of creating new traditions as needed.1. Thankful for my loved ones so happy birthday love to our granddaughter (4!), Hubby, and my lovely cousin Mary. Happy anniversary to my big brother and lovely SIL.2. The dog continues to feature in my thankful list but this time because of what my husband did. As he was taking her out for the last time before bed he had a sweet little ‚Äútalk‚Äù with her about sleeping until 6 am. Made me smile and she loves to be talked to in a happy tone.3. Hubby took to heart my comment that our grocery purchases were lacking variety. He came home with artichokes and frozen scallops both of which we haven‚Äôt cooked in years. Steamed the artichokes, ate two and have two in frig for later. The scallops are forming the basis for our Thanksgiving meal. He does the Trader Joe‚Äôs run and I do Vons so we each limit our potential exposure.4. He also figured out how to take the cover off the bath exhaust fan (the installers had caulked it to the ceiling - duh on their part) then cleaned it really well, fixed the ceiling and touched up the paint. Thankful to have such a handy man.5. I was able to drop off old prescription medications in the local police department lobby to be disposed of safely. All I had to do was put them in a ziplock bag and drive over there.6. We got the alternator replaced in our car and they stood by the quote made months ago when they said it didn't need replacing yet. Thankful it is fixed before we get stuck on the road! Bonus is that the car now runs very quietly.7. Definitely something I am thankful for is all of the judges who are throwing out the Trump campaign and related cases filed by sycophants with scathing lectures on how unconstitutional they are. I am appalled at these attempts to reverse the actual vote to appease one sick little man."},

They have done things right and don't have the US horrible situation of infections, full hospitals, stressed to the breaking point health care workers, and endless deaths.¬†Out of my control though so I am once again focusing on what I was thankful for this past week.1. I am endlessly thankful for a husband who is an equal partner in the kitchen. He asked me what I wanted to do for dinner Friday and my response was ‚Äúabsolutely nothing‚Äù. He came up with a plan and I only had to get rice ready to cook.2. Lola the dog (as my granddaughter used to call her) actually slept past 5 am on 4 days this past week. I‚Äôll be even more thankful if she increases that total!3. The large-ish folding table that was in the garage fits nicely under a bed and the step stool fits in the coat closet. Two fewer things to trip over!¬†4. This past Saturday while the dishwasher and washing machine were both running I thought how thankful I am that we have machines to do those jobs.5. We realized it was rather silly to keep paying for collision insurance with a $1,000 deductible for a 10 year old car no matter how low the mileage. Thankful the agent is responsive and our refund is on the way.6. I'm also thankful I learned how to bake at a young age - thank you Mom and 4-H! Have you ever made chocolate depression cake? Very simple and less rich than most cakes or cookies and made 9 pieces that we had no trouble eating lol. I think I've had that baking dish since my first college apartment."},

Our bit if yard waste also sits around waiting for space in the regular bin.- Items like Christmas lights, etc. that are going to our younger son are sitting in the small bedroom waiting for our trip starting December 4th.- Christmas decorations still to go through are sitting in our dining room.Does it get worse before it gets better at your house too?"},

Long story but today we are going to go through and rearrange the storage cupboards in the garage and figure out how to rearrange other stored items.

I admit it took us a while too as it seemed to be designed to do everything but dance on the kitchen counter.So now that I finally used the air fryer function to make sweet potato fries, guess what part broke and can‚Äôt be repaired? The door hinge! A simple mechanical part. Apparently a not uncommon defect according to frustrated consumers venting on line. At least we hadn‚Äôt shelled out any money for this short lived small appliance. Now we just have to figure out how to dispose of it responsibly.

It is an early voting spot and I went on Saturday but I did do a double take! I wonder how strange it will feel when we can actually be back in our public spaces with other people?Anyway, still many things to be thankful for this past week including this glorious sunset viewed from our front entry.1. I finished stocking up our over the counter meds and other illness supplies by receiving my order of disposable masks and buying more acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I even had a CVS coupon to get 25% off on one of them.2. Things are slowly opening up here. I looked up some of the places I really enjoy going and yeah! The restroom on the Ventura pier is open again so we went to the coast for an ocean dose on Wednesday. It was socked in beyond the beach most of the time we were there. One thing I love about the ocean coast is that it is different every time you look at it!I really enjoy the creativity of rock sculptures on the beach and this was a new variation.We had our favorite salmon tacos for lunch at a small restaurant on the pier. Grilled salmon, arugula, avocado, pumpkin seeds, chipotle cream sauce and red chili sauce on corn tortillas.3. I also see that my local artist coop gallery that has wonderful shows is opening for limited hours with limited people allowed. Can't wait to do that too.4. Poodle girl had a good spa day and came home with a great haircut so she is all set until mid December although we will give her at least one bath in the interim. She is so happy when she walks out after grooming that it is comical but it must feel really good to her to have the whole experience. The groomer is so kind and sweet to her too.5. Hubby got a flu shot! Now this shouldn't be a big deal but ever since he had a painful arm for 6 months after getting one at work years ago he has been unwilling to do it. No problems this time. The pandemic plus flu season argument was successful lol.6. I was able to get my foot into yet another pair of shoes although it was tight. The swelling has gone down dramatically and I am working on my ankle flex and strength building only now vs all the other steps earlier."},
{"title": "Decluttering, Minimizing, Editing vs Curating Belongings and Physical Environment ", "date": "Saturday, October 31, 2020", "text": "I saw an Instagram post that said \"Decluttering is about removing the things we don't want. Minimalism is about discovering how little we actually need.\"Neither really appeals to me. By these definitions decluttering sounds like I have bought or been given things that don't fit my life and let them sit around. Minimalism seems like I live with as little as possible which sounds austere.¬†Then there is the successful home organizing show The Home Edit which I admit not watching as it appears to be about organizing and storing your stuff. Editing sounds to me like dealing with storing excess rather than what matters most.¬†I want to curate to have what suits me just right at this point in my life, to buy consciously and not hold on to things just in case or acquire on the whiff of desire. Instead, to surround myself with things that bring me joy or are useful and preferably appealing at the same time.So for me curating my belongings and home means intentionally selecting, organizing and using what I own. Curating goal, relationships and other non-material parts of life is a whole different process I think. Perhaps I‚Äôll think about curating what I eat and how I build my health too.Starting though with my home as I‚Äôve been tweaking it lately, I found this inspirational statement about curating your home at¬†SimpleHomeSimpleLife.¬†\"Curating means pulling your space together in an intentional way. Think about how museum and art gallery curators pull things together in very purposeful design so that we can have the best experience. You can do the same thing for your home.¬†It means using what you have but only keeping what contributes to the home and life you want. You use and present those things in a way that will make you smile, pause and feel good. It means surrounding yourself with things that will help you thrive in an environment that will encourage mindfulness in the present and be supportive of your best future. It means to take charge and live by design.\"¬†I think that fits me and love that it leaves lots of room for art, keepsakes, comfort, hobbies and so on.¬†I do love having art mostly made by family in our home along with carefully chosen keepsakes. Color is very important to me too. I am very visually affected and in fact learn easiest by reading or seeing a demonstration and then doing. My husband learns more by listening but appreciates visual interest and harmony.On the other hand I dislike house cleaning and clutter. Makes for an interesting combination of having stuff and organizing along with minimizing clutter that isn‚Äôt appealing or useful. I think I would have suffocate in a Victorian stuffed parlor and cringe in a bare sleek modern one.How do you experience your belongings and physical environment?"},

The delivery of a \"step\" to use for my PT exercises since we don't have any steps in our house. It adjusts to 4\" and 6\" heights. I'm at the lower height right now as my ankle still does not have full range of motion and is somewhat weak from lack of use.

Our car keeps going and isn‚Äôt too worn looking. 10 years old but only about 66,800 miles as it was my errand car in Atlanta. We cleaned it thoroughly this week.3. Coffee, lots of nice dark French roast coffee. Thankful every day for this lol.4. I have decided to pull out anything that is being stored and not used. I will use and enjoy it or send it on. Started with this 1930s tourist trade Navajo rug that was a gift from my uncle to my Mom. We had it hanging on the wall in Atlanta, but here it is going on the floor beside the bed. I am enjoying using it as rug after storing it for over 3 years. It makes me happy when I see it.5. I have an afghan my Grandma crocheted. I recently ordered a new throw that got stuck in pandemic distribution limbo so I cancelled the order. I never use the one Grandma made because she did open weave crochet to hook the blocks together and as a result there are lots of cold spots even though it is acrylic. I was attracted to the one I ordered because of the texture it had from cables.¬†I can hand sew some of rows of Grandma‚Äôs together to create an appealing texture and make it more useful. I‚Äôm happy to have a little project. The dog clearly doesn‚Äôt mind it the way it is now though!¬†6. Brownies made by me on a high level of of chocolate craving.

{"title": "No fires this time - Just lots of pine needles to sweep up", "date": "Wednesday, October 28, 2020", "text": "We were on high alert for 2 days in case any wildfires started near us but lucked out this time perhaps because of so many fires the last 2 fire seasons. The high alert is because of the so called Santa Ana winds elsewhere called Diablo winds.It simply means very high sustained winds blowing towards the coast and capable of causing fast moving fires. The names come from earlier California residents seeing the winds seeming to come out of canyons with the names above. Actually has to do with large sustained air pressure systems.Anyway, the fires that do start are terrifying because they can spread so fast, far and unpredictably as the winds occur during our dry season when the mountains and canyon vegetation is tinder dry. Even an embers carried far by the wind can start a new fire. That makes it very difficult to get them under control and put out.So far this year it has been other areas that have caught fire. The latest is two fires to break out in Orange County quite a ways south of us. Fire season isn‚Äôt over but the winds have stopped for now thank goodness.

Bonus was that they sent us home with a batch of pulled pork which made a great dinner entree.2. My office rearranging and refreshing is working out well. I still want to find a small plant for the cabinet by the window and pick something from our stored art/keepsakes to hang on the wall over the printer.3. I was able to walk the dog on the usual short route I was taking with her before surgery. She is out of shape too but it will be quite a while before we can do the long route so that is ok. We old girls will build our strength and stamina back up together.4. I decided to stick with the mobile hairdresser for now even though hair salons have reopened here. Less exposure to COVID, less cost and we both get haircuts. The first one grew out ok so I am thankful this is available to us. The lower cost means we can tip very generously and help an entrepreneur.¬†5. We had fun as usual playing our speedy with no scorekeeping version of Scrabble. Puts the emphasis on playing the whole board and coming up with words quickly. Works for us.¬†6. Sitting with the front door open listening to 2 or 3 owls hooting.

Of course they are both working long hours at home in front of their computers and we are retired which already has its own groundhog day implications.I've been listing my gratitude for my Thankful Thursday posts and it turns out that is a recommended strategy. Now that I'm well on the road to full recovery from my foot surgery I find I need more than piles of books to read and streaming shows to watch.I'm adding regular exercise back in along with my physical therapy. Short term focus - what will I do today - plus things to look forward to are also helping me.One thing that struck me in our conversation was the need for some structure to set the days apart and have a week and weekends. The idea of meal planning by day of the week (Taco Tuesday!) to have something to look forward to was one brainstorm our son and DIL had. We did have fun with Macaroni and Cheese Monday or Salami Saturday ideas.¬†I tend to cook based on what I feel like eating and energy level so that isn't my first choice but I think having a \"it's Wednesday so I get to do x\" approach is helpful.

I used to go stand under it on a sunny day and the whole world had a rosy glow.¬†But onward to 2020 and my Fall Bucket List!My desire to stay healthy and other people‚Äôs desire to take the risk and just party on means a bucket list limited to my home, safe exercise options and mostly family social time plus more use of media to stay in touch and in the world.So if I am going to continue to be home almost all the time I‚Äôd better:Do some nesting activities1. Try out different recipes and ways of cooking. I‚Äôm thinking low sodium BBQ sauce, sheet pan meals, air fryer sweet potato fries, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread, flat bread and scones or small biscotti as possibilities.2. Add to our safety at home and for emergencies. I‚Äôm considering a non slip mat for main shower, head lamps for power outages or emergency evacuation, and more pantry stocking up. We also need to put up one more smoke alarm.3. Figure out where to store the equipment used while recovering from foot surgery.¬†Small home but other foot will have to have same surgery in a year or two. Sigh.4. Clear out guest closet of stored items not needed. See above for why needed.5. Improve our cyber security. Focus on a password manager and backup system decisions and activation.Help others affected by the pandemic6.¬†Make larger than usual donations to targeted charitable and cultural organizations. I‚Äôm targeting Foodshare, Family Justice Center (abuse has increased), and public radio.Spend time with MY important people7.¬†Experiment with ways to be more social and to have date nights while keeping risk low. Try eating outside? Drinks on the patio?¬†8.¬†See our granddaughter, son & DIL in person again if safety permits. I need to find out what their plans are for celebrating her 4th birthday and Thanksgiving in November.Explore the world in many ways and entertain myself from my home9.¬†Read more widely and intelligently. Now to figure out what that means. One of my aunts used to set a reading subject focus for each winter. Might have to try that for Fall.10.¬†Utilize media in different ways. Try digital magazines, podcasts, etc.11.¬† Make art. Since I can‚Äôt visit exhibits in person now which is a favorite activity, I need to spend more time being creative myself. First step will to be to use the art journaling subscription box I just ordered. I also ordered a small folding table to use for sewing and creative projects.12. Find a series/show to binge watch and get hooked.¬†Hubby got hooked on Ozark so I need to find one too.So there you have it!

They both are telecommuting just as they were at their house. The dog is ecstatic to have more people to pet her! Haven‚Äôt had this long a visit with them since moving back to California. - On Sunday late afternoon we FaceTimed with the Berkeley family and mostly had a long visit with our almost 4 year old granddaughter who was quite chatty but then would just walk away for a bit and come back with a new topic, activity to show us or having gone to the bathroom lol. Her mom was cooking nearby and would chat till she came back. Almost like being there without the hugs and snuggles though.- No more walking boot! Can‚Äôt do a happy dance yet though. And was able to get a flu shot. Yeah for health.- To use up molasses I made a gingerbread cake with a lower calorie recipe. We had it for the ‚Äúkids‚Äù afternoon work break or tea time as they call it. Light and delicious even though I was short on molasses so subbed brown sugar for white to up the flavor.- Wore the the second of two new Fall tops I bought recently and really like it. With shorts both for the weather and morning PT workout."},

On the other hand, although I don‚Äôt keep a gratitude journal I‚Äôm trying hard to find bits of happiness.Btw, we are being extra cautious about avoiding Covid risk because of age, my experience 16 years ago of virus caused heart inflammation and acute congestive heart failed (fully recovered but it took years) and that affecting some Covid patients, and hubby‚Äôs auto immune caused overactive immune system putting him at risk. We are lucky we can take great care but it makes little bits of happiness more important to note and harder to find as we are doing less.- I was quite pleased with the quality of physical therapy provided in my first two visits and am happy to be on my way with that. Moving to just a cane to help with balance as I focus on being able to walk correctly again.- I had my women‚Äôs club schedule a practice Zoom session for those who are new to it or simply a bit uncomfortable. We had 5 log in and found one who needs more assistance so I was pleased we did it. Our primary program speaker joined us to make sure we coul enable him to share docs on the screen.- Then we had our first general club meeting since March and it went very well. Great program about the Ventura County Family Justice Center which is a one stop shop for victims and survivors of crime. We stayed on to chat after the program and got some more ideas for programs (emergency preparedness seems most apt in the midst of fires), an on line mystery theater where you each get roles, online crafting and so on. Attendance was 50% so we need to grow that but I am very pleased.- The dog slept past 4:30 am most days which makes me very happy although being old girls together I do understand the call of the bladder.- We have the space to provide our local son and DIL with a place to stay and work so they could escape the highly unhealthy smoke filled air in Pasadena. We head their way when fires are out here and they come here.- The dog got a haircut today that cost almost 3 times what my garage stylist charged but she looks great and was quite happy when I picked her up."},

Not complaining lol.- Got really bored and really tired of reading and laying around. Initially not able to sit with my foot down for long as it still swells and needs to be elevated but that got better. Did start taking showers - bliss. Was really glad we have grab bars, a no slip shower floor and the borrowed shower seat for when I need to wash my feet.Week 7 & 8:- The bone is healed although the incision and bottom of foot are still tender and my foot not very flexible. I am walking a bit wonky but able to get up in middle of night with only one crutch for balance at the start of week 7 and no crutch by ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† No more knee scooter!- Wearing a compression ankle sock and foam toe separator except at night.

It cost much less to rent them by to month - less than the 2 week fee - so I have some time yet to get them back.- Physical therapy twice a week for now.¬†EDIT: I ended up getting a cane to help with walking without the boot. I was wobbling from a week ankle and not taking a normal length step with my unaffected foot but the cane solved that."},

Surgery was quick as was recovery room time.¬†I was able to get in the car with the seat back as far as possible, support from the nurse, and having practiced the move required to not bang my foot! I also was able to leverage out of the car with Hubby's help and use the knee scooter as we had practiced to get in the house and into bed.So the outpatient surgery is over. Now what?¬†Well I definitely cannot put my foot down as there is no weight bearing for the first 3 weeks.Week 1:- This was the most painful part especially the first 3 to 4 days. Painkiller plus anti-nausea patch, Ibuprofen to reduce swelling, icing as directed, elevating my foot religiously, sleeping a lot. Washed up only and washed my hair in the kitchen sink.¬†- Day 5 saw the Dr. and the bandaging came off and the cast went on. I quite easily scootered in and out of the office. Quick improvement from first couple of days.Week 2 & 3:¬†- Found that my knee started hurting now that I was scooting around a lot more. We padded the scooter with foam and that helped but I also had to use it less. Other leg got tired.- Did not feel confident trying to take a shower so continued with sponge baths and kitchen sink shampoos. Continued icing, elevating and at night first painkiller and then just Tylenol. Had to stop Ibuprofen due to it bothering my stomach but icing and elevation do the same thing.- Doing Zoom meetings and FaceTime calls from the couch with my foot up and my iPad on the bed tray.- Dr. removed cast and I started wearing the walking boot except at night or when resting on couch. You also use a little foam toe separator which wouldn't stay on so I added a lightweight sock and that worked and also protected the tender incision. Started putting lotion with vitamin E on incision and foot.Not bad for just 3 weeks from surgery!"},
{"title": "My experience with bunion surgery: Preparing for surgery (Part 1)", "date": "Sunday, September 6, 2020", "text": "I've had several people mention that they may have bunion surgery in the future so I thought I'd share some of my personal experience with preparation and recovery. There are lots of different types of bunion surgery and protocols so take this for what it is - one person's experience.¬†I am glad I had the surgery as once fully recovered ¬†walking longer distances should be pain free.What was they type of surgery I had? A Lapidus Bunionectomy.¬†\"A Lapidus bunionectomy is a procedure in which the first metatarsal bone is fixated to the medial cuneiform bone with a plate and screws to stabilize and correct a moderate to severe bunion. ¬†The procedure involves removing a small wedge of bone at the base of the metatarsal to allow for reduction of the bunion. ¬†Fusing the joint at the base of the metatarsal helps prevent any possible return of the deformity.\"A sample x-ray of what they do - not my foot!My before surgery prep for recovery:- I read online about recommendations for what you will need and what to try ahead of time. My Dr. is a good surgeon but not great on detailed info about anything but surgery. Lots of good info available though.- Clearly you need a caretaker for the early weeks. I'm lucky I had a live in one and thus not only I but also our dog were taken care of.- Make sure you have clothes and sleepwear that will fit over a very bulky bandage almost to your knee, then a cast and then a walking boot. You will also need shoes that can be loosened to fit your still swollen foot when you reach that stage. I wore very loose crop PJ bottoms to the hospital. It helped with clothes that it was warm weather but I had few options until I got the removable walking boot.- I rented a knee scooter and crutches. Borrowed a shower chair. Bought Ibuprofen, a reusable ice pack and cover, a reading pillow, a folding bed table for eating (which I ended up using when on the couch), lotion with vitamin E for my incision scar, a shower cover for the foot and leg, Got out a water bottle to make sure I drank enough to battle opioid side effects.- We picked up my pain prescription ahead of time. I should have also gotten an anti-nausea patch prescription ahead of time as I know opioid painkillers make me nauseous. Would have save the surgery day evening scramble to get that after I threw up.- We arranged a couch area so I could be out of bed each day from the beginning. We set up a charging station, a small table I could reach laying down, 2 pillows for elevating my foot, Made room to get to the couch with the knee scooter and practiced. Covered the couch so no blood would get on it.¬†- We set up the guest bedroom. Again cleared it to make room for using the knee scooter and practiced. Untucked the sheets so I could set up 2 pillows for foot elevation and to keep the recovering foot from being under the covers.- We decided the guest bath was the best for access and safety. Set it up with everything I would use. Practiced how to maneuver the knee scooter and how to leverage myself on and off the toilet with just one leg available.- I practiced getting over the front door threshold with the knee scooter so when I came home there wouldn't be a problem.- We stocked up on food and I downloaded a lot of easy reading books onto my Kindle.- Realize most of your shoes won't fit your still swollen boot once you can put on a shoe. It is summer and I have a pair of very adjustable sandals were the only thing that worked once I needed to wear one.- What else would I do next time? I‚Äôd get a small cart to load up and push with one hand while using the scooter or a crutch. It was tiring to carry things back and forth with one hand. I‚Äôd make sure we had more meals in the freezer. I‚Äôd expect that I would be very tired during the day and need naps. I‚Äôd find out how to keep doing leg and shoulder stretches and work harder on my posture."},

Little or no wait for doctors appointments. Getting a professional haircut in my garage. Fancy take out including a cocktail in a plastic bottle. Lots of shortages in the grocery and drugstore for months. Wearing a mask and having a collection of them. Quickly using a state rest stop while wearing a mask and gloves and supplying my own toilet paper. Tracking infection and death rate public health scorecards. Having surgery with no loved one being able to wait with me before and after. Handing off my dog in the parking lot for vet visits. There are probably a few more but that captures the last six months on the new experiences side. We all know the losses side of the equation.Trying to feel like my days aren‚Äôt just oozing away from me has led me to creating a must do and want to do plan for the day.

I see lots of athleisure outfit days in my future plus more of the same purchases. I guess it is the trend right now with the masses working (or wishing they were) from home. The extent of my interaction with anyone other than Hubby is walks that are very short at the moment plus zoom meetings where you don‚Äôt see much of your outfit.I do see an exception for times like this weekend when it is supposed to hit 99 here which is quite unusual. That calls for ver loose sleeveless summer dresses. And when I can return to the excitement of trips to CVS and the grocery store I‚Äôll put on a real outfit - maybe!I do miss having a reason to dress up a bit to go out for a meal with friends or to an event.

I found myself being much less picky than usual as the pandemic looks like it will stretch on rather long and couch wear seems to be the dress code. Case in point is that I am wearing leggings and a long tee today. Comfort rules as long as they fit and I like the color.We are slowly removing things that were put in place for early recovery so the house is starting to look more normal.

And laying still in bed. Better by noon so overall a mixed day so far.I‚Äôm getting used to walking with my foot in the boot and using crutches to take some of the weight. No where to go so I take laps around the house to build leg strength, balance and weight bearing tolerance back up. I‚Äôm still using the knee scooter at night and first thing in the morning so I can carry things! Progress though.I took off the elastic bandage and washed my foot which felt really good. A small thing but doubly enjoyable because of pandemic boredom and fatigue. Just covering with a light sock now although not necessary per the dr.¬†I‚Äôm getting pain twinges still in the area of the incision but it looks like it is healthy and healing. I forgot to mention that I was surprised to find I had stitches that had to be removed very slowly as it was rather painful. I had thought there would be surgical glue or dissolving stitches. Done with it anyway.Hot weather has arrived in S Cal right on schedule so hanging out inside in air conditioning is a pleasure.

{"title": "What I‚Äôve learned so far about foot surgery recovery", "date": "Sunday, August 2, 2020", "text": "These points will not surprise anyone who has broken a leg or foot or had surgery that required no weight on a foot during recovery. Having lived for almost 71 years without that though some things are new to me.1. Getting everything you can think of ready before surgery is very important. We were caught up on laundry and groceries and figured out what furniture needed to be moved in advance. Also figure out what clothing will fit over your bandage or cast or work with a walking boot. Very little of mine will fit over the cast and dresses are a hassle with all the lying and sitting around with a leg elevated.2. Practice critical mobility situations ahead of time. We practiced getting from the car seat into the house, in and out of bed, and bathroom access. That really helped.3.If painkillers have ever made you nauseous do get an anti nausea patch as well as the painkillers ahead of time. We didn‚Äôt get the patch which meant Friday evening contact with the dr. an a pharmacy run.4. You will need help. You do not want to fall or be trying to prepare and carry food. Do get a basket for the knee walker to make carrying things easier. I wish I had one.5. Using a knee walker is great but your knee may become quite painful. Be ready to add extra padding to reduce that.And in my case and not surprising in the least, you will get bored and your dog will try to lay on you or lick you sore toes."},

Loaded up my Kindle with distraction novels. Got the pain killer prescription filled, etc. We are as ready as we can be.There is research that shows the more you know what to expect with surgery or an illness the better you cope with the negative parts and the faster you get better. Also research that show that being realistic leads to greater happiness. Hoping this proves true! Will find out after the surgery on Friday morning.See you on the other side."},

Bliss.Lots of coloring and imaginary play with stuffed animals, dress up, the toy farm, kitchen and or horses. She and papa played for 3 hours straight one morning. They also made pancakes. Our dog was usually supervising.Hubby helped our son finish a 3rd raised garden bed and start turning a coat closet into a pantry with many shelves. We transplanted lettuce into the container garden and watered plants which led to some water play. Took a couple of walks to see workers digging holes in the street and then to see how they made them back into street again. So many activities that I didn't manage to document them all!Here are the crafts projects we did.A Happy Pupday banner out of triangles of construction paper hung on a piece of yarn for our dog‚Äôs 11th birthday. Granddaughter wrote the letters herself and decided that both ‚ÄúPs‚Äù belonged on the same piece of paper because they were the same. Then we hung it across a big window and quickly moved on. A few days later we made fudgesicles and gave the dog some carrot while we enjoyed chocolate.A life size little girl outline to color in. So many giggles getting outlined made it hard to hold still and for an accurate tracing!A homemade large size matching game to play on the floor. This got played quite a few times with Nana, Papa, Mommy and Dada. We simply used colored printer paper and drew the same thing on 2 sheets for a total of 14 pieces as 10 was too easy.A neighborhood map of important places to a 3 1/2 year old. Her important places spread to an hour‚Äôs drive away to include Grandma‚Äôs house and her cousin‚Äôs house. Also included were a little fish pond up the street, a park, a fountain in a roundabout, local grocery store, Daddy‚Äôs shop in the garage, all the fruit trees she knows about and of course her house. I‚Äôm going to try to remember to do this again next summer and see how her mind has changed.We had a very full week! A walk to a rustic nearby park with a stop on the way home to see a small fishpond that also had dragonflies. Making pancakes with Papa. Picking a small bouquet for Mama and putting it on the breakfast table."},

The dog is now 11 years old and couldn't sleep during the day for the most part while we were visiting both due to her own need to keep track of everyone and everything that was happening and due to the different noises and pace of the day. She had a good time but will be catching up for days as will we.As far as I know I still am on for my foot surgery this Friday and will hear today when and where to go get my pre-op Covid test.We were concerned about places being open for us to stop as needed so we took the very un-scenic route of I-5 from northern LA to near Sacramento and then cut over to Berkeley. It worked great. Since that is the major north-south truck route, the frequently spaced state operated rest stops along the freeway were clean and almost everyone stopping wore a mask and didn't linger. There are pet relief areas as well. We packed a lunch and stop midway had nice clean and shaded picnic tables. We will keep using this route as long as the pandemic rages.So glad we went on this trip! Hopefully we can go again in the Nov-Dec time frame once my foot has healed.Check in tomorrow for our grandparenting activity summary with photos!"},

I know we read some of Sartre's writings in high school between 1965 & 1967 although exactly what escapes me. Interesting how I adopted it.

The logistics of having places to stop along the way is shifting our drive to the truck heavy and scenery deficient I-5. That assures us of open and cleaned rest stops though. Here are guidelines on how to safely use a public restroom when traveling during the pandemic (public restroom safety)- Caught up on my club president to do list except for finishing my calls to members. Unfortunately we have concluded we need to change the locks on the clubhouse and start over with key and code distribution. We counted keys today! We are also revising the rental agreements and asking everyone to sign new ones. A Covid policy on when and how we will reopen the clubhouse for use is written and in place. On to the fun stuff hopefully.- Picked up a library book that I requested just before the pandemic. Their curbside pick up process is great. Don't think I will read the book though as it looks tedious.- Taking forever to finish deep cleaning the kitchen and will do the floor and call it done for now.- Diligently followed up with doctors (not impressed with their communication and follow up!) and as expected my cardiac health is fine with no risk for surgery. Because of our planned trip surgery will now occur late July or early August with 10 to 12 weeks of recovery. I missed the low point of Covid infections.

Intermittent power outages will be coming. Something more to think about.What to do? Pretty much all of this applies to earthquake prep too.I'm going to think through 7 days of meals + fluids with no power and make sure we have that on hand for us and the dog. Then there is the personal sanitation plan.I've also realized we need to freeze ice to move to the frig during a power outage to lengthen the time our refrigerated food is edible. We also need to get thermometers for the frig and freezer so we know if the food is still safe.Then there is the how to cook uncooked meat in the freezer. We don't want to get a grill so I think I'm going to ask friends right around me if they have one. We could cook and share the result rather than tossing it. Also, I think I will start freezing more cooked meats that could be thawed and eaten without reheating if necessary.Power supplies for charging phones and providing light? Solar chargers and lights plus battery operated lanterns are going to be needed.Then there is preparing to have to evacuate again if fires are too close or may cutoff evacuation routes. Another project but we had practice with this one last year.At least we now have seismic activated latches on all the cupboard doors housing breakables. Hubby is installing seismic straps on both TVs today and I am investigating what to use to strap the computer monitor. We had the water heater strapped correctly when we moved in and we only have electricity so no natural gas fire hazard concerns.I'm focusing on the positive and using my planning and coping skills. Almost zero risk of hurricanes or tornadoes! No blizzards or floods! No locust hoards!Seriously - we are in a great position to be able to buy what makes sense and we have local family to evacuate to if needed. Plus we purchased earthquake insurance and have fire coverage in our homeowner's policy so if a lot of damage was to occur we would get some financial relief."},

Salons opened a week ago.- We have been going to the grocery store, drugstore, and Home Depot. Also picking up take out but taking turns and only one going at a time.- Hugged our son and DIL with faces turned away when we saw them for the first time since March 3rd, but had doors open to get air circulation while we visited. We bought take out for lunch.- Had drinks with another couple on their patio sitting about 10 feet apart.- Talk to neighbors outside while standing very far apart.- With a mask on I have been to see 2 Drs in person and taken the dog to the groomers and vet.- We each take walks, but stay away from other people.- Talked with one other person at our clubhouse while staying at least 10 feet apart.How are you interpreting what is safe for you and others given where you live and your personal situation?"},

And then there is just plain illness/infirmity.Deciding how long to have pantry last is another question as is where to store things and make sure nothing gets wasted. Making my head hurt but I think it is important to think through and make decisions.So later this week we will buy some canned green beans because we have canned fruit, tomatoes and beans but no veggies as we prefer fresh or frozen. I also found out we were low on a few spices.Last grocery store trip there wasn't any dishwasher soap or dish soap oddly. So I went to CVS and they had a few of each and I added more to our supplies along with more laundry soap. I had to pick up a gel re-freezable ice pack for the upcoming foot surgery so made the trip useful.We also ordered some shaking activated cupboard latches to see if they will work on our kitchen cabinets. If everything falls out of your cabinets and breaks you have a dangerous broken glass & china sticky mess.We had baby latches on the upper cabinets in our former California home and nothing in the kitchen broke during the Northridge earthquake. If these work we will get enough to finish the job. Since we thought we were going to move we hadn't really done all we need to do from a safety perspective.I hate having to think about these things and spend the effort to manage supplies. I am not at all of the \"prepper\" mindset just aware that natural and health disasters happen.Have you reconsidered you pantry or home supplies after the last 10 weeks of supply chain shortages and wanting to avoid stores?"},

Haven't seen them in person for about 3 months despite them living just an hour away. They have been so diligent in their own social distancing - probably more so than we have been. It was a wonderful dose of love and connection.2. I asked Hubby to pick up some flowers when he did the Trader Joe's run and he came home with the vibrant bouquet above. I'm really enjoying them.3. Then there was my continued search of the library's website to see what they are offering while closed. I managed to sign up for access to Hoopla and Kanopy and tried using the Zip Books program to order a new hardcover book purchased by the library and delivered to my door by Amazon Prime!So happy to get the brand new book Riviera Gold by Laurie King - the next in a series I have really enjoyed. Normally you get to keep the book for 14 days and then turn it into the library in person so it can be added to their system and removed from you checked books. You can request 2 a month up to 5 a year. Joy!4. Little poodle girl went to the groomers and came home looking spiffy and feeling much cooler.5. My hair salon opens Monday and I'm hoping to get an appointment in the first half of June.6. All the car required for its annual servicing was an oil change. Lots of car repair/maintenance expenses a few months ago so that was great!Hope you had some good things happen this past week."},

They can visit because their grandmother is helping babysit at both homes on alternating weeks as all the parents are working full time from home. Same germ pool.Turns out he has been getting the crates for a long time although he gets one for older kids now. So he got to show her how it all worked and they did 2 projects together. I got a photo of them beaming after finishing the first one! Her Mom said they were so happy. Win!We FaceTimed them yesterday testing out my new iPad in the process. She showed us what she had made and what was left do do in the crate. Then we got a tour of the vegetable garden she is helping put in in their back yard. It has taken a while but they have found their stride to having her home full time in addition to working.Koala Crates are STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) projects aimed at the targeted age group. Including a book is an add on which I did as she loves books.Her first kit was themed about rainbows. So the whole thing is like what a good pre-school would do to teach with multiple activities around a theme.The first project they did was make a rainbow pillow where you had to put the rainbow decoration on in the right order. Then there was an easy dyeing project that taught color transfer using tissue paper and a small tote bag. There is a third one but I don't know what it is yet.I only did 3 months to see how it goes and also to see if there is time for something like this once her pre-school is back in session. I expect we will be continuing it though and just segue into the next age group as needed."},

Right now it may have to be postponed.Questions the doc has to get answered: Do I have to see a cardiologist to get approval given that won't be general anesthesia? Do I have to redo blood tests since no one told me it had to be one week or less before surgery? Where do I go and when to get the Covid swab test? Yikes.Trying to roll with it right now as this is just another situation where we are all trying to figure out how to operate in this strange pandemic.I'm still moving forward with getting everything in shape to ignore for the first 2 weeks of June and if it happens later this will have been a drill! Post foot surgery I just want to focus on recovering and entertaining myself and not feel any need to be productive or keep up with things. Thank goodness Hubby is so good about taking care of everything and a good cook too.Sadly my older son and I agreed that them coming to visit in person this weekend with surgery planned wasn't wise. I survived only seeing them a couple times a year when we lived in Atlanta, but they are so close now!So progress the last few days -- Found one 6 week OLLI course I want to take online - 30,000 Year of History at CSUCI (Cal State Chanel Islands). Begins with the Chumash Indian settlements. Starts June 15th so will work out well.- I've been slowly getting my iPad set up for ease of use and getting plenty of books lined up.- I've been enjoying going through Starbucks drive thru occasionally for a skinny mocha latte and a brownie may have snuck in there today too.- Chipping away at emails and calls for my club. The leadership team is making great progress with ideas to go into our plan for the year.- I used the medical equipment supply closet at my HOA office to borrow crutches and a shower seat but learned that the Methodist church in town also has a lending closet. Might want to check that out in your location vs buying or renting. Will have to rent the knee scooter but that is fine.- Realized I had no refills left on a prescription and got that taken care of at my Dr's appointment today. Btw, I haven't warmed to this Dr previously but she was much more personable and open today I'm sure because the situation has us all a bit off kilter. She even joked around a bit. Happier with her for now."},

I'm not going to be as lucky though so I'm thinking it will be late July or August before I can get a haircut. Last one was Feb 28th.Moving on to what is possible to get done.- Did the basic iPad set up. Now I need to practice using it before I set up anything else lol. I have not been an Apple product user before and it is rather a challenge to do everything differently.- Donated to a fundraiser for our granddaughter's nursery school/day care to try to help it survive. Tragic how day care is going to disappear if governments don't help them survive. How are people going to go back to work with no school or day care?-¬† Given the inability to donate decluttered items I'm taking a second look at everything to see how it can be modified or used differently. Turned a pair of old capris that were very out of style into shorts that will work well for exercise walking and perhaps work with post-surgery splint/cast.- I went to the historic clubhouse building to check out how badly the skirting needs replacing (it does) and also found that the clapboard on 2 sides probably need repainting as well. Putting it on the list for discussion and potential budget planning.- While there picked up a stack of mindless paperback novels for recovery reading. The club has a book discussion group and a Little Library so there are always books.- Returned the bed table/lap desk I had ordered as it was very heavy and ordered a lightweight plastic one. Saved money in the process.- My foam foot elevating pillow arrived and although it is returnable I can't imagine how we would compress it sufficiently to get it back in the box lol.- Read this interesting blog post about assessing scientifically the risk of catching Covid-19 in different situations. This was referenced on CNN online. It won't change my behavior but once again a calm recitation of fact is helpful.¬† The risks: Know how to avoid them"},

It also means I won't have to borrow Hubby's laptop for Zoom (my desktop computer is too old to support it).Drawing -¬†Pulled out the only remaining art supply I have after decluttering for our move 3 years ago. I kept my Dad's colored artist pencils and also basic pencil and ink drawing supplies. I then bought a cheap 50 page sketch book at CVS and am trying to do one drawing a week. I got tired of the adult coloring book I had picked up right before everything closed lol.At this point I'm trying to remember how to use colored pencils artistically, playing with color and making up what I draw so not being concerned with the drawing part so much. The activity does turn of the analytical, worrying part of the brain - a nice break at this time. If I keep at it I'll probably buy a set of watercolor markers to play with too.Planning -¬†As I've mentioned there are two things I'm in planning mode for and since planning is one of my \"superpowers\" it is keeping me occupied part of the time.There is the preparation and anxiety management for my upcoming bunion surgery. First time I will have had surgery that keeps me from being able to walk on one foot so there is that. Plus I won't be able to walk the dog, do chores, sit at my desk for a while so some logistics to think through so it isn't too difficult.Then there is taking on a 2 year term as President of a 110 + year old women's club that also owns a historic building. Just in time to not be able to hold any meetings in person. Just a bit of planning and creativity and team leadership there. This isn't something I particularly wanted but no one else stepped up to do it.Random New Experiences -There is the shopping for face masks that fit and are at least slightly effective, dodging those who aren't social distancing at the grocery store or when taking walks, becoming a dog groomer for thankfully just one small dog who holds very still, playing games with a 3 year old granddaughter via technology and snail mail, and all the other things that go with being on a Stay at Home order.You are invited to the Inlinkz link party!Click here to enter"},

Some really sick looking folks there and some were still being ridiculous about masks. I've decided to look at it as we are all in pre-school regarding this and some catch on quickly and do what is asked, some rebel by only covering their nose and not their mouth or standing too close to others, and one couple shows up without masks and the excuse that \"our masks are in the car\" (duh).- Trying to figure out the minimum I have to do re: club leadership before I am down from painkillers for a week or two. I did postpone the next exec. committee for a week so hopefully I'll be able to think by then.- Ordered a leg raising thingy from Amazon to keep my foot above my heart for first week or more. I decided I would not stay on a stack of pillows while asleep as I don't sleep on my back usually and would roll over. This should prevent that.- Added to order a nifty thing to cover that leg when I am able to shower and wide leg crop lounge pants so I have something to wear home that will fit over whatever splint or cast is on my foot and lower leg.- Also ordered a bed tray/lap desk with legs so I'll be able to eat and watch stuff on my NEW iPad. Yes, I actually broke down and ordered an iPad to entertain myself and do FaceTime and Zoom calls.- Still have to see if I can borrow crutches, etc. and see how I am going to get around.- Lots more to do but then I do have time lol.

No in store shopping, no malls, no personal services. This won't change our lives any right now.I just found out my bunion surgery is scheduled for June 1st - yikes. I think hospitals are trying to get their regular business back in ASAP if they haven't been Covid centers.

Our county is easing just a tiny bit for retail with curbside pickup and some other type of businesses that can prove they are meeting certain requirements.- I finally gave our dog a haircut using dog grooming scissors and she held really still for me. I can't imagine doing it with a wiggly dog. I did skip her tail and ears as they don't make her hot. She seems quite happy to be rid of the equivalent of a heavy sweater!

So I ordered some chicken breasts from a local restaurants \"market\" and we got take out dinner too. I am seeing that my lets see what is available approach to the grocery scavenger hunt is what is working best. Hubby plans to go to Trader Joe's on Wednesday so we'll see what he can get there. Not complaining as it quite possible to eat really well with what is in the stores - just maybe not what you have in mind.I gave up on the second batch of gifted homemade masks as they don't fit as well as the first ones so I ordered one from an Etsy vendor. Hopefully it fits. I like the looks of the LA Made ones but they are only selling in batches of 5 which will be needed if we have to start wearing them everywhere in the future but is too many right now.I am now officially President of my women's club and what a challenge it is going to be to keep our members involved, engaged and feeling that the club is worthwhile if we can't in fact have meetings. It will be interesting to see what we all come up with.Our first step was to pay for a Zoom subscription that allows two hosts so we can have longer meetings that way. Everything else will have a Plan A (normal) and a Plan B (socially distanced) and we will have to create new socializing and service avenues. Well I did want a project!It is interesting though that some our renters who give dance lessons, etc. are assuming they will be able to start back up on July 1st. I'm happy that they are optimistic.If any of you are in groups that are experimenting with ways to continue while distancing let me know what is working please."},
{"title": "Week 7 of Shutdown: TB vs Covid-19", "date": "Sunday, May 3, 2020", "text": "My maternal grandmother died in 1930 when my Mom was almost 9 but my Mom didn't remember her being at home with the family because she had been in a TB sanatorium since my Mom was quite young. She did remember having to have TB tests every few months for years as a child and standing outside a building with her younger brother one Easter so their Mom could see them through the window.Why do I bring this up? Well, TB was endemic for centuries until post WWII and killed about 60,000 people in the US every year for decades and decades. The development of an antibiotic that can treat it changed its impact. It is also an airborne disease in expelled droplets from coughing or even breathing just like Covid-19. Unlike smallpox for which there is a vaccine, TB still is with us and continues to kill although at a much lower rate since treatment is available although drug resistant strains have emerged.The difference between TB and Covid-19 was that TB could take years to kill you even infecting you as a child and not being evident as a disease until you were an adult or lying dormant for decades before becoming active. Not the case with what we are experiencing as far as we know.I'm still working my way through the book Epidemics and Society and am obviously in the TB chapter. What I am finding interesting is the extensive public health campaigns that occurred to change behavior and get diagnoses once the cause of TB and scientific evidence of how to reduce its transmission was known but before there was an antibiotic that worked. We are falling far short in this arena right now. I'm not trying to diminish the abuses that occurred in the quest to defeat TB, just saying that lots of resources were dedicated to identifying and trying to treat those infected and to slow the spread.Of all the diseases that I have read about so far in this book - plague, smallpox and others - TB seems to be the most like what we are experiencing in terms of transmission vectors and appropriate ways to reduce infection and death rates until there is a cure. It also seems very similar to the 1918 flu pandemic in terms of infection ease.This is not the first time society has had to deal with something like this although it is the first time almost all of us have had to cope with this type of situation."},

I'm starting to ramp up with info and ideas as to how to be President of my Women's (and Men's) club during this pandemic. I think we will do some online sales to members and their friends of our inventory of holiday craft items and then take orders for Christmas in July. We need to raise funds even though we are shutdown as we have a building to support. Also looking for ways to engage members over the summer and probably into the fall without having meetings.2. Enjoying more contact with my East coast cousins. Letters and emails. Looking forward to when I can see them again. Also looked around the house to see what we could mail our granddaughter and found some balloons to stick in a card. She has a lot of fun with balloons.3. After initially dismissing the idea I am using the adult coloring book I purchased at the Friends of the Library bookstore at the front end of this mess. It turns my brain off for a while. I also picked up a sketch book/art journal at CVS - 50 pages to fill.4. We are generally well stocked with food and (gasp) were able to buy toilet paper today. Kleenex remains scarce.5. These six weeks have shown me that I want to focus in more detail on making sure we are prepared to get through a post-earthquake scenario of no utilities for up to 2 weeks. We have prepared some but this has taught me the difference between utilities exist and they don't preparedness!6. I am super impressed (but not surprised) with the creativity and resilience our sons and DILs are demonstrating. One pair are making sourdough bread and crackers, buying flour from a nearby bakery, and building raised beds in their backyard and involving their 3 1/2 year old. The others are foraging for fun and got permission to use some garden space at a nearby small college which of course has no students in residence now. They have also had socially distanced happy hour on the yard space in front of their condo, done drop offs of birthday cakes and other food for friends who live alone and instituted tea time to take an afternoon break from work. I'm a happy and proud Mom.6. I entered our bank info at the IRS website in hopes of not having to get a check with Trump's signature. I plan on making additional donations to the county food bank system, animal rescue services out of the stimulus money. Perhaps donate to the Democratic Senate campaign fund, Planned Parenthood, RAICES, and ACLU also.7. I purchased a sweater \"shaver\" and guess what - it works. Rescued an old warm winter cardigan that was looking shabby for at least one more season. I have at least one other sweater that needs a little but much less help.8. Received our first of two auto insurance refunds for the pandemic driving less situation. A whopping $20.72 but hey, I'll take it.9. I asked the friend who made us each a mask if she would make one more for me and she sent over two that she had leftover! Now we each have 2 so if one isn't dry after washing we will have another.10. Then a neighbor asked if we had trouble finding any food items and wanted them to look when the went shopping today and came back with white sugar for baking. I'm a lucky person.10. Cleaned up the donated books that were sitting at our clubhouse. Put new stock in the Little Library out front in hopes someone local will appreciate the resource with the library closed.12. I have half a can of leftover enchilada sauce, some chicken and no tortillas. Thank goodness for Allrecipes ingredient search function. Chicken enchilada soup tonight!13.

Of course that isn't the plan Georgia and some other states are following so we can probably expect higher infection rates to return in those places and since people cross state boundaries there goes the infection rate elsewhere perhaps.But I digress. What he wrote a few days ago is a long blog post that includes the following. He then goes on to say it isn't that simply though. Will there be a supply chain to enable restaurants to operate, will they be profitable, how will their employees get to work, etc. All things to think about.\"Most developed countries will be moving into the second phase of the epidemic in the next two months. In one sense, it is easy to describe this next phase. It is semi-normal. People can go out, but not as often, and not to crowded places. Picture restaurants that only seat people at every other table, and airplanes where every middle seat is empty. Schools are open, but you can‚Äôt fill a stadium with 70,000 people. People are working some and spending some of their earnings, but not as much as they were before the pandemic. In short, times are abnormal but not as abnormal as during the first phase.\"For the full blog post by Bill Gates go¬†here"},

I have them to the point of at least trying to wear them now.I am still contemplating the best use of a pair of flannel PJ bottoms that don't fit and are pretty worn out.

It was a strangely satisfying day with chores, exercise, dog walks, a nap, and comfort food.Monday, Day 36 - Our 3 graduating senior $1500 scholarship winners were picked and they all are not only good students but have consistently demonstrated how motivated they are to continue their education and pursue a career goal despite a low income families. Our club will have to simply mail them their check instead of presenting it at our May meeting but we made it happen!I listened to some of Governor Newsom's daily briefing where they discussed progress on closing the digital divide for rural and economically disadvantage students. He is really committed to making that happen to help reduce the educational imbalance. He also spoke very compassionately about the deaths so far as not being a number but lives that had meaning and were cherished.I started rethinking how I am using my days during this period and my goals/bucket list. So far I've decided that I need to do something that needs doing but I really don't want to do plus something I simply want to do each day. Throw in dog walks, exercise, cooking, reading, connecting with others, etc. and the day will feel pretty good.I was able to drop off a UPS return package although the locations hours are seriously reduced. I will need to identify a UPS drop box for future use.I found out a delightful twenty-something cousin got engaged to a very nice man she has been with for at least 2 years - how lovely!Tuesday, Day 37 - Oh my! I stayed up most of the night reading since I couldn't fall asleep. A slow day resulted. I decided to be a realistic optimist and booked a haircut for May 27th and our younger son turned 37.Wednesday, Day 38¬†- The new senior hour at my local Vons is quite early even for me and still has people not social distancing - especially staff who were pulling their masks down to chat! They shifted the senior time to 6 to 7 am M-F and I got there at 6:40. Good thing I'm an early riser lol.Although sales seem to only be for packaged manufactured products, the on sheet flyer for Vons this week did have a $5 coupon if you spent at least $50. Did that.What was particularly interesting was how what is missing from the shelves or limited in quantity continues to shift based on demand and ease of producing more than the usual annual purchases. Today it was dried beans/lentils/split peas, rice and pasta that were mostly missing. Still no liquid hand soap, disinfectant, or yeast and little baking soda, flour and sugar. Lots of eggs and no limit on bottled water. A little bit of toilet paper. Lots of things like salad dressing, soda and other manufactured items. Plenty of bread, meat, dairy, produce and alcohol.I'm assuming the dried beans, etc. problem will continue until a new crop is produced. And I will have to make a stop at a rarely used store to try to get the chicken we like.What did we have for dinner?Dinner continues to be the meal we have together and put the most effort into although sometimes that is pretty minimal!Sunday - Turkey burgers, broccoli, cornMonday - Homemade minestrone soup and garlic breadTuesday - Chicken breast with sauteed green pepper, onions & green salsa, refried beans and riceWednesday - Leftover minestrone soup, green salad and garlic bread"},

A fun thing they are doing is finding ways to do urban foraging near downtown Pasadena. Kumquats from a random tree not owned by a resident and dandelion leaf salad from a commercial lot waiting for development and not being mowed. They are in the midst of a no grocery shopping challenge for themselves so the fresh fruit and greens were welcomed. Their next planned grocery stock up is May 1st. They are continuing though to make and deliver treats for friends who live alone.They are good at finding the positive each day."},

I am going to make a note to do this every 3 months so they don't have to be cut back so drastically once a year. I think they will look better as a result and it will be easier for the gardening crew to mow under them.Took a nice long walk as well as taking the dog for a walk.Finished watching BBC's Wartime Kitchen & Garden which I thoroughly enjoyed.Found several more books to download on my Kindle and read for a couple of hours."},

I expect that will get extended too. At least we were expecting this. Some people will be feeling shocked, desperate because of lack of employment, resistant, etc. We are resigned.Yesterday we had a discussion with our son about how it was pretty impossible to drive up to help them out even if we felt it was safe and were allowed to. No or very few restrooms open anywhere which is reasonable but a problem for a day long drive. He would love to have us come for a month or two and help with childcare as his work is very busy and our DIL is also working full time. I'm happy that they still have a good income but miss them terribly.Carrying On:Today it was all about little things that made for a pleasant day.I have been watching on YouTube the old 8 episode BBC show called Wartime Kitchen and Garden. I'm on episode 6 and have liked them all except for the part about cooking a pig's head. Call me squeamish or not ready to see in quite this way the reminder of where our pork comes from.I took my mask, non-essentials random shopping list, a 25% off coupon and $9 worth of ExtraBucks to CVS this morning. There were about 3 other shoppers and mostly they were at the pharmacy. I got all but one item on the list which made me happy and I didn't have to try to order these things from Amazon and wait a month for delivery. The one item they didn't have was a nice to have so no problem.Made a batch of 24 pumpkin raisin pecan muffins and my taste testing shows they are really good LOL.Talked to my across the street friend when I took the dog out - properly social distanced of course.Later on the dog wanted a good cuddle in my lap which was nice. I let her decide when she wants pets and cuddles as she can still be jumpy when you reach for her even after all these years due to her early abusive owner. She is a very loving dog though - fortunately. If I say \"May I pet you?\" she almost always walks toward me and is happy."},

A gorgeous day so I took the dog on a good long walk and then took a quite long one by myself. Ordered a couple of short sleeve tees and sent back a couple I had previously ordered and that were way bigger than the size listed.Pruned another bush. We are quite limited in the amount of trash we can put out so I will finish after tomorrow's trash pick up.Was unable to finish the scholarship application review as 4 were inadvertently not emailed to us. I'm sure they will come soon. So far I have picked out 6 of 12 reviewed for further analysis. Five left to review. Lots of compelling stories and goals and initiative so far in their young lives. I always want to give to all of them but we can only do 3.Finished reviewing all the non-Christmas CDs my son and DIL passed on. I've kept 33 for now and 203 have been or will be donated. Now for the 15 Christmas ones! My DIL loves Christmas and since I am thoroughly tired of the few we have I'll pick out some new ones and pass the rest on.Got a note from another cousin and I loved the line where she said her husband is \"already a self-isolating kind of guy\" and so isn't having as much difficulty with this as she is. She teaches high school art and is trying to do that remotely. My younger son had commented that he wasn't struggling as much with the stay at home order as his wife as he realized that staying home and doing projects was exactly what he likes to do! My Hubby's comment - sometimes being content alone is a useful skill. He is starting to crave in person contact with people other than me though.No interest in figuring out dinner so we had leftover pizza with raw veggies and fruit."},

The paper delivery happens then to the houses on each side of us. So this morning I tried getting up and taking the dog out then going back to bed. Two more lovely hours of sleep and a much better mood!And we had a cheery end to Day 30. Yesterday's mail brought a lovely surprise in the form of mail from our granddaughter. You might remember that we had sent her some Easter bunny coloring pages . We got 2 of them back plus more. She had Mommy and Daddy help her color, had Mommy color a¬† picture of sunset over San Francisco which is what they see from their living room window when it is a clear evening, and drew us a picture of a flower. She is learning to write her capital letters so she wrote her name and NANA and PAPA but Mommy wrote the note from her. So fun to see her at almost 3 1/2!This time her note said \" I miss you and I love you and would like you to be my best friends when you come to my next birthday.\" I'm guessing that when she asks when we are coming to visit they tell her that we will be there for her next birthday in mid-November which is a reasonable hope. Perhaps by then the restrictions will have been lifted and we will have the ability to drive all day with at least rest stops open or to be able to fly. Hopefully before then!Carrying On:My club gives three $1500 scholarships to local graduating seniors and this year we have 17 applicants. It was so hard to pick last year and this year I'm sure the stress on family finances for many is even greater. The application review and scholarship recommendations need to be done by noon on Friday so I have a good task to focus on for the next few days.Another beautiful warm day so I started needed pruning. Walked the dog. Mailed younger son's birthday card and check. Emailed a nephew and Atlanta friend. Did 2 loads of laundry.Hubby did the Trader Joe's shopping as we are going once a week and alternating stores. I do Vons and he does TJs. While he was gone I cleaned the frig, decontamination counter and kitchen counters. I can't get to the point of wiping down each item so we are letting them sit on the \"dirty\" counter space for set times. 24 hours for paper and 72 for plastic or metal. Of course perishables go into the frig right away. So far we are healthy.Pleased with California's Approach:Here are the 6 criteria that have been laid out by the state for relaxing social distancing and what is required to make it happen. I see that it is based upon the WHO's guidance but expanded to actually start a plan.California's Roadmap to Modify the Stay at Home OrderSo no matter how badly I want to hug my family it makes sense to me!

I'm mostly worried for what is ahead until a vaccine, massive testing and/or effective treatment is available.Why we find it difficult to recognize a crisisAs a social scientist and former management consultant, I don't fall in the wishful thinking categories but rather in the let's be reasonably prepared and have a plan category.We could have been like Taiwan or New Zealand!¬†What do country's with the best coronavirus reponses have in common? Women leaders.BTW, the book Pandemics and Society is very interesting reading so far. I'm still reading about the plague and not only are the facts about the massive outbreaks across centuries interesting but the types of responses of humans is too. If you read it just don't freak out that the bacteria is still present in rodents on every continent but Antarctica."},

It helps us cope and survive.It is normal in a pandemic to use isolation, quarantines, testing, etc. to try to save lives and suffering. It is not normal to accept the fact that if the President had taken warnings seriously and taken swift and appropriate action lives would have been saved but \"oh well, that's Trump\". Now he is retweeting \"fire Fauci\" tweets because Fauci dared to say lives could probably have been saved if steps had been taken sooner. Well, yes!I can't feel it is normal for over 3,300 nursing home residents to have died as the virus rages through care homes. Or that over 22,000 people total have died in the US to date. Or that we are asking low paid workers in critical service areas including farming and care for the most vulnerable to show up for work with no testing available and little PPE. Or that some governors still won't issue stay at home orders and way too many people violate the orders that exist in most of the country. Or that people believe it is a conspiracy not a disease.It is not \"normal\" that over 17 million workers have suddenly lost their jobs and little is being done to help them. Or that countless more have lost income from reduced hours, failing businesses or work that is not covered by unemployment insurance.It is not \"normal\" that we continue to hold immigrants in unsanitary, crowded detention centers with little or no healthcare. It is not \"normal\" that the President refused to reopen enrollment for Obamacare apparently because of his hatred for Obama.As I sit here safe in my lovely home and retired with a stable and good income, I am angry at the squandered opportunity to have had less of this suffering and refuse to accept this as normal.I don't know what to do about it though and that is the hardest part.Back later in the week with more uplifting posts."},

Boy was it delicious! One of the more expensive restaurants in town is offering dinner specials for either 2¬† for $35 or 4 for $65. You get to pick from 2 salads, 4 entrees with starch & veggie, and 2 desserts. We had Caesar salad, chicken piccata, citrus salmon, and decadent brownie bars. Paired it with a nice bottle of Chardonnay I had picked up at the grocery store. Delicious and just the right amount! Usually we just go there for happy hour specials as it is quite expensive and the regular servings so large so this was a treat and the serving sizes just right.Then we Facetimed with the Berkeley crew and learned our granddaughter got a large toy bunny for Easter and she named it Chloe. Chloe can do amazing things with help from her girl. She also \"miss you so so much\" many times over. Likewise!Exercised and walked, read, worked a bit on background info for the women's club Presidency and tried to avoid looking out at the gloomy day.

I like to plan and anticipation is at least half the joy of doing things so I'm thinking about starting one myself. Like most people I would have lots of \"see and hug so-and-so\" on my list. Sons, DILs, granddaughter, brother and SIL, cousins, aunts, nieces & nephews, friends. Hope we are safely able to do that sooner rather than later.That being said I read this morning a statement from a public health scientist saying that the stay at home order really shouldn't be lifted fully until there are consistently fewer than 10 new cases of Covid occurring. Makes sense, but I'm not happy about it of course. Will masks be the new normal then? If so hopefully we will have access to real ones.This BBC articleBBC article seems to lay out really well the currently known challenges with a return to even quasi-normal. Not to depress you LOL.That being said, perhaps a Stay Safe at Home Bucket List is more appropriate. Tops on mine is getting better able to use technology to connect with others and finding a hobby and/or learning project that will truly engage me.Carrying On¬†- I made another¬†attempt to trim the dog's face & bottom shorter plus trim her feet. She hates her front feet to be touched unless it is for a massage, but old pro at grooming that she is, she held really still. Knows what scissors mean for sure. I think she was holding her breath as much as I was, but there were no problems. I'm going to keep working on her bit by bit and hope I don't make a too much of a mess of it as it must be done.It was a beautiful breezy, sunny, fairly warm day and I took a quite long walk and found other excuses to be outside for a bit."},

Called our DIL for her 50th Birthday!Carrying On¬†- Went to Vons for the first time in over 2 weeks. Good changes - one way aisles, senior/disabled shopping hours from 7 to 9 each weekday morning, sneeze guards in front of cashiers, all staff wearing masks. And surprise, although we don't need any they actually had some toilet paper and paper towels and paper goods were the only items with limits. Still some empty shelves in the canned goods area, but overall in pretty good shape. Picked up a nice bottle of wine to go with our take out restaurant anniversary dinner tomorrow night.I saw that the VOX news online book club picked \"Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present\" by Frank Snowden while¬†the World Economic Forum rated it the #1 book to read for context on the coronavirus outbreak. I bought the Kindle version as it sounds like a pertinent science book to read at this time and I need a science book for my book group challenge. It is considered a textbook so it may be heavy going - we will see.It was an overcast, brisk, occasionally drizzly day so I did the laundry, took the dog for a long walk and read some more. I'm thinking I should make some more masks so if one of us gets sick there will be enough to wash, dry and wear at the same time. A good project for this weekend.Thankful for - The food and other supply chains that are bringing most of what we need and much of what we want to the grocery and drugstores. Now if they will just figure out how to NOT have farmers throwing away food because of changing patterns of demand around the country!"},

So far they are all fine thank goodness.And our granddaughter's other grandma sent us a short video and email message from her. This grandma lives close by and is alternating a week of child care between her 2 children's homes so the parents can work more as they all still have jobs.

So from 1:30 am to about 4:00 am I did just that. I suspect lots of people are finding it hard to turn off their thoughts in the middle of the night right now. My dog buddy feels obliged to get up too but then goes right back to sleep near me. No troubling thoughts there.Connecting while Distancing¬†- Hubby talked to his 90+ year old aunt who lives alone.Carrying On¬†- Having a be gentle day to switch to enjoyable thoughts.- Screened 10 more CDs from our son and kept only two.- A Facebook group I belong to is having a \"dress like a bird\" shutdown challenge. I joined in with matching the California Quail although I don't think they live in this part of the state. Love seeing quail with their babies or in a group in a field.Anyone want to suggest birds for my next inspiration?- We picked out the nice restaurant to order take out from for our anniversary dinner on Saturday. We picked one we really hope survives.- Printed out a year's worth of agendas, minutes, financials, etc. for my club on the reasonable assumption that I will be elected President to start in June. Not sure how we will proceed since we can't meet but we will make it through this.- I finished reading A Journal of the Plague Year written in 1772 about the 1665 London plague by Daniel DeFoe. DeFoe was only 5 years old at the time of the plague. People haven't changed over the centuries in terms of the range of responses to pandemics as his book is a fictional account mostly focused on behavior not medical/illness issues. I liked the book which surprised me.Thankful for -"},

You can only get prescriptions at the pharmacy now where they have a barrier up to protect the employees. You have to take anything else to the front register. You can only purchase \"essential\" items although the clerk didn't expand on what that meant. Of course no paper goods or disinfecting products on the shelves still. Employees wearing masks. The biggest change were tables in front of the usual place to put your items that was holding the credit card machine and a basket to put your items into. Good distancing.The same thing at the pet store, but only customer at a time as it is a small store. I'm glad all these things are in place but it was a dramatic change.I have decided to try the senior hours at Vons later in the week to see if it is easier to stay at a distance then plus since it is first thing in the morning perhaps they will have more in stock. Yet another new shopping experience.We have set up a \"dirty\" counter where all packaged items are left for the appropriate amount of time to let any virus die. It is getting a lot of use.On the way home from my short shopping excursion I heard part of a news conference with our governor and he indicated that they think the number of new cases will not peak in California until mid-May although Los Angeles county if anticipating a very rough week right now. I guess my thinking that it will be July or later until the restrictions are lifted may be on target.Connecting while Distancing¬†- Just emails back and forth with a friend.Carrying On¬†- After craving something chocolate for a few days, baking was on the to do list. I only have cocoa powder in the pantry so thought of brownies but found chocolate muffins used half as many eggs. Haven't decided what to make based on egg availability in the stores ever. The muffins hit the spot.I was supposed to have a routine Medicare Wellness visit and annual prescription renewals in 10 days with lab tests sooner. I called the Dr's office and they rescheduled me for early June pending whether or not it is safe to go to the lab by then. They authorized prescription extensions though to carry me through.Then I called the vet to see what the new procedure is there. You call once you arrive and they come out and get the dog and charge you when they return her. They will cut her toenails if needed - the groomer has been doing it. They also had more medication in stock for her and we scheduled her appointment for May. All set to take her for her monthly Addison's shot next week.Our local OLLI program is offering a very reduced number of courses for Spring for free via Zoom so Hubby is doing 2 of them. I'm not so keen on the topics so will carry on differently.Thankful for -¬†I am so thankful that we are financially stable as the cost of one of my prescriptions has soared and that California has a governor who seems to be tackling the pandemic as well as can be done."},

I gave her a bath and then trimmed very carefully around her face, feet and bottom.

I'm waiting for the grooming brush I ordered and will ask the vet tech to check her toenails when I take her for her monthly shot.What else? Some stretches, made veggie broth & started split pea soup for tomorrow. We had chicken, pasta with sauce and veggies for dinner.Finished an interesting book, The Plague by Daniel DeFoe of Robinson Crusoe fame. Set during the mid 1660's while the plague decimated London and the surrounding area but focused on how people behaved. Fiction although the reviews say he got the facts right. I thought it might be a difficult read due to the current pandemic but it wasn't for me.

I get that this situation is unprecedented in modern times yet look at how the country has been mobilized to produce weapons of war. This is a war and we aren't winning when the VP notes that the trajectory of the disease here is the same as in Italy and governors, health care workers and others are begging the public to donate lifesaving materials. Appalled is too polite but I'll go with it.So we are to the point of trying to make our own face masks. Although it is acknowledged that they aren't great at keeping the virus out and that people will use them wrong and therefore potentially contaminate themselves, I think of it simply being the best we can do right now since it is vital that health professionals have the real personal protective equipment. I do understand that it will help those who are infected, but don't know it from spreading the virus so far in the air and may prevent some transmission that way. It is something to try at least.I found this¬†NPR article¬†that now only explains what is known and unknown about homemade mask effectiveness, but also has links for how to make them and where to donate locally any N95 or true surgical masks and other PPE that you may have at home or at your business. California has set up a website for those with larger quantities of supplies available or that they could manufacture to send in the info so it can be coordinated.We have one package of industrial N95 masks from the last wildfire episode. There is now a place I can donate them here according to their search function. I can buy more masks when they are back in the home improvement stores. Wish I had more to donate.Connecting while Distancing¬†- I am blessed with the friends I have made since moving. One friend who is a great crafts person offered to make us masks and I am taking her up on it. Her husband will do a porch delivery of them.I also found that we have two 100% cotton pillowcases that we don't often use so I may try making tie masks from them and then share them myself if it works out.Carrying On¬†- Today was laundry day which includes changing the bed and towels. Had a very fitful night so took a nap and read. Hubby has really limited his intake of the news and commentary which is a good thing.

We did it on Zoom and it was so energizing to see my friends faces and hear them too.Then while walking the dog a woman stopped and chatted. I learned that a nearby restaurant has opened an online market along with take out of menu and bar items with free delivery to my senior community. They are even selling toilet paper and Purell wipes! She also mentioned a nearby farm that will sell you a produce box so you don't even have to get out of the car.

We adore her and are glad we called.Carrying On¬†- I am trying to identify three important things to get done each day including self-care.

Include things to do to keep occupied!Have you thought of anything you want to do differently once this is over?Connecting while Distancing¬†- Last night I got an email from my Berkeley DIL that said:\"Nana -¬†Ryan saw all the colors of the rainbow and MORE on her neighborhood walk today. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, black, silver, and pink!¬†We challenge you to find the rainbow on YOUR next walk!\"It was accompanied by photos of lots of flowers and foliage. I decided to take pictures of the colors in things that weren't flowers to send back to her. It was fun to do a long distance scavenger hunt for a 3 year old to enjoy.Carrying On¬†- With my mood and energy back I kept myself busy and had a much better day.Thankful For - People here who are taking walks, running or biking taking social distancing seriously so it is safe for all of us to get some exercise outside. People are also trying hard to smile and say something friendly too as you pass them.My County's Data¬†- They have expanded the data shared so this morning it said the following plus a table by age and another by city or unincorporated area. Interestingly my small city has as many or more cases as the larger ones.I like seeing the Recovered and Ever Hospitalized numbers as it provides a clearer picture of what is happening and puts it in better perspective.

Also looked in the pantry for those purchased for a recipe and not finished up ingredients and will look for ways to use them.I see the federal Covid shutdown guidelines now are extended to April 30th but yesterday I heard Bill Gates say that the models his foundation's experts are using suggest it will be the end of May at the earliest before relaxing the restrictions makes sense.

I filled 2 large trash bags with pruning as I cut back the big succulent that was about 18 inches out onto the patio and swept. This area really has a nice view and vibe but we haven't used it much.One of the reasons we don't use it is that the winds blow in lots of dirt that make keeping patio furniture clean. I realized today that right inside the patio door are this rattan chair and small table so I am going to try just putting them out when I want to sit out there and then bring them inside again.And in line with the need for comfort today, we had homemade chicken, bean and veggie soup with salad and corn muffins.My County's Data¬†-¬† Four more confirmed cases for a total of 39.

I also learned I have been using more toilet paper than absolutely necessary LOL.More importantly I learned we were not keeping enough back up food and water for the dog and enough food that doesn't require cooking for us in case of more typical emergencies that take the power and possibly water out as well as disrupting supply chains. In an earthquake and wildfire prone area this is important.I also learned some of the steps to care for an infectious person at home and where our home care supply gaps were for that - especially disinfecting wipes and sprays. We also no longer have a cool mist humidifier but I am on the fence about buying one.

Hope it helps someone else.County Public Health Order¬†- I live in a county that is both agricultural and suburban with few smaller cities. Nothing like Los Angeles and with the stores, etc. closing there are no locations where crowds of people would gather unlike in NYC. The instructions issued by the county yesterday included the expected closure of bars, breweries and restaurants except for drive thru and take out. No gatherings over 10 people. No movies, gyms, etc. There are 8 confirmed cases in the county so far.They also asked that all residents 75 or older, as well as those 70 and older with pre-existing conditions, to shelter in place. They defined that as only leaving for medical, nutritional or other essential services or work if it was essential. Neither of us falls into the current shelter in place criteria, but we are social distancing as much as we can.We did have the carpet cleaner come today but stayed at least 3 feet away. I am grateful to have that done and help support this solo-businessman, but that is the last optional service in our home until this health emergency is past.Connecting - I called a friend who I thought might be going stir crazy as she usually is out at meetings, movies, and lunches 5 days a week. Her husband is a writer and works at home but shuts the door to his office all day. We had a good chat and, yes, they are going stir crazy already.Food Planning¬†- Took an look in our refrigerator. We need to use our lettuce, spinach and a single zucchini as well as mushrooms, a tomato, cucumbers and onion. Half a container of tofu too. I de-boned the chicken from last night, packaged the meat for future meals and made broth.Shopping Differently -¬†I've been thinking about how to minimize our shopping for supplies and am taking a slightly different approach for now.Since we are trying to limit grocery store visits there will be one trip to one store when necessary and I will buy what is needed there rather than trying to buy specific items at a specific store.I am a bit concerned about bottled water for the dog who gets sick on our softened water, but do have quite a few stocked up for earthquake preparedness. She goes through about 5 gallons a month so at least I have now calculated that!I use Amazon's subscription service for some dog food and supplies and decided I could add things like dental floss, etc. No need to go to CVS unless we need a prescription.I also happened to see that Nordstrom has 25% off on many items including the bra I was going to buy this summer so I ordered it with free delivery.Suggestions for additional changes welcome!"},

They told me that vets will be considered essential businesses and able to stay open if there is a shutdown. They had us out in less than 5 minutes. The human clinic next door had a person in face mask, gloves and gown sitting outside to triage arrivals. Smart.BTW, the dog has Addison's disease so no adrenal gland function and has been getting shots for over 6 years so far. She also gets a pill every other day. So far she's healthy and happy.Time outdoors¬†- The sun was out intermittently and although it is chilly and damp I walked the dog which we both enjoyed after yesterdays rain.Created a mailing for our Granddaughter - I was going to send her an Easter card but instead put together a mailing of 3 Easter coloring pages and a decorated letter from us. All found online by searching free coloring pages and free spring flower letterhead. I'm going to ask her to color them and have her Mom or Dad take pictures to send to us. She loves getting mail and is at home with the Bay Area lockdown.Connecting¬†- Called my husband's cousin who's brother just died of cancer and who's 92 year old Mom in in assisted living with health challenges. Didn't get to talk as she is in the process of selling her brother's possessions but was able to tell her I wanted to see how she was doing and let her know we were thinking of her. All the rest of life does go on even during a pandemic.I also reached Hubby's 92 year old aunt who lives alone. She is very stressed out for lots of reasons without this but fortunately has neighbors who are getting her groceries. I'll be calling her a lot more frequently.Roasted a chicken and some asparagus - When I was trying to pick up beef at Trader Joe's for a St. Patrick's Day stew and they were out I decided to buy a roasting chicken instead as I certainly have the time to cook it and the weather has turned colder and wet so the heat in the kitchen was welcome. Its been a long time since I cooked one instead of picking up a rotisserie chicken.GOING FORWARDEach day I am going to try to get a good dose of being outdoors by walking the dog or going out by myself. Once the weather warms & drys up I think I'll set up our patio so I can sit out there and read or have a drink.I also want to try to do something creative, fun or different each day such as the mailing for our granddaughter and/or call and chat with a relative or friend.And we are carefully evaluating each appointment vs. the current infection situation here. I did confirm the carpet cleaner for tomorrow and the dog's grooming next week as I don't know how to groom a poodle! Assuming we keep the grooming appointment I'll get the dog's hair cut very short so returning can wait 2 or more months. I rescheduled my hair appointment for the 3rd week of April and will re-evaluate later. My thinking is that eventually we are all going to be infected but we desperately need to slow down the infection rate so there is some chance the healthcare facilities and providers can treat patients!What are you finding to do to keep yourself occupied so far?"},

As expected there was no toilet paper but no potatoes, no beef, no flour, no canisters of our favorite coffee - strange things cleared out. Then I saw a man clear out all the canned vegetable. Who knows - maybe he is feeding a large group.They had signs up saying their supply chain was quite challenged and they could only order from the warehouse based on sales data from the past 3 weeks (prior to the rush here) and wouldn't receive what they ordered if there was a shortage in the warehouse. Understandable. I think things will calm down in a week or two as people find their new normal and the supply chain adjusts.We are fine but I know many people are not so we made a big donation to our county's central food bank hoping to help those who are newly food insecure as well as the ongoing population that is. Trying to think of how else to best help those who are having difficulty coping. Ideas?I have decided that for now I will still keep the dog's grooming appointment, my hair appointment and the scheduled carpet cleaning but no massages. I'm wondering if my routine physical in mid-April will go ahead or if they will agree to issue new prescriptions without it. We'll see.I'm really glad I have a compatible spouse to interact with and worry about those who live alone becoming anxious and depressed. The frenzy at the grocery store today was good at raising everyone's anxiety level and encouraging the idea that we need to hoard while it is available. I tamped that down and changed my cooking plans to fit what was in stock.So today was pretty normal as chores do continue!But first thing in the morning I checked our county emergency website where number of tests, number of confirmed cases and their origin (travel vs community spread) and see that so far we have no confirmed community spread.Laundry, dog walked, changed the bed and cleaned bedroom & together we got all meals fixed. Will have to keep on top of using up our stocked up food in the order of how soon it will go bad.Wrote a note to a cousin on the East coast.Did a morning stretching/exercise workout.Read a bit and that was that!"},

The washing machine wasn't moving on from running water to fill up at the start and had an error code. He figured out it was a filter where the water enters the washer that was clogged up. He cleaned it, put it back and the washer is working fine again thank goodness!I happened to look inside on of our grocery bags and realized how long it had been since I washed them. All done now.The dog also needed cleaning so she got a bath and was quite happy about it.Finally scheduled the carpet cleaning for next week.Saw the Podiatrist only to find out I need to schedule bunion surgery on one foot. No answer as to how far in the future it might be safe to do that and/or not cause capacity problems.

So far I've- Picked up more books to read- Thought about pulling out my art colored pencils and trying drawing again or color the art coloring book I picked up- Borrowed some jigsaw puzzles- Thought about cooking and freezing some easy meals in case we both get sick- Set up a Facetime call with our granddaughter and thought about who may need phone calls to help stave off depression- Decided it is a good time to finally up my exercise especially since I just found out I need bunion surgery and need to be able to easily manage crutches for 1 to 3 weeks afterwards so need upper body strengthening. I won't be pursuing a Pilates studio right now so need to try some Youtube videos to start that. I can still go for walks and increase the distance too. I think our little community pool is still open but don't know if the locker room is so will check that out.- The house could use a deep cleaning (boring!)- I'd like to alter 2 pairs of jeans/slacks to make the legs narrower- I could assume my club will meet in the fall and start figuring out what needs to be done to plan for the yearLet's share ideas! What are you planning or considering doing during this time of social distancing?"},
{"title": "Managing Your Cash Flow: A critical part of living on retirement income", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2020", "text": "My older son keeps asking me what advice I have for dealing with elderly parents and for retirement in general.One thing that popped into my mind after our last conversation was that most retirees really need to get clear on when those non-monthly expenses will hit and how they will manage their cash flow to manage those. Then there are the expected but unplanned expenses like car or home repairs and other one time bills.What approach do you use to manage your cash flow? Transferring money in and out of a savings account? Sinking funds? Cash envelopes? Credit card debt or installment payments? Live on last month's income so you are always a month ahead with cash flow? I'm sure there are other approaches that aren't coming to my mind right now.Now that we are in our 3rd year of living on retirement income and savings with the ongoing expenses of our new home, I am really seeing our own financial pattern. First quarter of each year has predictable large annual and quarterly expenses. Then there are some other months that¬† have extra expanses that are unpredictable like car repairs. Plus the one time expenses we choose such as home improvements or travel.We are extremely fortunate to have the end each so far with additional money to put our savings, but there are many months we would be in the red if we didn't have savings to transfer into our checking account. I've set up a table by month to show when irregular expenses are due so I can plan the next month's cash flow once I know the actual amount of each as they do change each year.Something for those not yet retired or changing their living situation to consider."},
{"title": "March Week 1 - Weather swings, happy hour, family dinner, club activities", "date": "Sunday, March 8, 2020", "text": "I'm hoping our weather settles down so my sinuses can only care about all the pollen blowing their way! Perhaps the two are connected as the uncommonly warm weather may be causing more blooming at the same time? I'm sneezing and coughing a bit which makes me feel like I am back in Atlanta. The dog also coughs and has runny eyes this time of year. She doesn't complain though and I do LOL.Then there is the trying to figure out what to stock up on and how to prepare otherwise for a possible quarantine and/or infectious illness in the family.¬† Adding to our basic pantry of food, paper goods including paper plates, bowls and cups as well as toiletries to extend the time we could manage without shopping. Also adding over the counter medicines, health aids like gloves and disinfectant, and foods we don't normally eat in quantity but would if sick and had a very sore throat, etc. After discussion with Hubby that came down to juice, applesauce and soups. I might get a couple of boxes of instant pudding for me.TAXES: We owe the IRS some taxes for 2019 and of of course our first estimated tax payment for 2020. I am hoping this is the last time we owe money as it was probably caused by under withholding for Hubby's final inherited IRA payout. We had a tiny refund from the state. This year's taxes should be very simple and I will do them myself or use the AARP tax help service there in my community.YEAH!- Hubby made me happy by going to Home Depot, getting new weatherstripping for the front door, and installing it. No more visible gap!- Our problem window panes were replace or sealed. Yeah!- I found out you can redeem Southwest Airlines points for gift cards. $100 worth of Amazon cards are in the mail to me!FOOD: I did another stock up shop at Vons. Now I will try alternating Vons and Trader Joes every other week and see how it goes. I know I have to track how much we actually use of perishables in a week so I made a grocery list to note each week how much is used and what we need. I may be making more work for myself rather than less at least in the short run.We are eating well. Dinners were:- Sunday: Pork chop, roasted cauliflower, green salad- Monday: Homemade veggie soup, garlic bread, oranges- Tuesday: Thai take out- Wednesday: Sausage with sauteed onion, peppers & cauliflower and salad- Thursday: Veggie soup and salad- Friday: Turkey burgers, potatoes, zucchini- Saturday: Turkey dinner at son's house with us taking wine and apple galetteVOLUNTEERING: Against my better judgement I agreed to be nominated to be President of my service & social club which means almost surely that I will be in that role for 2 years. At least this has given me standing to say yes or no to the rest of the slate. Election is in April so we will see.FUN:- Our DIL's parents have escaped the upper Midwest tail end of winter and are staying in Pasadena. We went over for dinner with all of the above one evening and it was fun even for the dog.- Went to lunch with a group of women friends after our club board meeting. Great conversations.- Had my club book discussion group meeting which was interesting and fun as always. We all read what we want and then share the highlights and lowlights as well as book.So please share what you have been doing!"},
{"title": "Spring 333 Capsule Wardrobe with NO Shopping So Far", "date": "Wednesday, March 4, 2020", "text": "I have learned to start my capsule planning with inspiration photos including a non-clothing one. Hence the flowers in the field with an invisible blue sky with fluffy clouds above it.My 4 accent colors and 3 neutrals reflect my palette and also what I own and enjoy wearing.The outfit photos are from Pinterest and with one exception all the models are way younger than I am. The point is to see styles and color combos as inspiration.So what have I included in this 33 item capsule to start my March-April-May in coastal S. Cal?2 dresses10 tops5 cardigans/dusters/jackets3 pairs tapered leg jeans & 1 pair ankle jeans1 pair slacks3 pairs crops/capris3 pairs shoes2 purses2 coats2 scarvesI'm not including in my count jewelry, athleisure and exercise wear, or PJs & robes, etc.I hope to do minimal or no clothes shopping the next 3 months as I have enough. What I am willing to buy are 4 items: lightweight dress slacks, topper and a dressy top, and Spring flats. I might also pick up something from a thrift store to wear as a sartorial not to 1970 at my DILs 50th birthday party. For the latter I may just borrow something from a friend but she likes to thrift shop so we will have an outing first!So far in March I have forgotten to take photos half the days but here are the 2 I did take.

It was time to set some priorities and get some things done.But first I want to share this blog post from Frugalwoods that really explains my thoughts on the topic of the best for the planet and our pocketbook type of financial decision making -¬†Environmentalism, Frugality and MinimalismVOTED:- We are able to vote for Super Tuesday by mail always in CA so I completed my ballot and turned it in at the 24/7 dropbox at city hall. Every state should make voting this easy!HOME:- Had the window repair person come over and see what can be done about the 3 window panels that have 3 different problems (broken seal between panes, sun shade coating coming off, glass panel edge seal lets air in). It all can be easily remedied so we signed the contract and the order has been placed.- The sun was just right for me to see that there is a big gap in the weatherstripping around our front door. Will remedy that as soon as we are near Home Depot again.FAMILY:- When we were with our granddaughter I helped her create pictures for our frig. I got 3 kinds of muffins (lemon seed being her favorite and blueberry and chocolate mine) and Papa got 2 suns including one purple because that is her favorite color at the moment. I did outlines, names and the flower border but she did the rest.We decided to send one back to her to go on her frig so I printed out a free coloring page and we both did our \"namesake\". We had fun doing this - probably more than she will getting it!VOLUNTEERING:- I am on the nominating committee for my club and we met to prepare a slate of officers and other board members to be presented at the March club meeting.SELF CARE:- Got a much needed haircut by a new hairdresser who charges significantly more but I am much happier with the outcome and will go back. Oddly, she went to the same high school as my older son at the same time. Small world.- I was in great shape and a great weight when we moved here but I have let that change. I want it back and that is going to take work. Using my project planning skills from my career I laid out the first steps to take March in 5 categories: flexibility, cardio, strength, weight loss, lower environmental impact food plan. I am thinking if I do this as a month by month project plan I just may stick with it.- Since I get very tired of grocery shopping each week I tried a 2 week shop at Trader Joe's. I typed up a master grocery list to try which will be a change from what I have been doing for 50 years. It was hard and we'll see how it works out. I hate food waste so I don't want it to lead to that as I do buy produce at TJs. I'll pick up things at Vons the other week if needed as it is very close. Driving reduction too!- Stocked up on some home health care products in case we do get sick from the flu or coronavirus. Bought disposable gloves, disinfecting wipes and Ibuprofen as well as bar soap. Not ready to be really concerned yet but those are good things to have on hand anyway."},
{"title": "How do you shop for groceries?", "date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2020", "text": "I've been taking stock of my habits including their impact on the environment and find that my driving is most frequently to the library and secondly to grocery stores. Since I love doing the first and only love the outcome of the second I am trying to rethink my approach to groceries.Typically I would go to Trader Joe's (a drive across town), Vons (close by) and CVS (walking distance) each week plus stop at Sprouts occasionally (again a drive across town). Now since I find grocery shopping boring, I am thinking that I could go to Trader Joe's every 2 weeks and Vons every week but am not sure how to transition to that.In addition, with the CDC announcement that it is only a matter of time until Coronavirus epidemic spreads to the US (no surprise there) I have been thinking about the need to have pantry supplies for extreme illness as well as for earthquakes and power outages. Again, not sure how to set that up.I'd love to hear from you!1. How often do you shop for groceries and how do you get organized to do it?2. Did you do it differently in the past and why did you change?3. What do you have in your pantry in case of illness? Please include over the counter meds and other supplies of that sort.Thanks!"},
{"title": "Feb weeks 2 & 3 - Berkeley trip, dog stuff, massage & voting", "date": "Sunday, February 23, 2020", "text": "The first few days were spent on getting ready to take our trip to visit family in Berkeley. You know how it goes - eat down the frig, do laundry, arrange mail pick up, etc. I squeezed in a lunch with a friend at a new nearby Mexican restaurant and got the dog groomed. Hubby took all of our tax stuff to the accountant as well as attending his weekly OLLI class. Go us.Had a great visit but all 3 of us are very tired (I'm including the dog here!). Our granddaughter was our Valentine's Day dinner date while her parents got a night out.Came home to the usual stuff like laundry, grocery shopping and monthly vet appointment for shot for Addison's disease. Found out we owe quite a bit to the IRS which makes me wonder why the accountant couldn't have come up with a better amount for us to pay in estimated taxes! This is the final year we are using him. Too expensive and too careless it seems.Had my monthly massage appointment which was great and a dermatologist check up with 4 spots on my face being \"frozen\" off. Glad I enjoyed laying by the pool in my bikini when a teen as this is the outcome.We finally finished up the leftovers from our party that I had put in the freezer! I do love being able to pull a ready once thawed and heated main dish from the freezer.We started to look at the 23 page document sent by the earthquake insurer saying our policy had changed and the only change we could see noted in the first 2 pages was that the premium was reduced by over half! We called the agent rather than reading the legalese on the other 20 pages and that was the only change. We were able to improve our coverage and still have over 25% less to pay for a savings of $254. Grateful!Also I went to Vons to pick up ground turkey on sale for $1.88/pound instead of the usual $4.99 to $5.99/pound. They had a limit of 2 per customer so I thought I would get 2 pounds but it was the 3 pound packages on sale so now we have 6 pounds to divvy up and freeze. Not complaining lol.Received 2 tops and a cardigan I ordered and am happy with them. That makes 4 clothing/accessory items purchased so far this year out of my maximum goal of 20! The second top is the color of the cardigan but in a crinkle knit for some texture interest. I wanted some new tops and a new cardigan for Spring weather and these fit that criteria. No makeup or accessories as I was on my way to the dermatologist.Not showing as much restraint on books as I am up to 13 of 40 although mostly secondhand from the Friends of the Library or Kindle books there are a few print books in there. Still piles coming home from the library too. My latest real book purchase is about how to use all of the fruit and vegetable pieces in your cooking. Part of my living lighter efforts.We had an outing on Friday with a trip to the Ventura pier and boardwalk that included the best tacos for lunch at a small spot on the pier. Then we checked out the Museum of Ventura County which has Chumash Indian artifact exhibits and a special exhibit on the early Cal Modern architecture movement including an interesting video about Charles and Ray Eames. Visited the archaeological museum dedicated to artifacts and info about a 1970's era excavation of some of the original mission site that later was home to Chinese settlers. Also walked around an peered into the only surviving adobe house left in the City of Ventura. As usual am in awe of how a couple and 8 children lived in a small 3 room building. Was a really fun afternoon.Then Saturday afternoon we went to a Science Cafe talk at the library on \"Climate Change: What to Expect and What Can Be Done\". I have to join in with Elizabeth Warren and say \"I believe in science!\"Hope you have had a great couple of weeks!"},

{"title": "Why I still practice frugality", "date": "Thursday, February 20, 2020", "text": "I've been thinking about how our spending is a mix of targeted frugality and happily spending on what we want. For a while I was thinking that the frugal part was simply long standing habit but I don't think so now.¬†A recent post by¬†Mrs. Frugalwoods¬†where she says:\"Frugality is a mindset that encourages us to evaluate our money based on the following:Am I spending in alignment with my goals?Am I using my money towards my highest and best priorities?Am I creating a financially stable life that I enjoy living?Do I have long term goals outlined and a financial plan to support and enable these goals?\"is exactly what we are doing with our spending pattern.As I told my younger son on our recent visit, the financial gifts we have been able to make to his brother and him have brought us so much joy and that is very true. That kind of spending is in alignment with our goals. The same is true of a recent large for us donation to a scholarship fund.I clearly remember the times when I had so little money that I couldn't even go out for a cup of coffee or had to add up the cost of my groceries as I shopped with food stamps. Using a bicycle with a child carrier seat at our only transportation even in the pouring rain. There are many other examples. My not so huge student loans paid off finally when my older son was a senior in high school so of course there were no savings for his college expenses.But thanks to our good fortune in being able to stay employed, earn well, stay healthy and save we are in a financially stable place where we can do as Mrs. Frugalwoods states.So I will keep tracking our spending, washing out those ziploc bags, shopping at Goodwill for extra dinner plates, cleaning my own house and so on until I simply can't do it any more. And I will happily spend where it aligns with our goals and values. And I will continue to feel enormously grateful that I can do both."},

There were little chocolate biscotti available too or just ice cream as an option but the galette was the winner!As most cook's do I made a few changes in how I made it. I used frozen pie pastries from Trader Joe's as I didn't want to take the time (effort?) to make them myself. I also bought large Granny Smith apples because I hate peeling lots of apples! Still peeled too many so we ended up with apple pecan salad for dinner. Also I arranged the apple slices differently but it all tastes the same.If you like apple pie this is a pretty and fun change to make and is easier in my opinion.¬†Taking a break from peeling apples!¬†My way of arranging the apples.¬†The butter melts right into the filling and it only takes 30 minutes to bake.Fresh out of the oven cooling on a rack.You are invited to the Inlinkz link party!Click here to enter"},

They not only were so helpful at our party but I have had comments from most of the guests about how much they liked meeting them. They are gems. And they brought us avocados and music cds which I have enjoyed this week.- My friends.- Creating tasty meals at home while using up what we have.MUSIC! Our son and DIL are seriously decluttering and have downloaded all their CD collection so - I am the lucky recipient of a large tote of CDs. They estimate 500 but we'll see how many there actually are. I'm going to slowly go through them, listen to what appeals to me and take all my rejects a few at a time to the Friends of the Library for selling. New to us music for free and low environmental impact!This week's tally of the number reviewed is¬† : I kept , donated , and threw out. Our CD containers are pretty full and i'm not sure what will happen for storage as I find more to add to our collection.TAXES: Like everyone else I had to buckle down and collect all documentation for sending our tax info to the accountant. Spent a lot of time on that this week.POODLE: The pup got her first new collar in 9 years! We bought her an adorable one decorated with squirrels when she came to us at 1 1/2 years old but it had gotten too tight. Little did we know then how squirrel crazy she was. We had a ton of squirrels and chipmunks for her enjoyment in Atlanta especially since there were two giant oak trees right outside the back door! Now she has a collar with roses on it which is appropriate for living near Pasadena and the Rose Parade. Not too many squirrels to see here and she still hasn't figured out what to think about rabbits LOL.FUN: Went to my monthly women's club board meeting and book club. Went out to lunch with the group after book club which was, as always, fun.CLEANING OUT THE FRIG: We are eating up leftovers/cleaning out the fridge. Plus there is the regular \"shop for us\" stuff I bought and there 4 very ripe avocados brought over by son and DIL. Don't want to waste anything, but also we are leaving on a 6 day trip soon to visit family and need the fridge cleaned out.VISITING GRANDDAUGHTER: We are heading out in the middle of next week to visit our Berkeley family so I will see you all when we get back!"},
{"title": "Party for 18 friends and family", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2020", "text": "Well I guess I needed a project! Here's how it worked out.I bought 4 dinner plates, 3 mugs, serving tray, ladle and ice tongs at Goodwill. Full price for a 9 x13 baking dish as I used to have 2 but only moved one as I got sick of packing dishes. I did look at Goodwill first, didn't find one, paid full price and washed it then next stop at Goodwill there was a perfect one for $1. Sigh.Borrowed a crock pot and pasta pot with strainer from my son and DIL. My inventory showed I had enough of every other equipment for cooking and serving including enough places to sit. We were able to use our dining table to serve the food and a separate table for drinks which worked well.Decided I needed a theme to plan a menu as I'm not used to cooking for a crowd and picked Italian as that is pretty easy, cost effective and most everyone likes it. I also wanted things that could be prepared ahead of time with just last minute heating not preparation. And then there is knowing that guests are lactose sensitive/intolerant, diabetic or Keto - oh my. At some point I decided to offer options, label them as needed, and figure people were used to taking care of their own dietary restrictions! Turns out no one is dairy intolerant, a former heavy meat eater has stopped eating meat, etc.I'm curious how far others go in modifying their dinner party menus to acommodate dietary restrictions of their guests?MENU: The items in bold were the hits!Appetizers:Caprese and antipasto skewersVeggie trayHummusDried fruit and nuts (this surprised me)Crackers, olives and salamiDinner:Italian green bean salad (green beans with sun dried tomatoes, almonds and vinaigrette)Cheesy meatballs with pasta saucePasta veggie bake (with and without cheese) - could have made only one!Bread & butter¬†Dessert:Apple cinnamon galettesVanilla ice creamSmall chocolate biscottiDecaf coffee¬†TeaDrinks: Guests also brought 2 bottles of wine one of which was opened and finishedAperol Spritz cocktail (this was a big hit!)¬†Pinot NoirChardonnayBeerSparkling flavored waterSo how did it go?We had a very warm day for winter with a high of 81! We were able to have the doors open for the party which kept the house nice. The tables were set up, chairs rearranged, and music ready to play. I had made the meatballs, pasta bakes, and galettes in advance. Once all the food was prepared I had room to stage the dessert supplies in the kitchen.Two guests cancelled at the last minute so there were 16 of us and the house easily could have accommodated 8 more. It seemed that everyone had a good time. We were glad our son and DIL volunteered to do kitchen/serving duty to free us up to visit although we also helped. We all can see why people hire a kitchen helper for big parties!I achieved my goal of having very little trash/recycling by using washable plates, glasses, coffee cups and silverware. Just napkins and the appetizer paper plates plus bits of tossed food. And of course wine bottles. It's hard to figure exactly how much we spent because LEFTOVERS (!) but I think it was about $15 a person with the alcohol included.We bought way too much wine and beer, but split the leftovers with our son and DIL so no problem there. Quite a few meatballs and one pan of pasta bake leftover - also split. Just a tiny bit of the green bean salad, appetizer skewers, galettes and ice cream left though and if everyone had come they would have been gone.I learned to never again make a veggie tray for a party though. Too healthy it seems LOL. We do eat a lot of vegetables and salads though so no problem using them up and they are what I would buy anyway.We had music playing but hadn't planned any entertainment so what happened was impromptu. Guests who don't live in this community looked around our home and asked one of our neighbors to show them their home too (just a few houses over). Hubby pulled out his telescope and aimed it at the moon so people could have a look. He, his drum teacher (a professional drummer neighbor) and another guest who plays drums gave the drum set some love. All in all a good party!It was fun and something that I would do again. Next one will be a potluck though!"},
{"title": "January Week 4: Final car repair, party prep and warmer weather", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2020", "text": "More car repairs. This time it was to fix the pulley that occasionally caused a very loud screeching sound right after the car started. It really freaked out the dog! We had to go to the dealer for that repair, but of course they knew right away what the problem was. So new tires and now a new pulley and some other part related to the pulley and alternator. Hope this is it for a long while.This car despite being 10 years old and moving us across the country only has a bit over 60,000 miles on it.¬† More importantly the dog's crate fits through the back door so she can travel in comfort and safely. Not to mention it was paid for when we bought it.After making, baking and freezing a humongous number of meatballs for our Italian buffet dinner party, I went through our latest credit card statement. It is always a struggle to reconcile the Amazon charges/refunds with my orders as they don't bill the same way they ship. However, I did find that they never refunded the money for an item they didn't ship in early January as it was no longer available apparently. Took two tries but finally got the right credit back to my account. $43.22 win! With all of our car repair bills lately I'll take what I can get to offset them.One of my bunions is getting large enough that it gets rubbed when I walk so I am down to just a few pairs of shoes. Today I managed to loosen my athletic shoes enough to be able to take a long walk without a problem. Another win. However if you know of good brands of shoes for bunion sufferers I'd like to hear about them!The weather has been unusually warm too so it is lovely to go for a long walk. We have also been able to open the doors and air out the house in mid-afternoon which is great.I've been trying to notice little changes I can make to reduce our environmental impact. In the \"duh\" category is that I am only filling the dog's water bowl half full now. I mentioned that she get sick drinking our tap water (softened) so has bottle water. I have cut in half the number of plastic jugs put into recycling by this little change. I also mentioned that we have to put our trash out in plastic bags. I had been sticking with my Atlanta habit of taking the trash out each night (think the buggy South US) but there is no need to do that here. About a 1/3 reduction in trash bag use. I'm also trying to find produce that isn't in those hard plastic containers. A bit of a reduction here as it is hard to find some of the core things we eat sold loose or packaged any other way (e.g. berries, cherry tomatoes). It's a start.Our laundry room storage unit is the holding area for the non-perishables and borrowed crock pot and pasta pot.I picked up almost all of the perishables on Thursday. I had already made and frozen the meatballs and some cheese is in the frig but this counter shot is everything else except for bread and alcohol.Friday I made 2 apple galettes, 2 pans of veggie pasta bake, prepped veggies for crudites, and sauce for the meatballs that are defrosting. We also set up an extra table for drinks, moved chairs and little tables, cleaned the bathrooms, and got out the drinks table supplies.I spread out the food and house party prep across the week as much as I could so I wouldn't be exhausted by doing it all at the last minute. Still a lot of the food prep can't be done until the day of the party.¬† so tomorrow I'll be making the appetizers, baking the pasta and heating the meatballs in sauce, getting and cutting up baguettes, figuring out all serving dishes and utensils, setting out plates, etc. Hubby is in charge of drinks but I'll get the decaf coffee ready to go, cups out, etc. My son and DIL are coming over a bit early to help. Hopefully there will be enough food and people will like it!I'll take pictures and will do a separate blog post since it is something different for us to do."},

I had lunch and a good chat with my older son as part of his birthday gift. Hubby and I also went out for a happy hour dinner at one of our favorite restaurants which was fun.I have spent quite a bit of time organizing my menu and plans for our dinner party for 18 and will write a separate post about that once it happens on February 1st. I think I needed a new project. I do love a good project to plan and execute LOL.I have been participating in a shop your wardrobe 100 outfits in 100 days challenge and completed the first 20 days. So far I've ended up with 7 S. Cal winter outfits I liked a lot for my everyday life. I've also let go of a few things that really no longer suit me or are too worn to keep wearing. That surprised me as I actually have a pretty small wardrobe and don't enjoy shopping for new clothes.The dog and I have both gained weight so we are taking more walks together which isn't on her favorite thing to do list. One a day makes her happy, but more than that and she is not a fan.In percentage of body weight the dog has gained way more than I have. I think it is the poor girl going from prednisonee for her Addison's disease once a week to a pill every other day. At least with humans prednisone is associated with weight gain.It also is related to the fact that she will eat as much canned food as given and Hubby has been giving her more than we used to. I think I have convinced him it is not a great idea no matter how much she enjoys it. She will stop eating kibble when she is full. She is happy and pretty much healthy for a dog who is 10 1/2 and has had Addison's for 6 1/2 years.You can just hear the level of excitement our lives have had during this week LOL."},

{"title": "January 12 - 19", "date": "Monday, January 20, 2020", "text": "Things didn't start off to well but the problem wasn't too bad and was eventually fixed.Hubby has become increasingly unhappy with our car and even started seriously considering trading it in. However he decided instead to take it in for new tires and a rear brake job. Then he said - let's go for a drive to see some gorgeous scenery on a back road. Quickly we both realized the car wasn't riding or driving well and he figured out they sold him the wrong type of tires! They made good on it but it took 4 days until it was fixed. Then the car made a screeching noise when started so it is booked for a check up on next Monday as it has done this a couple of times before.That means I got things done at home and walked the dog more! Cleaned out our paper files, removed several pounds and shredded what I had to. Obviously I haven't done this since we moved. Sheesh.The grab bars were finally installed in our renovated shower so that project is done and we can move on.Planned our upcoming dinner party for 18. Everyone we invited said yes which was lovely but unexpected. It is dinner for 18.Had my monthly massage and went to lunch with a friend.Used up some blackberries that were too sour tasting and some sliced almonds that were in the freezer by making muffins. Onward to using up some other things that I should really stop buying because they are healthy but then we don't choose to eat them.Heard from my oldest nephew who has fallen in love with someone he met on a scuba diving vacation. They have been managing a long distance relationship but it is time to move to be together and he is starting a job hunt as they have decided he will move. So thrilled for him that he met a wonderful woman after not thinking it would happen for himself.Starting Tuesday Hubby is on call for jury duty for 4 days so I can't plan on having access to the car. A good reason to get out and walk!"},
{"title": "Are you making any changes to reduce impact in light of climate change?", "date": "Wednesday, January 15, 2020", "text": "In the wake of the coverage of Greta Thunberg and the ongoing massive horrible fires in Australia I have been thinking about how to further reduce my (our) environmental impact. We aren't big consumers but we do buy and consume and every decision has an impact.¬†My recent reading has confirmed that there aren't easy answers and individual action has minimal impact - but, and this is a big but, if millions of people changed their individual actions the big companies and government would notice and have to change too.There are two things I have seen trending online related to overall reduction of consumption - 20 for 2020 and No/Low Buy Year.20 for 2020 is focused on only buying 20 new items of clothing and/or makeup. Now that seems like a lot but for many people it is a reduction. I'm thinking to try to limit my clothing replacements to 20 at most and make sure I really need the item before purchasing. There really is a huge excess of clothing produced in the world and much of it ends up being trashed.No/Low Buy Years tends to be focused on debt reduction and/or consumption reduction? If you aren't driven by financial needs would you do a No/Low Buy Year to reduce your environmental impact? Of course everyone buys food, medicine, etc. and pays their bills so none of them are total No Buys. Everyone sets their own rules. I'm thinking to try to do a very low buy but then today I bought a used book and some plates at Goodwill. Hmmm.One blog I looked at said they did a Low Buy Year and used the money they saved to have amazing experiences. The general guidelines for their experiment was to not buy any non-consumable goods during the year. Non-consumable meant: clothes, shoes, furniture, home decor/furnishings, books, toys, electronics, etc. Consumable items that were okay to buy were things like food, printer paper, soap, makeup, and things that could be used up completely. If a non-consumable item broke, or wore out, it could be replaced with one similar. (But worn out shoes weren‚Äôt a green light for a shoe-shopping spree). They also set out to better use the items owned, and organize and get rid of things not loved or used.Another new trend at least in Europe is to avoid plane travel do to the amount of fuel used and its impact. Of course they have other transportation alternatives that are efficient such as good train systems.¬†And then there are the good old standards. Drive less. Avoid plastic packaging. Eliminate food waste. Reduce your water, electricity and other utility use. I have notice that since we aren't billed directly for our water in this home (and therefore have no idea how much we are using), we have slacked off on conserving.What I have started or resumed doing:1. Cut the number of cleaning products down to the bare essentials and using non-toxic ones except for grout mildew remover and toilet cleaner. There must be a good substitutes for those - I'll have to research it.2. Invested in e-Cloth scrubbing pads instead of the standard sponge scrubbers and also their stainless steel cleaning cloth which works well on the sink instead of spray. I already had and like the glass cleaning cloths and floor mop.3. Reusing produce plastic bags until they are skanky and then using them as poop bags. We have used reusable grocery bags for years.4. Recommitting to getting books only from the library or secondhand from friends or the Friends of the Library bookstore - and then returning real books to the same bookstore after reading them.5. I'm using up dryer sheets and then will start using dryer balls for softening.6. Trying to turn the computer off midday or when I will be gone. No need to have it running in the background. The printer is off unless being used.7. Using our window shutters to help control inside temperature depending upon the sun, wind and outside temps.8. Planning errands to reduce driving.9. Not automatically throwing clothes in the was after wearing. We don't sweat in the winter and I am using silk undershirt with a lot of my tops so I can wash less. Not ready to join the never wash your jeans club lol.10. Continue with essentially no food waste. We do love leftovers and try to save them in a washable container rather than plastic wrap covering.What I can't or won't change right now:1. Our soft water makes our dog sick so she drinks bottled water. And she eats canned food (as we do some) and there are those plastic poop bags. We do recycle the plastic jugs and cans.2. We are required to put our trash out in plastic bags so simply can try to make sure they are full and minimize our trash.3. We have year round allergies and do use paper kleenex.4. Plastic toiletry, laundry and dish soap containers.5. We don't know our water consumption as it is not direct billed so will simply have to try to minimize without feedback.I've got a mental list of things I want to do and/or try.Has anyone else been thinking about and acting on this? What are you doing?"},

Planned a mid-February long weekend in Berkeley with family. Sent our granddaughter a funny card and some bug stickers as she likes bugs.I attended my club board meeting and book club. Visited with friends at club crafts group but decided latest project was too \"fiddly\" for me and would result in throwing my hands up in frustration. Went to my club's monthly luncheon which was fun as usual.Started planning a party for February 1st. Bought 4 plates at Goodwill so now I have 19 dinner plates to use for a party. I'm trying to reduce what we throw away and not using paper plates is my goal. Those I will save for emergency supplies.I did little \"fix its\" like mending the hem of a washcloth and changing batteries in the scale and wireless mouse. Rearranged my clothes storage so I will more readily wear what I have in new ways to combat boredom without shopping.Decluttered a bit and took the batteries to the recycling bin at the library and some items to Goodwill. Made sure to process food that was on verge of spoiling by making applesauce, veggie stock & banana muffins.We finally decided on the style and length of shower grab bars to have installed, purchased them and they should be up next week. Then the bath remodel is complete.Submitted my Medicare cost reimbursement to my health insurance (they reimburse $800/person for a tidy sum of $1600 for us). We got new tires on our car and had a rear brake job done.Called TIAA-CREF and confirmed that I do not need to take mandatory minimum distributions until next year due to the law change. Also found out they will post what I am required to take by the end of January of that year and I can make the distribution arrangements online or by calling.

Wow, did that ever expand to more leftovers.Went to book club and we all traded books as usual plus sending a bunch to the Friends of the Library book store. I came home with a bag full of new to me ones to read.We planned out our donations for the year and wrote the largest check to make a contribution to the scholarship fund for local seniors administered by my women's club. We both really feel good about giving a tangible vote of confidence to a young person who needs financial support to further their education. Also on our list are the public TV and radio stations we use and the Friends of the Library.I may have complicated our financial record keeping and analysis beyond the helpful point! It seems to be taking a long time to get last year's numbers entered. Sigh.One more Pet Club financial report to do later today and then I can hand everything over and walk away from the drama and bullying that ended the year on a sour note.

She was happily busy the whole time and we enjoyed their visit tremendously. BTW, naps are a feature of the past so there were more hours to fill and it didn't rain but was cold and very windy so we were mostly indoors anyway. Thanks for all of your suggestions.____________________________________________________________________She brought her scooter and helmet so that burned up some energy after a long drive to get here.She used the few dress up items I had stashed especially loving to wear the fascinator I had left from my older son's wedding. The mardi gras bead necklaces moved around with each of us getting our turn to wear them. I'm not good at taking selfies but here one is.She loves to help so she set the table and helped her Mom wrap some presents.She still played with a puzzle, xylophone¬† and toy car I had and thought might be too young for her. Creative imagination is a wonderful part of being 3. The xylophone hammer became her \"bone\" as she pretended to be a dog much to the confusion of our dog lol.Out of the 4 books I borrowed from the library one was a very much repeated favorite because \"it's funny!\" and another got a fair work out. She bought her \"Frozen\" story book which was read a lot too.Speaking of Frozen, we thought Frozen 2 would be too dark for her, but she had already seen it once and was eager to see it again so we all went to see it in the afternoon. At 3 the darker messages in the story seemed to go right over her head which was good. She is starting to ask questions about death (Mommy where is your Daddy?) but doesn't have an emotional or much of any reaction to the concept yet.She helped build a \"castle\" using a table covered with blankets and she filled it with pillows and a quilt. At one point all 5 of us managed to at least get our heads in there at her request.Lots of games of Go Fish, Hide and Seek, and Keep all the Balloons in the Air¬† the latter of which provoked peals of laughter.She got to play Papa's drum set and we learned she has a really good sense of rhythm and timing.

We'll see if that lasts or if I get cabin fever and make an escape this afternoon.So while the laundry is drying (takes forever but thank goodness I don't have to hang it up or iron it!), here is what is going on in my simple life.1. The new down comforter for the second bedroom arrived and it is just the right color and much larger than the old one - yeah! Tonight for the sleep test.BTW, I don't want to buy a headboard. We also can't hang anything heavy or with glass in it over the bed due to earthquakes, but really want some color in there.¬†Perhaps I need to get curtains for the window to add some color and warmth.A painted headboard or wallpaper?Concept of a darker color painted headboard - not the colors!Concept of the stripes across the wall2. It popped into my head this morning that it would be fun to send our granddaughter a musical snow globe. This one looks cute!¬†Penguin musical snow globe3. I refuse to be cold in my house this winter and also refuse to crank up the heat because it just goes up to the high ceiling and/or into the attic. We fixed the insulation last year - could add more but don't really think it would help that much. We also bought small electric heaters for by our desks in the added on rooms and that helps. So far I have bought silk underwear - tanks and long sleeve - and that is helping. I'm going to look for another vest and a wear with anything warm cardigan. I ordered some new PJs and socks for sleeping. This is the joy of coastal S. Cal and old housing stock in the winter folks."},

I tried some new recipes - Green lentil and Sweet Potato soup that was nicely spicy and a mostly veggie beef stew were both hits. We were just the 2 of us on Thanksgiving so I made a turkey loaf, sweet potato and coleslaw which we enjoyed along with pumpkin pie.Our son and DIL had a Friendsgiving on Saturday that was also our celebration with them so I made a cinnamon apple galette and pumpkin ginger cookies. I love to bake but don't want it in the house to eat so this was perfect.We have decided to attend 3 holiday music events this season and make donations at each. The first was yesterday and was the Cal State U Channel Islands Chorus \"A Light in the Darkness:Voices of Hope, Peace, Love, and Comfort\" concert. Amazing selection and voices plus a great organist. Followed by dinner at a Mexican restaurant with friends. We plan to attend a chamber orchestra and high school chorus event and a community band event this coming weekend. So looking forward to it. We also love live theater and the little local volunteer one has season tickets on sale now for a great price so I am contemplating doing that as well.

So fun to spend happy times with our little family.Monday - The trip home was an hour longer than usual as was the trip up. Lots of traffic and road work. It was a gorgeous sunny day and the ocean views were fabulous though. Quite a contrast to the drive up as that was foggy and overcast all the way. We got takeout for dinner and the dog slept really well after 6 days of few naps.Tuesday - Time to reset the house and get ready for the rest of the week. I did laundry, a Goodwill drop off and a library visit with a stop for afternoon coffee at their cafe. Hubby got groceries and moved the new nightstands and lamps into the guest room. I think they are quite nice!Wednesday - Our Granddaughter is officially 3 today and had a day of adventure with her Mom and other Grandma. They rode the bus into San Francisco and went to the Exploratorium. I'm sure lunch and snacks were also involved.The dog had 3 vaccinations and her 6 month blood test done with no bad reactions - whew. Rain here off and on with sunshine in between. What is this wet stuff falling from the sky?Thursday - Hubby's 67th birthday! He is so into watching the impeachment hearings that we only went out for dinner. You get to do what you want on your birthday in our house! We went to happy hour at a nearby new-ish upscale restaurant and really liked our meals and drinks. We'll go back there.Friday¬†- I had a massage as my monthly self care treat and then went to a longer than usual walk. The shower door was installed. Now we are totally back in business in the guest bath and happy with the look. Just have to decide if we are installing grab bars and if so where they will be placed. No more home improvements or decor updates planned for a while at least except getting a new down comforter for the guest room. Ordered a DIL's birthday gift from her Amazon wish list and added a couple of things to mine.¬†Saturday¬†- I guess it makes sense that I woke up at 3:30 am since I fell asleep at 7:30 pm - yikes. Feeling physically tired still, but still got out and moved around. Crazy warm again so it was lovely to be outside. Planned my cooking & grocery shopping for the week and went to Trader Joe's. Bought a lot so I won't have to go back until after Thanksgiving. I also decided we wanted a pumpkin pie and I didn't want to make one! Delish. At 8:30 am the store was already busy. Hauled out the stack of stored Christmas cards to see how many I really want to send.How has your week gone? Do you have big plans for Thanksgiving or a low key approach?"},
{"title": "And now for the fun 3's!", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2019", "text": "Wednesday is actually our granddaughter's birthday although her party was this past Sunday. And tomorrow is Hubby's 67th! A fun, happy week.Since we were gone for 6 days it took a day to recover and get the house reset plus ourselves and the dog rested up lol. We aren't too old for this yet but we sure were tired by the time we got home as was the dog who just didn't get in all those lovely dog naps.So 2 days of driving - enough said. The reward was a granddaughter who was jumping up and down with excitement that we were at her house when she got home from school!Thursday and Friday we worked through our \"to do\" lists alone and with our son who took the days off. He and Hubby installed a water hammer preventer thingy on the washer pipe and got it all leveled. Sounds easy but it is a stackable set in a very tight space. Then they dug out a drain pipe that comes from under a sidewalk, cut off the broken part, cleaned out all the composted leaves that were blocking the drain, installed a new extension and it works! Some yard trimming too.I raked lots of leaves, did lots of dishes, went grocery shopping with our son, prepped food and kept the pets all happy and fed.Saturday more food prep (did I mention my DIL is a major donor non-profit fundraiser and loves to plan and put on events?), the arrival of older son and DIL and creating party activities, etc.Sunday I declared I was tired and went to watch our granddaughter at her pre-school gymnastics class which was a delight. Then came back and took a nap! Nana gets to take a break.The party was a blast with lots of kids running around in the back yard doing activities, great food mostly an extensive taco bar and then the some-mores cake! The whole theme was around the show about Spirit the horse and her girl Lucky plus their other horse and human pals. A brave and resourceful girl gang.We all had \"Spirit\" names from the game created by older DIL (check out her Etsy shop at¬†Ice Breaker Printables¬†for party name games for the holidays).Our younger son started an¬†Etsy¬†shop too selling the large wooden serving platters/chacuterie¬†boards he made (marks and daughter shop). He sold the first one 25 hours after opening the shop which was fun as we were all there to see him do the photo shoots and get the shop up and running.The birthday girl had a grand time and no tears this year! In fact all the kids seemed to have a good time. So much noisier and more active than the 2 year old party.Our and their dogs enjoyed hanging out during the visit as usual and the cat even made several appearances. She hisses at our dog (who likes cats and is gentle with them) and who she has known for at least 6 years. This time our dog just looked at her and kept walking. The cat backed up so it was a statement not a threat!All in all a success. Now back to everyday life."},

She does like her dog \"cousin\" a lot but otherwise seems not that happy being there so it is hard to understand. Once again - if only she would learn to talk!We are going primarily for our granddaughter's 3rd birthday party but also son and Hubby are going to a Cal-USC game as Hubby's birthday present.

All gone now except for the pine cones that I brought in for some seasonal decoration.BATH REMODEL - Our newly remodeled guest bathroom is almost back in operation after a thorough cleaning. We ordered a custom shower door and scheduled installation later in the month. pan.SOCIAL LIFE - My schedule was rearranged so I could go to my club board meeting, book club and craft group.¬† Out to lunch with friends after the first meeting.GUEST ROOM UPGRADES -¬† I found end tables, table lamps and a down comforter online. Perhaps I will also look for some rugs by the sides of the bed.BERKELEY AGAIN -¬† We head to Berkeley next week for our granddaughter's 3rd birthday, our son taking Hubby to a Cal vs USC football game for Hubby's birthday, and the two of them working on home improvements for a couple of days. Our other son and DIL will come up for the weekend too.SHOPPING OUR GARAGE - We had reluctantly accepted a hand me down like new Emeril air fryer from Hubby's aunt and then stuck it in the garage. Our toaster stopped working and so we pulled it out and our going to try it as a toaster!SICK POOCH RECOVERS - Poor dog had another random day of being sick, but bounced around the next morning and ate eagerly.¬† She is on antibiotics for now and had a negative parasite test result. If only she could talk and describe how she feels before throwing up on the carpet repeatedly LOL.FICTION FROM REAL LIFE - I have so enjoyed the Amy Stewart mysteries featuring the real life Kopp sisters including Constance Kopp who was an under sheriff and lady detective in New Jersey in the early 1900s. She was widely covered in the newspapers at the time. I'm going back and reading the ones I missed. Check out Amy Stewart's website for more info on the history back story. She also has written a series of books about the natural world that look interesting.REMEMBER THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT - Only one more state needs to pass it for it to finally become ratified and it looks like Virginia just might do it this coming year! I think once the new state congress is seated we should all write their Speaker of the House and encourage getting it done! I'd love to see women's rights finally become law during my lifetime."},
{"title": "Living with wildfire risk", "date": "Saturday, November 2, 2019", "text": "We have been talking about how to address my fear of wildfires - basically a fear of not being able to get away from them in time. It is interesting that once I had my earthquake survival kit packed and water, etc. stocked up at home I really don't worry about earthquakes. They just happen and then it is over and you have to deal with the consequences.A wildfire though is in a definable place with the winds either sending it towards you or not. Roads can only take so many cars at once as people evacuate.So how often do you pack up and leave when not at immediate risk? I wanted to leave when the Easy fire (Reagan Library adjacent) started even though it was a ways away. The risk was that options for driving away would be limited if 2 freeways were closed instead of just the one that was closed immediately. The winds were blowing our way.We came home after one night and then that very same evening the Maria fire started even closer to us but the winds were not likely to send it our way. Hubby suggested I pack for evacuation before going to bed and have my cell phone near me to get any evacuation alert so that is what¬† I did.I'm learning to understand wind patterns. I need to learn more routes the leave in addition to major ones. We are considering whether or not for the car to be gone all day when one of us is at home. I need to figure out how to have our and the dog's meds packed and ready to go while rotating them so they are current. The dog needs food too and we need a change of clothes at least.¬† That goes beyond earthquake preparedness because usually you don't have to leave in the earthquake scenario.I found this great Wildfire And Emergency Go Kit¬†article and will be working on getting everything together for it as well as making it supplement out earthquake supplies with are basically food and water.So that is the plan. Any additional ideas?"},
{"title": "October is history", "date": "Thursday, October 31, 2019", "text": "This month both crawled and zipped by quickly depending upon the day!It crawled when I was the one to stay home with the dog while the bathroom remodeling folks worked away. However it is done now except for ordering and installing a custom shower door as it is a non-standard size. Then the contractor will come back and install grab bars as we want them. We are in the process of doing a final cleaning, reinstalling towel bars and installing a new light. It came out nice and is a huge improvement over the 1980s version that was there.The month zipped by when cat sitting, reading, going to lunch or coffee with friends old and new, going out with our son and DIL and then heading back over to their house to spend the night when the winds were so terrible here last night and I would have stayed awake worrying about fires.Our evening out with our son and DIL was to attend the closing of a gallery show of a friend of theirs at an artist studio space. It involved some unusual music and drinks on the gallery patio followed by the 4 of going out to dinner and a good visit. I like the funky succulent garden wall on the patio and especially like the patterns made by the wood scraps used to build it.During our unplanned visit we entertained ourselves by dressing the dog for Halloween! Their dog hated to have clothes put on him but ours is fine with it. She makes a cute Halloween bat with her crazy ear hair due to very dry weather adding to the effect.We came home to piles of pine needles everywhere and a need for a big grocery shop and a nap after 2 nights of poor sleep. Otherwise all is well. I do have to come to grips with how I am going to deal with my fear of wildfires as this will be an annual concern unless we move into the city environment away from the mountains and hills. Something to think about as I get rather panicked at the thought of being stuck with a fire headed our way.Plans for November are mostly about family time. Lunch with Hubby's aunt and cousin this Saturday, a visit with another of his aunt's and cousin's in a week or two, a trip to Berkeley for granddaughter's 3rd birthday and a good visit with that son and DIL, and then Thanksgiving by ourselves as everyone local is traveling. I think we will go out for a nice dinner the evening before! That is how we handled holidays alone when we lived in Atlanta and it was perfect.I was hoping to make it to my club's 4 events in November, but have messed up my calendar for 2 of the meetings by forgetting and scheduling other appointments, we will be in Berkeley the date of the monthly luncheon and program, and I may not be able to attend and help with the post-Thanksgiving fundraiser if other family plans come through. Have made sure to update my calendar for December and January so I will have the times booked to attend!"},
{"title": "Wind and Fire - Must be Fall in California", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2019", "text": "Once again we are turning a wary eye to the paths of wildfires in our area and hoping others aren't affected by them as well. Signs of Fall if you live in California and the warm, fast, gusty winds are swirling. The first day of this year's winds was interesting due to the blow off of last year's fire residue from the hills near us. The air was brown, smelled like ash and it was really gritty. Add in lots of pine needles raining down. No fire for us so far but I've been thinking about potential evacuation routes just in case the closest one expands. Being near the coast does limit our options for leaving quickly along with the hordes of others who would be doing the same.Also on our minds is the in progress bathroom remodel and whether or not the accent tile we picked will look good. Hubby has been concerned but finally decided it will look good. The good news is there were no surprise problems once the old shower was torn out! And the dog is coping pretty well with being confined to a back room as the workers are in an out the front door. I'm coping less well with having to be home half the time (we are splitting the being here time).¬† I went to the farmer's market this morning especially because the hand weavers guild was having a sale and demonstrations. That wasn't a hit for me but there was a new to me vendor at the market selling specialty herb mixes and I got some to try and some to give. Also some luscious looking organic grapes, strawberries and yellow pepper. It really is so easy to go there on Saturday mornings - need to make it a priority.A friend and I managed to cater the woman's club luncheon this past Thursday despite a distinct lack of enthusiasm of both of our parts. The lead for providing meals quit suddenly so we are all trying out different ways of feeding 30 people. We bought everything LOL.Not much else going on in my life right now.

Well, they both have announced they are moving away!The great-aunt lives in the same assisted living facility that my FIL did and is moving to one near her daughter at the end of this month. That will really help out her daughter and hopefully cheer up the great-aunt who needs to be cheered up LOL.The aunt is another story. She has tons of friends going back to high school and is still living independently but slowly going blind from macular degeneration. I adore her and hope I can be half as sprightly, connected with others and interested in the present and future as she is. She is moving to Idaho to live in a condo near her son and DIL. She is so good at making friends that I'm sure she will manage such a big change although she isn't looking forward to winters and will have to stop driving.Hubby has one more 90+ year old aunt but she already lives with her daughter a bit further away than these ones and we only see her once in a while. However, they sold her home of decades and moved into a rental condo less than 2 years ago so again a move.I think we ask our oldest to be very resilient and would suggest that we all make sure we work on our ability to be resilient and not resist change!"},

As Hubby pointed out, she is his longest term friend that he still is in touch with. Not my oldest friend as I still am occasionally in touch with my best friend from high school and consider one of my cousins a dear friend from childhood.Then Sunday we headed back to the same area to pick up Hubby's 91 year old aunt to go to the cemetery for the 1 year anniversary service for his uncle. The day got of to a rough start with hurt feelings that someone wasn't going to come, the graveside gathering had tears and smiles, and then our small group headed to lunch and that was a good time for her. Big announcement that she has decided to move north several states to be near her son, DIL and granddaughter. Quite an undertaking at 91 but she is spunky. Glad she can envision a new chapter in her life is still a possibility.Monday - Crafting at women's club for sale to raise money for scholarships, lunch with a friend and then organizing of part of the club's building space. Home hot, sweaty, gritty and happy to have spent time with friends doing something useful . A good day.We had dinner al fresco at the Camarillo Ranch's Food Truck Thursday complete with a Neil Young tribute band. I was fun to see a lot of children running around and such a wide variety of people enjoying a late summer evening on the lawn. Not to mention the food! Out of 13 food trucks we chose Middle Eastern plus a glass of wine. I really enjoyed a lamb gyro pita and Greek salad. Then we drove to Old Town Camarillo to have cones at Mr. Softy.The photo below shows the dairy barn operations of the Camarillo Ranch which was on the site where the community where I live is now situated. From cows to the 55+ Leisure Village! The mountains behind are what burned last fall in our wildfire.I learned Tuesday that all my family will be here for my birthday.

Hubby is at the window ordering for us while I am saving the seat with the best ocean view.I went to my favorite club's board meeting and as always enjoyed the company of these interesting and kind women. One of my goals for year 70 is to find more activities such as this club that bring me companionship and joy and to reduce to the absolute minimum the things I do only out of a sense of obligation.I started serving as an online peer facilitator for a group that I truly enjoy. While it has led to me feeling like I have friends around the world it isn't a substitute for real life friends so I am eager to find one more local group.My little hummingbird garden art birthday gift to myself arrived and I like it.A new toilet paper holder arrived and will work well. We are waiting on the new light fixtures for both baths so don't know yet how they will work out but one of the ones in the master bath died earlier in the week so this change is just in time.

To put it all in context, Ridgecrest has had over 10,000 earthquakes this year.Starting my Birthday adventures in advanceMy birthday isn't until September 1st, but I decided I wanted to celebrate before, during and after LOL. So turning 70 is going to be celebrated by 7 adventures in our extended neighborhood!First one was a trip to the Santa Paula art museum about 30 minutes away. It is housed in an old building that was the offices for a lemon ranch/sales operation. The docent at the art museum really chatted us up and tried to recruit us to be docents too! We followed an enjoyable time looking at art by current California artists with lunch at an Irish restaurant and pub in the same old town area. They have kept the old buildings probably dating from 1890-1900. No empty stores that we could see. We will be going back to see the Oil Museum and the county Ag Museum. We've already been to the Aviation Museum at the old airfield.Then we drove home on a canyon road that took us through the mountains nearby. Back to the earthquake thoughts again as that is why we have mountains here!Socializing and fun activities:We took Hubby's 91 year old aunt out for lunch and had a wide ranging, interesting discussion. She is amazing and my older DIL and I both have said that we want to be like her when we \"grow up\"! She got a chuckle out of that when I told her and thought it was a great compliment. I continue to be amazed at the resilience of our over 90 family members.Determined to put down deeper roots in our community, we invited the couple across the street over for drinks and hearty hor d'oeuvres¬†which led to trying some new things to make for entertaining. It went well and everything we made was gobbled so now we have a potential menu for future gatherings. Since there were just the 4 of us it turned into dinner. Menu: bruschetta, sausage, melon & grapes, cheese, roasted asparagus, nuts & biscotti plus wine or pear martinis.I went to my club's holiday crafting morning to help make items to sell at some upcoming events as part of our fundraising efforts. Had a lot of fun chatting with the other women who showed up.The same day I helped run the Pet Club Health Fair which is always popular as the animal shelter gives free shots, microchips and licenses. Only 2 more Pet Club events and then at the end of the year my term as Treasurer is over and I'm glad!Last but not least I am still checking off the To Do list:- Signed up for one OLLI class for fall. I'm taking \"What Should I Eat?\" which looks at the evidence for different dietary choices.- Ordered checks which will mean we finally have our current address on them LOL. Not many used these days with online payments.- Scheduled an appointment to drop off old unusable paint although it is a month from now its on the calendar.- Found a new dog groomer and scheduled an appointment - hope it goes well.-"},

I haven't been very committed to this community or invested in this house but now - well I'd better be.Also we made the decision to spend more time both with family and away from home and to spend more money doing so since it is no longer earmarked for purchasing a much more expensive home.FAMILYSunday we drove to Pasadena to take our older son and DIL out for lunch and have a good catch up chat before they head out on their summer vacation. We also brainstormed ideas for spending more time together as a whole family. They liked the idea of renting a place that was half way between (Paso Robles anyone?) and also thought a trip to San Antonio would be fun.Our granddaughter loves to play with legos and loves horses ... so I sent her a small lego pony stable set. Approved in advance with her parents as I agree on the not too many toys approach.HOMEWe picked out the accent tile for our small bathroom update. This bathroom is the only part of the house that wasn't completely renovated when we bought it, but we are able to keep the parts that were done: flooring, vanity base, toilet and new paint on walls.The rest is originally from early 1980's and shows it. We are redoing the shower and vanity top/sink, changing out the heat lamp for a fan & light combo, and having the ceiling painted. We started this project to help sell the house, but now that we are staying for a while we can enjoy it ourselves.Dark is vanity top, white large subway is shower and mixed is shower accentMy FIL's painting finally got hung! I'm so glad we got it framed as Hubby commented that he is so happy to have the painting and have it displayed in our home. It is in a narrow room so it is hard to get a straight on wide view photo though.I cleaned out the garage storage and came up with a small pile to get rid of.I found half a can of paint in a color a shade lighter than the garage walls so I painted the worst wall just below some high shelves. It looks much better and now.Removed!Now about those boxes we were saving in the attic in anticipation of moving again .... another project for another day.I feel like we are nesting all over again 2 1/2 years after the flurry of our move."},

We do have plans to take my hubby's 92 year old aunt out to lunch on Saturday and visiting her is usually a joy.I want more fun though. There needs to be at least on meal out either at the coast of happy hour at the upscale restaurant we like. I need some time with friends. I want some kind of new experience.So I'd better get busy planning those things!Do you plan fun into your week or just let it happen?"},
{"title": "Small Time Sustainability edition of Six on Saturday - August 3rd", "date": "Saturday, August 3, 2019", "text": "Small time sustainability is a topic recently covered over at¬†Living Richly in Retirement¬†and I really like thinking about my current life habits and spending that way versus frugality. We don't need to be frugal at this point in our lives but do many things that are both out of habit and a desire not to waste resources - both ours and the planets. We can up our game though. So here are a few SMALL TIME SUSTAINABILITY items from our first week back from vacation.1. Repairing: We repaired our refrigerator. The water filter has not been removable for some time and we have since learned it is a design defect in this brand/model. The frig came with the house though and it would not be sustainable or reasonable to replace it. Although not my favorite design overall it does work. Now all of it works. I also found out I had been trying to replace the filter more often than needed so less waste there. I still need to replace a broken door shelf as the repairman received the wrong one in his order, but he told me a close by location where I can go get one next time I drive that way. And on my to do list is to mend a down comforter. It is getting worn, I need to replace a blanket too so I am looking for a duvet cover that will work.2. Reusing: I'm trying to be very mindful about reusing what we can. Plastic packaging seems to be unavoidable to a large extent. Case in point - bread wrappers. So they get at least one reuse as dog poop bags. A quirky reuse for us is egg cartons that are donated to a local food bank that uses them to package bulk eggs in sizes that can be given out. Which leads to thinking about all the packaging that is in the production and delivery stream before I buy my probably over packaged items in the first place.3. Sourcing: Still on the packaging idea, I have put going to the Farmer's Market on my weekly schedule. At least there is less of a packaging and shipping stream there. I take my own tote bag of course and will be taking plastic produce bags to reuse until I get non-plastic ones.4. Using Up: Although I am still using plastic containers for leftovers (because we have them already) we are very good at making sure those leftovers get eaten! I also add a bit of water to get the last of shampoo, laundry soap, etc out of the invariably plastic container.5. Borrowing/Sharing: I was thinking about the whole concept of Plastic Free July and wondering what steps we could take next so I requested from the library 3 books on the topic of reducing plastic use. Then for extra motivation (or will it be sadness?) I will request one about plastic in the ocean.I also love my reading group that meets monthly. We all read different books and then talk about the best and worst. The ones ready to share are passed around and I get a lot of different books that way. Once we are done with them they go in the clubhouse Little Library or are donated to the Friends of the Library for resale.6. Buying Less: I finished my second month of no clothing purchases. My summer wardrobe is working out great so any additions would be unnecessary. I will be shopping, but carefully, for fall and winter clothing as that part of my wardrobe is too sparse."},
{"title": "No move for us for now", "date": "Thursday, August 1, 2019", "text": "After 6 months of trying to figure out how to happily move near our little granddaughter we have concluded that we just can't in the current housing market in the East Bay of N. Cal. In fact the market has gotten even more frenzied than it was just 6 months ago.Our idea of living further away in Davis, CA seems a non-starter too as the commute time was much longer than predicted even though we made the trip on 3 different days and at different times. We may check it out again in the fall to see what it is like with 35,000 university students in residence but given all the developments sprouting between Davis and Berkeley the commute time would only get worse. The housing market is much easier there though.So where does that leave us? We are brainstorming ways to visit for longer stretches without camping out at our son's house during their work week. Perhaps visit a weekend then take a mini-vacation in another area nearby and then come back for another weekend? Rent an AirB&B for a month? Rent a vacation home and invite the family to join us? Babysit during school breaks? Join them for children's theater outings? We have decided for what it would cost us to buy a smaller home in N Cal we could spend a lot on visits LOL.We all have our thinking caps on. (And where the heck did that saying come from?)If you have any ideas on how to be a well connected long distance grandparent I'd love to hear about it!!!____________________________________________________________________We do like our current house but are feeling a bit isolated and don't really enjoy living in an age restricted community although people are very friendly and kind.On the family front, the good news is that our other son and DIL are still living in S Cal so we get to see them quite a bit and that is lovely. In fact we will go to Pasadena on Sunday and take them out to lunch to visit before they head off on vacation. My Hubby also has 2 aunts who are in there 90's and live alone that we try to see regularly.We are determined to get ourselves busier and happier with daily life here! Part of that will be to issue more invitations to others and entertain more. Planning a weekly outing especially if it is a new experience or exploring a new area will help too. I will also create a weekly routine to make sure I have plans and tweak it until it is comfortable and energizing. Hubby is going to make sure he has OLLI classes one or two days a week although I don't see any in the fall schedule that I want to take.We are going to continue to take care of the little fixes and improvements we would make to our current home to get it ready to sell and then enjoy them ourselves. Today the frig was repaired so we can use the water dispenser again. I still have to replace one of the shelves in the door but I now know where to go to get it. The repairman ordered it but was sent the wrong part.We made a deposit to finish the remodeling of our smaller bathroom as the previous owners only did it halfway! That will mean the whole house is updated although not upscale. I am going to fix up the guest bedroom too so it is more appealing in terms of decor.So there it is - our plans until, or if, there is a recession that causes a housing downturn that makes moving a practical option!"},
{"title": "Back home after almost 2 weeks", "date": "Tuesday, July 30, 2019", "text": "And we had a lovely time with family, pets, vacationing and looking at options for moving.¬†When we drive north from our house to Berkeley and have our dog with us we always stop for lunch in the same place, The Honeymoon Cafe in Pismo Beach Cafe, - unless it is a Monday and they are closed. The dog recognizes where we are and is quite comfy as you can see. On the way back on a Monday we happened upon another place in Pismo Beach that was open and had dog friendly patio seating so now we have an alternative!Our main initial purpose for our trip was to pet sit while our son and his family were vacationing. The dogs have know each other for over 7 years and are very compatible. Their greeting was a \"Where have you been?\" type and then they settled down very quickly like the buddies they are. The cat took a lot longer to come out although she has know our dog for about 5 years. Eventually she joined the pack.Then we settled in to making our pet sitting week a mini-vacation and move researching time. We really enjoy the view of San Francisco from our son's living room.¬†We could walk to a coffee place, market and restaurant so we pretended we were in Europe and took full advantage. A jazz quartet concert outside the the coffee shop followed by dinner at the restaurant next door. Almost daily trips to the market to pick up food based on what we had planned.¬†We also drove to a nearby very upscale Farmer's Market where we bought some local jam as a thank you gift for the neighbor who was watering our plants while we were gone. Big spenders that we are we bought one peach and an avocado too. I really like the amazing shape and colors of these mushrooms and the bee hive section at the honey booth was amazing to watch.Add in a walk down the walkways between houses dating from over 100 years ago with a Mexican restaurant lunch at the end, a drive to the Berkeley marina to have a drink at a restaurant over the water and watch the sailboats being buffeted by the high winds, a realtor visit and some other drives around and we quite enjoyed ourselves.But what about moving? Well, we drove out to Davis, CA three times and on two of those visits looked at houses with a realtor. Bottom line is the town is lovely, hard to imagine what it is like when 35,000 college students are in residence, and it was very hot! I'll walk you through our moving exploration process and decision in another post.Then our family came home and the visit went on. Hubby trying out son's virtual reality games.Lego building and cooking with our \"big girl\" granddaughter. And some good snuggle time on our last morning there!"},

Finished with a stop in the artist run gallery. Fun Saturday date outing.2. Sunday after sleeping 10 hours both the dog and I are still tired so I declared it an at home day but of course still dog walks! #chore day #hanging out #old jeans new styling3.

It is the only room that wasn't finished when we bought this house although it does have new tile flooring, low flow toilet and same paint as the other rooms.

More windows and screens washed. We are so close to being done with only 2 left.

Both the dog and I looked around at first trying to figure out what was happening.If you haven't experienced this type of significant earthquake then it is interesting to know that eventually things in your house/office/store start making noise and you feel like you might be on a boat as things sway around you. The rattling was what made me realize it was an earthquake and this one seemed to go on a long time.The type of earthquake like the Northridge quake we lived through in our prior S. Cal stay was a jolting feeling like a giant had picked up the house and dropped it from a short distance. That one sure jolted us out of our sleep.Don't like them no matter how they move but no harm or damage from this one here. Just a bit too much adrenaline rushing through my veins.Update: I just learned why it was a rolling quake sensation here thanks to the amazing Cal Tech geologist expert. She said that the rolling motion is caused by low frequency waves while the jolt is the high frequency. Low frequency ones travel much further than the high so you can know that it is pretty far away if that is what you feel. Good to know!"},

There is quite a bit of variety this week.1. Hubby played in his first pickleball tournament and had a great time. He and his partner came in second in the 60 and over category missing first place by just 1 point! He sounded so happy when he called me.2. We went to see Rocketman. Wow!!! I really enjoyed this movie and it was so emotionally engaging.3. We Facetimed with our granddaughter, DIL and son. We could really see how a 2 1/2 year old has trouble talking for a long while and resorts to showing off physically as a way to keep engaging. We did get her to draw us a picture while we watched which worked pretty well. So grateful for this medium to keep connected in real time and that she wants to stay on with us even if she can't figure out what to say!4. Our city decided to contract for electricity from a more renewable source provider and rates went up. I'm all for the decision but we are just now getting how weather and don't want through the roof electricity bills due to running the AC. We are experimenting with opening the house as long as possible in the morning and at night if it cools down. Also running all 5 ceiling fans on low to try to keep the AC off as much as possible. Not willing to be miserable though so AC is at the same temp as usual.5. I made lentil stew early in the morning on Wednesday so all we have to do for dinner is reheat part of it with torn spinach thrown in for a one pot meal. It used up some leftover chicken too as a bonus.6. It is proving to be very unnerving to reread 1984 in light of the current world and political situation.

We have kept going managing our income vs outgo about the same as always with a bit less concern about frugality. Habits are still there and serve us well though.I should note that we do not do these things to make our lives unhappy or to suffer. We spend plenty on eating out for example and pretty much do what we want. I do like to see our money spent well though when it produces the results we want for less!Also, we anticipate living for another 25 to 30 years and know many of those will be more expensive than our early retirement. Determined to enjoy each year we are allotted though.So here is a couple week's discretionary spending with an eye to savings.- Returned 2 items we weren't going to use - $7.25 back in our pockets.- Went to see Rocketman - but on $6 Tuesday which is less than the usual senior price.- Went out for pizza and beer at a local brewery and brought home the leftover pizza for lunches.- Ordered 2 Nuetrogena sunscreen tubes - but through Amazon subscription which saves $4.50 over CVS current price.- Bought 2 copies of 1984 as my book group has decided to read it and discuss in terms of modern life - but bought for $1 a copy and my Friends of the Library bookstore.- Bought what I wanted at the grocery store - but stocked up on canned low sodium beans as they were on sale.- Went out to lunch with friends - but ordered a small meal and drank water.Our do it ourselves activities.- Washed the screens and windows in one more room. 3 rooms to go but it will get done eventually- I probably should get the carpet professionally cleaned but I'm still spot cleaning. We'll see if we are going to move or not before paying for a cleaning service.The hire someone else list.- It has been impossible to change the water filter in the frig for over a year and since we are probably going to sell it is time to get it fixed rather than just not getting water from the frig. Scheduled the appliance repair person. One of the shelves in the door needs replacing too so I'll have them get the correct part.The just don't spend wins.- I volunteered at the Pet Club Ice Cream Social, raffle and pet photo even - but did not take any money so no raffle tickets and my dog is stressed at these kind of things so didn't purchase a professional photo of her as I left her home. My time is my contribution.- Hubby followed up on getting the sprinkler system leak fixed that was creating a pool of water (complete with tiny frog!) next to our house. The HOA fixed it which is why we pay our monthly fee.- So far so good on my 3 month clothes buying spending freeze.- After 2 years and 2 months we are still managing with one car!So far in 2 years of retirement we are being able to spend less than comes in so we can continue to add to our savings or make significant gifts to our adult kids. I know this won't continue especially if we do move to a more expensive housing market and the single family home maintenance but it has been lovely."},
{"title": "Six on Saturday - June 8th", "date": "Saturday, June 8, 2019", "text": "My week was busy with Pet Club and Somis Thursday Club board meetings plus my book club meeting. Typical first week of a month. Other \"excitement\" included:1. I slept badly Sunday night for unknown reasons, but the dog slept well. Then she picked up something that caused her not to eat or drink, have great intestinal distress and we both slept badly Monday night as she tossed and turned and her insides gurgled loudly. Easy for her to catch up during the day but not for me! Turns out we had to go to the vet who re-hydrated her and drew blood to try to find out why this keeps happening. What we do for our fur babies.Headed out to the patio for the sun and instantly fell asleep!We were talking about our dog turning 10 years old in July which means she has lived with us almost 8 1/2 years. Hubby mentioned that he thought we have given her about the best life she could have had unless she had ended up in a home that had a cat that likes dogs. She does love cats and is very gentle with them, but doesn't get why most of them don't like her!2. I finished the first week of my 3 months of No New Clothes Shopping personal challenge. 12 weeks to go. I'm trying to do this because I think I have all the clothing I need to get happily dressed for these 3 months. I'll make an exception if something wears out or there is a true gap. I know that I will need some new clothing in the Fall so I'm making a list as I think of those items.3. Looked at my \"maybe donate\" pile of clothes and it dawned on me that I might like to wear an older pair of cropped spring pants if I just changed the length to be more trendy. Fifteen minutes and they are no a pair of capris that look like they will work at least for this summer.4. My husband's cousin's widower's sister and brother in law moved into the third house up the street from us. Try explaining to others how we are connected LOL. I don't know them really, but they seem nice. Lots of sibling groups seem to move into this community which I suppose is very nice when they need support or help. My brother and SIL are firmly entrenched in New Hampshire and most of my cousins are in NH and MA. I guess we are a bi-coastal family.5. We decided we should try to make sure that a small earthquake doesn't bring heavy items falling on our car from the garage shelves. Hubby had the idea of using bungee cords to help hold them in place. Brilliant!6. I'm up to 5 ideas for my 70th Birthday Adventures Plan for the beginning of September (literally as my birthday is Sept. 1st). The latest are a:- Gondola Paridiso tour of Channel Islands Harbor- Food Truck Thursday at Camarillo Ranch- Dinner at what is a highly rated restaurant nearby that we COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT so never tried. A friend mentioned eating there recently and how good it was. And we are always saying there is no where to eat!So I am adding those to a trip to the Santa Barbara to art museum with a nice lunch (or the Santa Paula art museum depending upon exhibits at the time) and going miniature golfing (which we find great fun and haven't done in a long time).Hope you had a lovely week!"},
{"title": "Almost Summer Wardrobe Time", "date": "Monday, June 3, 2019", "text": "It is going to warm up here by the end of the week although we have plenty of cooler days left. Summer doesn't really get started here until late June/early July and lasts pretty late into September or even early October. Layers are still needed all summer but the warmth will get here especially when we spend time further inland.My friend Liz may already have had 100 degree says in the SE but I'm looking out the window at another June Gloom morning, a predicted high of 69, and running the heat to stay comfy indoors this morning, I'm going to chat about my Summer Wardrobe anyway!I think I have the clothes to get me through the summer weather already sorted out. Why? I'm getting better at following a process to create a \"right for me\" capsule wardrobe for the seasons and thus shopping better.What is that process? My friend¬†Liz Klebba in her Closet Play Image blog¬†lays it out beautifully for¬† her own summer capsule planning. Here is my version!What kind of look do I want? How do I want to feel?Thanks to¬†Imogen Lamport's 7 Steps to Style Program and great blog¬†I am pretty clear about the look I want - I call it Boss Lady, Retired as a shorthand and it is bold, vibrant and modern. Sort of a Relaxed Modern Chic for a height challenged retiree! It is good to have aspirations LOL.I want tofeel like I do when I am having lots of laughs playing croquet with my cousins at their annual July picnic, having dinner with friends outside, or walking by the ocean on a hot summer day. The clothes that fit thisfeeling, my body and lifestyle are:- Slightly fitted outfits in comfy fabrics-¬†Pretty and comfy flats and sandals plus a pair of white tennis shoes-¬†Dusters, light cardigans, loose pullovers, scarves and zip jackets for layering-¬†Clothes that work well for being active, walking by the ocean or dining outside-¬†Pockets, cross body purses and a great summer tote-¬†Fun earrings, necklaces and bracelets¬†Using pictures for inspiration helps to set a mood and helps me with slogging through shopping successfully! Don't get hung up on trying to recreate exact outfits as that can be very frustrating and they may not suit you at all. Colors, silhouettes, mood, accessory use - all are helpful though.Then it helps to have a color palette that your are working towards. I've picked 4 colors and 4 neutrals from my my own palette for this Summer to use the clothes I have and to carefully add some new items to make this capsule (hopefully) work well for weather, lifestyle and appearance.What do I already have?¬†¬†How much do I need? What level of refinement will be best?In checking what I had from last Summer and will carry over from this Spring's wardrobe, I found that 2 of my 3 summer dresses were past their use date and no longer fit well. I also had to let some sandals go due to foot problems and wanted to add a lightweight cross body purse that would work with everything. Dark navy crops and shorts also got released as they were worn out and too dark.I know that in Summer my¬†Project 333 capsule needs to take into account more frequent laundering needs. By the way, I don't include hats, sunglasses, belts, jewelry, exercise wear or sleep wear in that count.I have also pretty much settled into our S. Cal retiree lifestyle and don't need to buy clothes that are dressy as long as I can dress up what I have on the rare occasion that is needed. My life is a mix of smart casual outings, casual activities and dog walking/staying home very casual days.What do I need? How much do I need?I've already done this work for this Summer and ended up buying 2 new dresses making sure they would work with the duster from last summer. To there are 2 of my summer colors.I also bought 2 pairs of sandals (one of which I have on in the photos) and a cross body purse. I'm still thinking about a tote purchase, but will most likely use one I already have as I'm really ready for a clothes shopping hiatus. The exception I may have to make is to buy some exercise clothes for hot weather and to replace items that are wearing out.I'm ready for Summer weather to get here and to just be able to reach into my closet for an outfit I like to wear and then forget about it the rest of the time! My focus then can be on adding more activities of interest to my days instead of on shopping or spending time figuring out what to wear.Has summer weather already arrived where you are or are you waiting for it to make an appearance?Do you go through a process before shopping for the season?"},

It is lovely to make your own salad green mix too plus buying the bumpy carrots that the stores won't sell. Lovely sunshiny morning to be out.2. Continuing our slow motion Spring cleaning soon to be renamed Summer cleaning. Another room's window screen and window washed. 4 to go. Also cleaned the frig coils and washed the kitchen floor. Such an exciting life I lead.3. Brunch Tuesday at my service & social club as we plan the meals and programs for the next 9 monthly meetings of the entire group. I may have said Yes too many times! I even got a bit dressed up but got to love the casual S. Cal retirement lifestyle.4. Then since Monday was a holiday and a perfect beach day, we did Monday at the Pier on Tuesday to avoid the crowds. Dinner was lovely as was the walk along the shore and looking out the window at the ocean from the restaurant. How do you like that carved swordfish sitting on the table?5. Decided to keep 2 summer dresses I ordered. One is poppy red, very loose, sleeveless & linen. The other a soft peach, loose with dipped hem, short sleeved and cotton/polyester. Happy to have my summer clothes sorted out already given what else I have in my closet. And I'm thinking it is time for a clothes (and books and pastries when out LOL) shopping break.6. I'm trying to decide what will make me really happy as a celebration of turning 70 at the beginning of September. One thing we have decided is a series of experiences that are a Staycation birthday variation. Don't know if it will be 4 done one a week for the month or 7 to celebrate each decade. Depends on how many I can come up with! So far I have 2:- Day trip to Santa Barbara to art museum with a nice lunch- Going miniature golfing (which we find great fun and haven't done in a long time)And I'm thinking a boat ride needs to be in there somehow."},

Throw in a late June theater and dinner outing with our son and DIL and that wraps up the planned social events.Of course there are the monthly vet visit for the dog's shot for her Addison's disease and her grooming appointment. I have a haircut and doctor appointment. And there are the Democratic Presidential candidate debates to sit through.I'm not going to bother to set any goals for the month, but rather continue with my exercise aspirations and try to make it to the Farmer's Market each Saturday morning.

It was lovely to have a relaxing time to talk with him in depth.2. On Monday we went to Ventura to walk beside the ocean and on the pier followed by a drink at the restaurant on the pier. This will become a part of our routine - Mondays at the pier.3. Tuesday I was supposed to have lunch with some friends but didn't read the email carefully and went to the wrong restaurant! Went home for lunch and then took myself to the library cafe for coffee and a cookie for dessert while sitting there and reading on a glorious day.4. I emailed a contact to get more info to plan our initial visit to Sacramento to see if it is a potential spot for relocation (thanks Sherri!). Her answers were similar to what we had identified ourselves but added some specifics that are very helpful.5. The plus side of living here - a sprinkler broke and was flooding an area right next to our house but all we had to do was turn in a request to have it fixed and it was. Are we sure we want to own a single family home again and be responsible for dealing with everything?6. Found a receipt that provides the name of the carpet cleaner we used when we first moved in. It is time to hire him again so now I can.BONUS - I think the dentist has finally fixed the problem I have been having with my bite on one side ever since I got a crown there!"},

We are both very ready to break back out into the \"real\" world of diverse age groups and a more urban environment.2) The dog had her monthly vet visit for her shot to treat her Addison's disease AND her every other month doggy spa day - bath, massage, haircut, blow dry, nails trimmed and a blueberry facial. She always walks out so very relaxed and who wouldn't! She is oblivious to the flower on her head but I take it off as soon as we get home.3) I made a batch of banana almond muffins. I don't think I mentioned that I had made banana walnut muffins to take to Berkeley to have for breakfast. The first morning we were there we found out their dog had managed to reach the bag they were in and ate all nine muffins for her breakfast! Time to have some muffins of our own I think although we had managed to eat 3 of the prior batch.4) I've been reading a lot of my usual mysteries, a book of poetry, a book on \"radical suburbs\" and skimming the cookbook \"Skinny Taste\". I received \"Becoming\" by Michelle Obama for mother's day so want to get started on that too.5) Lunch Thursday with some women friends which was very fun as usual. I'm grateful for having made some good friends here.¬†I'm looking forward to attending a musical performance tomorrow - \"Songs of Broadway\" - and to having our local son and DIL to join us for live theater and dinner in late June.6) I finished deep cleaning the den near the living room and we washed the screens and outside of the window in that room.

{"title": "Do you Spring Clean?", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2019", "text": "I don't think I ever have done a full Spring Cleaning of a house. My Mom cleaned all the time (or so it seemed to me growing up). True that if the windows were open then dust from the nearby fields blew in and each day dusting was required if you didn't want to be able to write on the furniture. Without air conditioning having the windows open during hot weather in Illinois was a must though.When I was a very busy young adult I did all my chores on the weekend so the house got cleaned routinely then. Now it is sort of a well, is it dirty enough to need some effort approach. Except this Spring I noticed that a deep clean was needed after 2 years of living here.Instead of an intensive Spring cleaning drive though I have decided to do one room at a time as the mood and energy strikes me. Thus it will be spread over many months.So far I've done the smaller bedroom, 2 bathrooms and the dining room as well as the front walk/door/doormat. We also refreshed our little patio area. We finished the den yesterday when we washed the screens and outside of the windows. Which makes me have to mention that we haven't done that in the smaller bedroom yet!I thinking the hallway with its big closet/linen closet and a random cupboard that has dog things, wrapping paper, etc. is next. Or perhaps the garage before it gets too hot? We'll see."},

As we drove along they were swooping and flying past the car from the south. Must be migration time.2. All home maintenance doesn't go away just because you live in a 55+ HOA community so we started washing screens and the outside of our windows. We are just doing a couple at a time as they are really dirty from the dust that blows off the fields nearby. There are services that will come do it for a fee but we still can so why not!3. In the not buying it category - I thought we needed a new doormat outside our front door but when I picked it up it was in good shape but certainly full of dust/dirt (see above). I got out a scrub brush and the hose and it will be good for a while longer. I'm going to wash the front walk too as it is covered and doesn't get washed by the rain and the tiles collect dirt.4. In the buying it category - We picked up a Spanish Lavender bush to replace a flowering bush that had gotten too large for the pot it is in on the patio. A monarch landed on one while we were selecting ours.5. I made a point of going to the Farmer's Market this morning and was glad I did. A beautiful day to be outside, live music and some good Spring mix, arugula, chard, tomatoes, strawberries and, for something I haven't bought there before, a loaf of fresh rye bread.6. I had a lovely time Thursday at the last lunch meeting of my service club before summer break. We gave three $1500 scholarships to three accomplished young women graduating from local high schools.

{"title": "Now what? Trying to move to N. Cal", "date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2019", "text": "Well after spending more time looking for a way to move to the East Bay area of N. Cal we became very discouraged and didn't see any path forward given the housing shortage and very hot real estate market. Then there is the issue that we want to enjoy living where we move next and plan to stay until we can't manage to live there so that rules out some smaller or very hilly areas. We were not cheery visitors with son and DIL I'd say!Once we got home we joked about moving to San Luis Obispo which is half way between each son's home (4 1/2 hour drive to each) but that would not make sense to matter how lovely the town and area. Then I started wondering about Sacramento, CA.What do you know! It is semi-affordable, no bidding wars, great things to do and health care and only 1 hour 20 min to our Berkeley son's home. We could fly down to visit the one in Pasadena if we didn't want to drive. So now we are trying to learn about Sacramento via the internet and thinking this may be the workable path. Still have really no idea what we are going to do but we are in agreement that we don't want to stay living in Leisure Village although that may end up being what happens.Then there is the question of how to do a move financially and logistically so I have been trying tothink of alternative ways to approach this. So here are all the options that I can think of right now.* Wait until enough CDs mature to pay cash for a new home while house shopping long distance and then sell this one to rebuild our savings. Could be over 2 years to have enough unless we cash out early.* Put our home on the market first then when it sells ...1) Rent a home there for 6 months to a year if that is possible given the market and our having a dog. Possibly someone on a sabbatical or in need of long term house sitting. How would we find that situation?2) Rent a series of long term Air B&Bs or VRBO homes that allow dogs.3) Live in son and DIL's spare room4) Rent local son and DIL's home for 6 mo to a year while they travel if they in fact do that.* Resign ourselves to staying here and ...1. Do 3 or 4 long term Air B&B or VRBO rentals each year to spend more time with N Cal family and be able to take dogTruly wishing this wasn't so difficult to pull off. Of course after a weekend with a 2 year old who has perfected tantrums we won't mind waiting a bit longer until being closer LOL."},

A gloriously beautiful Spring day that makes you want to pull a chair up in the sun and sit and read and daydream but instead you run errands, go to the library, walk the dog, attend a board meeting and have an annual physical!5. More rain which is so rare here but a good excuse to go shopping or catch up at home but first get the lab tests done from my physical with a new doctor.6. Wow, the day feels long when your dog keeps you up for 3 hours during the night because she is sick and then you remember what it was like to parent young children and still go to work but I avoided taking - dog is fine now!7. Finally got to see some of my Somis Thursday Club friends and go out to lunch and for 2 1/2 hours I laughed more than I have in a very long time.8. We spent the evening in Pasadena having dinner with our son and DIL and going to the Spring Art walk where we saw some amazing local talent in paintings (the one I wanted was $4500 - did not buy!).I've designated this next week the \"Get it Done\" week -9. After sleeping over and our dog being ecstatically happy to see DIL in the morning, we took them out to breakfast, headed home and spent most of the rest of the day sorting and getting rid of paperwork.10. A day of sorting through paperwork and other stuff that had accumulated in the house like Amazon returns so now all set for the coming week.11. Actually found 2 clothing items to buy for Spring - a scarf and linen top and ordered 2 pairs of sandals and one pair of flats to try.12. Spent the day addressing lots of piles of things which were mostly put away and a long to do list some of which got continued to tomorrow.Flat surfaces attracting piles of things!13. More chores - enough said.14. A day off mostly from chores since I went to my monthly women's club lunch meeting which let me get a bit more dressed up with my new top and scarf although that is a tank peaking out at the bottom as it was windy and a bit chilly.¬†15. Another day of Get it Done including appointments made, online paperwork and volunteer work completed, and general prep for the coming week.16. The third day of windier than usual and the pine needles are coming down a fair amount but I was out early getting groceries, then we went to the DMV armed with documents to get approved for the Real ID drivers licenses and out for pizza and beer at a local brewery as a reward.Coming up is Self Care week for me!17. Part of self care is spending time with friends and doing things you enjoy which is why I spent the afternoon with a few friends at a cabaret performance. (Also walked 2.5 miles in the morning!)18. Flexibility focus with a stretch DVD and then a mammogram and a bone density test finish off my physical for the year.19. Dropped Hubby at the train station as he heads off to Dallas to check off his bucket list item of spending a day at the Kennedy assassination museum and then continued the taking care of my health part of self care with dermatologist and dentist appointments.20. Today's self care was more fun as I got a haircut.21. Ahhhh, a massage which I have decided to do monthly for 6 months and see what the results are and then picked Hubby up at the train station.22. A fun day shopping in Santa Barbara with friends who also want to refresh their Spring/Summer wardrobes.23. Catch up day with tax payment, car washing, laundry, etc. before I start project and yoga week.Project and Yoga Week to Wrap up the Month24. Well, my project of the day was to get as far through module 11 of 12 for the beta test program that I have committed to doing so not much else happened except a walk.25. Such exciting projects we have going on including getting bids for extra attic insulation and duct sealing - contractor #1 today - and then we washed the car and put on the new tag.26. A tough night and morning as the dog has been not well, but we got into see the vet and she is really doing very well now which is a relief and made the rest of the day go better although little was accomplished except stretching and going out for a cup of coffee.27. Woke up determined to enjoy the day by reading and going out to lunch with Hubby - and I did plus I made chicken soup!28. Feeling lazy but at least Hubby booked contractor to fix insulation in attic.29. Laundry, yoga for 1 1/2 hours, finished research project for women's club and went to the library.30.

Sleep is good too.So what did I do during my Self-Care Week?Sunday I walked 2.5 miles and my bunion hurt so new walking shoes may have to be on the shopping list. I'm looking at Orthofeet shoes for walking. Does anyone have experience with them?I went to the \"La Vie En Rose\" cabaret show at held at my women's club and had a table with friends. Spending time with friends doing enjoyable things is important to self care IMO.St. Patrick's Day so I wore one of \"my greens\" and enjoyed the Irish coffee, soda bread and cupcake snacks. The music was amazing - just the piano and one vocalist doing part of her cabaret act in our 1930's space set up with bistro tables for 4 each.Our club building was an elementary school at one point. The stage was added by the club decades ago.Monday¬†¬†I finished my physical by getting a mammogram and bone density test. A session with my stretching DVD to focus on flexibility and a couple of dog walks and a trip to the Friends of the Library book store wrapped up that element of my day.Tuesday¬†More healthcare (I said there were appointments this week!) with an annual skin check at the dermatologist and a dentist visit for a replacement retainer. I was out early dropping Hubby off at the train station and saw a gorgeous sunrise. Came home and listened to some music before heading to first appointment.Also realized I had missed the dog's appointment for her monthly shot for Addison's disease - first time in 5 years that I have goofed and she has been perky so it took a while to catch. Fixed that with a trip to the vet after the dentist. Owner care for pet week too.Sadly my son and DIL's lovely dog died today at 15 years of age and they are really grieving. I will talk to them tomorrow.Wednesday¬†Glorious sky all day with a mix of cloud types and shades plus blue sky. Made banana nut muffins for my breakfasts with peanut butter. A much needed haircut. And I finally finished deep cleaning one bathroom which is not self-care but is progress!This was late afternoon from my drivewayThursday¬†Did chair stretches, gave myself a manicure and pedicure, and had a massage. Once again I learned that if I don't do my stretching/yoga daily I will have aches and foot cramps. Maybe I'll start doing it?Then picked Hubby up at the train station later than planned as his plane was delayed for repairs and then crew. He had a great time on his trip.Friday Drove to Santa Barbara to meet two friends for a day of shopping and laughs which was really fun. I met these women online in our style course Facebook group and have seen them each separately once before. So fitting room diary photo -Saturday¬†I decided I needed to consolidate the week. I'm tired and need to catch up on some things like paying our taxes, washing the car, deciding if I need to try a different size in the pants I bought yesterday, etc. I think this is self care too as I'm going to make sure I'm caught up in various ways so I can start the new week fresh.How was your week.NEXT WEEK? It's on to a couple of projects that will require sustained attention plus getting back to yoga class.- Research, document and write up info for selling vintage player piano rolls owned by women's club- Continue my deep cleaning around the house in 12 months by tackling the big closet in the hall to our bedroom and the hall cupboard.- Go to yoga class twice and walk as much as I can."},
{"title": "A \"get it done\" week! ", "date": "Saturday, March 16, 2019", "text": "This has been a \"get it done\" week and the results are good!Sunday¬†We both worked on clearing up things that had stacked up around the house. The biggest change was Hubby throwing out lots of my FIL's paperwork and finding a place to store the rest out of the way. He emailed a late arriving tax document to the accountant and gave the signal to file our taxes. We are still waiting on my FIL's final return for signing. He even dusted his desk!I went through club paperwork that was dropped off by the former President member and now have one box ready to go to the current President for decisions. I also bought groceries and gassed up the car.Monday I returned an online order to JJill and found 2 items instead that will work well at much less cost. Also went in the Clark's store to see if there were any shoes and sandals that might work for me and then came home and ordered 3 pairs. Dropped off an Amazon return of Hubby's and got cash from the ATM. Loaded up items for club evening meeting and will find a better place to store them tomorrow.Tuesday I'm sorry to say that there were piles on lots of flat surfaces when I started.At the end of the day only the piles on the counter next to my purse and smaller piles on my desk remained! The desk will get finished tomorrow and the stuff next to my purse will be taken to a club meeting on Thursday. So what did I do?Updated my reading list for my next book club meetingPrinted estimated tax forms and sent 1st paymentFound documents required to get Real ID driver's licensesUnsubscribed my FIL and myself from 7 cataloguesDid all emailing, material updating and banking for Pet Club, ordered more membership cards and put away materials from Monday night's¬† meeting and a box of materials headed to another person's houseReviewed minutes from Somis Thursday Club board meetingandSprayed weeds in the drivewayTook the dog for a nice long walk and to CVS to pick up a prescriptionWednesday¬†I continued to address my desk and online to dos. I also did some housework. My desk now only has the one project that is ongoing in a stack to the side plus the items I use everyday. Exciting huh?Thursday Mostly a day off from this fun week's focus although I did stop at the medical offices to ask them to send a new link to the online patient portal since there were problems with the last one. Tech support asked them to do it last week but didn't happen. I found out they had reentered my email incorrectly. I finally got it to work!What I did do today that was fun was attend my women's club monthly lunch meeting. Got to get a little bit more dressed up.Friday If it doesn't get done today when will it get done! What was left was¬† updating our first responder medical info cards for the frig and putting my new Dr's info into my MedicAlert record. Then there was the PR materials for Pet Club - the volunteer effort that I am starting to resent & I've already given notice for the end of the year. Ordered some new tea towels for the kitchen. Bonus points for doing laundry and trying a new dinner recipe - quinoa, broccoli and beef bowls.Saturday The week isn't over yet! Groceries, a trip to the DMV armed with lots of documents to get our Real ID drivers licenses and out to dinner as a reward!Next week is SELF CARE week for me.¬†Join me!I already had some medical appointments so I added some fun and rejuvenating activities too."},

So here is the last 2 week of my February. Nothing exciting I can assure you LOL.FUN- We drove to Berkeley in the rain and saw 4 rainbows! Three of the rainbows were very low so the top of the arch seemed to be sitting on the ground and the bands of color were very wide. Lovely. A long weekend with our family there including our much loved granddaughter. The drive home was in sunshine but there was snow visible on mountains where usually there isn't any.- Lunch with our local DIL who was in our town for work. We went to Love Pho N' Mor with me having 4 seasons spring rolls and the others having soup. Nice visiting!GOT TO DO IT- Tax accountant appointment and review of our returns with my FIL's yet to do.- Browsing neighborhoods and houses near Berkeley to see if there was a place that we would consider moving to.- Finally getting 3 crowns installed after much effort to get them the right color and shape.UNUSUAL EVENTS- Another ER visit for Hubby that turned out to be a chest muscle pull causing pain breathing instead of something much more serious."},

Berkeley and found some areas we really liked although not the prices. Then Hubby looked up where the Hayward fault line runs and it runs right under our son's house and through the areas we were seriously considering. Since it is considered one of the most dangerous fault lines in N. Cal he says no to purchasing a home in that area.So we are considering further away and then wondering if that defeats the purpose of moving close LOL.Anyone have any insight into living in the Pleasant Hill area east of Berkeley or in Napa?So much to consider but we have to keep moving forward."},

She is at the point now that she asks to Facetime us so we are delighted with that. The poodle princess gets to stay home with her sitter and I think in her heart that makes her happier; certainly less stressed except for wondering where we have gone.So what have we been up to so far this month?Hubby started an OLLI class on epigenetics. Hopefully we will both understand what that is after a few more sessions!I've been in and out of the dentist's chair too many times. This too will pass.We went to see the movie Stan and Ollie and really enjoyed it. Highly recommend.We also went to a staging of an opera, The Tales of Hoffman, at my club's building. It was a lovely afternoon with bistro seating, wine and snacks. The opera was staged using the whole space so they moved among the audience and it was amazing. Then out to dinner with the two friends who shared our table at the opera.Don't want to forget to mention the rain. We have had days where it came in monsoon like levels of downpour, a rare S. Cal thunderstorm and lots of showers. Starts in again tomorrow. No complaints as we just cross our fingers that the reservoir serving this area is filling up after a many year drought. The roads near burn areas have had some mudslides and mandatory evacuations though so not all positive.Hope your month is going well. Let me know what is happening in your life."},

Just started to feel better from that when we were in the ER with Hubby in great pain from gallstones. You can tell where this is headed can't you? A Sunday evening gallbladder removal which identified a further procedure that needed to be done and which was on the 29th. All is well now - but next time I'll be more specific and say, I need more fun and pleasant things to do!!!All of this has led to little progress on goals, stress eating and lots of time spent vegging. I've continued to walk the dog but that is about it for exercise. I went out to lunch with a friend before all of the above.How was your month?"},

I'm realizing that the 2 groups I am involved with have all their activities in the first half of each month and then nothing. Looks like I need to make plans with friends and family for the second half of each month so I have something to look forward to!I've spent a lot of time on our finances. Balancing everything for the end of 2018, making the 2019 budget, thinking about what to do with our inheritance and if we move again what that will cost. We had quite a few occasional payments due and other action items, so I made a chart by month for those periodic bills and things like appointments to make, birthdays, etc. and it is helping.I've also decided to focus on being even more conscious of my/our optional spending more from a minimal impact and not adding more stuff to our lives perspective (rather than financial) - see the new tab at the top of the blog.So I am summarizing how I've done on my 2019 Intentions twice a month for now as a reminder to focus on them. I did pretty good!2019 Dreams, Aspirations and Hopes (No goals here) - January 1 to 14SORTA¬†1. Make exercise a do-able habit¬†- Focused on stretching and walking. Did my stretch DVD 3 times so far this month and walked 8 times. Need to work on stretching more!YES¬†2. Lots of family time¬†- Lovely time with all immediate family on New Year's Day at the Rose Parade and then half of them at our house that night and the next day. Out to lunch with Hubby. Called great-aunt to invite her to lunch but she was ill so will make that happen later.YES¬†3. Be active socially¬†- The first half of the month was busy. Women's club board, book discussion group and monthly meeting. Pet Club meeting. Scheduled lunches with two friends for later in the month and a group outing in February.YES¬†4. Dream and evaluate location and lifestyle options¬†- Had an initial discussion re options and timing of potential move to the Berkeley area. Looked at our investments to see how and when we could have the cash to buy a new place before selling this one.SORTA¬†5. Read with a purpose¬†- Went to book discussion group. Have requested several memoirs from the library.6. Refresh my wardrobe in my style and colors¬†-¬†This has taken an interestingturn as I have decided to do a Not Buying New Challenge for a while. Ifsomething wears out or if I have a specific need for which there is nothing inmy closet I can buy it but otherwise it is thrifted or nothing.7. Healthier food all the time¬†- Well, no.YES¬†8. House ready to sell or enjoy even more¬†- Deep cleaned the front bedroom. I wanted to buy something to store racquets and balls that were on the closet floor, but found a sturdy box to use instead. Enlisted Hubby to dust the ceiling fan blades and high closet shelf. Made a list of bedding replacements desired, but am not shopping for a while as I decide which are the top priorities for replacement/upgrading household items.9. Push my creativity¬†- Hmmm.YES¬†10. Learn¬†- I'm participating in a beta test of a new online program and learning a lot. I read an interesting book by Stephen Talty, \"Empire of Blue Water: Captain Morgan's Pirate Army\" and another by Shaun Bythel, \"The Diary of a Bookseller\".YES¬†11. Do more enjoyable things¬†- Attended a performance of an opera medley. It was very interesting and enjoyable. A group of us then bought tickets for a table at the February performance of Tales of Hoffman by the same local opera company."},
{"title": "December 2018  - Week by Week", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2019", "text": "December is full of commitments for many of us isn't it? Hopefully yours had some lovely entertainment and time with loved ones too.Week 1:¬†We tried to go out for dinner Saturday night, but ended up just having drinks as we waited 1 1/2 hours after ordering , but no food arrived at our table!Monday was a busy day starting with exercise at home, than a \"who knows why\" vomiting dog who had to see the vet twice (fine now), laundry, a Pet Club board meeting with the new club President too ill to come so I am still in charge (sigh), and a call from our son where I learned the deer tree ornament sent to our 2 year old granddaughter was a big hit (yeah!).Went to a women's club board meeting to report on progress on a project and got elected to the board which was a big surprise and I'm not sure what it means commitment wise, but I do like these women! The next day enjoyed another interesting discussion about book with the book subgroup of my women's club followed by lunch (shrimp enchilada and salad - yum!)Week 2: Made 4 dozen cookies for the Pet Club Holiday Dinner dessert potluck. They are White Chip Cranberry Blondies and boy are they sweet! We (the club leadership) managed to pull off a successful party despite ill health on several people's part. Whew.And then there was my women's club holiday meeting and potluck lunch for 37 people. I made Balsamic Honey Carrots using a recipe from Budget Bytes and they were such a hit that I was asked for the recipe. That has happened before like - never. The trick I think is roasting the carrots instead of steaming or boiling them. Then we had a middle school jazz pop band play for us which brought back lots of memories of sitting through many, many concerts of my musician son. I wore the apron made by my new DIL's mother for each of the women in the wedding party out of extra fabric from the tablecloths. The sunflowers match the club's logo and I was helping with lunch.We ended the week by having salmon tacos for lunch on the Ventura pier while watching the waves roll in.Week 3:¬†We are exchanging \"stocking type\" gifts with our local son and DIL. I packed each of them a gift bag of food, fun and emergency kit items. The dog is \"getting\" a small Christmas tin filled with poop bags. I'm sure he'll be thrilled LOL.Hubby's 90 year old aunt called to remind us that she will be going to Idaho for 2 weeks to visit her son and his family. I want to be her when I grow up! Her husband died this year so she took the challenge of traveling by herself having never gone through airport security or taken Uber. She uses GoGoGranny to schedule her ride. What a strong woman.¬†And our beloved pier in Ventura was damaged by 15 foot high surf (Photo) and closed until repairs can be done. This historic pier has been damaged by waves or burned many times including having 20 feet of pier ripped off once. It keeps getting repaired although there is no date set for it to reopen yet. Lifeguards also had to use water craft to rescue surfers who couldn't resist trying to ride the waves.Week 4: A lovely Christmas Eve at our son and DIL's followed by a sick Hubby on Christmas morning so we came home right after a quick opening of gifts and before their brunch party started.¬† It was fun to meet the Mom of one of their friends from S. America. My son met him when they both lived in Japan for a while. They have such a nice group of friends and throw really fun parties.And then there was the unexpected. For the first time in 53 years of driving I was on the freeway and my car simply lost all power and with that the ability to drive. I was able to get over into the breakdown lane fortunately but was between a high wall and the end of an on ramp. AAA showed up very quickly and got me and the car off the freeway safely, the car needed a new fuel pump and 7 hours after I left home I was ready to drive back with only a repair expense. I admit I was initially terrified, but now I am only feeling grateful.¬†BTW, the tow truck driver said if your car stops in a traffic lane and you can safely remove yourself and get off the freeway that is the best thing to do as your car is definitely in danger of being hit! I stayed with my seat belt fastened so in case I was hit the air bags could help me and I wouldn't be thrown out of or around the car. He confirmed that was the best choice in my situation.Last 2 Days:¬†Getting ready for a short visit by son, DIL and granddaughter so cleaning and grocery shopping. Spent the early part of the 31st with both sons and their families before bringing the dog and ourselves home for a very quiet New Year's Eve. Hope your year was fabulous!"},

Tomorrow may be my older son's birthday but he has to work and I dropped off his gift on New Year's Eve. Always shortchanged with a very early January birthday as people are celebrated out LOL.Anyway, I've spent part of the day looking at year end financial numbers and our plans for next year which are still pretty much up in the air on the moving front. We spent a ton of money in 2018 if you count turning family loans into gifts. But we did inherit more money so .... We will continue to contribute to a 529 plan for our granddaughter but at our children's request we have reduced gift giving even more for Christmas.And (thanks California DMV) despite getting driver's licenses about 1 1/2 years ago we both need to make appointments, dig out all the required documents and pay another $35 to get the Real ID Driver's License! Yuck.I think I am going to try to not shop out of boredom or unwillingness to wait (for a book from the library for example) this year. I have done my winter wardrobe using Project 333 and am already bored (but that is a personality problem not a wardrobe or need to go shopping problem.) So what behaviors can I substitute for shopping/browsing online or going to stores and wandering around? Eating is out and library trips usually involve a coffee and sweet but could switch to lunch. Exercise is good. Hmm - what else?We are talking about using Hubby's cancelled flight credit to both go to Dallas as he had originally planned to see the Kennedy assassination museum. I might go to the Dallas art museum instead! Then we would drive to Austin and on to San Antonio (where my parents were married at the end of WWII). I had originally thought of¬† going to Santa Fe but this makes more sense and will be fun.Ideas for what to do in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio please! And when is it best to go in late winter or spring before it gets really hot/humid but not during the rainy season?We need to research where we might live in or near Berkeley and have what we want house, price, walkability to restaurants, etc. and opportunities to meet people and make friends vs an area that empties out every day. Moves during retirement are tough on the making friends and finding meaningful and fun things to do front.So here is to kicking off 2019!"},

I got strawberry shortcake while our granddaughter had a plane on her cake!We had the very fun wedding of our much loved older son and his sweetheart of 20 years.

They do need refinement and turned into actionable steps in some cases. Call it setting intentions and direction instead of goals.But first I want to set one for my dog! Sleep past 4:30 am regularly in 2019 please LOL.2019 Dreams, Aspirations and Hopes (No goals here)1. Make exercise a do-able habit - ideas: walk/treadmill/swim daily; yoga/stretch 2x per week; weight/strengthen 2x per week; read the RBG workout book and see if it fits as a plan; try local Pilates studio2. Lots of family time - this should be easy and a continuation of what we have been doing.3. Be active socially - invite friends to do something or come over once a month, increase role in women's club4. Dream and evaluate location and lifestyle options - includes evaluating the option of relocating to the Berkeley area and purchasing a small home there; take a longer trip to Berkeley including spending time with a realtor learning locations and market5. Read with a purpose - first quarter is probably going to be reading memoirs and biographies of strong modern women; continue in book discussion group6. Refresh my wardrobe in my style and colors¬† - keeping to a plan and budget with an eye to spending more time in the Berkeley area and climate; possibly hire my stylist friend to help me shop in an environmentally sound and stylish way (She wrote this great blog post for me!¬†Style Recipe¬†)7. Healthier food all the time - read, plan, eat, enjoy8. House ready to sell or enjoy even more - deep clean and declutter one room each month from rafters to floor, address any needs/fixes and refresh with secondhand/re-purposed/carefully chosen finds (Thanks for the idea¬†Barbara¬†)9. Push my creativity - refashion, re-use, re-purpose, make myself; hold a cocktail party; etc.10. Learn - Take three classes from OLLI or other source11. Do more enjoyable things - perhaps a vacation trip, regular live theater (season subscription?), gallery show openings, musical performances at the libraryYes, I am aware 2018 isn't quite over but in the tradition of thinking about what will be my goals and dreams for the coming year I am first thinking about what went well in 2018! In random, brain dump order here are the first 10 to come to mind.1. We had lots of lovely time with our family! Definitely something to repeat in the coming year.2. I made friends and found groups to get involved with. I'm talking about you Somis Thursday Club and Leisure Village Pet Club. Both are letting me use my skills and strengths as well as being fun and welcoming.3. We went for walks by the ocean regularly. Lovely to be able to drive there in about 20 minutes.4. I now feel very comfortable driving around and know how to get places easily.5. Our home functioned well and the neighbors are friendly but not intrusive.6. Our retirement budget worked!7. One car living is not only possible but will be continued.8. We have found some restaurants and a live theater that we enjoy as well as a farmer's market.9. We have both been healthy and found new exercise venues: Pickleball for Hubby and yoga for me.10. I continue to enjoy learning about color, style and wardrobe design without spending a lot.I'm sure there are many more but there are the ones popping out of my head at 6:30 in the morning!What went well for you this year?"},
{"title": "November wrap up", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2018", "text": "This was a generally a fun month for us! Granddaughter and Hubby's birthdays a day apart, Thanksgiving with family and generally a cozy California month. It was also a month of further deterioration of my FIL's health (he is 92).First 3 days:¬†Tough start to the month. Hubby went over to his father's assisted living facility three times to consult with the hospice nurse, assisted living staff and his father after his Dad was found unresponsive twice. His level of care was increased. Hospice is great as is being close enough for DH to help manage care and be there to talk and listen.On a happier note, our granddaughter loves planes and spots them in the sky before anyone else! Her 2nd birthday party has a female aviator theme and we get to make 150 paper airplanes that will be part of some yet unexplained decor installation. DIL is a non-profit fundraiser and does lots of events and has the best ideas. So on the hunt for red and tan printer paper to fold into planesWeek 1: My father-in-law died Sunday morning at the age of 91 so this week is about arrangements, family support and change. The fires in S. Cal started on Thursday. We evacuated ourselves and dog on Thursday evening to our son and DIL's house in Pasadena so we could be sure to make the funeral on Friday and not have problems due to road closures. The funeral was touching and a celebration of his life. About 10 people couldn't make it because of the fires but the rest of us gathered afterwards at my BIL's house. We went home Saturday to find out the fires had come close to our community but stopped on the other side of a wide dry creek bed. 10 fires trucks were lined up ready to act though. The assisted living facility where my FIL lived was under mandatory evacuation. What a week.Week 2:¬†It has been all about Pet Club meetings and to do items, finally getting back into FIL's apartment to do some more clearing out work, and then heading to Berkeley for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday party. Nice to turn our minds to happy family gatherings.Week 3: Way fun to spend time with an almost 2 year old. Singing silly songs, marching around and much more. All the time indoors because the wildfires in N Cal made the air quality awful. The birthday party was a success. Many more paper airplanes were made than were hung but it was really cute! There was even a toy plane cake topper.Then back home to¬† get ready to host Thanksgiving dinner. I am extremely thankful that you can buy a cooked turkey, side dishes and pie from Whole Foods and just go pick it up! That way we have salad, scalloped potatoes and an apple crisp coming with guests so all we had to do was clean, make snacks for before dinner and buy wine and beer.To wrap up this week we finished emptying my FIL's assisted living apartment and may get a partial month refund of his fee to add to his estate. In the end we were able to find people who wanted most of the furniture and decorative items, donated bath/kitchen items and clothing and then had the rest hauled away on Saturday.Week 4:¬†It only took 19 months after our move, but we now have our CD player, receiver and speakers set up in the living room! Old technology but good quality. The table holding the TV in the den now holds them and a cabinet from my FIL's holds the TV. I have my music again. Now to figure out how to turn on wi-fi on the TV we brought home from FIL's and see if we can stream movies to it.Hope your November had lots of happy moments.    An InLinkz Link-up"},

I hear it was a big hit, got hung on the tree immediately and is pointed at when she passes by LOL. Little gifts for a little girl is my theme for her this year and I am spacing them out and avoiding Christmas day totally. Next up is a fleece type top with a sparkly \"little pony\"¬† on the front and sparkle tights. Legos, llamas, \"Little Ponies\", singing and tubas are her current passions.It is her Mom's birthday today and I did go for buying from her list for this occasion. A gift card to a clothing shop as I am not there to have the fun of shopping with her. A joint gift for her and our son is going in the mail soon with an open me now tag.Our local son and DIL have asked to scale back to stocking type gifts/consumables so I am filling a Christmas gift bag with those types of things and having fun shopping for them. I haven't figured out what to do for this son's January 3rd birthday though. How can it be that he will be 48?Are you having fun with gift planning, making and/or purchasing this year?

I want her to really enjoy a few things amidst the excess she will receive from extended family. So far I have sent her a deer ornament for her first tree as 3 deer visit her yard and she is enchanted by them as are all of us. The twin yearlings (does that apply to deer?) and their Mom hang out as the twins were born in the yard next door.3. Enjoy the time with others at social events!

Very appropriately it says \"Lets Party\" and is still there just a bit.I bought dried persimmons from a vendor at my local Saturday Farmer's Market. Hubby doesn't like them but I like the subtle flavor that only appears once you chew well. Sort of a fruit leather texture. You can see the seeds and beautiful interior design of the fruit.

{"title": "Wow that was a month! Now to get back on track without getting bored.", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2018", "text": "Last night I fell asleep at 8:30 and slept until 5:30 this morning. Tired physically and emotionally after the ups and downs of the month so far. So glad there were the happy times to balance out.In summary:11/4 - My 91 year old FIL died with Hubby holding his hand.11/5 - We started dealing with his apartment, funeral arrangements, financial items, etc.11/8 - The S Cal fire nearest us started and we left home to stay with our son and DIL. Good evacuation decision making and packing practice.11/9 - My FIL's funeral and the family gathering after which was very nice11/10 - We came back home after the fire moved away from our development11/15 - We briefed the dog sitter and then drove to Berkeley and gave ourselves plenty of breaks including a walk on the Pismo Beach pier and lunch at the Honeymoon Cafe where we usually stop with the dog.11/16 - Babysat an almost 2 year old granddaughter as her day care closed due to the N Cal fire air quality issues11/17 - Helped set up for 2 year old's birthday party11/18 - Said party11/19 - Drove home and dog was happy to see us but had also made friends with the sitter - yeah!11/20 - Vet for monthly treatment, laundry & groceries for us and Thanksgiving dinner11/21 - Cleaned house, prepped for overnight guests & made birthday dinner for Hubby. He played pickleball and then went to Whole Foods and picked up the precooked turkey and side dishes.11/22 - Thanksgiving which was very nice11/23 - Hung out with guests (son and DIL). Went to FIL's apartment to remove a cabinet we are keeping and send other furniture off with others. More was able to be passed on than we had anticipated - yeah.11/24 - Farmer's market with guests & cleaned house. DH finished emptying FIL's apartment, turned in the keys and paperwork, and brought home 4 large boxes of photos.11/25 - Laundry, sorted and shredded FIL's papers, & did some furniture rearranging and setting up of CD player - yeah for music on demand.Notice there is no exercise listed as I rarely made it to yoga or did my at home version. There was some dog walking, lots of housework and event prep, lots of standing, lots of eating and lots of wine LOL. Books read were of the mindless cozy mystery kind and not very many.So it was a lovely family filled month. A month of new memories. A sad month. A scary month. An unusual month. We managed some good laughs along the way and talked quite a bit about our parents who are all gone now.I am hoping to use this last week of November to reset a bit to a new, albeit temporary, normal.Yoga is a priority and I have it down for 2 days a week. Longer walks with the dog too. Perhaps even revisit the gym?I should take a wine hiatus. I didn't drink at all for over 2 years back in my mid 50's after I suffered acute heart failure. I'm fine now but just mentioning that the will power is there.I have 2 commitments in December plus family Christmas, but am going to put off the larger issues of transitioning the Pet Club leadership and trying to sell the Women's Club parlor grand player piano until after New Year's.So I have to make a hot vegetable side dish for 30 people for the December Women's Club luncheon. Any ideas??? I'm thinking some kind of glazed carrots?Then there is the Pet Club Holiday Dinner Party. It is rather like herding cats at the moment but there is a team on it. Again some cooking - 3 dozen cookies. No decision here yet.Christmas is pretty low key. First there is a DIL's birthday gift to sort - must get son to send some ideas. Then there is the rest but we are all simplifying. We will exchange stocking stuffer gifts with the local son and DIL on Christmas morning and attend their Christmas Eve dinner. Probably sleep over too. The other son & DIL will be down for New Year's and to see the Rose Parade so we will exchange small gifts with them and our granddaughter on New Year's Day.Whew, I feel better getting that all out!"},
{"title": "Talking with middle age children about our and their finances", "date": "Saturday, November 24, 2018", "text": "Both Hubby and I were very fortunate that our parents were totally open with us about their finances and set up revocable trusts with their children as co-trustees. That meant there were no worries about their financial situation while they were alive and easy execution of their estates - or so far easy in terms of my FIL's as it is not done but progressing as anticipated.They never asked about our finances though so we felt free to talk to them without judgement and we have tried to follow the same pattern with our sons. As a result it all gets talked about with no drama.This weekend was no exception. My newly married 47 year old son and DIL asked how we organized our finances (joint accounts or separate) and how we tracked and budgeted for our household. They are quite experienced tracking their investments in rental properties and their side business but are looking at how, or if, to totally merge their personal finances. Since my since son organizes and processes information pretty much the same way I do, it was nice to be able to share the Excel spreadsheet I set up for tracking income and expenses and have used and tweaked for years. That led to a discussion of how much we are needing to live on and how we have our savings invested now that we are both retired and on Medicare.I do love this ongoing openness and sharing.I know not all families can sit and have a calm and interested discussion of these things and feel really blessed with both my son's maturity, sense of responsibility and calm emotional states when it comes to money. I'll take a tiny smidgen of credit for that, but it really is all to their credit as they have both deliberately created the lives they want and their way of dealing with others to match their values, personalities and goals. Thank goodness they are also care about our well-being financial and otherwise.Lots to be thankful for this Thanksgiving weekend.I hope you are feeling loved and thankful too."},

We spent the time singing silly songs, marching around and much more. All the time we were there was spent indoors because the wildfires in N Cal made the air quality awful.The birthday party was a success although she was mostly focused on playing as usual and not that interested in the decorations LOL. Many more paper airplanes were made than were hung although Hubby and Auntie made mobiles of them to hang outside too in place of balloons. It was really cute! There was even a toy plane cake topper.Our drive home included lots of discussion about if we will move again to be close to her now that my FIL has died and, if so, how we will make a decision about location and timing. We are still tired from the last move but will probably eventually make this one. Lots to consider."},

{"title": "Getting through the week after a death", "date": "Wednesday, November 7, 2018", "text": "We are at peace with my FIL's death but exhausted. Here is how the week is shaping up.- I cancelled all my meetings. Should have kept going to yoga but I am very tired. The time change has not sunk in for the dog and I'm falling asleep way too early as I am so tired. I woke up this morning to find the dog sitting up just staring at me waiting for signs of wakefulness. It was 3:30am. You can really see the stars at that hour lol.- I processed my clothing and shoe orders that were sitting around. Now have 2 new pairs of loafers for cooler weather and a lovely green cotton sweater. Other items returned.- On Monday while DH and BIL met with the mortuary and rabbi, I cleaned out my FIL's unit in terms of kitchen/frig, bathroom, leftover medical supplies and finding the rest of paperwork. Gave medical supplies to med techs at assisted living facility, some supplies to Hubby's great aunt who also lives there, and brought 2 large bags of books home which have now been donated to the library. Mostly I just threw stuff away and ignored my preference to recycle containers, etc.- Helped text and call re: time and location of funeral. Got dog sitter to at least come by to walk dog on day of funeral. Perhaps stay a while too depending on her schedule. Did a little grocery shopping so we could have healthier meals at home.- Trying to find new homes for furniture as we have until the end of the month to vacate his unit. Since we will be out of town 5 days for granddaughter's 2nd birthday and then there is Thanksgiving it will be a tight timeline. Trying to avoid putting into storage items that will be given away. One day soon we need to pack up all his clothes, linens and so on for donation and bring all the family photos home.- Our younger son and DIL will be staying with us the night after the funeral (Yeah!). The house is quite dusty, etc. so cleaning, more grocery shopping and laundry are today and tomorrow for me. If it was just us I would wait and clean after the funeral.- DH has started dealing with the financial details. Thankfully there is a trust that automatically goes to him and my BIL. Still a lot of paperwork as I recall from my Mom's death where there was also a trust involved that went to my brother and me. DH is also fielding the upset family member calls and condolence calls. Hard on him is an understatement.- I ordered not only a pre-cooked turkey but most of the rest of the meal for Thanksgiving from Whole Foods. Less stress is good.- If I need stress relief there are always those 150 paper airplanes to fold as my contribution to decorating for Granddaughter's 2nd birthday party. She sees or hears airplanes before anyone else and points them out avidly so female aviator is the party theme.I know all of this is just a small burden compared with what many experience after a loved one dies. The hard balance is getting everything done, holding loved ones close, taking care of your own well being and mourning at the same time.Hugs to all who have gone through this before or are preparing to deal with it soon."},

A long and resilient life. After my mother-in-law died 13 years ago at 80 he found a way forward and made a different life for himself.Both my in-laws were welcoming, kind and generous to me. I distinctly remember the first time I met them. My hubby invited me to go to the family Thanksgiving dinner - about 25 people! - along with my 7 year old son. We were hugged and welcomed and it stayed that way forever.Now we are the oldest in our family. My father died eight years ago at 88 and my mother 4 years ago at 93.¬† We come from long lived families and at 69 (me) and just short of 66 (DH) we probably have a long way to go - which is good!Last night we were talking about how odd it is in your 60s to realize that you are now an \"orphan\". The people who knew and loved you since you were born are now gone although my husband still has two 90 year old aunts. It is an odd feeling.Add to this the fact that we moved to our current location to be near my FIL when we would have gone near our granddaughter otherwise. Our granddaughter turns 2 on November 20th and the next generation is happy and growing. Perhaps we can still head to N Cal to attend her party.There won't be any swift decisions as there is a lot to do and a lot to process but once again we are facing a time of potential great change ahead.

There's a link up below if you'd like to see what others have done or join in.Week 1: Not only is it National Pumpkin month but the 1st was National Pumpkin Spice Day.

He wants it and we will take up in November.Week 4:¬†It looks like I can step back and just be Treasurer of the club that was without leadership. We have recruited candidates for the other offices and that makes me happy.But for another group I have agreed to try to sell a 1932 parlor grand player piano with 30 rolls. It is supposed to be quite valuable. Any ideas? We need contacts in S. California or anywhere if they might know of a buyer.And I felt very French (ok, very Californian) taking my tote bag to the organic farmer's market this Saturday morning. Even have the poodle to fit in although she stayed home. Lots of goodies including an apple tart to have with my coffee when I got home.Final 4 Days:¬†Sunday afternoon we went to see a performance of \"Into the Woods\" at our local small theater and it was great although a much darker story that we expected.Finally figured out where to get our kitchen knives sharpened: a mobile service that is at the local Joanne Fabric store every other month.HAPPY HALLOWEEN WITH A TRULY SCARY PUMPKIN!

You see for about 15 years of the 20 we lived in Atlanta we spent those holidays alone unless we or our family traveled across the country. We developed very low key responses to them. A slightly nicer than normal dinner cooked at home for Thanksgiving. Christmas was dinner out on Christmas Eve followed by a drive around to enjoy the lights. A few decorations on the mantle - maybe. We sent gifts of course but mostly just went on with daily life.Last year was our first back in the neighborhood of lots of family. A long weekend in Berkeley for the granddaughter's birthday party, back home to pick up the pre-cooked turkey, etc. from Whole Foods and cook the side dishes for a nice dozen or so family members for Thanksgiving. Christmas Eve and Day at our son and DIL's. Then I completely forgot about all of it LOL.So here is the plan this year.

Now they are available if you are 50 or older.The pharmacist did the usual warning of you may have swelling, redness or soreness at the site of the injection. Then she said or you may have flu like symptoms but do NOT call me if you feel like you are getting the flu as it is JUST THE SHOT so you can manage with Tylenol! I can only imagine how many phone calls she must have fielded as she is usually so mild mannered lol.Anyway, soreness and mild flu like symptoms for one night. No flu like symptoms this morning.

There was a made to order birthday dinner (chili and strawberry shortcake - much more delicious than it might sound) and a little voice singing Happy Birthday Nanna. Also a visit to a little farm and a little train ride, a trip into San Francisco involving buses and BART followed by a walk along the waterfront and many viewings of \"BOATS! WATER!\" with much excitement by an almost 2 year old. A visit to the Exploratorium too. Helping with unpacking, weeding,¬†¬†and general getting the house set up. Reading toddler books, building with legos and making playdough creatures. Wonderful. Then a drive home with another stop at our favorite Pismo Beach cafe (this time for BLAT sandwiches and a large side salad).A train ride in the park5 & 6Catch up day of bill paying, laundry, groceries, dog grooming appointment, flu shot, a chat with a neighbor, and there may have been some Chardonnay involved. The next day I pruned the bushes that are our responsibility, returned a plant to Home Depot, took a walk and browsed the internet!7Had a lovely time at my Women's Club book discussion group but Hubby is sick so unfortunately he had to reschedule his lunch with an old friend and I was tired so I picked up some ready made food.8-10Getting the stuff of life done: washed sheets and towels, mended, filed paperwork, ran errands for Women's Club and Pet Club, emailed my brother details about wedding weekend and visit after, cancelled Monday's massage as am feeling like I am getting sick after DH's 4 day illness (yuck and sigh - I really wanted that massage).But then DH cooked dinner, I took more Tylenol and felt well enough to watch The Notorious RBG - wow!11Sold raffle tickets for a Pet Club fundraiser this morning wearing an outfit that received compliments of \"adorable\" and \"hip\" (neither of which I have ever been called since memory began LOL)Tennies since I had to walk home.

Found out Home Depot can't copy my car key so I will have to go to the dealership, picked up a pair of olive jeans and a top at Macy's, grocery shopped and did some laundry. The dog saw a rabbit sitting still while we were on a walk and didn't know what to make of it until it moved and then she decided it was something to chase lol.18Follow up visit to dermatologist and cancerous spot on my nose had another round of freezing and so did another spot.19 -20Drove over to my son and DIL-to-be's home to have lunch with them and her parents and younger brother who just arrived for this weekend's wedding.

A pub crawl Friday night, final wedding venue set up Saturday morning, wedding Saturday afternoon/evening, brunch at Santa Anita race track followed by a stables tour on Sunday morning, final venue tear down Sunday afternoon and then home for us!Then we scurried around getting ready for my brother and sister-in-law to visit. Besides going to the Reagan Library and the Ventura beach and pier, we took them to the Maritime Museum, Murphy Auto Museum and an Italian restaurant all in Oxnard. Camarillo got represented in a tour of our lovely library (SIL is a retired librarian) and dinner at a wine and beer bistro. It was a nice mix for us of places we had been and liked and new experiences. I hadn't seen them since my Mom died 4 years ago and now we live on opposite coasts so it is even harder. Nice to have a long visit.A much quieter week is on the horizon which is great. Volunteer meetings, book discussion group, yoga, swimming and regular life."},

I can hear Lola sighing with relief LOL. Last time we visited them our dog could still get out of reach by getting on a chair in a specific spot. Poor grandbaby just wanted to pet but her pets were still turning into hair grabbing then. Her dog has really short smooth fur so a poodle was so delicious to touch. She does love dogs so much. I think we will have her help feed ours and have lots of planned opportunities for supervised petting this time which will help them both have a good time.Other plans are celebrating my 69th birthday, checking out the town just north of Berkeley to see if it might be on our list for our next move and generally having a good dose of family time.Hope you have a lovely Labor Day weekend too!"},

And what is it about frugal living blogs that fascinates me when 1) we have enough resources to loosen up and 2) I already know most of this stuff?Then there is the need to go to the library frequently. Could it be the chocolate donuts and chocolate chip cookies at the library cafe rather than the books that make several trips a week necessary?Why didn't I socialize more in high school and now for that matter? I did just reconnect (track down really) my best friend from middle and high school and am glad I did. But I also connected with another classmate who would have probably been happy to be my friend in the day and I would have enjoyed her a lot. Hmmm.Then there is my fascination with color but little art work going on now. I am determined to bring more color into my wardrobe at least going forward.We celebrated my birthday a week early at the request on the local son and DIL-to-be once they remembered that we would be at the other son's home on my birthday. They brought over a death by chocolate gluten free cake. We made dinner and had a good chat. They asked about travel plans and guess who surprised me? Hubby said he would like to visit all of the international cities listed in the paper weather report with the exception of Baghdad which is wise thing. This is a surprise because for years I have tried to get him to go to Paris and/or Amsterdam. He wants to start with the Asian cities though and I have no interest.

Wearing scarves to spice them up is out of the question in the heat and my lightweight necklaces lack punch.So today I zipped over to the back to school sale at my local consignment store with an open mind as to what might help. A top in a different color with built in details or a print? Colored shorts? Lightweight necklaces?Yes to necklaces! I bought two for a grand total of $26.19.

The dust from the fields blew in and Mom dusted the entire house every day until cold weather hit. I thought she was a bit obsessive!Now that I live near fields where the wind blows and the weather means you often have the screen doors open, I have more empathy! We have air conditioning so I don't dust every day but way more often then I had to in Atlanta and I really don't like it.This morning I went out to sweep a small patio on the side of our house that bears the brunt of the winds (not to mention dropping pine needles) and it is amazing how much true dirt was there.

This time it took almost 16 months. It sure was easier as a student where you met lots of people also new to the area because of school!So what makes this feel like home now?1. I can find my way around without thinking about it and have identified key places to go for what I want and need.2. I have made a few local friends and am seeing the potential for others.3. I have gotten involved in 2 organizations which gives me some scheduled activities. I've also tried and decided against quite a few activities/organizations.4. I've adjusted my exercise activities and wardrobe somewhat to fit the change in climate.5. We have finished fixing the things that were identified as problems when we bought our new home and have found that the homes spaces are working for us.6. We have found ways to integrate ourselves back into the daily lives of family after 20 years of being across the country and flying in for brief visits. This is still a work in progress though. If you move to be close to family again please don't be surprised if after the initial flurry of time together¬† you find that they are back in their routines and you don't exactly have an ongoing place in those. It doesn't mean they don't want you to - its just an adjustment.If you are quite outgoing or are passionate about hobbies or activities that you can jump into in your new location, you may find that feeling at home comes about much faster. If you are even more introverted than I am, have few hobbies that involve others or feel sad about leaving your former home, it may take you longer and require a lot of concerted effort to feel at home.I recently read a book that might help if you are struggling in a new location or planning a move and feeling anxious about how well you can adjust.This book is partly a memoir of how she tried out various strategies to become connected to her new hometown after moving very frequently and partly reporting on social science research and/or experiences and data from other sources."},

Capella group sing and the AC was out at the library lol.9th - Sad news this morning as we learned my husband's 91 year old uncle died so we spent part of the afternoon with his aunt and cousin but also made it home in time for me to go to the Pet Club event about raptors.10th - Had quite a stimulating discussion with my hair stylist about world events, politics and the reason he lowered his prices for short hair cuts for women (to charge the same for women as he does men who have short hair - cool!).11th - When the highlight of your day is going to the dentist you need to plan better.12th - We attended an uncle's funeral this afternoon and as our aunt said, \"it wasn't sad\" but rather uplifting.13th - I locked myself out of the house without my phone, but security was able to get in through an unlocked window (bonus is that now know are locks are not keyed to the master so need to be changed).14th - I seem to be getting too good at ordering things that don't fit and then having to return them by driving around as I did this morning.15th - Met Son and DIL for ice cream as they drove by on the way back from a visit to friends.16th - Cleaned the house - enough said.17th - A very fun evening at an outdoor concert right here in Leisure Village with jazz and blues performed by the ‚ÄúGroovin‚Äô Easy Big Band‚Äù with friends to chat with and homemade pineapple upside down cake served.18th - Hosted a volunteer board meeting.19th - Called my big brother with happy birthday wishes and met with a potential dog sitter for upcoming wedding weekend.20th - I finally went in my community's pool but kept getting water in my mouth when trying to take a breath - why is that?21st - A 3 activity day: visit to the modern Port Hueneme lighthouse on a gray day with a good explanation of how a Fresnel lens works and how the old lighthouse was moved across the port on a barge, lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant, and then a 90th birthday celebration for a beloved aunt.22nd - Latest round of returning online clothing and shoe orders - le sigh.23rd - Went to sign up for 2 week long private swim lessons starting 7/30 (as my attempt at lap swimming showed me I need a brush up on swim technique) and learned that everyone goes on a wait list until the instructor roster is final and then they call you if you get a space.24th - It was a tough assignment, but I stuck with it and researched in person the best bakeries in town with justifiable sampling along the way.Spiced chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream, whipped cream, cinnamon dust, and chocolate shavings. Photo from website as mine was eaten before thinking about pictures!25th - Lunch at a new to me restaurant with a new friend and I would go back again as it was tasty and pleasant.26th - I volunteered to be the Pet Club rep at the new resident welcome meeting so that was my evening.27th - We had planned to be driving to Berkeley today for a weekend visit with our son and his family but their house closing was delayed so we have 4 unplanned days to fill.28th - Saw the latest Mission Impossible movie with my sweetie and then we had dinner at the Thai Peru restaurant and, yes, the owners are Thais from Peru.29th - It was so satisfying to be able to provide an online friend with lots of recommendations and connections in the part of Atlanta where she is moving.30th - My first of 8 private swimming lessons was early this morning and I learned a lot to help me swim laps more effectively and I won the picnic basket raffle at my Trader Joes - look at all that and a basket too!31st - Its a wrap with another swim lesson and the dog's routine monthly shot at the vet.

Then I drove around trying to find all the bakeries on my list.I now have a list of a very expensive bakery that looks to be quite good or at least quite visually appealing in terms of cakes and pastries, a cupcake place I know is delicious, and a busy Mexican style bakery and lunch spot.Some samples may even have been purchased and eaten in the name of research - hot chocolate cupcake anyone? Delicious.Spiced chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream, whipped cream, cinnamon dust, and chocolate shavingsWhile driving around I also found a newly opened Tifa Chocolate and Gelato which is apparently their second location in the county, a Noah's Bagels, and a charming little bookstore called Mrs. Fig's Bookworm.I was unable to find one of the bakeries on my list so will do more research to see if it still exists. So many businesses here are in mini-malls and thus are hard to see from the street even if you have an address.Yesterday I stopped in at the town aquatic center to register for private swim lessons and found it is quite a lovely facility. Waiting to hear if I got a spot to work with an instructor to refine my lap swimming technique. If I do it is 4 half hour lessons a week for 2 weeks. Way to get back into swimming or truly decide it isn't for me.Tomorrow a new friend and I are going to try the women owned wine bar in one of the mini-malls as a lunch outing. It looks like they have good salads and sandwiches on their menu.I am now inspired to come up with more lists of things to research and try in my new hometown."},

Big steps in that direction the last couple of weeks.I took the dog over with me to thank the neighbors who helped me call security to get back in my house after I locked myself out. They have to very friendly, calm cats who I have taken care of so I mentioned that Lola loves and is gentle with cats. My friend instantly invited us in and went to get the friendliest cat and we held them about 6 inches apart to meet. They were both quiet and calm so now Lola really wants to go over there to see the kitty! Be association my friend is also now OK to her so she offered to take care of the dog when we are out of town and even sleep over. I'm going to use her as back up or when we are gone more than the 6 hours we can crate the dog.Then once I decided to leave the dog home for the wedding weekend, I contacted another neighbor who has an elderly dog that has Cushing's disease and was happy with a dog sitter they used for a long trip. We met yesterday with this dog sitter who moves into your house for the duration and Lola was interested in and calm with her so I booked her time. Yeah!I was initially embarrassed that my typed instructions was 2 pages long but she said it wasn't the longest she had been given.You may wonder what the big deal is but when you have a dog with Addison's additional stress means they burn through the medicine that keeps them alive at a faster than usual rate so minimizing stress is very helpful. Add to that the fact that she is very unsure of new people due to having been abused before we got her and the right people make all the difference. She only boarded with her foster family in Atlanta and loved them to pieces so was very excited to go to their house. Finding not one, but two, resources here is a great relief.My son and DIL-to-be have offered to take care of her too but they are across town and work so we would only do that for a weekend away probably. And of course that doesn't work for their wedding weekend.What we do for our pets!PS. If you are planning a major move as we did I'd like to add that our to do list was so long that eventually we ran out of steam and simply didn't get everything done.

Nope, none of them work - add changing locks to the to do list.He asks if any windows might be unlocked. Yup, perhaps one but you weren't able to get the screen off and there is a glass topped desk right under the window.Under 30 years old & physically fit security guy easily pops off the screen, opens the window, assesses how to avoid breaking the desk and then stops and sighs saying \"I'm not as young as I used to be!\" before pulling himself up and over the window. He easily steps over the desk onto the chair, unlocks the door and problem solved.We always had a hidden key in Atlanta but hadn't gotten around to it here now. Short term solution before changing locks!"},

{"title": "And June was ... better than I remembered offhand!", "date": "Thursday, July 5, 2018", "text": "The first thing that comes to mind when I think about what happened in June is that all of us here were sick including my FIL and dog!Of course I visited my granddaughter, son & DIL for a weekend (19 month olds are so fun!), read a lot and tried 4 new things plus saw a friend's new home.I had lunch with a new friend, did a thrift shop tour and lunch with 2 other new ones, started attending a book discussion group associated with the women's club I just joined, and went to an evening program on state legislation in the pipeline directly affecting women put on by the same club. The book discussion group is one where we each talk about what we have read since the last meeting but no assigned reading. We also had lunch at a friend's new house although they haven't moved in yet they wanted my FIL to see it and his health is keeping him from getting out and about at times now. He was able to go and enjoyed himself.In June I read A Murder of Magpies by Judith Flanders (a good beach read), Murder in July by Barbara Hambly which was a good historical recreation of 1830 Paris and later 1830's New Orleans but not so great plot wise. I loved Larie King's latest Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes book (Island of the Mad) and decided to reread the entire series in order.I also read Edison and the Rise of Innovation by Leonard DeGraaf which came from Bill Gates recommended reading list for summer and was interesting but not gripping! Quite different was Everything Happens for a Reason by Kate Bowler who talks about how \"prosperity gospel\" believers approach health and death issues as she deals with her own illness and rejects that approach. It took me back to my Mom's anger and distress over some of the things people said to her when she battled cancer 30 years ago.There were other books started and not finished, a couple of not worth mentioning cozy mysteries and lots stacked on the table waiting to be read.I'm back to joining in on Sentence a Day in July but this is my June summary instead.

{"title": "Clothing!", "date": "Monday, July 2, 2018", "text": "Well, we know its not optional in most situations and ever for many of us but I do wonder why so much advertising, media time and my own thought process gets devoted to it? And I know for sure its not just a woman thing although perhaps more of us think about it and our appearance then do men. There are men who do though and I truly think that wanting to be perceived positively on first glance is not a gender thing although the willingness to spend time on it may be primarily a one gender thing due to all of the societal and parental conditioning women face from toddler hood forward to look \"nice\". Not going to spend time searching for data to support this opinion so take it for what it is - my opinion right now.Now that I have free time again (no job, no children to raise, no large yard to maintain lol) I feel like I have reverted back to my teen years in terms of my thinking about clothing and wardrobe issues. This time I am trying to have more fun with it though and treat it somewhat as a problem to be solved crossed with a \"decorating\" color challenge while still being environmentally and financially conscious. Whew!I signed up for the Fashion Revolution \"Who Made My Clothes? course by FutureLearn¬†to remind myself about the issues with manufacturing, materials and consumption. Week 1 was interesting but not anything really new. I know myself well enough to realize that I'm not going to buy simply based on country of origin of materials and manufacturing, brand or other issues like those. I don't really buy that much and wear my clothing a long time so am not part of the fast fashion industry at least.I went on a thrift shop scouting adventure in Ventura with 2 new friends and have 2 new shops to go to along with the consignment shop here in town. I also just learned of another one in Oxnard which I will check out. The benefits of thrift shopping for me is that I am not contributing to the churn and full price/sales price cycle of stores, I can try styles and colors with little investment, and if the garment has been washed I'm fairly certain it won't shrink.I like the idea of upcycling and have taken on blouse I purchased from the consignment store and remade it into one I like wearing. I have discovered that I am not very interested in getting back into sewing what with the fitting and fabric issues but may take a sewing class at the Oxnard Adult School to learn more about working with knit fabrics so I can do alterations more easily.Having just seen the lovely cocktail dress a friend in Ohio got from Rent the Runway (I have decided to use that service for a dress for my son's wedding in September. Interestingly they have you pick 2 sizes in the same dress and a 3rd back up dress to order. I'll also have something as back up from my own closet just in case. No more buy an expensive dress for a single occasion hopefully.Project 333 still appeals to me in an expanded version that fits our long, similar weather situation as we really only have 2 seasons here with occasional forays into hotter or colder weather as we travel further inland or up to the Bay Area. I'm creating my June-October capsule by seeing what I wear rather than picking them out at the front end and then will try to decide about the items that are languishing unworn or rarely worn.And last but not least, I am still actively involved in¬†Imogen Lamport's¬†7 Steps to Style program through its active, international Facebook group which is full of lovely and supportive women. Groups have even met IRL in various parts of the globe including my having met some of the participants here in S. Cal. The value of her program for me started with knowing what colors now work to make me shine with my graying hair and softening skin but extend to fit, style, etc. It has turned into a fun hobby and I am much happy knowing I can pull together an outfit each day that is right for me and also spend my money on what suits me. The group give great inspiration and feedback too.Not a hobby I thought I'd get into at 68!"},

Even the dog was sick yesterday but $200 later to the vet and she is feeling better today. Must have been something she ate outside but she was dehydrated and our carpet is worse for wear lol.The best part of June was my trip to N. Cal to see granddaughter and her parents! Such a fun age. Then we got word that their offer on a great house in Berkeley was accepted so sometime in August we will drive up and help them settle into their new home.So tomorrow, the last day of June, we are taking my FIL and Hubby's great aunt to the house of a friend of theirs for lunch. I made brownies to take and that is all the planning going into this. We have been getting some things on the calendar for July.We are going to the HOA 4th of July luncheon and talking about exploring the lighthouse and some other things in Oxnard. I've got a book discussion group get together, massage & haircut booked. Also a birds of prey show as the monthly Pet Club meeting. We will get some more fun things and adventures penciled in hopefully.I'm determined to use the pool in July and make some seasonal meals using farmer's market goodies.

A 1 1/2 year old is such fun and so exhausting at the same time. I found I do remember the words to the Eensy Weensy Spider song and she likes my out of tune singing a lot.We are all healthy again and my FIL's diagnosis turned out to be a pre-cancerous esophageal lesion with little likelihood of spreading in time to cause him problems given his age (91) so no treatment required. He is anemic too so they are figuring out how to manage that but that is a minor issue and he will feel better once it is solved. Yeah!I am really appreciating the new vet we switched to. He actually took the time to read and analyze her records from 6 years with the same vet in Atlanta and then asked questions. The first vet we had here asked for the records and never looked at them.Wedding plans are almost finished for my older son and his long time sweetie. She wants me to go to the LA flower mart with her early one morning so we will schedule that soon and I'll sleep over the night before. I've always wanted to see it.I had a fun outing with 2 new friends going to thrift shops and out to eat in Ventura. I like both of these women a lot and have met another woman through the Women's Club I joined so slowly building my local tribe.

Hubby had the post inserted for a dental implant and developed a raging infection that required a trip to the ER and further dental surgery. After 5 days he is feeling well and finally pain free. We also learned that the closest ER is really good and are happy about that.I started using a topical drug for a potential basal cell carcinoma or at least a pre-cancerous lesion in a place that was treated by surgery 20+ years ago. As is often the case for me just one dose triggered all sorts of not great side effects.

My FIL was hospitalized on this past Friday and went home on Tuesday doing much better. This is why we moved close to him as my Hubby was able to spend a lot of time with him in ER and then the hospital without having horrible commutes to do so.2. We had a lovely Mother's Day weekend despite FIL being hospitalized on Friday. We spent the weekend with my older son and his fiancee and their dog staying over at our house on Saturday. A fun time playing ping-pong and bocce ball after walking the dogs and then a very enjoyable dinner out. Sunday everyone but me fixed brunch and while they were busy our dog cleaned out the other dog's breakfast bowl. She sauntered into the living room licking her chops with a very full belly and very happy! After breakfast we all went to visit FIL and then came back for more time together before they headed home to get ready for the work week. This kind of time together is what moving back to California was all about.3. I'm doing two wardrobe challenges right now to find more ways to use what I have. The first is 100 outfits in 100 days - all unique - and I've made it to Day 13 so far. The second is a 10 items plus 5 accessories for a week. So far these are my favorite new combinations. I seem to be in a flower¬† period.4. It seems to be pets have priority week. I am cat sitting for a neighbor and finally switched vets for our dog. I wasn't thrilled with the one we had lined up during our move and hear really good things about this one. Bonus is that the new vet office is within walking distance.5.

{"title": "Worst retirement financial decisions you have made?", "date": "Friday, May 11, 2018", "text": "This is a hard one for me as I don't think we have made many yet. However the best decision we made from a family care taking perspective will probably be a poor financial decision.The thing is we are going to end up moving twice while living independently. We moved to our current location because it is near my FIL's assisted living facility and today that is proving again that it is a good care taking decision ad Hubby was able to pop over to be with his Dad when he was taken to ER this morning. In fact he was just admitted with treatable problems.However when he is no longer alive the plan is to move near our granddaughter (oh and her parents!). Our local son and DIL want to move there too so we will all live in the same area and be able to help each other and enjoy being on site grandparents, uncle and aunt.That means we will be selling and buying a home again with all the associated costs as well as moving expenses. And in just the year we have been here, housing prices in the east bay area of California have skyrocketed.So that is our biggie! How about you?1. Indeed we did go to a restaurant called Pho N Mor over in Oxnard as part of our expanding our horizons effort. Turns out there is the same restaurant in Camarillo LOL. However we went to a \"food court\" that was lots of fun and in a converted warehouse so there were other restaurants too and the place was decorated with lots of interesting things to look at including the mural above.We had Banh Mi sandwiches that were excellent!2. The first Saturday of each month Studio Channel Islands has artist studio open house. We had a really good time talking to various artists, seeing their work and petting lots of dogs. I had been considering taking a glass art class and after talking to the artist I am going to do it!3. I think the list of books for the next 6 months of the library book club turned out good. Have you read any of them?Before We Were Yours by Lisa Wingate¬†Etched in Sand by Regina CalcaterraKillers of the Flower Moon by David Grann¬†Endurance: Shackleton‚Äôs Incredible Voyage by Alfred LansingThe Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane by Lisa See¬†Four Seasons in Rome by Anthony Doerr¬†4. Lots of cooking.¬†Ilooked for recipes to use up the buttermilk and cream I bought for making thechocolate cake last week. I ended up making banana bread and spinach quiche(which also used up a frozen pie shell left from Thanksgiving pumpkin pie making).I also made homemade enchilada sauce (for black bean and avocado enchiladas)which surprised me by having cocoa in it. All were yummy!5. I went to my second Women's Club lunch meeting and am really glad I joined. Such a nice group of friendly people!"},
{"title": "Best retirement financial decisions you have made?", "date": "Sunday, May 6, 2018", "text": "I have been taking stock of what we have done right and what I would have done differently during our first six months of both of us being retired. Let's talk about the financial front for now.As you know we sold and bought houses as part of moving across the country to be near family. We rather reluctantly decided to live where we are currently because it is near my FIL's assisted living facility. That has turned out to be a good decision not only because being near him is a good thing but also for the financial impact. For one thing, it has certainly reduced our travel costs as most of our travel in the past was to visit family. Unfortunately it has also made us less likely to do other travel as we have yet to find a way to leave our special needs dog while doing so.The main thing about moving in financial terms though was that we were able to buy a property that suits us at this stage for a little less than we received from selling our Atlanta house. Our monthly home related bills are lower too even with the HOA fee. As a bonus, after living here a year we do like it and are quite comfortable.Secondly we decided to try to live with one car instead of two. That decisions was prompted by the need to only drive two vehicles across the country - the rental U-Haul and one car. So we sold the oldest, highest mileage car and kept the newer, albeit smaller one. We figured we could always buy a new one if we truly needed it and thought we would probably get a hybrid do to the increased driving that we would be doing as we travel longer distances to spend time with family.The good news is we haven't yet needed that second car. So our gasoline bill has gone up as we drive more overall, but our car insurance, licensing and maintenance costs are lower. So far we haven't even used Lyft or Uber although those are options. We have each used the free to us city operated shuttle bus, taken the metro to the airport, or accepted rides from new friends (especially when DH is going to play pickle ball with those friends). So far so good on this front.We both went on Medicare after the move and had to decide what to use as supplemental medical insurance. So far we have managed to keep our insurance costs about the same (which was a priority) while improving our coverage in the sense that our co-pays are almost non-existent except for prescriptions and dental. I do know that this outcome is at the whim of the market, but so far so good.The biggest decision we have had to make so far has to do with when to take Social Security or to start withdrawals from retirement funds vs living on DH's pension and our cash savings. This is a work in progress. We decided to take DH's federal pension with survivor benefits which did lower the monthly amount but gave me peace of mind for my future financial security. Since I am older and have a slightly lower SS payment I started collecting at the same time I started paying for Medicare. Right now the plan is to hold off on DH collecting SS until he is 70 - again to maximize my future financial security (as well as his if he lives longer). We are hoping to wait until mandatory withdrawal age on our other retirement accounts but will start withdrawing sooner if we need to.So how do I know all of this is working out?The best decision of all is that I have tracked our income and expenses for years so I know exactly what we need to have to spend and what our cash flow will be. We continue to practice being frugal where we don't care how much we spend so we can spend on what we really want to and care about. Also we revisit our decisions about every 6 months to make sure we are on track .How about you? What have been your best retirement financial decisions so far? We'll talk about the worst ones later LOL."},
{"title": "Five for Friday: 5/4/18 - Cake!", "date": "Friday, May 4, 2018", "text": "So you know how you should read the recipe all the way through before you start but don't and end up running to Target first thing in the morning to buy an electric hand mixer that ends up not being the best ever?It started out being that kind of week but I plowed forward with this as my motto.1. The mixer was purchased because after Hubby said we would bring a small chocolate cake to his aunt's house Sunday evening as our contribution for dinner I mentioned that we hadn't yet found a decent bakery in town. I decided to make one using a recipe from The Smitten Kitchen Every Day cookbook, bought the ingredients and a square plate to put it on and only then read the instructions. Both the cake and frosting called for a mixer if possible (although of course cakes were made for centuries without electric appliances LOL) so I decided to replace the one that died right before our move. It worked but not loving the beaters for this purpose so need to see if there are others that can be purchased.In the process of making the cake I learned- that Trader Joe's carries small cartons of shelf stable cream,- you can freeze leftover whole cream (I had to acquire an ice cube tray first - did that on Monday thanks to CVS),- you can use a vegetable peeler to shave semisweet chocolate to put on top to make it fancy, and- I need to buy a metal square cake pan if I am going to continue to do this as it took too long to bake in my glass one!But here it is in all it's chocolate, butter and cream glory.In the end only 3 small pieces were eaten, half the remainder was left with aunt and uncle and we brought the rest home! Should of just bought 4 cupcakes somewhere LOL.We all had a lovely and loving time though which is what matters.2. Saturday I went to yoga despite having been up in the middle of the night for 2 hours with problems sleeping. I did meet a woman there who lives in my community and is one of the people who can certify you to use the gym and encouraged me to call her to do so! BTW, yoga did help but the afternoon nap on the couch helped more.3. I went to the dermatologist because of one concern and it was also way past time for a full skin check. Turns out she agreed with my concern and we are starting with freezing the spot on the side of my nose and will see if it heals back to normal skin. If not, then it is biopsy time. The challenge is that I had a growth that was growing into my nose removed surgically about 25 or 30 years ago. The main thing I remember is that it was precancerous and I had black stitches on my nose for a couple of weeks. This dr. says it was probably a basal cell growth. No other areas of concern although she did measure some moles for the record. Over the years I've had lots of things sliced, cut or frozen off my skin probably thanks to early life sunbathing with sun tan lotion and fair skin.4. I found a dime in a parking lot and yes I did pick it up.5. In my never ending quest for finding new favorite places to eat and go nearby, I learned that there is a trendy food court and craft venue in a refurbished warehouse not too far away. Field trip!"},

I would add natural disasters if you live in an earthquake prone area like I do, etc.- Discretionary spending (surprise! they list dining out in this category although I put it in our budget as I do vacations however a major trip I would consider discretionary as are large gifts)- Legacy (leaving $ to heirs or charities)Of course you might prioritize leaving a financial legacy over discretionary spending but you can't argue with basic living expenses and a contingency reserve as top priorities.If you read this let me know what you think please!I'm going to work through it and will post about it."},

{"title": "Five for Friday: Car recall, anniversary celebration and more", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2018", "text": "Another week of exciting (?) retirement. I'm not sure what would be exciting though. For me it was the times we traveled to new places and explored lots of sights and experiences, granddaughter time and major hard work learning complex things.Perhaps next week LOL.1. Anyone else have a car that was caught up in the Takata air bag recalls that took years to finally get them fixed? I was able to get the second one replaced at last and it is reassuring to know that if they deploy there won't be pieces of metal shooting into us.2. Sunday we celebrated our 37th anniversary. It actually was on Thursday of last week but we spent that evening taking Chinese food to my FIL and spending the time with him. We had tickets for a play at a local all volunteer theater that we wanted to try out. It is located in an old elementary school near the Camarillo Airport. The play,¬†Sylvia¬†A. R. Gurney, was a laugh out loud comedy and we really enjoyed ourselves. The dog, Sylvia, is played to great comedic and dramatic effect by a person.We were going to try out a new to us wine bar that serves some food, but found out it was closed. So we went to what we have heard is one of the best restaurants in town and had the best meal out we have had in a very long time. Really a great evening!Trying new things is one of our favorite things so we were happy so we talked about what we might like to do this coming year. Gold panning, visiting Santa Fe and taking a tour of S. Cal with a geologist were all on the brainstorming list.3. I was thinking I wouldn't replace my hair dryer that shorted out and slightly burned my hand but then I realized I need one to dry the dog after her baths! I bought a little travel one with a folding handle. And then I go my hair cut even shorter LOL. New hairdresser seems good though and had to go very short to fix the problems with the prior cut that I complained about.4. Planning ahead and invited local son and his fiancee to spend Mother's Day weekend at our home. We have come up with a bunch of ideas of what to do so once they confirm for sure we can move forward with reservations, tickets and so on.5. I went to a movie and out for coffee with some women from the Women's Club I just joined. I liked them a lot so progress in the socializing realm."},
{"title": "Five for Friday", "date": "Friday, April 13, 2018", "text": "I started out taking care of business and then moved on to other activities.1. On Friday I booked the recall air bag inflator¬†replacement work at car dealer, scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist, and finally got the results of my 3/28 ultrasound. Good news: no evidence of an abdominal aorta aneurysm. Moved on to giving myself a manicure, cleaning dog's ears, taking a walk and ordering 2 more dresses to try.2. Hubby spent the weekend helping our son paint in Berkeley in prep for selling their house. He also go to spend time with our granddaughter. I just got a photo, but it is a very cute one! And he had some good stories to share about her at 16 months.3. Poor dog had diarrhea again for 2 days. I am always afraid that it means her liver is having problems which can be a consequence of Addison's disease. More likely she ate some rabbit poop or something else while on a walk! Anyway, I had pills on hand that I gave her and also fed her rice and cottage cheese. She was still perky and has a good appetite so I simply waited it out rather than going to the vet, but it did keep me at home.4. I am still on the search for clothes for the 3 day wedding weekend in September and now for another of Hubby's aunt's 90th birthday party in July. I decided to go to Ventura to a different Macy's and tried on a bunch of dresses which was instructive as to what styles and colors might work. I also learned better how to get to that mall. I have 6 dresses ordered to try on from 4 different vendors. Whew! Hopefully some will be just right.5. Trying new things Introvert version:- I went to a book club at the library and it was an interesting discussion with little opportunity to get to know people. However, I did see one of the women later at the clubhouse in my community so maybe it will work over time.- Went to a lunch meeting at the local women's club chapter. Lovely, vibrant group and so social I needed to have time alone afterwards LOL. What a demonstration of how an introvert feels in a group of extroverts."},

{"title": "Five for Friday - Easter Edition", "date": "Friday, April 6, 2018", "text": "We spent Easter weekend at my son and his fiancee's home in Pasadena. The rest of the week was the usual mix of random and planned activities.1. Saturday midday we went to view their fall wedding venue. It will be outside and the space is perfect for a BBQ with a wedding ceremony in the middle. The ceremony will be in front of this.2. Saturday night they hosted a dinner party for which I made¬†The Prudent Homemaker's carrot cake with cream cheese frosting¬†.¬† Sunday morning they hosted a brunch and egg decorating get together for which I made a coffee cake that won't be made again! Still it was almost all gone as were half the banana nut muffins I took along in case it wasn't good. They always throw such a nice party with special touches such as these edible pansies in the mimosas.3. After stating that I never find any clothing at my local Goodwill, I popped in to look for some decor wanted for the wedding and found a perfect for me cardigan. So this is my favorite outfit of the week.4. After over 2 decades of knowing it existed, we stopped by the Somis Nut House which is a rather ramshackle building in a farming area. Turns out they survive by doing a big online business but we found a few things we wanted to buy and then headed to lunch at the Somis Cafe and Market. We used to eat there with my FIL and MIL back when they lived in Somis. Glad we went but its all not on our list to revisit.5. Thursday the termite specialist drilled holes in our living room floor to inject pesticide underground in an effort to kill the subterranean termite colony that has been munching on our home for who knows how long.AND one more -Felt an earthquake midday on Thursday for the first time since moving back to California. It was quite a ways off the coast so just a little short shake. Guess we truly are Californians once again. The dog didn't like it BTW."},
{"title": "Retirement adjustments: 6 months in", "date": "Thursday, April 5, 2018", "text": "We are about 6 months into both of us being retired, a year into having moved to a new location, and still adjusting. Even the dog is still adjusting as she can't seem to decide where her territory ends so still barks way too much at other dogs when we take walks. She is no longer freaked out by the whole thing though and seems to know how to get back to her own house from different directions. We've been working on that in case she ever got loose.The current situation? We both will readily admit to being bored. We both are trying new things. We are confirming that suburban living is not our first choice, but here we are for the unknown number of years left in my FIL's life. Could be a lot worse as it is a lovely place. Just a bit to quiet and with a small number of options in our favorite categories. People are very friendly and willing to make new friends - a big plus.There have been minor tweaks in the distribution of routine chores. Since I retired first I had taken on most household chores although we both pitched in on cooking and yard work. Hubby did most of the home repair projects too and we both were good at cleaning up after ourselves. By our choice of housing we no longer have yard work or most home maintenance chores to do so that has shortened the list considerably. We are pretty much back to our 50-50 split. Not that there is that much to do LOL.Retirement has made double checking our short and long term finances a bigger deal. Cash flow is working fine thank goodness. We are tweaking ownership of some investments to avoid probate and I need to get a credit card in my own name. The lack of that goes back 21 years to an error that was made on a credit card application that means I am an authorized user not joint card holder. Unfortunately we didn't know this until I had stopped working and had no income of my own. Now that I am collecting social security so have an income again it is time to fix this. Thank goodness that 21 years of great credit history went on my record too due to how the laws are now written.Does anyone know how you get them to consider assets as well as income?Since I handle most of the financial chores (bill paying, taxes, investments) we are also spending time making sure Hubby and our local son know how to access everything easily. Now that most things are online that is a concern we all should be aware of and have back up plans. We do make all decisions jointly, but I just happen to like budgeting, etc. more.Our social life has shifted substantially. Lots more family time which is a lovely outcome that we wanted very much. Friendships are much slower in coming as neither of us is an extrovert. We are trying though.There is a lot of sameness to the weather where we live, but when we venture inland or north we get more variation. Still, neither of us has needed to use our very warm winter coats. Summer hot weather clothing doesn't get a lot of use either.Living with one car means we need to get comfortable with Lyftt and Uber so we don't let the lack of a car hold us back. A new goal.That's all I can think of right now. Did I miss anything you are interested in hearing about?"},

We did go on some Road Scholar trips in Florida and enjoyed those.I like going to plays and exhibitions that are new.I do not tend to do a deep dive into a subject or develop a passion for a particular specific topic but in general enjoy the arts, science, the natural world and reading.I had found my way in retirement in our former location but our move shook up all those solutions - in a good way but still I need to find new ones. Hence joining in in stepping out of my comfort zone.I'm just starting to think about it so here are my observations and request for ideas.1. I want a new big long term audacious project. Deciding to move across the country and to have a home ready to move into once we got there was about an 18 month audacious project that kept me engaged and busy. I need another one so time to put on my thinking cap and ask for ideas too. Have you had any in your life recently or right now?2. Retirement has not provided as many ready made opportunities for learning as school or work did so my first learning is that I really need to work at making sure I have enough exciting learning opportunities in my life now. That will be part of my new big project going forward. Ideas?3. I have met lots of very nice¬† people since we moved here. I am not that good at turning acquaintances into close friends as I am rather introverted. There must be specific steps I could take to speed up the process. Ideas?4. When I volunteer or join a group it needs to be a situation where there is social interaction in smaller groups. I also gravitate towards having a leadership and/or planning role. So far I have only gotten involved in the Pet Club in my HOA community and became Treasurer. I'm looking into a nearby Women's Club and the local all volunteer theater. Other ideas?5. Our family is lovely, loving and at times challenging especially in large groups. Hubby tends to pick out one person to chat with extensively at large family gatherings while I wander about and end up feeling alone and wishing I wasn't there. Hmmm. Time for a change there.

{"title": "Five for Friday and some favorites of the week", "date": "Friday, March 30, 2018", "text": "Family, preventive health care screening, home maintenance, exercise, finances and food prep for Easter fun. This week had it all.1. Saturday evening we took a trek across the San Fernando Valley to attend Hubby's aunt's 90th birthday gathering. She had been looking forward to and talking about this milestone party for 2 years. It was a nice gathering and people came from far away to celebrate. Always lovely and encouraging to see the 20-something nieces, nephews and cousins doing so well.2. My father had an abdominal aorta aneurysm that was found while they were trying to diagnose a back problem so he was able to have it fixed. He fell into the high risk category for this - white, male, smoker early in life. However although I am not male and never smoked since he had one I fall into the high risk category too and could get a free ultrasound scan to check once I was on Medicare. I went on Wednesday and had it done because it is fixable and potentially deadly if you have it and don't fix it. Thanks to Medicare and our secondary insurance it was no cost to me. The tech said \"no need to worry but I didn't tell you anything\". Still will get the results from the Dr's office.3. I've vacuumed up all the dead termites I can find and the termite professional says we have to pull back the carpet along one wall in the living room. Then he will drill through the slab quite a ways into the soil and inject a pesticide to hopefully kill the subterranean termite colony. Price is just a little more than what we paid last Spring for a different treatment that worked in that it caused them to enter the house in a different location! We will probably have to get a carpet installer out to re-stretch the carpet, but we'll see how it looks once it is back in place. Home maintenance is endless isn't it?4. I'm 7 days into my 21 day walking challenge and haven't missed a day yet. My legs are feeling tired at night!5. Remember my complaining about shopping online? I took advantage of a one month free offer to get 10% off and a $10 return cost rebate for the dress I bought in 3 different sizes before I got one that fit right. I made sure to cancel the membership before the monthly fee kicked in.Bonus: I only took a year to get this one hung up. A hand painted memento of our time in Atlanta. I used a photo of a flower on our own magnolia tree as the model.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This week's favorites?Meals out: We tried to go out for pizza and beer at the local Institution Ale brewery but it was packed with an event in progress so we went to The Curry Leaf for Indian food. That led to a discussion of how many Camarillo restaurants we have found are ones we return to. Add in Bandit's Grill and Mama Hummus and there is the list LOL. We are still searching for favorite Mexican and Thai restaurants.Dinner at home: Pan fried tilapia with mixed veggies and rice.Outfits: Apparently it was blue and ivory week!"},
{"title": "Naming", "date": "Monday, March 26, 2018", "text": "I recently read a fun and interesting post over at Sizzling Toward Sixty¬†about why parents give a particular name to a child and go to thinking about the naming of people, objects, experiences and feelings in general.Take my own first name for example. It is Juhlin and I do know why I have that name. My maternal grandmother died when my Mom was about 5 after being in a TB sanitarium for several years. Her name was Sophie Juhlin Anderson Duncan, but she went by Juhlin which was her mother's maiden name and is Swedish. With me so far? So I was named Juhlin after her with the middle name of Mary after my Mom's beloved stepmother's middle name. The reasons are loving, but my name has caused confusion most of my life.I didn't even know that was my fist name until I entered junior high! I was called Juli which had little connection spelling wise but still had to be spelled as it wasn't Julie. Eventually I changed it to Juhli to make it easier to explain since I always had to spell it anyway! I used to receive mail addressed to Mr. back when people who didn't know you still tried to guess. It doesn't happen anymore of course as those titles aren't used by strangers.Interestingly last names weren't even consistent in Sweden until a 1901 law required people to pick a last name to be passed on to future generations. Before that they were a variation of your father's first name, a reference to where you lived or your occupation or perhaps a nickname. People could and did change their last name during their life. It sure make genealogical research a challenge.My first name isn't a common last name in Sweden though. However, as a side note, when I lived in Seattle there were several people in the phone book with the last name of Juhlin. In addition, my freshman year roommate's father was of Danish heritage and his first name was Julin which was a random coincidence. He had only met one other person with a similar first name and it had some 3rd spelling variation. I can't find any information about what Juhlin means but apparently it is most common as a last name in Sweden, Denmark and the US.Not surprisingly, I gave my sons simple one syllable first names! My granddaughter though has a first name that is usually a boy's name so the cycle continues.That 16 month old granddaughter is at the stage of language development where she wants to know the names of objects. I remember that stage with my own children. The frequent \"what's that?\" barely intelligible question in a tiny little voice accompanied by pointing or actually carrying the object over to ask about it. We have been told she is carrying things to her day care teachers and asking for the name. Vocabulary building in action. She understands a lot as a result but isn't saying much yet. Her most consistent naming so far is \"baba\" for bottle and \"daaaa\" for dog. She sure has dogs figured out and tries to pet ours through the phone when we Facetime with her. Absolutely much more interested when we show the dog's face than when we show our own LOL.But in general naming seems to really help us cognitively and socially. The tricky part comes when we feel we have accurately named our experience or feelings. Those words often tend to mean something different to other people and thus the ongoing challenge of communication."},

We also have both acknowledged that we are a bit bored and need to find more activities we enjoy. Add in some adventures and lots of family time and we should have a happy Spring.Spend Easter weekend with family: This event is why I was asking for help with coffee cake recipes. We are going to spend the weekend with our local son and his fiancee. Dogs included and thank goodness they are friends. Hopefully a field trip to see the fall wedding venue too.Throw a party to celebrate one year back in California: We moved in to this house on April 19th although we owned it starting March 22nd. We are thinking a snacks and drinks kind of event to which we will invite DHs pickle ball friends, my Pet Club friends, a few other people we have met or reconnected with, and family. That is a lot of people. Ideas for menus and how to stage this???Celebrate our anniversary: April 12th it will be 37 years. We will probably go out to eat.Three 21 day challenges: If you can do something for 21 days it comes close to being a habit that you miss if you stop. Not sure that applies to not drinking wine but I went 3 years without drinking back when I had heart problems so I know I could do that too if motivated. Challenge 1: Walking. Challenge 2: Stretching/flexibility. Challenge 3: Lose the sugar/snacks.Try out a book club: There are two book clubs at my local library. I've got the Tuesday morning one on my calendar for April. I'm also going to research a nearby women's club that has lots of interesting activities.Visit a tide pool: We keep talking about this and simply need to find out when is a good time to do it and if we can join a ranger walk one day. Leo Carrillo State Beach here we come.Go to a play: I bought the tickets so April 15th we will try out the local, all volunteer playhouse. It could provide me with a volunteering option so will be looking at that too.Go to Ghengis Khan exhibit at the Reagan Library: May of June will be the target for this.

We found out that the Reagan Library has a big Genghis Khan exhibit going on until mid-August so we will pick a time to go.¬† I went there once long ago when my younger son was in elementary school and had to write a report on a President. It was generally interesting as a lot of the exhibit was about the presidency and its history in general and then there is the chance to step into a decommissioned Air Force One.4. We finally bought 2 desk chairs. It is like the Mama and Papa bear chairs in that we each chose a different one that was really comfortable for us. Much better than our extra dining room chairs!5.

Our older son's fiancee stayed overnight to make it easier to get to an early business meeting near us and got to help us try out a recipe from one of my Christmas presents -¬†Smitten Kitchen Everyday. I made pork tenderloin agrodolce with butternut squash instead of acorn squash as that is what I had at home.¬† It was delicious! This website has the recipe if you don't want to get the book (recipe). I'm definitely going to make more recipes from this cookbook. In fact there is a banana cake roll that just might appear for Easter brunch.2. We took advantage of being retired and drove to Ventura to walk the boardwalk and have tacos for lunch on the pier. It was very windy with the water very choppy. Always different at the ocean.3. I had my annual blood test and got all 3 prescriptions refilled. Happily the quite expensive one was less than half of what I paid before we switched insurances.4. I walked 1.5 to 2.5 miles each day for the last 5 days. That is my baseline for exercise I think.5. I bought 2 tops and a pair of capris which I happened upon at Macy's and a dress that I had ordered a second time in a smaller size.I was shopping for a dress for my son's wedding picnic & BBQ in September but this may not be casual enough. Or it may simply be too hot to wear it.

I did make it to a yoga class as I have decided I have to stick with that no matter my desires or not.I also didn't make the phone calls or send texts to schedule a massage or gym orientation or get the name of a good PT for our files. Nor did I buy new exercise clothing.I didn't have any problem going out to lunch twice and meeting up for coffee once as well as dinner out with Hubby and some wine and beer drinking. Priorities you know.Well it is a new week and my more realistic exercise plan for this week is to exercise every other day.Sunday, Thursday & Saturday - stretch DVD, walk and/or hand weightsTuesday - yoga classBetter to plan for 4 days and hopefully exceed it than feel guilty about not exercising every day.On the other hand I did finally have my annual physical and Welcome to Medicare appointment. The doctor was nice but nice isn't enough. Once I extract my prescription renewals from this apparently understaffed and low on technology practice as well as the referral for an abdominal aorta aneurysm screening we are going to see if we can find a larger, more efficient medical practice. BTW, I am having the aneurysm screening because when you start Medicare you can have one for free if you are in a risk category which I am because my Dad had one and had surgery to repair it. Usually it is white males who smoked that are at risk and can get screened.I also think I need to find a better vet.After singing the praises of the local OLLI program we both decided we weren't excited enough about any of this coming sessions classes to sign up.

That is not something you typically find in children's books.The other interesting thing to me is that there is no requirement for signing up your child except that your community needs to be in the program and your child between 0 and 5.

{"title": "One year ago", "date": "Wednesday, February 28, 2018", "text": "Since yesterday was my FIL's 91st birthday, I know it was a year ago that we were hanging out in Camarillo, CA a year ago to be around while our now retirement home was being inspected.Earlier that week we had flown from Atlanta to S. California with several missions.- Buy one of the 5 homes that met our size and price requirements and were on the market in the location we had picked.- Help hold a 90th birthday party for my FIL and enjoy time with our family.- Do a bit of scouting in our soon to be home town such as finding a vet, the library, grocery stores, restaurants, movie theaters and generally beginning to learn our way around. Plus of course walking by the beach about 15 minutes away.- Drive to Berkeley to spend time with our then 3 1/2 month old granddaughter. Hubby then flew home to go back to work and take care of our dog while I stayed and provided day care for a while so they could wait until she was 4 months to send her to day care.During all of this we learned how to use our phones to sign legal documents, send money transfers and generally handle all the details of selling one house and buying another from a distance. It all felt a bit audacious as a plan but it worked out thankfully.I'm very glad we didn't have to buy a home that needed lots of remodeling or, the more likely scenario if that was the case, decide to rent for a year. That would have required another trip out and more location decisions and well as some different financial planning. I also think it would have been harder for us to build connections in our new location as most non-retirement neighborhoods empty out during week days as everyone heads to work or school.It is all working out a year later or (as we answer the question of how do¬† you like it here?) it is all good so far.I think I need a new huge, audacious project though!"},
{"title": "Creating new exercise routines because of life changes", "date": "Sunday, February 25, 2018", "text": "On a short hike we too early last summerWhen we lived in Atlanta I had a private Pilates session each week, walked on very hilly streets, went up and down the stairs in our house carrying laundry from the second floor bedroom to the basement, did lots of yard work, and used a stretch DVD occasionally.It wasn't perfect, but throw in the occasional massage and physical therapy and I was ok with it. The Pilates, stairs, yard work and hill walking seem to have made a big difference.Now I live in a single level home, do no yard work, walk on an almost level sidewalk and do the stretch DVD or go to a yoga class about once a week. That needs to change although I am quite happy doing no yard work!There have been other times when I have had to change up my exercise. I spent a year recovering from an illness. When I came home from the hospital I could barely walk through the main floor of our house and the stairs were out of the question. That time I focused on slowly increasing my walking. Another issue was three surgeries in 18 months that left me with problems lifting that still limit the amount I can lift to 20 pounds or less. And of course there were the injuries and joint problems that let to PT with my fabulous Atlanta physical therapist who worked closely with my Pilates instructor.So it is definitely time to tackle this again to retain my strength, flexibility and endurance not to mention take off some of the inches that have crept on these past 10 months.To start I went through all the classes and facilities available here in my community plus some in the surrounding town and online to come up with these options.Strength Training: We have a gym available plus several classes that include strength training along with aerobics and of course there are gyms and Pilates studios in my town and the hand weights I already own plus YouTube.Right now the gym and hand weights appeal to me although I will be checking out the Pilates studio too.Aerobic Fitness: Walking, gym treadmill and other equipment, outdoor swimming (S. Cal remember), water aerobics and a number of classes as well as YouTube.Right now I would pick walking and seeing if the gym has equipment to make up for the lack of hills although if I walk further they are certainly nearby.¬† When it warms up I promise I will get in the pool to swim laps and try out water aerobics as they seem to have fun.Flexibility: Morning stretching class, yoga classes, my favorite stretching DVD and YouTube.Sports as Exercise: For free in my community are golf, racquet sports, water volleyball and probably some others that I can't remember right now.I do love horseback riding but it is out of the question due to those 3 surgeries. Hiking would be ok though and water volleyball looks like fun. DH has become a Pickleball fanatic after wandering by when they were playing but that is not for me.Bodywork:¬†Massage, chiropractor, physical therapy if needed.¬† I have found an orthopedic massage specialist who is fabulous and met someone who says she has a great physical therapist.So how to start?I don't seem to keep up with large goals these days so I think I need to plan this out week by week and just put one foot in front of the other both literally and figuratively!This coming week:Today I did my stretch DVD and ordered a variety of walking shoes to try on.Monday - schedule massage and gym orientation, get name and contact of PT for future use, use hand weights and take a long walkTuesday - yoga class & shop for some exercise clothingWednesday - I have my annual physical scheduled and I can walk to that. Use hand weights.Thursday - stretch DVDFriday - walkSaturday - yoga classI'll let you know how I did.I would love to hear how you have put together and keep adjusting your exercise routine."},

Taking an art history class on American Art from colonization to the 20th century and another called Jazz Meet Country: A History of Western Swing.2. Attending a Great Decisions foreign policy discussion group through AAUW.3. Enjoying meals with friends old and new.4. Starting the process of getting our legal lives up to date with California wills and POAs. Learned more about the benefits of setting up a revocable trust and agreed with attorney that she will subtract what we paid for the above from the cost of the trust when we are ready. Left it to her to draft what we need so we can get them signed.5. Getting our taxes done for 2 states and the IRS by an accountant back in Georgia.6. Trying to find a schedule for exercise with yoga/stretching and walking the rest of the time for now.7. Taking a Raw Chocolate Making class with my older son's fiancee who is such fun and truly has been a daughter for so long (they have been together 20 years!). We also had lunch at a beach side cafe and talked about wedding decor ideas and dresses.8. Starting to get refunds from our health insurance for our Medicare payments which will eventually totally $1200.9. Cheering that the HOA finally took down the almost dead tree in front of our house! Looking good.10. Hubby started the 9 month long process of replacing a real tooth with an implant. Step 1: Tooth is gone.11. Focusing on what I actually want to do that makes me happy. I like practical problem solving so I remade a blouse that I bought from the consignment store. I liked the fabric, it fit in the shoulders and bust and the style was terrible for me. The problem solving required was fun and I like the way it turned out!BeforeRemade to suit me¬†12. I also like to make soup, stews, quick breads and main dish salads so I have been cooking more of those.13. I have decided to embrace my love of mindless cozy murder mysteries!14.

Glad that our calendar is starting to fill up!1. We took Hubby's 88 year old aunt and 91 year old uncle out for lunch. I always enjoy their company. It was lovely but a bit sad how grateful they were that we came to see them. We must do it frequently. They are not geographically close to their son and his family so we are trying to step it up now that we live here again.2. I had ordered 8 warm weather tops to get free shipping with the hopes that 1 or 2 would be keepers. I was right and feel I look good in this one although it obviously wasn't so warm when I took this picture. I confirmed that it was a keeper with my Facebook style group - an international group of women who are so helpful and kind. I've met a few in person and they were so nice.¬†3. We went to see \"The Post\" on Sunday afternoon and it was very engrossing despite already knowing the ending. I see why the actors didn't win at the Golden Globes though as it was more of an ensemble performance movie despite having 2 top stars in the leading roles. Then we went to our local brewery for beer and pizza and the last quarter of the Saints-Vikings playoff game. What an exciting ending!4. Hubby saw that there were going to be 6 to 8 foot waves so we headed to the beach to watch the surfers. He no longer surfs but the pull is strong! A walk along the boardwalk followed by gourmet tacos on the Ventura pier. Retirement life in S. Cal is so hard lol.5. Had lunch with a friend from way back in my working life who I haven't seen in years and we scheduled lunch with some other old friends from grad school."},

I don't believe I had read it before but certainly haven't read any of his books since I was a teen or young adult.I had forgotten how \"choppy\" or unfinished his writing style seems and how dark his stories can be. However it is engaging and a fast read.I had picked it in light of our ongoing challenging relationship with Cuba and the brief potential thaw including how resuming a ferry between Key West and Havana seemed a possibility before the election of the current President.I'm going to read Pollyana next for my children's classic choice.For February I'm jumping to \"a memoir, biography, or book of creative nonfiction\" and reading Personal Memoirs by Ulysses S. Grant. For the children's lit part I think I'll read Prairie Fires: the American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder by Caroline Fraser.What is on your reading list?"},
{"title": "Banking Wednesday: Retirement Finances", "date": "Wednesday, January 17, 2018", "text": "I have decided to deal with most financial items on one day of the week and Wednesday it is. So here are my Retirement Financials for the week.1. The local newspaper raised their rate $9 a month without notice to just over $35/mo for a skinny little throwaway with lots of ads. We decided to cancel.2. We made a decision regarding how and how much to contribute to our granddaughter's 529 fund and mailed the first check. Hope I'm still around when she starts college or whatever she decides to do after high school. 17 years to go LOL.3. I thought we had to pay our excess liability insurance annual bill this month, but I looked it up and our move changed the renewal date to May. So I decided to look up all the rest of our insurance new renewal dates too so I can be sure we get and pay the bills online. In addition to auto insurance and excess liability we have standard homeowner's and earthquake insurance policies. We stopped our life insurance as we started collecting retirement benefits as we no longer need to replace income but instead made sure all of our beneficiary documents were up to date on pension and retirement accounts.4. I started figuring out what documents I have or need to send to the tax accountant. Most won't be available until the end of January, but at least I have found what I do have and made a list of the others.5. We both registered on line for our health insurance Medicare premium refund program ($600 each) and mailed in the documentation required. I also completed the online health questionnaire and got $50 on a debit card to use for prescriptions.6. The personal loan repayment check we received reached our credit union in Georgia and apparently cleared - yeah!7. An online item I returned was received and processed for a refund."},

Porter's Pollyana to meet the \"read a classic you haven't\" category. Reading different types of books is it's own kind of adventure isn't it?2. I can see quite a few stars in the dark sky here. On Sunday morning in the just lightening sky there was also a jet trail which was quite beautiful against the darkness.3. Started a very short home comfort increasing list. So far it has a candle holder for a pillar candle which is languishing in a cupboard and a dining chair seat cushion of some sort so my FIL will be comfortable at our table.4. With the first rain storm since we moved here 9 months ago hitting on Monday afternoon, it was pleasant to sit in the house and hear it hitting the roof. As it turned out the storm had a horrible outcome nearby with mudslides (caused by the recent huge fire denuding the hills) killing at least 13 people.5. I finally made a tomato poached pork over raisin kasha recipe for dinner that Hubby declared was the best meal we have had in a long time. He also asked that I remember to make it for guests. Oddly, it was the first time I had cooked a pork tenderloin.And 5 retirement financial items -¬†1. Emailed the reasonably priced tax accountant back in Georgia who did our last set of complicated returns (2014) and in the process found that I had made an error for several years that saved the whole cost of doing the work. She can do our 2017 complicated returns - yeah! Now to collect all the documentation needed.2. Completed all of my year end summary financial spreadsheets and updated our important record document. I keep these in Dropbox so our sons can access them too if need be.3. We lent a significant sum of money to a relative last year and just received repayment! They had promised but as anyone who lends money to family knows you have to lend it with the idea that it may become a gift.4. I am systematically assessing what additions to my wardrobe will actually make it more functional and be worn given my current lifestyle and location. Ordered a bunch of knit tops from Kohls. No shipping cost and I can return them to the nearby store if they don't work out. I expect to only keep a couple. Bought some underwear from the nearby Jockey outlet after determining that they sell overruns not lower quality items.5. Got a filling repaired in a tooth that had a root canal previously and even with insurance discount $237 later it is good to go. Bad tooth!!!"},

I posted about our Rose Parade adventure. It was the second time I have gone but the first time with our granddaughter. She really watched the horses and bands.2. We went to visit my FIL and Hubby's great-aunt with our son, DIL and granddaughter. I like this interaction between the triple great aunt and triple great niece. That is great-Grandpa's room key which is making such a good toy and was given back and forth many times. Six adults spent the whole time watching one baby although some discussion of football and bitcoins may have occurred LOL.And the 4 generation photo along with a separate ones of happy grandparents with her.3. Every time I felt uncomfortable in some item of clothing this week I tried to solve it. One shirt is in the recycling pile and two items had tags cut out. Small steps but improved comfort.4. We are still having glorious sunsets as there are still smoke particles in the sky and increased moisture. I grew up in the central Illinois and summer sunsets were usually sensational and I do get great pleasure out of a nice one.5. I started my Dry January on the 3rd mostly in an attempt to lose weight but also in hopes of sleeping better.And 5 Retirement Finances:1. We had our semi-annual dentist visits and bought their dental insurance plan which should save us money. By switching our medical plan, both being on Medicare and buying this I think our insurance costs will be about $150 less than last year and we will have fewer medical bills to pay as well.2. However, we found out we both need dental work and Hubby's will be expensive. Then I picked up a prescription and found the cost went up 33% with the new year. Sigh. 3. We were given a dozen delicious tangerines as our son and DIL were given more than they could eat before they spoiled.4. I have decided we will need an accountant to do our taxes this year and have started collecting all the documents and recommendations for a good person.5. I stopped by Goodwill to drop off some items and found 2 stainless steel dog bowls and a tray to hold the soap and sponge by the kitchen sink - all for $5.36. Can take those off my list now."},

Be sure to check out the links at the bottom to see what others have been up to.This is the last time I am participating in this link up. Instead I'm going to continue to do my 5 for Friday weekly wrap-ups.1. I was honored that my DIL asked me for some advice and that we had a great chat on the topic.2. Oh man, after 2 hours of driving and 4 hours of packing china/serving pieces for my husband's aunt and cousin I just have to say that if you are moving to a smaller place get rid of the excess before you ask for help packing!3. Same as December 2nd except the dog didn't pee in her crate this time but was able to wait until we got home.4. Sold Pet Club dinner tickets for 2 hours, did laundry, Pet Club board meeting for 2 hours, put on sweats and grabbed a glass of wine, then waited for Hubby to fix dinner.5. A wildfire raged out of control overnight due to Santa Ana winds and is now threatening the city of Ventura, but not us as so far we are only getting smokey air and the winds are in favor of us being safe from the fire.6. A haircut that has potential but is too short, trips to the library and bank, and trying to ignore the sky full of smoke plumes as everything I could find says the wildfire is headed away from us.This morning's fire map with where I live (Camarillo) at the bottom between the 4 and N7. Made banana flax pecan muffins, washed the dog and a load of towels and blankets, took a walk, worried about a new and visibly closer smoke plume and cloud (until research explained where it was coming from), updated the Pet Club financial records, and made a healthy dinner.8. While Hubby was off helping move his aunt there was no car here and with the air quality bad from the fires and winds there was no significant walking, so I vacuumed, dusted, cleaned the kitchen, made barley mushroom carrot soup and took the dog out as needed. 9. Another month wait for our new shutters because the measurements were done wrong by them and they have to make new ones which is such a waste and frustrating - le sigh.10. Seeing this joyous image of my granddaughter in my Facebook feed was such a great way to start the day!11. We went to the Pet Club holiday dinner where the group gave $2000 to the Moorpark College Training Zoo which was a pretty great donation which will be matched in January with one to the Camarillo animal shelter.12. Speaking of pets, our little dog had to have her 3 year rabies shot today with reaction preventing doses of prednisone and benadryl but the day went smoothly for her afterwords.13. We went to the racquet club annual wine and cheese evening event and had a nice chat with some new acquaintances.14. After a night of very little sleep due to a sick dog, we took her to the vet and then ironically had a Pet Club officer meeting at my house.15. The dog seems to have recovered and I am not as exhausted so we were able to attend the Ventura British Brass holiday concert which was just lovely. (BTW, British Brass use different instruments all of which have a conical bore so there are coronets instead of trumpets, etc. No reed instruments. A little learning along with a concert.)16. Did a morning stretching routine and took a walk.17. Pushed myself to be at Target by 8am and - the lot was nearly empty but that meant I could browse before picking up the present I had ordered for Hubby.18. An ordinary type of day.19. Went to yoga class and took a walk.20. Another vet visit but just her routine monthly shot this time thank goodness.21. While dog was getting groomed (we call it Poodle Spa Day), I shopped for food for our contribution to Christmas brunch.22. The Thomas fire is now the largest in recorded California history and I randomly walked outside just when the Space X launch from Vanderberg produced the most sci-fi UFO scene in the sky.23. A routine day!24. Packed up and headed to Pasadena to our son's to celebrate with them.25. A lovely day with loved ones.26 - 28. Chilling!29. Housework, laundry, menu planning and generally getting ready for company.30. Hubby left early to go play pickle ball which is his new passion for exercise and socializing.31.

My 2018 ABCs: Adventure, Beauty and ComfortAdventure means to venture further afield in my local area, to try new things, make new friends, and to have at least one travel adventure. I wold love to wake each morning feeling like the day was going to be an adventure.Beauty reminds me that I really enjoy visual and sound beauty. I need more time viewing art, going to the theatre, live music performances and being in nature. I also want my clothing and home to be beautiful to me and try to be a beautiful person to others in all meanings of the word.Comfort is both comforting and comfortable. What is comforting is deep and loving companionship, being comfortable in body and mind, good food, etc. Comfortable is to remind myself not to put up with uncomfortable things (shoes that don't feel good, poor lighting, etc.). It also means I need to feel comfortable as I try new things and spend time with new people.Now to work on how this will all translate into a year of life!Do you have a theme or word to set your intention for the coming year?"},

I'm sure you are hearing about all of the horrible wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Ours is the Ventura one (Thomas fire) but it is not endangering our community.My heart goes out to everyone with losses and to the animals suffering now and later as their habitat is destroyed. My heartfelt thanks to all the firefighters and volunteers helping the evacuated humans and animals. May the winds end soon so the fires can be put out.1. We have seen flames at the top of a mountain ridge one night while driving home from dinner out (3rd Thai restaurant was a winner!). We also have smelled smoke and greeted people who are sheltering with neighbors while evacuated from their homes in the fire area.2. Yesterday was the first day I was really concerned for our home and health but fortunately it turned out to not be a problem. I was finally taking a walk as the winds had died down so the air quality was better and I really needed some exercise. A bit into my walk I saw a smoke plume rising nearer to us than before. By the time I got home from my short one mile walk there was a huge black smoke cloud.We finally learned where this flare up was and were able to pull back on our personal concern. I did sleep with the cell phone by bed though so if an alert came through I would hear it. Instead email updating woke me up at 3:30am LOL.3. My emergency preparedness now that we are back in California had been focusing on earthquake readiness. Now we are talking about potential fire evacuation routes and what we would try to take if we had to leave very quickly vs having time to pack.We are so fortunate that we have places to stay with family if we even need a break from smokey air or just from concern. Not everyone is being as fortunate as these fires have devastated over 100,000 acres so far and displaced hundreds of thousands of¬† people.4. 2018 will be our first year on Federal retiree benefits and Medicare. We took the time to research our Federal health insurance options as it will be secondary to Medicare. We changed to a different health plan with lower costs but our same doctors. Since the combined insurance and Medicare will eliminate copays and annual deductibles, it looks like we will be able to keep total health care costs about the same for another year even with adding dental insurance. That is a huge accomplishment I think. Even better? Hubby took care of the registration/insurance change while I was out.5. On a more cheerful note, I sold tickets for the Pet Club holiday dinner and bought tickets for a holiday brass band concert.How was your week?"},

What's not to love?", "date": "Wednesday, December 6, 2017", "text": "Once again joining in with a lovely group of bloggers to journal my days a month at a time. Check out their posts below. Are you ready for December?One year old already!1. With my commitment to trying to continue to live as a one car family and to trying new things, I took the free city bus to the library which was a bit time consuming but fine.2. Another exploration of our new area that included going to the Channel Islands Maritime Museum by the Oxnard marina.3. Clothes shopping is so time consuming what with all the driving or online searching followed by trying on and finding little to suit you as well as fill wardrobe holes.4. Looks like I will get my wish of hosting a small family Thanksgiving for 7 or 8 people rather than the massive one for 25 - 30 that was initially envisioned by my Hubby.5. We walked to the rec center to check out the holiday craft sale and bought nothing, I went to the library and as usual drank too much coffee and ate too many sweets.6. Received all the documentation needed to act as Pet Club treasurer and will have to plow through it to bring records up to date. 7. Yoga class for 1 1/2 hours left me pretty tired but I did the laundry and read before falling asleep quite early.8. I'm really liking how my Social Security payment shows up in my bank account each month without my having to go to work to earn it LOL.9. The shutters we ordered back on Sept. 11th that were supposed to be here in 60 days or less are now scheduled to arrive on 11/30 but that is often the way of home repairs.10. Checked out the TJMaxx in an adjacent town and will go back to shop there.11. Beautiful day for a walk so took one to CVS to buy cards for birthdays and engagement celebrations.12. An overcast day perfect for house cleaning which was rewarded by us picking up Chinese food to take to my FIL at his assisted living facility.13. This month's muffin making session produced zucchini walnut muffins as part of my effort to use up the too many veggies in the frig before we go out of town.14. I am finding clothes shopping difficult as I ordered ankle boots, 2 sweaters, 2 long sleeve tops (both in 2 sizes), and a cardigan but ended up only keeping one long sleeve top that aren't quite the right colors and returned the others today. 15. Laundry, car washed, suitcases packed and more so we are ready to head north early in the morning to see that granddaughter!16. We had good weather most of the way on our drive to Berkeley from Camarillo and were welcomed with big smiles by our baby granddaughter and her parents too before settling in for dinner and overnight there.17. We pitched in and did a lot of house and yard work to help prepare for the big first birthday party tomorrow, the baby's parents went to work at the symphony including the evening's concert, we went on baby duty including picking her up at day care and then our other son and his sweetie came over to fix us all dinner and help babysit until her other grandma showed up to take over.18. After a night at an apartment in a Victorian house AirB&B we went back to help finish up setting up the birthday part which was lots of fun and followed by dinner out on us to celebrate the older son and his sweetie's engagement.Nana loves her granddaughterHappy Papa & granddaughter19. This morning was a 65th birthday celebration brunch for Hubby complete with donuts instead of cake and then we all did some clean up and played with the baby before crashing again at her house.65th birthday donut cake with all his favorites20. After seeing our granddaughter on her actual first birthday we had another day of driving back to Camarillo so we can start preparing for a family Thanksgiving here.21. Hubby's actual birthday!22. Made the cranberry sauce and took the dog to the vet for routine care on a very hot day.23. Spent the morning and part of the afternoon preparing for Thanksgiving dinner which was a lovely time with 8 of us seated at one table.¬† Starting off Thanksgiving with snacks.24. I crashed and took a 2 1/2 hour afternoon nap.25. With Christmas wish lists on Amazon and free shipping so much that shopping for the Berkeley family presents was finished in less than an hour.26. I did laundry, returned some online order items, bought a pretty top, as the new Treasurer I spent some time trying to figure out the balance sheet entries for Pet Club, and then we went out for Indian food as an antidote to too much turkey.27. Spent the morning working a table to sell tickets to the Pet Club holiday dinner and then part of the afternoon trying to reconcile the books and get on the signature card at the bank.28. Shopping for baby girl clothes is so much fun and they are sooooo cute! 29. We spent the afternoon helping Hubby's cousin and aunt pack up their kitchen in prep for a move and then took ourselves out for¬† pizza and beer at our local brewery.30. Ending the month with a dose of self care by having a massage.    An InLinkz Link-up"},

We have volunteered to help my husband's 89 year old aunt and her daughter pack for their upcoming move. At least we have expertise in this LOL.2. My DIL has asked me to help her with a work related project and I'm feeling pretty honored.3. I went shopping for clothes for my 1 year old granddaughter and wanted to buy everything because it was all so cute! I limited myself to 4 outfits and 2 pairs of pajamas in the size she is transitioning into. It was fun.4. I treated myself to a one hour massage to try to get my body back in alignment after travel, Thanksgiving and packing. Went ahead an booked another 2 weeks out because of more packing ahead.5. I am so thankful that this move has worked out as we had hoped.What about your week?"},
{"title": "Where do you like to stay current?", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2017", "text": "Yesterday I bought a new sweater. No big deal. People do this all the time.However, as I was shopping I noticed I passed by the classic styles and colors in search of something that had a touch of being on trend without being trendy. For me that meant a current color plus a bit of an oversized look which in fact may not be best for my body shape but helps make me feel current.So fashion is one area to consider but where else do you try to stay current?I do follow the news enough to know the main stories. However, both my sons deliberately ignore it.I keep track of our financial situation monthly.I'm not an early adopter but I keep our software and passwords up to date and like to know where technology is headed.I like to know the weather predictions.I use Facebook, texts, email and phone calls to stay current with friends and family.To a lesser extent I keep current on medical advances and nutritional guidelines.That is all I can think of right now but I am curious where you spend time staying current?"},

It is so great being near to our nuclear family. First birthday, engagement and 65th birthday celebrations plus Thanksgiving during these 2 weeks.2. Having a guest room means our sons and their families stay over when they visit which is the best.3. Our recent time in Berkeley proved that the dog's eye problems are an allergic reaction to something in our new location of Camarillo just as the vet said. No problems while in Berkeley but immediately upon returning home they started again. I will have to routinely put medication in her eyes I guess.4. I am ready to get back into more exercising and less eating starting with yoga tomorrow.5. Buying a cooked turkey and ready made gravy was so worth it and will be repeated next year!We are going to have a leisurely breakfast and then enjoy the day without going out shopping. I have to admit I might load up some Christmas presents online though!Hope you enjoy your day too."},
{"title": "Feeling full of memories and making new ones", "date": "Thursday, November 23, 2017", "text": "I think Thanksgiving can easily be one the more emotional holidays. All that family togetherness - or not. Today though I am thinking of my childhood Thanksgivings in the finished basement of my grandparents' house in Champaign, IL where I grew up.They had a quite large dining room table down there in the main room and it was always full as my Grandma came from a large family. My Mom was always so happy to be with everyone. This was her step-family but she didn't remember her mother who died when she was quite little so this was Mom's family and she loved her \"Mom\" fiercely.I was Grandpa's girl and loved to hang out with him while he carved the turkey which was placed on a cutting board on top of the washing machine in a back room LOL. Good memories.Then there are the Thanksgivings when I was alone or with friends. Others when it was just Hubby and I or our kids came to our house. Trips to New Hampshire to have Thanksgiving with my parents, brother, SIL and nephews also are part of my good memories. I have other good memories of Thanksgiving's at my in-laws house. They enfolded my older son and I into their family with great love and Thanksgiving at their house was quite an occasion.Today my 90 year old FIL will be at our house for Thanksgiving and I am thankful that we are living close again and can do that for him. We also will host my older son and his sweetie (who are coming early to help with the cooking and prep!), my BIL, my husband's great-aunt and distant cousin. 8 is enough as we can still squeeze in around our dining table. No giant table in the basement for us.We will try to make lovely new memories today and hold those we love close.Happy Thanksgiving to you and your loved ones whether or not you are able to be with them on this day."},
{"title": "Thanksgiving is almost here!", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2017", "text": "I'm really glad that most of our prep this year was in the planning. So far we have bought drinks, an apple pie, ice cream and appetizer makings. I've made the cranberry sauce and we picked up the fully cooked turkey and accompanying gravy. My son and his sweetie are bringing 2 side dishes and extra chairs. A cousin is bringing another side dish. It is amazing how everyone wants their carbs though when I would really like a giant salad as a side dish! Portion control it will be.I still need to make the pumpkin pie, prepare the appetizers, put the turkey in to reheat, set the table, roast the potatoes and put on my comfy dinner outfit.Are you preparing Thanksgiving and, if so, for how many? We are going to be 8 which feels manageable with the help a few people are giving.We have had many Thanksgivings far from loved ones. Sometimes we shared them with friends and other times it was just the 2 of us so this will be lovely.However you are spending tomorrow I wish you a lovely day."},

We have to come home on Monday (darn) as we are hosting Thanksgiving on Thursday and there are things to be done!2 nights at my son's house and 2 nights sharing an AirB&B with the older son and family. The dog is going to be moving back and forth too.Friday is the help get ready for the first birthday party on Saturday and help babysit our sweet granddaughter while her Mom and Dad work the symphony concert that evening. Saturday is her birthday party and in the evening we will celebrate the older son's engagement. Sunday morning is my Hubby's 65th birthday celebration. Yeah for milestones in triplicate.I'm trying to make sure that preparing for Thanksgiving when we get back will be easy enough that I can look forward to the day and time with family rather than feeling stressed about preparing the meal and house. We have splurged by ordering a cooked turkey and gravy from Whole Foods and Hubby has volunteered to go pick it up Tuesday afternoon.The local son and sweetie are bringing 2 vegetable dishes and planning to come out early in the day to help get ready. They will stay overnight too so there will be clean up help. My BIL is supposed to pick up and bring my FIL and his aunt.I went grocery shopping today and bought everything that isn't perishable so I can make a quick trip to Trader Joe's on Tuesday morning for the last few things. I also bought appetizers that just need heating.I've done some cleaning too so little will be done when we get back. The cooking for me amounts to making a pumpkin pie, brownies and cranberry sauce, roasting new potatoes, and reheating things. I think it will be nice and not too stressful! Hope you have something lovely or joyous that you are looking forward to also."},
{"title": "5 for Friday", "date": "Friday, November 10, 2017", "text": "Let's see if this topic can keep going!1. Hubby used to play tennis and actually had a college tennis scholarship before he decided to focus on academics. He was walking by the pickle ball court near our rec center and became intrigued. He stopped to rally with a player, was warmly welcomed by others and may have found his go to activity. We drove over to Oxnard this morning and he bought a pickle ball racquet while I checked out the TJMaxx in the same mall. I'd go back to that one.2. I am liking my new yoga studio and the attentive and corrective instruction in the group sessions but really feeling the workout 2 days later. Is this normal? I asked the teacher and she said absolutely normal. Hope it gets easier with time.3. I have been spending time trying to make sure we have the appropriate beneficiaries on all our accounts and/or that they are all joint accounts so then they wouldn't have to go into probate. Can't figure out how to do it for one online account so called customer service and they can't figure it out either! Waiting for a call back from the tech dept. Hoping we are right to not set up a revocable trust while both of us are living. It is very costly, but really streamlines the inheritance process so we are thinking we will wait until there is only one of us left.4. Living close to extended family = lots of love with a small dash of aggravation (by just a very few people only thank goodness).5. Lovely chat with my Berkeley based DIL today as we figure out how to add in a celebration of the other son's engagement to our upcoming weekend of birthday celebrations."},

They have always been so terrific as a couple and so supporting of each other.A lovely group of bloggers is noting their days by writing a sentence a day. Check out what they are up too through the links below. I'm joining in for October with my sentences for most days:10/1 - We drove to Santa Paula and had a fun time looking at restored small, old planes at the Aviation Museum open house and then had lunch at the airport cafe.10/2 - The patio redo continues with the removal of the bougainvillea stumps by Hubby. 10/3 - A lovely Fall day so I took several walks around my neighborhood, baked banana nut muffins and made beef stew.10/6 - Interesting art history class this morning while Hubby stayed home with the handyman service and 3 more things on our home repair and improvement checklist were completed!10/7 - Went to a 1 1/2 hour Fundamentals of Yoga class with a knowledgeable teacher and may be going back as a paying student.10/8 - Wow, it is incredibly windy with a tree a few houses up coming down - lots of pine needles are also coming down so there will be no problem gathering enough to mulch the patio beds.10/9 - Yeah for well behaved grand-dog and dog!10/11 - It took what felt like forever for Hubby to make up his mind on 3 flower pots for the patio¬† but he is happy with the outcome.10/12 - Well what do you know, the new recirculating water pump is not creating \"instant\" hot water because it was installed backwards!10/13 - Lunch on the pier and a walk on the boardwalk in Ventura followed by getting 2 more plants for our new patio pots.10/14 - Plants transplanted to pots and grand-dog getting some cuddles from Hubby on the definitely more spacious feeling patio.10/15 - Two more pictures hung so we are nearing the end of that task with just a couple to go!My painting in the small denMy Mom's painting by my desk10/16 - Handyman rescheduled, bought a new watch, grocery run, washed my dog, read, and went out to dinner which made for a full if rather boring day.10/18 - I agreed to be Treasurer for the community Pet Club (which has monthly programs and raises money for rescue and wild animal rehab, etc.) and we took dinner to my FIL's assisted living facility again as he really enjoys this along with a visit.10/19 - Six months ago we arrived at our current home with a rental truck full of belongings and an air bed to sleep on and now we have made it a home.10/20 - A nice celebration for everyone who volunteered for the Pet Club auction and rather amazing that over $4,000 was raised to split between the local animal shelter and a college wild animal program.10/22 - Attended a small family gathering for the 1 year memorial and gravestone unveiling for my husband's uncle followed by lunch and catching up.10/23 - Almost record breaking heat of 106F with winds which felt rather like a convection oven must.10/24 - Excellent customer service from Spectrum regarding our internet outages which resulted in the replacement of corroded connectors and upgrades of cable splitters.10/25 - What a difference a good night's sleep makes!10/26 - Going to a talk about strokes and spine surgery sounds dreadful but the spine surgery segment was really fascinating.10/27 - Final session of post-Impressionists art history class and a bit of golf on a beautiful S. Cal fall day.10/29 - Took my son & DIL's dog home to Pasadena and they took us out for a fun lunch and then showed us pictures of their Amsterdam, Crete & Santorini 20th anniversary trip.10/30 - Pumpkin raisin muffins made so Hubby is happy!10/31 - With a great yoga studio just around the corner how could I not buy a monthly pass and start classes by attending a 1 1/2 hour Yoga 1 session.

{"title": "Retirement can be somewhat like Kindergarten", "date": "Tuesday, October 31, 2017", "text": "Why is that you may ask.If you move, you have to make new friends while learning new things. So it might be more like switching schools to one where you don't know anyone.Speaking of learning new things, unless you stick with spending your time on the same things you did before retirement then you have to go through the agony and excitement of being a beginner once again. For me one of those things is taking yoga instead of Pilates. It is hard to feel awkward.Staying home alone is not an option - or at least not a healthy one.The size of your allowance may well change. Thinking about cash flow at each stage of retirement is vital for most of us.You will find that there are many joys in your new adventure!"},

{"title": "6 months after our move", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2017", "text": "What has transpired?I am taking a look back to see what we have done, what is working well and what is still ahead after our cross country move, Hubby's retirement and general life changes.It has been quite a journey since we started painting walls in our former house about 15 months ago. Or as we are saying, so far so good!Moving from Georgia to California including selling and buying homes:The move itself went well and we feel comfortable in our new home and location. Even the dog has adjusted to the changes in routine and people.We got unpacked rather quickly although there still are 2 boxes of photos/ decorative items as well as some pictures to be hung. We bought the big items we planned for (new HVAC, washer & dryer, 2 beds, bedding, den furniture, shutters for 3 windows) and some we didn't plan for (water heater, recirculating water pump). We restocked the pantry, toiletries and some emergency supplies.So far for emergency/earthquake supplies we have in the pantry canned and boxed food plus lots of gallons of water, some first aid supplies, a battery powered lantern and extra pet food. For the car I repurposed a backpack which so far has emergency blankets and ponchos, long lasting LED light stick, first aid supplies, face masks, foot and hand warmers, gloves, and 5 year shelf life food bars and water packets. I've added shoes and socks to the car in case we aren't wearing good walking shoes and a few bottles of water. I still need to add supplemental cell phone chargers, a hand crank/solar radio/siren/light, more car first aid supplies, etc. Many home repairs have been completed: popcorn ceilings removed and painted, termites treated, plumbing fixed, electrical to code, bathroom fan installed, stuck doors repaired, window uncovered (although why it was dry walled over remains a mystery), outdoor porch lights re-installed, etc.Hubby cut down the overgrown bougainvilleas that were a hassle to trim each week (big thorns) and used up too much patio space. He scrubbed the patio walls and had the irrigation hose disconnected, put down pine straw and put in some large decorative pots and plants.The repair list has been added to as we experience the home and we plan on getting new attic insulation and we are still waiting for the Association to take down the dying tree in our front yard.We couldn't figure out a new wall color for the open floor plan and our furnishings so we decided to live with the existing one. Hubby did paint a dark master bedroom feature wall, dark walls in a small room and dark ceilings in 3 places. That was a huge improvement.Feeling at home in our new location:We have learned our way around and found that we like the library cafe and a few local restaurants. The local art gallery is becoming a favorite including the events they put on. I am enjoying taking an OLLI class and Hubby is enjoying golfing. We found a primary care doctor, dentist, vet, orthopedic masseuse, and hairdressers. I met up with some online friends and saw East coast cousins who were vacationing in California. I've met some locals that I can see becoming friends.We like the weather and can get to the coast or to my FIL's assisted living facility in 20 minutes, to our local son & DIL's in 60 minutes and to the others in 7 hours. I have gotten involved in yoga, the Pet Club, and the local AAUW chapter.The biggest win is all the time and fun we have had with family! It is so great to be close again and we and they are figuring out how best to fit into each other's lives on a regular basis as it is a change after 20 years. We are also able to help out such as dogsitting for 3 weeks while the local son and DIL celebrate their 20th anniversary with a European trip.¬†Finances:We have managed to retain most of the profit we made from selling our house and buying a less expensive one. We decided to try being a one car family at the time of our move and so far it is working for us ans saving lots of money too. Hubby has utilized the free bus service some and the train. I do need to get the Lyftt app on my phone and learn how to use it! I took a look at expenses for the first 6 months here vs the same 6 months last year in Atlanta (excluding one time home expenses at each end) and so far our housing, home insurance, property taxes, utility and cable costs are about half to two thirds of what they were in Atlanta. Food and gasoline are about the same as we are driving a lot more and food costs are similar. We will see if that continues.I found a free Health Care Power of Attorney and Living Will form on the CA AG's website and we completed those. We are going to research if our Georgia wills and Durable Powers of Attorney are valid and double checking all beneficiary designations on accounts.Hubby worked full time until the end of September which meant working remotely with monthly commutes to Atlanta at our cost. He completed all the paperwork for retirement, I started my SS on my 68th birthday and we both signed up for Medicare. He bought a laptop computer and got a personal cellphone as his work ones were returned.¬†Since we know our income in 2018 will be less than half of 2017 we are maximizing our itemized deductions this year including paying our full property tax bill instead of doing 2 payments. We will be tapping into our savings for the next 5 years until we both reach 70 and have our full retirement incomes, but that is planned out as much as one can. What is ahead for us?We will be spending the next 6 months getting the hang of living on my SS, the yet to be finalized income from his pension and savings. That is planned to last for the next 2 1/2 years.¬† I say yet to be finalized because it takes months for the Feds to process retirement and finalize the pension payment so you receive a partial pension in the interim. Then I will have mandatory minimum withdrawals from my 401K as well for the following 2 1/2 years. After those 5 years Hubby will take SS at 70 and his mandatory minimum withdrawals from his 401K and 403B as well. Best laid plans and all that LOL.¬† I need to finish preparing our emergency/earthquake supplies for home and the car and getting the last of the unpacking and home improvements finished. The new to us house will require less attention as we complete improvements although we plan to do a a partial remodel on the guest bath in the second half of 2018 as it still has some original fixtures that aren't in good shape.I also need to find a dog sitter so we can plan some vacations or as an alternative figure out a pet friendly vacation. We do like to travel.Hubby has to figure out his retirement activities, I need to up my weekly activities and both of us need to make new friends. We will continue to spend lots of time with family members and stay in touch with friends and family on the other side of the country.We also plan to broaden our distance in our search for restaurants, arts and theater that provide us with what we need to be happy in those arenas.So it has been quite a journey and the new normal is here at last. Some surprises along the way but our extensive planning made it go fairly smoothly so far. Now on to the not unusual challenges of retirement, aged relatives and everyday living!"},

I was able to wait until I was 68 to start collecting which I know is an impossibility for many people.We are hoping Hubby can wait until he turns 70 since his Federal employee pension starts this month and we have savings to draw on. The rationale is that then his will be higher than mine so if he dies first I will be able to collect a higher amount. Who knows if this is the right decision!How have you, or are you thinking about, when to collect your Social Security?We are taking care of our Grand-dog for 3 weeks while his people travel to Amsterdam and Greece.

Cal on their way back to the airport, and a good, inexpensive dinner at a new to us tiny hole in the wall local Thai restaurant.9th - Went to part 2 of the new resident orientation and learned some helpful things about what the HOA allows us to do without approval and with approval.10th - Phone calls with husband's aunt and my brother followed by a coastal drive to view the ocean.13th - The best masseuse ever!14th - The Women's Club in my community put on a fashion show fundraiser with Macy's providing outfits so it was interesting to see what their fashion stylists thought women over 55 in S. Cal would want to wear.15th - Came home from my OLLI class very happy for having chatted with 3 women I can see as friends and very ready for lunch only to find Hubby in a dither over problems with his computer and did not react well - in fact can say I way overreacted in a not good way - sigh.16th - Had fun plans but in the end we stayed home with one event cancelled and the other seeming like too much effort after I bathed the dog, walked her and did some house cleaning.17th - My older son and DIL asked to meet for coffee on their way to do some shopping for items needed for their upcoming trip to Greece and we spent an hour chatting and laughing which is really why we moved back to California to be near family.19th - Found the most adorable raincoat for my baby granddaughter at the local consignment shop on sale for $3.84 (plus shipping of course LOL).21st - Fall seems to be here right on schedule so I wore jeans and made veggie soup for dinner along with apple salad and garlic bread.22nd - I really enjoy having made 2 friendly acquaintances in my art history class and chatting with them each Friday.23rd - Hubs and I went on a short hike at a nearby city park in the Santa Monica mountains and learned its human history as a Venturano Chumash Indian site and location of a stagecoach stop, saw volcanic outcrops and learned about local plants, great views and generally had fun.24th - Met a whole lot of bright, energetic, motivated women at the annual kick-off meeting for the local AAUW branch (American Association of University Women) and heard nine articulate, bright, and enthusiastic 8th grade girls talk about their experiences at a week long summer TechTrek program the group sponsored them for so I joined up.25th - Bought a pair of gray slip on Skechers which I hope will work as casual and around the house shoes in cooler weather.26th - Car serviced & oil change, grandbaby's jacket mailed, more books from the library and scheduled handyman service so I can check all of those off.29th - We went to the new Tom Cruise movie and although I thought he did a good job with his role overall I didn't think it was worth seeing.30th - My first Fall in S. Cal in 20 years and the first one in an (almost) coastal location for 40 years so I am slowly creating a weather and new lifestyle appropriate Fall wardrobe capsule aka Project 333 which led to 3 outfits I liked this week although 2 used the same new top - oh well.

", "date": "Saturday, September 30, 2017", "text": "Hubby's retirement project #1:Our little patio in our new house came with large old bougainvilleas that required pruning every week while stabbing us with large thorns. Pretty and a good wind break, but a pain in the tuchus. No room for the patio table.So yesterday it went from thisto this.And soon will be beautiful again with large potted plants, larger with added pavers, and more functional with room for the patio table. No weekly painful pruning required.I've played with a capsule wardrobe before but with moving across country to spend my first Fall in 20 years in S. Cal and my first one is over 40 years in an almost coastal community I am really trying to figure out what to wear! So this year I am creating my Project 333¬† capsule wardrobe by seeing what I wear that works.So far I have 13 items: 4 tops, 3 cardigans, 3 pairs of pants/jeans, 3 pairs of shoes. I'm not counting my only purse, scarves or jewelry this time around and of course not clothes that are worn only for exercising or sleeping nor undergarments.The outfits I liked this week? Two included a new top the color of which I adore and my new gray slip on Skechers which are proving great for home but not for walks."},

Met up with my cousins as they traveled through California, had a long chat with an elderly aunt, talked to my close friend in my former location and emailed too, talked to my brother and FIL and sons, wrote 2 cousins and my aunt but the latter was returned so I know have her current address and will try again. Did decide I was too worn out to make a brief trip up north to see the grandbaby so I'm going to lose my SW Airlines credit but I would have had to spend more to make the trip. Sent I made progress on my personal goals too. I have upped my exercise with about an 80% of days results, got my flu shot and signed up for a yoga fundamentals class to try a new teacher. I worked on meeting potential friends as I joined AAUW locally, volunteered for a fundraising event for the county animal shelter, and attended my OLLI class faithfully. I picked out a potential cross body purse pattern but that is as far as I went with sewing.I really want to finish our crosscountry move related tasks but alas I didn't. I did schedule the handyman service for 10/6, ordered shutters for the relevant windows after Hubby finished painting, bought some more items for our emergency supplies and hung a few pictures. I still need to update our wills, etc. and finish purchasing the emergency supplies.On the retirementrelated front: Hubby signed up for Medicare Parts A & B and has finished his paid working days since he is required to take the final 2 days of September as vacation since he did not want to make one more trip back to Atlanta!Not perfect but not shabby.October will be the first month we are both retired and living on retirement income. I will receive my first SS payment and be fully on Medicare. We will be dog sitting for my son and DIL's dog for 2 1/2 weeks while they take a 20th anniversary trip abroad. I've never had 2 dogs at once much less when I have to take them out on a leash. Thank goodness he is a sweetie and the dogs get along well.I will keep going to my OLLI class, exercising and attending activities. We might even get the last of the pictures hung and figure out what to do with the ones that don't suit this house. That plus family time, some recreation and normal day to day life should pretty much fill up the month."},

I did buy two glass serving bowls and two large coffee mugs as those are items I am seeing we will use when having company. $8.36 later I replaced some things I hadn't moved because I knew how many were at Goodwill LOL.I did have fun toting around my birthday gift made by my other DIL - a shopping/beach bag that is so cute with pompoms and a cheery fabric.

Excited that both sons, DILs and grandbaby (plus 2 granddogs) are going to spend the weekend.It was a quiet actual birthday as its just me and the dog at home. DH is on his last business trip and arriving home tomorrow evening before the kids arrive.I started an OLLI class this morning, Post Impressionism, that is being held at a local artist collective gallery. Huge turnout of 74 enrollees which surprised me but gives lots of opportunities to meet people. I went shopping yesterday at a newly opened consignment store in town and found some birthday presents for myself: a cardigan, necklace and scarf plus a couple of toys for the grandbaby to have at our house. I wore the cardigan and necklace this morning and felt great.Then I rushed home to await delivery of our den furniture which was ordered 8 weeks ago. Nice birthday present LOL. Now we have a furnished den off of the living room. I didn't even cut off the tags before I took pictures. We'll get pictures hung after the family is here.Got to one grocery store to stock up and will do the other in the morning as well as finish babyproofing and cleaning. Can't wait to have \"my dream come true\" by having all of my immediate family together. Makes all the effort of moving across the country worthwhile.Hope you have a lovely long weekend."},
{"title": "Taking a deep breath after our move", "date": "Sunday, August 27, 2017", "text": "Lots of things about our cross country move are working out very well. Our new house is comfortable, neighbors are friendly and the weather is divine. We have seen more of our family in the last 4 months than we have in the last 4 years - and that is wonderful. We are ready for the next phase of life as Hubby retires at the end of September and we figure out how to spend our time individually and together and how to make new close friends.But .... we were talking last night about the unexpected expenses that have come with this house; not that we didn't expect some but still there have been more than anticipated. Some have been choices such as the quality of the den furniture we ordered but others were total surprises such as having to replace a relatively new water heater and a recirculating water pump.So I think we are going to take a pause and hold off on a big expenditure that would be a quality of life improvement and also not necessary. The water here is extremely hard which is why the water heater had to be replaced. As long as we periodically flush the new one it should last a lot longer. However the washing machine and dishwasher could be damaged over time.We have looked into a whole house water treatment system that would be great at solving this problem and making the water taste great without adding salt as many systems do. It would also make cleaning a lot easier as the hard water leaves deposits. But at $3,750 to purchase and install is it really worth it? A spending pause seems right so we can really think this through because honestly I'd rather take a vacation!2 questions:Any experience with really hard water and ideas for cleaning materials and steps to take to prolong the life of appliances?Do you ever take a spending pause to contemplate your priorities overall or in a specific area of your life."},

Window is in excellent shape surprisingly.- Fixed gate latch that didn't work well.- Filled holes in firewall in garage. Noted that we also need to replace the pull down attic stairs as they do not currently offer firewall protection and are installed backwards. A new item on list for the future sigh. Yesterday's program:Handyman company schedules workers to arrive at 9am. Forget to call and tell you that they have been rescheduled to 1pm. You miss a meeting really wanted to go to. Call and say they will be there at 2pm. Show up at 2:15.They do excellent work. So now:- The uncovered window is framed with nicely textured and sealed drywall.- The garage door has an automatic closer as required and opens without kicking it.- The guest room closet doors actually move smoothly with a new track in place.- The French doors between living room and study will close without kicking them.- The front door has new weatherstripping but the back door does not until they can figure out what to do.- The non-working bath fan has been removed and the size of the opening changed. I think some wiring changes were made too.- Determined that the recirculating pump under the other bath sink was programmed wrong and when that was corrected that it overheats quickly. Now unplugged.Today's plan (we'll see if it happens):- Show up at some yet to be determined time. This time I will call and find out.- Install bath fan.- Bring company owner by to figure out how to fix weather seal on back door.And then, my chores:- Clean house thoroughly before son and DIL arrive to visit on Friday afternoon. Lots of drywall sanding dust coating everything. Just reminded me how ready I am for home repairs/improvements related to moving to be over with! We still have a water system to install as well as finding shutters for the \"uncovered\" window and getting that room repainted.

We also have added some things after living here for 4 months.Today though it hit me that in terms of resource allocation we could save $425 by not installing a gutter for the patio area given how infrequently it rains here and how many pine needles would have to be regularly cleaned out of that gutter. Cancelled that quickly.The money will be better spent towards a whole house water filtering system as the water here is very, very hard and leaves deposits in and on everything. That is next up on our list.On the other hand, although I have been quite comfortable sleeping on our new mattress, Hubby has not. We spent a good chunk of money yesterday on a cotton wool mattress topper and he slept much better. I think the bed is slightly less comfortable but I can live with it.We also bought 4 tickets to a comedy show to attend when our local son and DIL spend the weekend soon. So there you have it. Long term goal is make our money last if we live to 100+. Current comfort and¬† is sleeping well and not battling hard water deposits (not to mention not having to replace appliances often due to said water).

As expected the conversation came around to my Hubby's retirement in 7 weeks, me already being retired and the woman of the couple thinking about retiring in June.So the big question was \"What do/will you do with your time?\"I think that is the hardest thing for people who have had an engaging professional career with little time or inclination for hobbies or avocations, no grandchildren (or at least none nearby), and little idea of what will replace the satisfactions of their work, the structure of work days and the enjoyment of spending time with colleagues.I know I continue to struggle with this and lost what I had settled on with our cross-country move. I also spent the last year focused on our house sale, house purchase & move. Bit by bit I am trying out new activities to try to recreate my life in a satisfying way.Hubby hasn't thought about it yet - or so he claims. Our friend genuinely had no idea how she would want to spend her time.How have you approached this or seen others approach it? What has worked - or not worked - for you?Let's get a discussion going."},

Tried a new to us restaurant, Snapper Jack's Taco Shack, which has good food, lots of surfboard decorations and 60's music.2. It's a fact that I will never like cleaning the house and look forward to splitting the chore when Hubby retires.3. Ordered the furniture for the den this morning and now have to wait 8 weeks for delivery.4. Made a delicious dinner from my new Mexican recipe cookbook.5. I took Hubby to the train station to start his 3rd of 5 week long trip back to Atlanta for work.6. I emptied 2 of the few remaining moving boxes and all that remains is shown below plus went to the library, UPS store, CVS and walked and washed the dog.¬†7. Day 1 of my most recent attempt to make myself exercise as a habit included 30 minutes of stretching, walking the dog and then walking by myself wearing a hat before it got too hot for reasonable people to be outside.8. I was already quite hot at 9:30am when I went to the Organic Farmer's Market here in Camarillo but I found what I wanted including tasting and picking a different variety of green grapes plus that sweet roll jumped into my bag (thank goodness).9. Nothing of note today but the laundry is done and the house picked up.10. The Pet Club program tonight was a talk and demo by the county search and rescue team which was extremely interesting including the lab who couldn't take his eyes off of the swimming pool until he started working.11. Invited a neighbor to got to yoga class but she found it not acceptable as she really wants exactly what her former instructor did - oh well.12. Sure wish I had bought pet insurance when we adopted this dog but at least her eye infection or allergic reaction has cleared up with medicine I can apply.13. Finally got an electrician over and agreed on what repairs need to be made which is not everything the home inspector listed AND we drove to the beach and took a walk.14. Laundry, errands including buying a new top & necklace followed by wearing same to dinner at a cousin's home and at a Beach Boys tribute band show. 15. Saw Wonder Woman and liked it, but I wonder if anyone else found it dark and way over the heads of the usual target audience of pre-teens due to the strong plot lines of Greek mythology and WW1?16. We were glad we picked up my FIL and went to visit the family of his recently deceased close friend and took lunch for everyone.17. Hubby finished leveling the pavers in our small patio so that now all of it is usable.18. Pretty much a do nothing day otherwise known as relaxing or vegging.19. Happy pooch with a summer haircut and doggie spa day today including a blueberry facial lol AND a very happy 71st birthday to my big brother.20. Found a good handyman/minor remodeling firm very experienced with the homes in our development and are waiting for their bid.21. Had very effective deep tissue massage that highlighted the fact that all of my problem areas are back but that they new masseuse is very good.22. I hope that if I have trouble hearing the TV and people speaking when I am older that I remember that it is most likely my hearing that needs fixing not the TV or other people!23. Who knew that having a clean car was such a happy making thing.24. The dog was startled awake at about 2am, left out of bed in a flurry of panic and adrenaline, and then stood there quite confused and numb until I got up to pick her up and put her back in the bed where she proceeded to practically lay on top of me for comfort and protection.25. Paperwork, follow ups, decisions - felt like a work day not retirement.26. Had a lovely chat with a couple of women in a genealogy group that meets at the library and will try the group out next week.27. Pruning, laundry, dog walking, library run, Starbucks run, reading and cooking made up my day.28. Home Depot (again), unsuccessful shoe shopping and another day gone by.29. My FIL seems to have come to the conclusion that he will be much happier if he moves to a different assisted living facility (although they are very similar and no one but him believes he will be any happier) so we took him on a visit to the other facility - sigh.30. Had a fun time with son and DIL and both their and our dog while taking a long walk in Pasadena and eating brunch outdoors.31. Braved the outlet mall which wasn't such a big deal on a Monday to pick up a lightweight top and scope out some future wardrobe upgrades.    An InLinkz Link-up"},

There is no penalty for delaying Part B past 65 as we completed the proof of other insurance form.

I'm starting to consider what I need/want to add to have an equally well working fall capsule. Shoes and a semi-dressy outfit are on the list so far.I stopped at the library and arrived a few minutes before it opened. Chatted with a woman also waiting and found out about a weekly genealogy group meeting. She took me up to meet other members and I'll give it a try next week.I'll add in attending yoga class and a jewelry making group in my at my community rec center and see if I can't make some friends quickly.I went to the golf course in my community and practiced driving as it had been maybe 8 years or so since I played.

As of September 1st when I turn 68 I will start collecting social security payments. He won't collect his for 5 more years when he turns 70 if all goes as planned.¬† That would leave me with a larger monthly payment if it turns out I outlive him.¬† Have to be practical about all of this we think.As of October 1st I will start paying for Medicare Part B. When he turns 65 in November he will do the same. We will also pay for federal retiree health insurance too.Lots of changes so it is time for a new budget even with a lack of clarity about final amounts and how much we will need to pay in estimated state and federal taxes. We do know that it takes some time for the pension payments to become a full payment but that any differences are eventually paid.We have other financial resources to draw upon but will have to figure out when to do that. We probably kept too much money in savings accounts for this purpose but we didn't know if we would find we needed a second car or if other large expenses would arise after our move. Still don't LOL.We have decided to drop his life insurance once he is officially retired. We have also decided to wait until we are 70 to start withdrawals from our retirement accounts.Best laid plans and all that.I do hope that when the dust settles on all this we can simplify our financial arrangements as changing our address and other contact info for all the various online accounts was a pain although a first world problem. For now I am going to see what expenses we can predict and monitor the incoming carefully until it evens out.Tomorrow I have an appointment at the Social Security office to turn in the extra paperwork required for Medicare Part B since I delayed starting it and don't need to pay the penalty because I can prove I did have health insurance through his employment.And then onward into the unknown."},

It is testimony to how dirty the car was that I am still quite happy today that it is clean.We also brought home enough leftovers from the birthday dinner we attended last night to have most of our dinner for tonight. Happiness is only having to fix a bit of dinner. Wine may be drunk too.I don't know if it is the season or the competition from the newly opened Sprouts store here in town, but the produce at Vons was much better than it had been so I was able to pick up quite a few good things yesterday morning.I had picked up an inexpensive loose sleeveless knit top at Target a while ago and am really liking wearing it instead of another tank like I usually buy.The HR office at my husband's work finally found his retirement paperwork today (which we had FedEx'd to them as required and was delivered about 10 days ago).

Got to bring some color, interest and energy to everything perhaps.The summer here is bringing a different kind of hot weather than I have experienced before. Not as hot as some places I have lived, but it is more humid in the morning than I expected as the marine layer moves inland overnight. The sun is quite intense when there is no cloud cover so hats were frequent at the farmer's market this morning even at 9:30am.I made the mistake of wearing a metal necklace and it felt so hot against my skin so I took it off as soon as I got home. I can see my hot summer day outfits will indeed be minimalist.I had never thought about there being different varieties of green grapes but there they were at the market. Distinctly different tastes and since I am the only one who like grapes I bought the one I preferred. Heirloom tomatoes for both taste and memories of my Grandma's love of growing different varieties of tomatoes in her garden. Here is my mini-haul as Hubby is out of town and there is a lot in the frig already.Got out of the house and went to the Oxnard Carnegie Museum and Studio Gallery by myself. Turns out it was family free day and there were lots of kids painting and weaving - what fun. The museum was one of the original Carnegie libraries and is very typical architecture for that time. The little associated gallery is CA southwestern. Not much space for exhibiting but the art that was displayed was a group of little gems.

I am not comfortable on many couches as they are too deep for me and I dislike always needing a pillow. That caused us to end up at a pretty high end furniture store but the bonus is that they have a designer who will bring fabric samples out to the house and do some possible layouts for us. So tomorrow morning we will probably see that our initial fabric choices are poor colors but at least it is a start. I am conflicted about whether this is the best use of the room as we have another room with a TV. Hubby disagrees. We will see.We had three ceilings that were painted dark. Hubby is finishing the second this weekend!Then there is the list for an electrician. We have agreed how to approach the trickier/optional items so I will call and schedule an appointment tomorrow.That leaves a rather random list of repairs where we are not quite sure who to hire since it would be nice to have one person who could do all of it.1. A window was dry walled over with the mini-blinds still hanging inside the wall - odd. We want to open the wall back up, trim the window, buy plantation shutters to match the others in the room and then paint the room.2. There are holes in the fire wall material in the garage. I think that is a specialty type of drywall.3. Doors and gates that stick and an auto door closer for the door into the house from the garage.4. Loose glass in one window.5. Sink overflow drains that need connecting. (The plumber didn't want to do it as it is fiddly and time consuming)6. Gutters & downspouts.7. Patio leveled.8. Install tool, ladder, etc. hangers in garage.Monday I will call and talk to a drywall repair person, a handyman and the person who sold the windows to a previous owner to see who might be the best answer or if it will take a team!"},

{"title": "Why internet shopping is so great & so frustrating", "date": "Thursday, June 8, 2017", "text": "Since we moved I have been shopping a lot more than usual. New furnishings for the house and clothing for me almost all done by internet except for the saga of the 5 tries it took to find the right down comforter and buying our new beds. Sheets and blankets were a combo of in person and internet shopping. We are supremely happy with our new beds, sheets, comforter and bed skirt. I like my new pillow and we are still working on blankets.Oh, and there was the evening run to replace the French press that broke so we could have coffee the next morning. Essential.I really want to talk about what I learned in the last month about shopping via the internet and hear from you about your experiences. It is so easy - its all available for a price without leaving your home. Once you start browsing, algorithms suggest additional items to look at and consider buying. If your local store doesn't have it then you can probably order it online.Sometimes that worked out this past month.We bought 2 pieces of furniture via the internet. A storage bench for our bedroom and a TV stand/cabinet. Neither one is high quality but we weren't looking for items to last a lifetime but rather to fit specific needs in this specific house for the time we live here.The gray storage bench is working out well and once it finishes out gassing chemical smells I'll like it even more. It is a place to sit and put on shoes comfortably and will store out of season bedding. It fits well in the space. The price was right with the discount coupon that was part of our address change package. It arrived with no damage.The TV stand is a bit weird, but the space we have available made it hard to find one to fit. What is weird is that the shelves inside the glass front cabinet are a different color than the rest of the unit. Again, it arrived with no damage. We are going to keep it as it was the only one I found that fit our needs.And sometimes it just cost me money for shipping and return fees.Clothing shopping has had a worse success rate as you would expect. I am pretty much through ordering clothing online even though I despise going shopping in person for clothing.I will continue to buy online things I have successfully worn before and favorite brand shoes as long as they are shipped and can be returned for free. In May I got online 2 pairs of jeans and 2 bras that were the same/similar to ones I had and that was great. I will also continue to buy accessories, vintage or new, via Etsy as that has worked well. What didn't work out in May was a too small maxi dress and ditto for a sheath dress; a too large chino skirt: and not as shown in the picture capris and a top. As a result, I've taken several stores off of my online shopping list and simply will not buy from them any more.Do you like shopping online and how do you make it work for you?"},

It was a success and I too would like a blueberry facial, shampoo, body massage, pedicure and haircut all in one place LOL. Hubby is often playing 9 holes of golf after dinner and we are both walking more. Except for the first weekend we were here, we have spent time with family each weekend and that was the whole purpose of moving.I'm debating what to get involved in. The pet club for sure (don't you love that there is one?). Perhaps the Leisure Village theater group that produces one act plays or the Camarillo volunteer run theater that we are going to check out with a Sunday performance. I am also contemplating volunteering to be the emergency coordinator for my \"Village\" because there isn't one and I think it is very important.I am attending activities here such as the Women's Club monthly meetings and the performance (music, movies, live theater) that sound interesting. I still need to try out the pool and go to yoga class again/regularly. Still need to get to the Farmer's Market too.¬† I also found out that there is an art museum nearby and it has a book club - definitely on my list to try out.We continue to work away at our \"punch list\" mostly arising from the pre-purchase home inspection and working on a bit of painting and decorating by hanging pictures, etc. We have ordered two pieces of furniture: a TV stand/cabinet and a storage bench for the master bedroom. Once they are in place we will buy den furniture and be pretty much done.I am feeling like this has been a good move and will work for us for the next few years - then who knows."},

Learned a lot about current mattress construction. Then we swung by Kohl's with a coupon and the Memorial Day sales in full swing and picked up much needed new bath towels and optimistically bought a mattress pad for the yet to be purchased king sized bed. We had been to lunch with my FIL and great aunt and didn't have the energy to decide on sheets, comforter, etc. Perhaps next week.Yesterday I returned an online order that was too large and found at great sale prices 3 items on my clothing purchase list: lightweight pajamas, sunglasses and a purse.Hope this streak continues!Do you have any luck shopping sales?

{"title": "Preparing for emergencies caused by nature", "date": "Wednesday, May 17, 2017", "text": "In our previous home the main nature caused potential emergencies were tornadoes and power outages due to falling tree limbs, ice or wind. Pretty simple to prepare for so we stocked up on water, food that could be eaten cold and emergency lights. We also were clear where in the basement to huddle and paid attention to tornado watches and listened for the siren nearby.In S. Cal it is a bit different - earthquakes being the big one to prepare for. However there can be \"forest\" fires, mudslides, floods, etc. Having been to this rodeo before I know it is important to be prepared to get by on your own for at least a week with no utilities, stores out of food, gas stations not operating or out of gas and ATMs not working. You also need to have \"bug out\" bags for each person and pet in the car and/or home. In our case since we have one car that could be gone there needs to be something at home too.I'm fortunate that the community has a emergency response group and a ham radio tower and operators. That would help but its a community of about 3,500 people all over 55 with an average age of 72. We need to be prepared to help ourselves and others.Enter this thorough website that the state of CA offers. I think it could be adapted to any emergency situation if you are interested in checking or improving your preparedness. Be Prepared - Individuals and Families. I like Arizona's website too: Just in CaseSo what have I done in the month since we moved? Nothing but buy a couple of gallons of water.Today I looked up the list of what to have on hand and got started with upping our water and non-perishable food supplies.(1) Water @ a minimum of 1 gallon per person per day for a minimum of 3 days. Add in some for the dog.- We now have six gallons and I will keep stocking up until we have at least 15. I'll also look into a good water filtering system such as is used for camping to make non-potable water drinkable.2) Food for at least 3 days including dog food. Pick foods that require no refrigeration, preparation or cooking and little or no water added. Make sure to have a can opener, paper plates, plastic cups and silverware, etc. Canned goods such as beans, fruit, & tuna, peanut butter, dry cereal, crackers, protein or fruit bars, nuts, canned juices, etc. I read a suggestion somewhere to actually make up a 3 - 7 day meal plan with calorie counts to make sure you have the right foods stored. Good idea.Here is a great list of non-perishables to have on hand. Some do require the ability to heat water so take that into account. Not a good idea when gas lines many have ruptured during an earthquake but helpful in other circumstances perhaps.¬†Disaster foods- We now have a few extra cans of beans, fruit & tuna as well as disposable plates, etc. I will make sure to always have extras of the other items on hand as well as adding more canned goods.Next on the list is a first aid kit. Will work on that next week and keep going down the list.Are you prepared?"},

The entrance door is great with a retractable screen. We will plant some flowers in the front beds eventually and/or decorative pots with flowers.¬† Want to be outside? We have a small patio in the back.Inside is a work in progress. We plan to have the whole house painted and buy more furniture. We will hang our artwork once the painting is done.The living room is enjoyable to sit in. Our living room furniture goes well and the dog thinks the carpeting is great for running.The den room is off the living room at the front of the house.

The laundromat was nice and faster to be sure, but I'm not into doing that each week.- New HVAC system & thermostat today - still needs some work as they dislodged two ceiling can lights in the hallway and we aren't sure why or how to fix it.Still to come- A new printer- Termite treatment- Buying a bunch of miscellaneous household items at Home Depot- Buying 2 beds and furniture for the den- Some electrical work and fixtures- Getting some drywall work done and some minor handyman type things as wellUndecided- We got a quote of $3,000 for painting the entire house. We may learn to like the wall color more than we do right now lol. That would mean we could paint the 3 ceilings, one feature wall and one small room ourselves. We might also paint the inside of the closets.What we haven't had to spend on, but thought we would- Carpet cleaning - a bit of club soda and elbow grease removed the spots- New shower head - it was just a loose at the connector- Less annoying doorbell - the volume and type of ring could be adjusted on the existing one Surprisingly more expensive here- Food, especially produce. This is a shock as we live in a major produce producing area of California. I'm going to try the Saturday Farmer's Market next weekend to see if that is better in terms of price and selection. This weekend is full of family visits.- Restaurant food.- Toiletries.Surprisingly less expensive here - Auto insurance.- Live theater tickets at small venues.- Our cable/internet/phone bundle part of which is included in our HOA feed. That is just what we have experienced in a little over a week.I am pleasantly surprised at the exercise programs available in our community and will be spending less in that area. There are also lots of free or inexpensive entertainment options in the community. We are talking more walks. The response to a request for a repair of an item outside our house was swift. The city library is fabulous.Our house is smaller, but feels larger as it is a relatively open floor plan on one level with attached garage while the house we sold was 2 stories and a partial basement with lot of rooms and a detached carport. That is a 1941 home vs a 1980 home reality. We have discovered that there is good storage space in the attic area over the garage with \"Attic Master\" pull down stairs and plywood flooring.We are also seeing that this house dustier inside faster as we can have the screen doors open a lot. Trade offs. I am trying to explore a bit each day now as I run errands and also to take different routes so I can learn my way around this city. I have found the post office, a bakery, restaurants, a pet store around the corner, an ATM for cash withdrawals without a charge within walking distance, a car wash, etc. In a few weeks it is onward to learning the adjacent cities.Moving has certainly been an adventurous learning opportunity and full of unexpected financial consequences.

Hubby also bought a piece of baseboard and installed it on the wall behind where the washer and dryer will go since it was missing there.

We do have a new washer but I am not trying to air dry loads of clothing indoors. Most of the kitchen stuff and clothing is unpacked. It is interesting to figure out how to use the available storage which is laid out so differently than in our previous home. I went to the closest grocery store and rediscovered how much time it takes to shop in a new store but came home with more essentials.Tomorrow is more unpacking, a visit from another cousin and hopefully a nice long walk.I'll take photos to share once there aren't boxes stacked all over the place.There is a new resident's tea on next Thursday afternoon and we will attend.

Breakfasts are especially hard for me to imagine beyond a carton of yogurt. I do have paper plates, plastic cups and plastic utensils available plus the frig.One thing I highly recommend if you are moving to an area that will require a change of health care providers is to schedule appointments with all your main providers before you move! Find out how to transfer your medical records, what to ask to find the best next provider and get prescriptions with refills for any medications. You don't want to be scrambling for routine health care right after your move. That being said, I had the last of my appointments this week. I did have to cancel an annual Opthamology appointment due to the traffic nightmare created by the freeway bridge collapse here in Atlanta but that will not be so hard to replace and isn't urgent.Happy I accomplished these things this past week:Sale of current house: - Cleaned inside cupboards, etc. in prep for final walk through.- Scheduled haulers for April 13 for items that need to be junked (e.g. old mattresses, etc.). - Received new microwave and installed it.- The third item in the house broke and the plumber will be here on Monday morning to fix a leak in the bathroom sink.¬† New house:- Our cousin is picking up our mail at the new house so we won't have any past due bills for electricity, etc. by the time we get there.- Scheduled cable installation and plumbing repairs.- \"Popcorn\" ceilings have been removed and the ceilings painted. Photos look good. Cross country move:¬†- Hubby changed our health insurance to CA and found out how to change his address in payroll.- Booked hotels and laid out route for drive across country April 14 - 19.- Had the car in for a check up prior to driving across the country. Packing & downsizing: - The older car went to its new owners who are friends and our dog's foster family.- Finally figured out way to pack a large oil painting and large framed print.- Packed 11 boxes total. Just the last minute stuff left.For myself:- Good bye dinner with closest book club & neighborhood friends & lunch with best friend.- Haircut.What I am looking forward to this coming week:- Mostly this being over with and getting on to the cross country drive!

I didn't look at items where there is only one option like my purse and I was living out of a carry on suitcase for 3 weeks.I think these items say a lot about what my real life wardrobe needs to be and possible that I need more pairs of shoes LOL.I found it interesting that no tops or toppers made the cut. That is where I add variety and color and I have more of those than the other categories yet often still feel like I don't have enough. Have to think about that. Winners with 20 or more wears- Grey zip hooded sweatshirt: this is quite old and I need to start looking for a replacement- Navy knit gloves: bought this fall and I love them - In fact when I thought I had lost them at the dog park after a trip there with my son and granddaughter, I was ridiculously happy to find them in his car! They are long enough for my long fingers and just the right warmth for most days.- Bronze ECCO flats: Great for warmer days & no socks - Walking shoes: When I want my feet to be really happy more than I want to wear the my best colors these are the thing.- 2 pairs of jeans: medium and dark wash- Navy belt: of course; see jeans - leather from LLBeanIn second place with 15 - 19 wears:- Navy packable down jacket: It wasn't too cold this winter so this wasn't worn daily like last year. Still love it!- Navy Clarks Nubuck loafers: Great with socks & jeans!- Charcoal jeans: Just about ready to let these go but not quite yet. And the runners up with 10 - 14 wears:- More shoes: Clarks navy flats and Clarks grey flats- More jeans: Army green this time.- Green long sleeve top: Hey, it was in my suitcase!- Black belt: See Charcoal jeans LOLThere you are - the hardest working clothing in my wardrobe so far this year with navy and clearly the leading color.

Packed at least 15 boxes of mostly hard to pack art, antiques, tools, etc. Donated a carload of stuff & threw out a bit.For the dog: Ordered a new dog ID tag with the new address. Made a grooming appointment for truck loading day so she will be out of the house.For myself: Kept up with chores & yard work. Went out for coffee with a close friend and gave myself some down time to read and relax. Went to my book club meeting. Got a smile by buying Wonder Woman forever stamps instead of plain ones. I also started a nutrition counseling program.What I am looking forward to this week:- Dinner Saturday at a friend's.- Starting first steps in nutrition changes.- Finalizing my spring capsule wardrobe and perhaps shopping for an item or 2. - Clearing all paperwork and details on selling house.- Packing every thing that can be packed before last minute."},

So far I am very happy that:We have agreed on our driving route and stopping locations. Now we can book pet friendly hotels for each night.I posted on NextDoor asking for moving boxes, packing paper and bubble wrap. Have received very nice boxes and packing paper saving quite a bit and re-using instead of land filling. I will be saving them for a cousin's upcoming move.Glad I bought the wide rolls of larger cell bubble wrap. Same with glass¬† & dish packing box insert and heavy duty boxes. I also bought a rug wrap which I think will be great for a large area rug. Still need to buy more specialty packing items though.Happy with the packing sequence so far. We started with things that aren't actually used like decorative items and art. Moved on to things we can live without for a few weeks and/or are hard to pack. The kitchen, bedding and clothing will be last.Glad we decided to give away the furniture we aren't taking instead of trying to sell it. We certainly have received our money's worth from each item. Also very glad that we cleared out a lot of stuff as part of preparing the house for staging.Thinking it is a good idea that I am testing out a small capsule wardrobe to use for traveling and the first week we are in our new home so it should let me take the minimum in the car . Right now the weather is pretty much the same in Atlanta and Camarillo although a bit warmer here. Looking at our planned route it is a bit cooler in some locations along the way.

Going to my book club tonight for some friendship time. Progress on move prep:- Picking up wool coat from the dry cleaners after noticing that my DILs cashmere sweater had moth holes. We haven't had moth problems in Atlanta but I guess you can in LA.- Ordered a new dog ID tag with the new address.- Bought some specialty packing supplies.- Browsed Maytag washers and dryers while I was at Home Depot - research for purchase for new house as these are the only appliances not coming with the house.- Started going through emails and saving documents related to the home purchase just in case.Going through a big life change? How about a cross country move? Add in downsizing, daily chores, aging body and much more to create a time when you definitely need to prioritize taking care of yourself along with getting everything done.I haven't been following my own advice. Skipping exercise. Stress eating by loading up on carbs and having an extra glass of wine. So what am I doing about it?One thing is that I decided to invest in getting advice on nutrition in an integrated medicine context within the parameters of my particular body health and medical conditions/medications. I had the first meeting yesterday and we discussed a lot that I know I should do, but also some things I didn't know or hadn't thought about.That included the impact of taking a daily low dose of antibiotic and how to¬† counter that nutritionally. Why I have ridges on my fingernails. The fact that I may have a low level of stomach acid and how to¬† check that out (this could explain why I no longer like to eat high acid foods such as oranges, strawberries and some apples). How my diet may contribute to inflammation in my body.She brought over a nifty scale that in addition to measures body fat, muscle and bone %s, visceral fat and how many calories you can eat to maintain your current weight if you are totally inactive. It even gives you an estimate of your body age for what that is worth. I'm looking forward to her follow up report as I want the recommendations to see what I can do right now. Then our meetings are on hold until I get to CA and unpack a bit. We will do follow ups and weekly phone support via phone or skype. No more nifty scale measures though!Overall my short terms nutrition goals are to- Increase my hydration and do this consciously as I typically don't feel thirsty and I prefer coffee over other liquids. - Plan breakfasts and lunches to get more fiber and protein - we do dinner quite well. - Create some snack combos that are healthy and curb my cravings for sugar and fat (cookies anyone?). - Add some probiotic rich foods and/or supplements to counter the impact of the antibiotic (yogurt and kefir top the list right now as fermented foods tend to have too much salt for me). - Explore ways to balance stomach acid in addition to idea of eating more bitter greens which I do love. Not sure about drinking apple cider vinegar LOL.Today at Trader Joe's I bought some unsweetened Kefir to try, a women's multivitamin and some hummus for snacks. A start.What are you doing just for yourself?"},

The 2nd house sold to the first person who looked at it and before it was even in the multiple listings.Since this house went on the market on Friday, Feb 10th we have had at least 12 scheduled showings, an open house that drew 40+ people, and a day when 5 realtors popped by. Except for the realtor visits we have to take the dog and leave.It is all good but exhausting. Today we have someone showing up at lunchtime and then a person coming back for the third time for 2 hours with their realtor, girlfriend and architect. No offers yet although in our market even once you have one you keep showing the house in case the offer is withdrawn.Which leads me to my relief that we are leaving on vacation at the end of this week! Babysitting for 2 weeks after that sounds restful at this point LOL. My husband will be having to make all the sale related things work doing those 2 weeks while working full time and I don't envy him that but I'll be with our baby granddaughter.Transitions are busy times.Does the amount of energy required to make a life change ever keep you stuck in one that isn't working for you?"},

First showing at 9am tomorrow!Our house for saleSomeone asked me the other day if I would consider living in a \"tiny house\" - those 250ish square foot little homes. Absolutely not unless I was living alone and in a great location where I could be outdoors a lot.However we are going down to about 60% of what we live in now. Our current house is almost 2400 square feet. We bought it when one son was in high school and it worked for us, but our 1700 square foot house (in a more expensive market) before that worked well for 4 of us. It was all about the layout and the ability to live outside as well or not as is the case here.Of course until recently we all left all day 5 days a week too whereas going forward we will be retired and home more often.The homes where we are planning to move are just over 1400 square feet with 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, a den, living and dining rooms and patios. Plenty of space for us and for our family and friends to visit. We could go smaller but want the flexibility of what these models offer.If you have downsized in retirement how much smaller did you go and why? If you are only considering it, what are your thoughts?"},

Also on the look out for items for Spring and our move.I bought a pink knit top and camisole when I stopped at my favorite charity thrift store to drop off some items. It was 50% off day - $4.82 spent and a different color top for me. I have enjoyed wearing it already.My watch broke so I bought similar Timex at Target since this is a functional item for me not fashion. It sits next to my Medic Alert bracelet so they have similar bands. $24.83 spent.I was such a big spender this past month.Well actually I have spent a lot, but it has been on bathroom remodeling, materials to \"stage\" our large yard, Pilates sessions, and plane tickets to CA for our February-March trip. Fortunately Southwest airlines was having a sale so the flights for both of us cost less than boarding our dog for 10 days will cost!What I donated were some more old black items and a scarf that I have struggled with as it has too many colors and the print is too large and angular for me"},

BREATHE through my fears about driving cross-country with a dog with health issues. BREATHE & don't eat comfort food when finding my mind blank and blood pressure rising. BREATHE through the anxieties of potentially owning two houses at once with massively depleted bank accounts and double monthly home expenses.I am confident it will all be fine in the end, but the process of getting there is huge and could be overwhelming if I let it be. I know from moving before and from leading large work projects that one step at a time with a good plan gets it done. Now if it were just that easy to address the emotional parts of life upheavals - even ones that are sought out!On the check that off front, the main bath remodel is finished! We are not happy with some things but we won't be living with it LOL. It does look great - no longer stuck in the early '70s.For those of you who wanted to see the finished product here it is.

I did it and got great focus words to drive my dreams and reality in 2017 - daring, joy, terrific, learning loving-kindness, spectacular, pretty, decency, comfortable, stunning, play, love, and excitement.So here is to a year full of that and more!¬†Let's start off with some goals to add variety to life.¬† FOOD: Try a new healthy recipe each month. Bring the best into rotation BOOKS: Expand my reading into new genres and read at least 6 that aren't mysteries or fiction. Sign up for Goodreads, browse Indie best seller lists, and use NPR's best books of 2016 as starting points. Next up - Travelogues, biographies, writers from a different part of the world? Any ideas for me????TECH: Up my tech skills and use. Improve my phone use skills (GPS, search, hands free, etc.). See if hand me down IPhone5s and Garmin will fit my needs. Research and hopefully buy a laptop before we move. Learn to use my husband's tablet and my phone better. Look into Netflix, Amazon Prime and other options to expensive cable bills (the move will cause a switch from Comcast to Time Warner anyway). Get back into genealogy research through Ancestry and DNA to find out where my maternal ancestors came from in Sweden and Ireland/Scotland. Then on to my personal goals.HEALTH: I will exercise regularly every week. Keep up with Pilates, stretching, walking and healthy eating before we move . Once moved I will take advantage of the pool and fitness center, join a Pilates studio and find good walking routes. CLOTHES: I will have fun with fashion while creating a versatile, budget friendly wardrobe for my new lifestyle & location. I will shop from my wardrobe shopping list adjusting it as my lifestyle changes. I will try polish on my toenails and branch out in accessories. Consignment stores and sales will be my friends.¬† LOVE & FRIENDSHIP: I will make friends in our new location and reconnect in person with family. I will find and get involved in 3 activities/organizations. Email or write a geographically distant relative or friend once a month at least.Then I will invite people over and to go places. Hubby and I will develop a new routine of fun joint activities. We will host parties and family get-togethers. I will spend as much time as possible with my sons, DILs and new grandbaby. And the elephant in the room of giant goals within giant goals.MOVE: Have a successful cross country move. We will sell a house and buy a house. We will move us, the dog & our stuff across country and settle in our new home including furnishing it. We will transition all of our medical care seamlessly. We will manage the vet, groomer and boarding transition seamlessly. We will transition our electronic & financial life seamlessly including that I will start collecting social security upon turning 68 on September 1st and add Medicare at the end of November when hubby retires. I will quickly learn my way around and how to get to each family members location from our new home. And we will end up with more money in the bank at the end of all of that - maybe!¬†I think that is more than enough!!!Happiest of New Years to all of you. What are your priority goals for 2017?"},

Shoes, camisoles/tanks, coats, hats, gloves, scarves & jewelry were not counted.I came up with over 14 different outfits some of which were worn previously, some new and some I would not put in rotation.

{"title": "Building my Retirement Wardrobe - November 2016 update", "date": "Thursday, December 1, 2016", "text": "I am ready to stop experimenting with purchases and buy carefully to have a wardrobe that works for all my lifestyle situations. I am carefully examining what I own and doing a ruthless wardrobe purge too. Out with anything that doesn't fit my current body or my Colorful Casual Chic style.Mid November I made this shift and am swearing off random shopping. I took Mette's¬†5 Year Shopping Calendar¬† and am modifying it as I go with what I am actually buying.The additions since this change in my approach are knit gloves, a knit hat, a \"coatagin\" in hunter green, navy nubuck everyday shoes (Clarks). Total spent: $142. I'm happy with these purchases and have already been wearing all but the hat as it isn't yet hat weather here.I've come up with 2 outfits with the cozy cardigan so far in this betwixt and between fall weather. As the weather cools I'll have to take some time to play with finding more outfits and more variation in necklaces.Before I adopted the shopping calendar approach I bought 4 items in November 3 of which were thrifted and the other a vintage bracelet from Etsy. Two thrifted items have already left my wardrobe and one hasn't been used yet and may not be. Bad choices or impulse purchases? Both I'd say, but $29 definitely wasted and possibly $6 more.What stayed for sure is this gray vest which was $14 at a consignment store. Although a lighter color would be better, I like the shape and it replaces an old black vest that saw lots of wear but is now just used for yard work. What else left my closet? Gray jeans that no longer fit. Gray corduroy pants that never fit well, an old black cardigan and last year's navy loafers that were replaced this month.What is on the potential purchase list for December? An everyday purse (replacement), camisole/underlayer for warmth, and a bra. In reality with workers in the house for the next 3 to 4 weeks I may not get to go shopping at all but that is what I would like to find.I did decide to start with Mette's own shopping calendar and modify it as I gained information about my own clothing needs and the longevity of items. So far from three years of November purchases I have concluded that light weight gloves last 2 years, everyday navy loafers only 1 year, jeans are good for 2 or 3 years, some sweaters for 3 years, knit tops for 2 or 3 years, and hats last a long time. Generally I don't plan to shop often enough for shoes and, since my feet are hard to fit and hurt easily, I really need to plan these purchases regularly.In looking at last year's November purchases, the navy loafers were worn out after one year since I wear them with jeans most days. The other 2 pairs of shoes I bought are worn less and have 1 or 2 more years to go. The gray headband and blue print leggings for Pilates are going strong and working well. A long sleeve t-shirt that was thrifted has developed a hole and is not going to last past this year.In November 2014 I bought 3 sweaters that are still worn, a cardigan and 3 knit tops that are still worn.¬† This is the last year for about half of them. The gray knit gloves purchased are worn out. I also bought 3 pairs of jeans and all are doing fine.How do you manage your clothing shopping to avoid churn and waste?"},

We will be picking the best of what is available unless they are all terrible.Lots of houses just coming on the market in our neighborhood which is odd timing.

{"title": "Rebuilding my Wardrobe: What do I really need for Fall/Winter?", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2016", "text": "I am ready to stop experimenting with purchases and buy carefully to have a wardrobe that works for all my lifestyle situations. I am carefully examining what I own and doing a ruthless wardrobe purge too. Out with anything that doesn't fit my current body or my Colorful Casual Chic style.Mid November I made this shift and am swearing off random shopping. I took Mette's¬†5 Year Shopping Calendar¬† and am modifying it as I go with what I am actually buying. So the first step is to see what I am actually missing from my current wardrobe and/or what needs replacing. Then I can add in what I would like to add or replace.Do any of you read The Vivienne Files? Janice has been doing a multi-part post on how to build a capsule wardrobe. I thought I'd give it a try with my current lifestyle in mind and with my planned 3 week trip to CA in late February & early March to celebrate my FIL's 90th, buy a house and take care of our new granddaughter for 2 weeks. Whew.First step was to take what I have and follow Steps 1-5 of Janice's plan. Jewelry is not shown but I have been stocking up on it these last few months so have lots of choices and no needs. I'm not including sleepwear.My closet is in much better shape for cool weather than for hot or transitional. Perhaps that reflects that summer clothing has to be washed more often so it wears out faster or that we have many more months hot/warm weather where I live now than we do of cool/cold weather.I'm happy with the colors I have now although all the items don't fit as well as I would like and/or aren't the style I am aiming for, but mostly I have enough clothing. Just a few shopping priorities and a list of wants to replace some things. The photo colors aren't exact of course due to the vagaries of lighting and my phone camera.To start, here is what I cobbled together for today. I am using my summer tanks as under layers until I can buy some.Pants: Olive and greige slacks along with 4 pairs of jeans; charcoal, dark wash and 2 pairs mid wash. Boring but useful. I would like a pair of warm dressy slacks.¬†Note: I have 2 pairs of mid wash jeans but one photo. Toppers: Some color here! 4 cardigans and a light jacket. I need warmer cardigans and/or jackets for everyday and for dressier occasions. I would like to get a warmer, stretch jacket to substitute for the light weight one. .Tops: 13 of various weights and styles. I would like there to be more color. I have ordered 3 long sleeve t shirts (begonia, bright blue and hunter green - hoping they fit) and have a heavy burgundy tweed pullover an older medium weight pullover sweater which may be added/substituted. I need some camis/tanks to wear as an under layer to stay warm. A warm dressy top would be nice to have. ¬† Scarves: 4 existing ones that will work. I've been buying accessories lately!¬† ¬†Shoes: 4 pairs of flats. I definitely need some warmer shoes that can be worn with socks. I have been ordering and sending shoes back with no luck so far.Leisure Mini-Capsule: Sweatpants, yoga pants, walking shoes, fleece pullover, sweatshirt, vest, t-shirt. I may substitute/add a pair of hiking shoes, warm leggings and another long sleeve t shirt that I own and use mostly for Pilates.¬†¬†¬† ¬†Outerwear Mini-Capsule: Trench coat, fleece jacket, down jacket, gloves and hat. As the weather changes I will add a heavier coat from the 2 that I own. I'm going to wait on buying a new winter coat unless I just happen upon a perfect one this year.Also Rans: I have 3 older 3/4 sleeve tops and a skirt for funerals or other sober occasions along with a pair of taupe wedges that could be used as well.SHOPPING CALENDAR: This has been helpful in creating my shopping list.Priorities: Warmer shoes that can be worn with socks and go with jeans; camis/tanks for under layers, gloves, knit hat, and winter pajamas.Wants: Dress slacks & a warm dress top OR a warm dress & tights, dressy blazer/jacket, replace purse, replace winter robe, one warm everyday neutral cardigan, an everyday stretch jacket to substitute for lightweight one, wool coat to replace 2 winter coats."},

Of course she is Canadian so the big elephant in the room for those of us in the US - medical costs - is quite different.What a thought provoking way of looking at our annual expenses especially if planning a change in housing, location and lifestyle as we are doing. I decided to do the same analysis for our current location and lifestyle and then consider the parts that will change when we move to different housing. I am only including fixed and unavoidable costs.House - maintenance, utilities, insurance, property taxes - not one time costs for preparing to sell$12,271 a yearMedical/Health - medical insurance, medical/dental fees, prescriptions, over the counter meds $10, 915Grocery - food, wine/beer, toiletries, paper goods, cleaning products$6,500 ¬†Dog - vet, medications, food - she has been ill this year$3,750¬†Cars - maintenance, insurance, gasoline, licenses for 2 cars$3,225Communications - cable including landline & internet, cellphone but not newspaper, printer ink$2,618Life and Liability Insurance - life insurance for DH while he is still working and excess liability $2,058$41,337 a year; $3445 a month; $113.25 a day! What I haven't listed is clothing, haircuts, makeup, travel, eating out, movies and other recreation, books, gym, gifts, donations, newspaper, printer ink and lots of other random expenses that are variable and discretionary.So what do I know will change with our planned location, housing and lifestyle changes.Housing: We will pay an HOA fee of about $500/month that will cover exterior maintenance, structure insurance, water, garbage pickup, and provide 50% off the cable bill, access to a pool, gym, etc. We will still be responsible for other utilities, property taxes, insurance on our possessions, and interior maintenance. I sense that will come out to about the same.Medical/Health: We will continue our same insurance and I will start paying for Medicare but will have low or no copays as a result.Grocery: No change.Dog: This is uncontrollable.Cars: We are going to try having one car but our insurance will be higher and we will buy more gas at higher prices. Minimal if any savings.Communications: Cable a bit less? 2 cellphones instead of one.Life and Liability Insurance: At last a savings. We will drop life insurance once DH retires as then I would have a % of his pension guaranteed if he dies first.Bottom Line: Pretty much a wash but that is actually good news. We are moving to a much more expensive housing market and if we are able to buy where we intend, we can keep our costs from going up."},

Doing it himself may take up his weekends but it helps pay for the upcoming bath remodel. Retirement financial planning LOL.A house across the street from us sold the first week it was listed. Obviously priced to sell. The owners are in their mid-30s and trading in home ownership for an RV to travel the country full time.I have been doing regular home maintenance and the annual months of leaf raking have commenced.A week ago when as a Federal employee he was off for Columbus Day, we did take advantage of the typically lovely October weather and walk 4 miles on the Atlanta Belt Line. It is the month of the annual outdoor art show and the new pieces that were added to the permanent collection are fabulous.I really like this one that is under an street overpass.

Only thing left to decide is the color of new towels.3. We decided to do all the remaining interior painting ourselves (see cost of #1). We still have to decide about pressure washing & painting the fence and carport. The house trim must be done by professionals.4. We decided not to take advantage of a free place to stay to visit Asheville again. There is still my husband's uncle in hospice and the anticipated funeral in CA for him. Since we weren't taking the dog to Asheville the costs were adding up (see cost of #1).5. My husband is close to deciding to continue working until he turns 65 in late November. Although the house will still go up for sale April 1st and we will plan to move to CA when it is sold, he can work by a combination of working remotely and onsite visits. That will make health insurance transitions much simpler and be easy if the house takes a while to sell. He was hoping to contract back anyway.We are enjoying lovely Fall weather finally and plan a long walk to see an outdoor art exhibit this morning.Painting is ongoing. The study and upstairs bath ceiling touch ups are finished. The remainder of the repairs upstairs are done and paint purchased. Since it is a 3 day weekend for my husband he will be able to start painting too.I started cleaning the basement floor and bathroom.¬† It is just about time to start raking leaves and since that takes a long time due to our great tree coverage I am making no plans for next week beyond routine upkeep of home and yard.

Hubby has been diligently working on repairing cracks in the ceiling upstairs and next weekend will paint the ceiling in one room and some walls. I have been caught up in exhaustion from lousy sleep, yard work and other daily chores, meetings and lunches and just regular life in general.Speaking of life and its unexpected turns - we were shocked to learn this week that one of our DIL's father died suddenly. We are going to try to go to the funeral in CA so have cancelled our Asheville vacation. Then we learned that my husband's uncle is failing very quickly so that will be another attempted funeral trip to the other end of CA. The silver lining is seeing loved ones in both cases.We also have been learning and thinking about health care coverage once my husband retires. He has planned to retire at the end of May when he is still 64. I am 67 so I will have to pick up Medicare part B & D (or C) plus retiree coverage as my supplemental insurance at that time, but he will be on retiree coverage only for 5 months. We aren't quite sure how that would work especially with a planned move that makes us have to find all new doctors. More to learn. The bottom line though is that he is now considering continuing to work until he is past 65 so he would probably retire at the end of 2017. However we would still put the house on the market this Spring and move to CA once it closes. Then he would work from home and commute part of the time. It is all rather making our heads spin at the moment.On a happy note, our dog is back to her normal playful, active self. Medication changes plus and antibiotic for a suspected low grade UTI and she is bouncy again. She is also quite happy that she now gets canned food to try to help her put back on the weight she lost.I'm not going to set any goals for prepping the house for sale for next week since I seem to be doing other things at the moment.Have a great week."},

I'd have to answer no as I base the year's budget on last year's expenses and known increases in things like health and car insurance or property taxes.Some people keep separate online account \"envelopes\" to save in advance for the rare and/or unknown expenses that pop up be it car or dishwasher replacement, vet expenses or whatever. We keep general savings and investment accounts.This month's unbudgeted and unexpected/unplanned expenses have me wondering if that is the best approach once we are living on retirement income. Just yesterday it was a new car battery for our older car - $166 that was not included in the annual servicing & licensing budget. We do budget for poodle princess's monthly shot, meds, annual exam & grooming, but this month she had lots of tests and changes in meds and food - $718 and a substantial financial gift to elderly relatives who are struggling financially.I have no problem with any of those expenses and am happy we can afford them. However, I didn't really budget for any of them and I'm wondering if there is a change that would be helpful to try as I know our first year or so of living on retirement cash flow is going to take lots of adjusting and planning.Please share your ideas and experiences!"},

He is in California so there will be a funeral trip when he passes away.We also found out the results of yet another blood test on our dog. Her liver function was not looking as it should be despite medication changes so a bile test was done to pursue the possibility that she might have developed a liver shunt which causes the blood to not flow through the liver. She is down to 15 pounds from a steady 16.2 pounds - dropped it all in 2 weeks. However, this latest test showed normal results! So now they are thinking she may have a low grade UTI and will test for that this week. We bought her some chunky stew canned food and she gobbled it down so at least we can get her to eat more. Generally she is happy and spunky - much better than before her medication changes for her Addison's Disease."},

We gave up and just got soaked. She kept wanting to stop and shake and I wanted to keep going LOL. My husband met us at the door with towels and a hair dryer.I felt very alive.

The two unnecessary book shelves went to their new home. I had already donated the area rug and recliner that were in this room. I moved a rattan chair in from upstairs. We will hang a painting to add a bit more color or just leave the trio on the floor.2. Meanwhile my husband took down a giant bush that was dying and leaving only the stump for the tree service to deal with. We then decided that a whole long section of fencing on that side of the house was too decrepit to keep. No need to replace it fortunately and now it won't have to be painted. 3. I painted the feature wall in the family room. We centered the couch and painting as recommended by the stager and will remove most of the plants and small table when the house goes up for sale. Only 2 feature walls left to paint out of 5!4. We received near final design plans for the main floor bathroom remodel. Just a few questions to be answered and then it can go out for bids and we can select a contractor. By doing the work over the fall/winter holidays we will get a lower price.5. We met with the painting estimator as we know we will use the same firm we used before. Mostly outside work, but some difficult inside painting as well to be done by them. Waiting to receive bid.6. I went through our Christmas decorations and pulled out some things for donating. The Christmas decorations now fit into 2 plastic tubs I bought at a very low price from the Friends of the Library and they are ready for the move.I was interesting also to learn that what motivates my husband to make changes in the house now is a week countdown to listing the house plus subtraction of the weeks we will be gone to see family, the bath remodel work and painting work. All of those really reduce the time we have to do our part by 4 weeks for Hubby and 6 weeks for me. Made it feel a bit more real to him. He asked what he should work on next.Week 33 plans?- work on finding a home for the roll top desk- go through more drawers & cupboards to reduce our belongings further- sign off on bathroom remodel materials & request bids for work- obtain painting bid- start dismantling a flower bed that requires too much maintenance"},

These other items were delivered to charities:- large suitcase- cutting board- 13 cups and saucers- more clothing that doesn't fit or is outdated- a picture frame- a sound machine (waves, etc.)We made a decision to use our trip to CA for my FIL's 90th birthday in late February to meet with a realtor and see some current listings in our target area. We will interview, select and gather info from the realtor in advance. Timing of an actual purchase is still being figured out. Then we will go on to meet our granddaughter in person and I'll stay to help take care of her a few weeks.Week 34 has quite a few items from week 35 rolling over. - Meet with the painting estimator for exterior and interior work needing to be done by others.- Buy paint and paint the feature wall in the family room and touch up kitchen walls.- Call other charity re: roll top desk donation. If they won't take it then list it on Freecycle. If that doesn't work then it is on to putting it curbside perhaps.- Follow up with bathroom designer to get an appointment"},

There are just 2 nail holes and a tiny ding that are now filled and ready to spot paint.The downside of this project was that then I had to the clean kitchen sink and counters thoroughly after the above created a mess.I'm tired!

Recently objects to leave included an extra briefcase, large suitcase, a lamp, small end table, and an area rug.- We made a list of what we think needs to be painted on the exterior of the house and painting that needs doing by professionals inside. I'll set up an appointment to get the bid and discuss timing.Being a list maker I pretty much know everything that has to be done. So I've started another type of list.For each week I am going to have 4 goals related to this so I will have fewer \"to dos\" rattling in my brain.Week 35:- Finish sorting photos and go through family room storage unit Christmas stuff and hobby stuff that belongs to me- Make appointments with painting estimator and bath remodel designer- Discuss family room staging and buy paint for feature wall- Find a taker for the large roll top desk.

I don't want to give more credit to aging and menopause than is appropriate!Eating:I have been contemplating how my relationship to food was different when I weighed 20 pounds less. Yes I was 20 years younger and pre-menopause but I also ate differently as I recall.What we ate was very similar but there was very little snacking and definitely not the going out for coffee drinks and sweet desserts in the afternoon. I ate smaller portions - for example half a sandwich not a whole one with the same amount of meat, tomatoes, lettuce but half the bread. Going to think about this some  more and really think about portion sizes and servings per day in different food categories.I found this visual on portion sizes very helpful too. A sign of cultural changes perhaps that now protein portion size if represented by a cellphone instead of a deck of cards? Check it out here Visual food portion recommendationsDrinking:My husband and I talked about this and as we recall there was rarely alcohol in the house. Yes we would have a beer when out for Mexican food but not drink regularly like we do now.¬†Boredom & Stress:I've also realized with further thinking that I rarely ate when I was bored. I tended to go for a walk instead but then I lived in S. California which was more conducive to that than Atlanta often is. In fact I walked a lot back then.¬†I do recall feeling more stressed but boredom when near a refrigerator of coffee house is not being dealt with the same healthier habits.So what to do?¬†I am definitely focusing on portion sizes and healthier snacks. I am also trying to ramp up my exercise in the face of walking outdoors being unpleasant. I had been only going to Pilates once a week with minimal exercise except for short dog walks and daily activities otherwise.I am ramping up my use of my 30 minute gaiam stretching DVD. I tried the Wellness Center's stretch class but found the instruction lacking so back to the DVD.I am determined to become able to swim laps for exercise. I have only gone once and am going again this afternoon. Hard work and my stamina is low right now so actual swimming time is short. Should get better if I stick with it.I tried using light weights for upper arm exercises and need to do more of that.The big decision is coming up as to whether or not to continue my expensive private Pilates sessions. I do think they are beneficial but need to combine them with a lot more exercise if I am to get strong again."},

Keys to door locks we have replaced?I have been walking around the house trying to make sure there are no locks that I'm not seeing. You might think that is strange but it took me 4 examinations of my current car to figure out where I could plug in my cell phone! Who puts that almost under the emergency brake?So the getting ready to move efforts continue. A bit more paper to go through that requires my husband to make decisions about it and then on to photos.

My plan is to exercise in the afternoon instead of - well, reading and eating.I started yesterday afternoon by going to a class that started at 3:00. The class was much the same to the stretching DVD I have intended to follow each morning and didn't.The difference was that I laughed, visited with others and didn't eat cookies or cake at the coffee shop. I wrote down my weight and what I did to exercise in a log book.Today I will start lap swimming although I know from the past that I can't swim very long or far at this point.If I keep fully in mind that I am substituting behaviors in an attempt to change habits then perhaps this approach will work.

Make major decisions re bath remodel finishes. Put project out to bid.6. Keep being happy with my summer wardrobe of 33 items plus jewelry, exercise & yard work gear, and PJs.I have more than enough to wear with this wardrobe.7. Decide or at least research the best way to get rid of oak roll top desk.8. Decide if we are going to use the BBQ any more. If not, get rid of it and the propane tanks.9. Cook, cook and cook some more. Dinner out is going to be occasional.10.

Painting over the terracotta wall was harder and a lot more time consuming!¬†¬† A dresser in place of book shelves to make the room look larger and brighter.Smaller chair offers more contrast and visual interest.¬†We liked the colorful wall. Now the bed seems to need additional color. Oh well.¬†And the unchanged 4th wall.I've decided to join in with¬†Fiona and¬†Sue to track 30 days of \"chic\" living. The purpose of this is to log every day with the goals of:Awareness of what I‚Äôm doing each dayWhere I am placing my focus, andRemembering what I want to achieve.Here‚Äôs what I will be reporting on each day for thirty days:What I ateWhat I woreHow I moved my bodyWhat I readMy focus for the daySo here it goes!Day 1My focus for the day is more home sale preparation while taking conscious steps to improve my health and body and spending time with a friend.Eating: I have decided I really would like to be thinner and am looking back at my weight when we moved here 19 years ago. Since then I have gained about 19 pounds (at one point more) and I want to reverse the trend. I can't keep gaining a pound a year so I'm tracking what I eat using MyFitnessPal.com and it has revealed too many carbs and a bit too much sugar. My challenge is¬† finding healthy snacks that are filling especially in the afternoon!Today breakfast was shredded wheat cereal with 1/2 banana, 1/2 cup blueberries and unsweetened soy milk. Coffee too of course. Lunch was a tuna and tomato sandwich on rye with carrot sticks. Dinner was a glass of merlot, turkey burger, small servings of roasted cauliflower and steamed potato, and a green salad. Snacks were a fig bar and a non-fat latte. I drank more water than usual which is a strategy I am trying out.What I wore: It is going to be 96 F today and I'm going out with a friend for coffee so a loose blue knit dress with a scarf to add color and to combat the air conditioning at the coffee house. You can see that reddish bathroom that is next on the painting list in the background as well as a blue wall that is after that.How I moved my body: 30 minutes of stretching/core work, half a mile dog walk and then wall washing. I had to laugh because I was remembering the movie Karate Kid where he has the boy waxing a car to strengthen his arms and I did get arm exercise for sure.What I read: Mostly blogs and Facebook posts today. I did start a new mystery borrowed from the library."},

{"title": "Would you move to a 55+ community?", "date": "Monday, June 6, 2016", "text": "We are contemplating moving into a 55+ active retirement community and that is a surprise to me!Our relocation plans post-retirement have always been to move back to S. California which still remains the plan. What is complicating the decision about where to live is the competitive rental and purchase market there, our first grandchild due to arrive in N. California in November and the impossible to know fact of how long my 89 year old FIL will live (hopefully a long time).Best case scenario right now would be to rent homes in both S and N CA but the cost and competitiveness of the market makes that impossible we think. We do need a place to move to and be comfortable.¬† So right now our primary reason to move to S CA is to be close to my FIL who lives in a retirement home/assisted living facility. The bonus is that we would be closer to my older son and DIL and at least in the same state as the other son, DIL and new grandbaby. As we try to wrap our minds around how to make this move work as well for us as it can, we run into some key decision points.The first was where to live geographically in S CA. It is a large and expensive housing market. We are used to the areas near and in Pasadena where we used to live and where one son and DIL now live. That would put us an hour drive from my FIL though. So we have been thinking that if he is our \"job\" then we should live where the commute would be short. We would only see our son and DIL on some weekends anyway. I also really want to live where there are abundant opportunities to make new friends. This reasoning let us to consider a 55+ community.On our last vacation we toured Leisure Village in Camarillo, CA with a cousin who is renting a home there and to our surprise we really liked it. The homes are mostly smaller but no yard work, reduced maintenance responsibilities, lots of recreational options (pool, gym, wood shop, billiards, clubs, golf, etc.) and the location is both near my FIL and the beach. Rentals are scarce and competitive though especially if you have a dog which we do. There are about 10 units for sale right now and buying one would ensure us of a place to live. But who knows how long we would need to live there vs moving to N CA to be a regular part of that soon to be grandchild's life.Lots of research to do as the reality is that my FIL's life span is totally unpredictable. We could be there 10+ years or a day.These are some of what we still need to know to make a decision on whether this is the right next step for us:- Are the units selling near list price or is there a bidding war as there is elsewhere in S CA?- How long are they taking to sell?- If we couldn't sell or the market went down drastically, what is the return or cost of turning it into a rental?- In addition to the HOA fee, what would it cost to own a unit? - What rentals are available and how would we secure one?Next vacation to S CA that is planned is a 90th birthday celebration for my FIL in February so this research needs to be done before then so we could actually look at units while there to have a better sense of the variation in space, etc. I will also be researching other options including how to make the 2 home scenario work!Do you live in a 55+ community or would you seriously consider doing so? -"},

{"title": "Why we are spending money and effort on preparing house for sale", "date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2016", "text": "We last sold a house 19 years ago. It was a down market, but we were moving for a job so we followed our realtor's advice on repainting the exterior and doing a bit of staging. It was a charming house in a desirable location and sold before the sign went up for more than we hoped to get.Wish we had kept it as a rental because it is now worth at least 3 times as much being in the hot Los Angeles market that we are moving back to and I would love to be able to just move back into it! But we didn't.We do however have our current house to put up for sale on April 1st. The general location is desirable but the house is old and buyers here generally prefer brand new ones. Right now it is a seller's market for this neighborhood, but still some older homes languish on the market and who knows what next Spring's market will be.We own this house so it is one of our major assets and we want to get as much for it as we can to help finance post-retirement living in a much more expensive housing market for our hopefully long lives.Since we know we are moving upon my husband's retirement we have the luxury of time to prepare the house and not make try to do everything in the month before the sign goes up. That also lets us make unhurried decisions about what we will move across the country (the list is shrinking LOL).Like many people, we put effort into making this house our home. That means the colors, furnishings and amount of stuff works for us. It doesn't necessarily work for potential buyers.My SIL who lives in the NE told me earlier this week about a friend of hers who is agonizing over whether or not to buy a particular house and being that they live in a tight housing market there aren't a lot of choices. The sticking point seemed to be the amount of repainting that would have to be done to neutralize the all the colorful rooms - rose red, shades of green, etc.So back to taking our realtor's advice along with much of the stager's advice. Buyers in our market want neutral colors so they can visualize their furniture fitting into the house. They want move in ready homes even if they end up changing the house before they move in LOL. They want space and light, but our house is a 1941 style of smaller rooms and not an open floor plan. They have trouble visualizing their stuff and lifestyle in a house filled with another person's stuff and lifestyle.We picked our realtor because the people in our area who follow her advice sell their houses fairly quickly for a decent price regardless of market conditions. We will be paying a lot of commission for her advice, experience and effort so we are listening to her. I am also taking the reasoning behind the stager's advice and customizing it to what we own and how we need to live in the next 10 months before the For Sale sign goes up and while the house is on the market.I am hoping that by preparing about a room a month that when the For Sale sign goes up we can put our energy into finding a rental in our new location and the logistics of the actual move!So time, effort and money are being spent now decluttering, depersonalizing, making sure the paint is a neutral color, and trying not to buy much to freshen the house decor that we don't want to take with us. The house won't feel like us or reflect our personalities much by the time we are done, but hopefully it will sell quickly for a good price. In the meantime my husband goes to work, we do all the routine yard and home maintenance, go on vacation/visit family, entertain, go out, have house guests, play with the dog, read, volunteer, exercise, and generally live our lives.Although I am writing about the process of downsizing and moving in your mid-sixties it is not consuming our daily life and I hope to keep it that way except for the actual move and getting settled at the other end of this journey!"},

I agreed to a contract with a designer for the main floor bathroom. I will have an initial meeting with her on this Tuesday.2. Arranged a delivery date and target installation date for the 2 replacement windows for the sun porch.3. Settled on how to clean painted walls, trim & doors so as to minimize repainting. Magic eraser for scuff and other marks. One cup white vinegar in a bucket of water with a microfiber cloth to wash walls and old hand towel to dry them.4. The hallway walls are washed and they just need a tiny touch up. The ceiling needs a drywall tape crack fixed in one place. Let's not talk about all the nicks in the baseboard and the lower edges of the doors.5. We moved the bookshelves & excess chair out of the guest room and into the study. I will advertised them as available.6. Washed the 3 neutral walls in the guest room - no need to repaint! The feature wall will have to be painted.7. Washed the guest room curtains and rehung covering as little of the windows as possible. Moved the extra dresser that was in the study into the guest room as suggested by the stager.Next I need to decide what kind of bedding to get if any, what to hang on the wall over the dresser and whether or not to include a small rattan chair in the guest room. I also have to wash and paint the feature wall the same color as the rest of the walls. The windows and closet also need attention. My goal is to be done with this room before the end of June.But first, I need to get ready for house guests over Memorial Day weekend!"},

We shocked ourselves by considering doing the same.The stressful part is the difficulty of deciding where to try to live and the new knowledge of how competitive the rental market is in both ends of the state. Our cousin was one of 14 applicants for the unit he is renting and got it because he doesn't have a dog and everyone else did - we do have a dog!I am looking at our house with fresh eyes after being gone for 11 days and I know we really need to update the bathroom.

This is good as you want your home to look as spacious and light as possible to potential buyers.We did decide to redo the main floor bathroom so that is on the to do list for sure.I found a table cloth we don't use that will make an attractive crate cover. Much better than a striped beach towel!While on vacation next week we will be driving by houses that are currently for rent in one of our targeted areas. We are slowly narrowing down where to look for housing in the huge Southern California area. I think it will help if we decide our new \"jobs\" are frequently spending time with and helping my FIL while our sons and DILs will be who we drive to see. After all the 4 of them work all week!I am being sure to get receipts for all of our donated items and logging them into Itsdeductible.comas this will be our highest income year for a while and maximizing our deductions just makes so much sense.We have let parts of the yard get away from us the last couple of years which is easy to do with the crazy growing season we have here in the South.

The exception is a small outdoor table purchased for half price at RiteAid¬† ($13). The stager had recommended a 2 chair cafe set for the courtyard but the least expensive one I found that we were willing to keep was $99 plus tax at Ikea. We have 4 outdoor chairs and a larger table and umbrella so 2 can go in the courtyard and 2 at the table on the patio.I followed the recommendations to move the black bench in front of the soon to be replaced windows and decided to add two more chairs to make a conversation area.

{"title": "Session with home stager", "date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2016", "text": "We are listing our house in 11 months and moving across the country. We currently live in Atlanta so some of these observations may be for this housing market and not for yours. Keep in mind that our part of town mostly attracts young high dual income professionals as well as some older professors, lawyers and doctors.It was very interesting to spend 2 hours going through our house with a home stager and getting her advice as to what we need to do to maximize the appeal of our house without buying a lot or spending a lot of money. I have 3 1/2 pages of notes. She said some things that I think are key to getting any home ready to sell.1. Don't confuse interior design with home staging! There is nothing wrong with how you prefer to decorate your home but the typical buyer reacts well to certain things that you may not prefer to live with.2. Maximize the light in your home. Extend curtain rods so that curtain panels fall to the outside of the window frame so as much light comes in as¬† possible.3. Light colored neutrals are the in paint and decor colors. Graphic design accents in darker neutrals are also in. So with dark furniture add light throw pillow. Pull up dark area rugs. Paint your walls light neutral colors and accent walls are definately out! (Sorry honey - I like them too).4. Don't be afraid of empty space. You may want those tables, chairs, etc. for the way you live but deleting some will make your home more appealing to potential buyers.5. Bookshelves are also out. Minimize and only keep what you will move or put those books and bookshelves in storage.6. Simple decorative accents help. A single item on display per shelf. A single bowl with boxwood balls on a coffee table.7. Make all of your indoor and outdoor spaces look appealing for someone else's lifestyle. This is called staging for a reason. Move furniture around to better showcase your home even if it doesn't fit with your lifestyle.Or course there was the standard advice about removing personal photos in frames or on the frig. Clear the kitchen counter as much as possible. Don't storethings in spaces that don't reflect there use - e.g. no turkey roaster in the guest room closet. Declutter or pack and store offsite. Paint/pressure wash/repair the outside of your home thoroughly.She did not say we needed to change our artwork or make major changes in decor. Apparently though empty houses with a few staged rooms are popular with buyers - so if we want to move out and then sell - Hah hah!!!!We still haven't decided if we are going to renovate the main floor bathroom so I asked her for some ideas on how to stage it if we don't. Wisdom would be doing it though and we will have to make that decision after we get back from vacation in mid-May. We also have to decide how much of the interior painting to do ourselves vs. pay to have it done."},

We need to replace 2 large windows in our sun porch as the seal is broken and they are cloudy. Weird size and need to match to other windows and we had to go high end sash replacements. Also learned that since the are near the floor the code requires tempered glass in the bottom sash. Ordered and that is done.2. We do have almost a year to get the house ready so we have decided to pay for a stager to give us recommendations now instead of after we sign the sales contract. That way we can look for bargains and do some of the work ourselves such as painting. It will be interesting to hear what she recommends on this coming Monday.3. We know we have to remodel the main floor bathroom and really don't want to - sigh. We will be hiring an interior designer to help pick out the finishing materials as of course we need an odd sized vanity and countertop, etc.We haven't even gotten to the cost of painting the outside of the house, yard and tree prep, etc. I hope next Spring is a seller's market here!Any advice or hard learned lessons from others who have been through this recently are greatly appreciated."},

Great progress as we only kept things that have a high likelihood of being used in the next year.We also pulled a bunch of toxic waste from the basement shelves and shed. It may be easier where you live, but in my county we can only dispose of toxic waste properly twice a year and e-waste once a year (perhaps). Luckily I thought to look up when the next toxic waste collection day is going to be and it is on April 30th. We will have to do it one more time, but this is a good start.If you are like us and have lived in your home quite a few years and done quite a few projects there is a collection of partially used toxic products in your home. You can't move any of it unless you are moving yourself and even then it would be potentially dangerous unless just driving across town.We also are getting serious about making decisions regarding what home improvements we are willing to make before listing the house.

These habits often got translated and expanded to the next generations and as our homes also expanded in size and/or we started worrying about the likelihood of income loss due to job loss or retirement, we acquired even more.Instead of acting on the healthier FOMO activities of travel, expanding friendship circles, learning new skills or other ways to avoid the fear of missing out, we may have stocked up on material goods. Even someone like me who hates clutter and tries hard to keep everything organized (its my obsession, sorry) succumbed to stockpiling toiletries, buying the same clothing item in multiples and other things related to FORO.It was easier not to do when there were 4 of us living in a house half the size of the one now occupied by just 2 of us. As an aside, it is interesting to me that both my sons and DILs live in homes much smaller than ours although they do like their stuff too.I have been quietly working on breaking the FORO habit. Toothpaste? It is always readily available and really doesn't cost much so 1 in use and one as back up is certainly more than enough. Garbage bags? Put that on the list when the stock gets low (although perhaps I let it get too low this week but recycled grocery bags will fill the gap).This isn't a storage issue for us but for me it is a mindset issue. I have plenty. More than enough stuff to be honest.What I need more in my life is not stuff. Rather it is travel, friends, learning and health. A work in progress."},
{"title": "  Evaluation: February wardrobe additions - one month and a year or more ago", "date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2016", "text": "Apparently I don't shop for clothing in the winter!In 2015 I bought exactly one item in February - a warm hat. I like it, I wear it when it is quite cold, etc.This year I did one thrifting expedition in February and came away with 5 items for $26.- 2 pairs of Columbia shorts for walking in hot weather that of course haven't been worn yet ($4).- A long sleeve graphic t-shirt that I experimented with altering and will probably not be wearing ($3).- A charcoal cardigan that I have worn 3 times ($15). I like the shape and warmth but missed some design features I am not sure about. We'll see how much it gets worn next winter.- Lastly, an orange silk shell that is again an alteration project that is in process ($3).I ended up with some needed shorts, a better fitting cardigan to replace an old one and some refashioning projects to keep me entertained. Good value for the money LOL. For March my priority is to find a new pair of athletic/walking shoes. So far 3 pairs have gone back to Amazon. I do hate shoe shopping but will not settle for something that is not comfortable any more! I'd also like to start finding warm weather clothes to add to or replace my current sparse collection.One thing I have learned in paying more attention to my wardrobe this year is that I tend to wear almost everything I own. I am slowly letting go of the items I don't wear. For example, my younger son was married 4 years ago this coming May. I bought a nice dress, shoes and formal bag for the event. I never wore them again. They are being donated for prom season shopping this year. Someone can be delighted to find them as a bargain.The other thing I have learned is that I need to find stores that carry clothing that fits me and my lifestyle. Thrift shopping has been fun for experimenting and finding some nice items but too often I'm not fully satisfied with what I have bought.Right now I am working with a list of needed and wanted items and limiting myself to buying those. We'll see how my warm weather wardrobe shapes up!"},

Two PT visits and follow up exercises got me to the point where I could.Then my husband got sick and the antibiotics prescribed aren't working or at least not quickly enough. Vacation cancelled and all travel plans and arrangement reversed including the one night prepaid non-refundable hotel room. Boo.Is there any silver lining in this?- We have a credit with Southwest Airlines that we have until December 19th to use. We certainly will make this trip before then.- I can go to PT this coming week and finish fixing up my neck/spine.- Hubby will get in to see a doctor early in the week and we can start trying to find a fix for his illness.- I'll have time to see if I can do this year's taxes myself using last year's corrected ones as a template. Our state lets people over 62 exclude interest income and I didn't know that! If I can't do it I have time to research whether to buy software or send to the accountant who spotted the error and did 3 prior year's amended returns too. Now that was a good return on investment.- Everyone was very kind, loving and gracious about our upending their plans too. Thanks kids, FIL, BIL, and dog sitter extraordinaire!"},

Enter my wonderful Physical Therapist who made space for me on her calendar yesterday and today in hopes that I can get on an airplane on Tuesday without lots of pain. I like pain free travel and family visits don't you?So what is the problem? My spinal facet joints have grabbed bits of tissue and are grinding them when I move - facet joint impingement it is called. What was most interesting to me was the fact that I even have facet joints (Spine Universe) which are what connects the vertebrae together and run along the sides of your spine.Lots of improvement after the first PT session and I am hoping for more after today's. Then I hope my tendency to be very diligent about doing the assigned PT exercises will help me be pain free or at least minimal."},
{"title": "For Mette - the 4 brooches I own", "date": "Tuesday, February 2, 2016", "text": "Mette (The yogastic shopping planner) asked for photos of my brooches and here they are. This little wooden seahorse belonged to my Mom and she passed it on when I was a teenager. Special meaning but rarely worn.The next one was very hard to photograph as it is so sparkly! Blue stones and multi finish metals. Recently purchased from Etsy as a vintage item.Another vintage one from an Etsy dealer and it really matches my love of complexity and design.The last one is also vintage but more traditional looking and shiny not in a fun way. This is the one I'm not sure I am going to keep although today I used it to pin a long scarf in place so it may be a keeper after all! Sorry the photos aren't better but I am still learning how to navigate Windows 10 and can't find my photo editor!The ongoing challenge of trying to remake my wardrobe. This January I spent $67 and picked up several things with mixed results. I was also surprised at how little cold weather we had and it looks like February will also be unusually warm.¬† Tops I am short. Most tops are too long. Some of these fall in that category, but while the first 2 look ok and all fill a need to stay warm I'm not sure about the third. Olive sweater (Eddie Bauer)¬†- $12 thrifted; 3 wears¬†¬†- I love how this looks on. Here I cozied it up with a vest,¬†scarf and hiking boots that were keeping my feet warm on our first real winter day.Wine tweed cowl sweater (Charter Club)¬†- $14 thrifted; 2 wears - I was looking for an oversized acrylic sweater that was right for our colder days and there it was! Perfect.Stone tweed zip cardigan - $13 thrifted; 2 wears - I¬†have removed the zipper and washed & dried it so far so it is smaller now. I need to play with this more as I think it is too straight and long and makes me look frumpy. I'm going to try fastening it with a brooch to see if that helps. It is warm though it may have to move on to someone else's closet.Mauve 3/4 sleeve top - $4 thrifted; 0 wears¬†- I'm not so sure about the color of this as it may be too muted for me. I am in the process of shortening it. Will see how it works out in warmer weather.Bottoms Gray corduroy pants - $4 thrifted; 0 wears¬†- I was eyeing a similar pair on Macy's website that were on sale for $23 but then stopped by a thrift store on a day where everything was 40% off. Had to hem them and they are lower rise than I prefer but .... how great is that since I only will wear them 1 or 2 months a year. Now that they are hemmed it has gotten much warmer of course with a high for today of 71!AccessoriesArtsy mixed metal and bead brooch - $13 Etsy vintage; 2 wears¬†- This was a great find. Fits my evolving style and makes me smile.Silver leaf broach - $7 Etsy vintage; 0 wears - I don't like this now that I have received it so it is going into the donate pile.Years past January purchases:Indigo down jacket - 2015; $60 on sale - Great purchase. This is one of those down jackets that packs into a small bag and I love it. Perfect for much of our cooler weather, travels well, and goes with everything. I wore it last February on the ferry from Oakland to San Francisco as shown here with my husband and younger son.Charcoal zip vest - 2012 I think; about $20¬†-¬† Another great purchase. I've pretty much worn this to death but it is still ok for casual wear. I'm going to have to find a replacement in the next 2 years."},

Sometimes an addition of peanut butter. Oatmeal is the one breakfast food that keeps me from getting hungry before lunch. So this morning it is microwaved oatmeal, half a banana and 1 tablespoon of peanut butter with soy milk.I've finished off my financials for 2015 and am delighted that we saved 35.5% of our income!

Looking at it this way, we did great.I did splurge a bit on the dog yesterday - replaced the 5 year old pad in her crate. A bit needed although she does love her crate for naps even with the old pad. The old one will be back up for a while as I do wash them. I couldn't remember the brand and had cut off the tag so I went back to the (expensive) pet store we bought it at the day we adopted her. They were just getting a shipment unloaded from a truck and there was exactly what I wanted in that load. I also got her more of her Harry Barker prickly pear shampoo + conditioner so I wouldn't need to order it online. Don't you love the brand name? Today is finally a brisk weather day with no rain!

Thanks Jeanine.(1) If you could write the story you'd like to live in next year, what would you want to have happen?I want 2016 to be a year of being the best I can be each day. That means being the best person I can be in each relationship, eating¬†the best foods, making¬†the best decisions daily, looking my best, doing my best in each activity, making the best use of my time and so on. (2) What title would you give this new story?Doing My Best Each Day¬†(3) How can you weave current or expected challenges into the story but include their resolution or a way to deal with them that does not prevent the story you want to create?Ah, the biggest challenge will be my history of not doing the things I listed. Not creating new habits that support what I say I want, but rather developing ones that reinforce what I say I don't want. The need to substitute different activities for my current¬†time wasters. The challenge of reaching out for friendship. Upping my energy and activity level. If this was a paid job I would just do it and do it well.

I'm still delaying collecting social security so that it will increase as I am betting on a long life. My parents lived to 88 and 92 and I want to maximize those payments as an inflation hedge. I'll start collecting some time after DH stops working full time in 2017.2015¬†expenses- Our cars cost us 3.6% less than 2014. Insurance was up but gasoline and licenses were down.- Clothing and haircuts were up 49.8% as I redid my wardrobe.- Phones, cable and other communications up 3.6% mostly due to cable bundle increases.- Contributions were down 14.36% and dog costs down 27.7% as she did not have any illnesses beyond her routine care.- Groceries, alcohol, household supplies and toiletries were up 8.5%- Gifts were down 24.3% as we made no large cash gifts in 2015.- Health care costs and housing costs (maintenance, insurance¬†and property taxes mostly) were up 27.4% and 24.7% respectively.- We cancelled my life insurance so life and excess liability insurance costs went down 28.9%.- Recreation costs were down 22.52% due to decreased travel costs.- Taxes were up 14.8% as we paid more realistic estimated taxes after a year of refunds due to filing amended tax returns to correct our ignorance of state tax laws for those over 60.So overall, our expenses went up 5.25% which is not sustainable given current returns on investments. 2016 Expense expectationsOur health insurance cost has increased by 8.8% and our share of the cost of prescriptions and treatment has gone up as well. I am expecting our car insurance, homeowners insurance, life insurance and property taxes to increase in the 10% - 20%¬†range each. I imagine Comcast will raise their rates as well.What will go down? Car licenses. Gifts. Travel costs if we only go to California as we now have family guest rooms to use at both locations. My clothing costs as I am committed to buying fewer items. Books, hobbies, classes - all $0 as I plan no spending there. I can try to reduce or maintain our spending on food but costs have¬†been rising and healthy eating is important. Dog care, health related items, home repair, gasoline, etc. are all pretty much out of my control as they are necessary and I have to pay what they cost. We will likely start doing some pre-sale improvements as well although those may not start until 2017. We will make one major furnishings purchase of a new mattress and bedding. Research is necessary for that one! I will continue to pay for Pilates sessions as a health investment. I want to take one vacation that is not a family visit so that will be added in. We haven't decided where it will be¬†yet but probably in the US. We will keep going out to eat occasionally but have decreased that in the last couple of months as several of our favorite restaurants have closed.Income expectationsMy husband is federal employee and they are to get a 1% raise. He will get a yet to be determined bonus based on performance evaluation. The annuity payments I inherited from my parents will end after October's payment.

I know that there are only 30 days in December but I'm challenging myself from November 30th through January 3rd to get in those 5 weeks and hopefully set some new habits.Mind: - Read one non-fiction book a week so I can learn something. I'm in the middle of a history of the British Women's Institute right now and it is interesting. I also have a travel book we bought duirng a museum visit last week and need to get going on it.- Go to a free Christmas chamber music concert. - Cook something new to take to my book club Christmas party. I'm thinking a great hor dourves dish or perhaps cranberry almond biscotti to use up ingredients in my pantry. Or even both?Body: - Use my stretching DVD at least 4 times a week and do not pay for stretch classes. I started November 30th!- Walk the dog every day. (0.75 miles)- Take one urban hike each week. I have mapped two routes. One is 2.5 miles. The other is 4.25 miles.- Pilates session each week. If my trainer is off for vacation be sure to schedule with someone else.Money: - See how long we can go without eating out! We had a great time including eating out a fair bit during our Thanksgiving week staycation and family visit. I am usually the one who suggests we go out so I am the one who needs to do better at¬†planning to eat at home. - Do not buy any books.¬†I have started a list of ones to request inter-library loan.- Order Christmas gifts from kids lists and have shipped directly to them or send checks.- Stick to no clothes shopping. My one exception is a pair of sweatpants if I find ones I really like.- Order debit cards for each of us. - Check husband's SS statement. - Get free credit reports and read carefully. What are your goals for the month?"},

There was only one day when I wore house/yard work clothing all day but I changed for an evening out so that equals 30 different outfits. That evening out convinced me that the top didn't fit right and it is in the donate pile along with a blouse that has the same problem. Life is too short to wear clothing that is bothersome to wear.I didn't take any photos during week 4 as we were busy enjoying a visit from a son and DIL. By the last 2 days of the month I was making combinations I hadn't worn before and I enjoyed them both. What I have realized this past month is that I stick with the same clothing combinations and need to mix it up more to fully utilize my existing wardrobe and not get bored.During the month I wore 50 clothing items: 18 tops, 9 pairs of pants, 10 toppers, 4 scarves, 4 belts, & 5 pairs of shoes. I used the same purse each day. In addition I wore 17 pieces of jewelry, 5 different coats, 2 pairs of gloves and one hat. Our high temps fluctuated wildly from in the mid 70s to the high 30s making a month of layering and really two different seasonal wardrobes. That helped with making 30 outfits though.Here are the outfits from¬†the last 2 days to finish out November. The photo quality has the colors¬†a bit off but I like both outfits.I am going to keep working on new combinations from my existing wardrobe but not document them anymore.

The Ponce City Market is a converted Sears distribution center building that is now a high end food court and shopping with apartments on the other floors.

Then to dinner theatre at¬†The Shakespeare Tavern to see The Tempest. Wow that is one busy, energetic, many character play! There was much dialogue, singing, dancing, and a sprite doing gymnastics hanging in the air like Cirque de Solei performers.

{"title": "Remembering my Dad", "date": "Thursday, November 12, 2015", "text": "Yesterday was Veteran's Day and I thought about my Dad a lot. His 3 years of service in the Army Air Corp during WWII left him assigned to an air base in Alaska where he was so bored that he asked to be transferred to a bomber crew in the European theater. His tour of duty on that bomber based in England¬†targeted Germany mostly but also some targets in other countries. He was the flight engineer, but his pilot thought every crew member should be able to fly the plane so he taught him how to fly. Later in life he found great joy in flying a sailplane (glider) as a hobby.Dad's¬†diary of that time was matter of fact, but included things like \"plane down on left; no chutes\". He didn't expect to live through his tour of duty and that was a realistic appraisal of the odds. His whole crew made it through even though their tour was extended for more missions. The only crew fatality was a man who was subbing on a different crew and plane the day he died. Dad had close calls - a piece of shrapnel hitting him in the head on one of the days he actually wore his helmet and having to lean out of the plane in mid-air to close the bomber bay doors by hand.¬†Afterwards he was sent to a rest camp in the N. Carolina mountains so I presume he was diagnosed with shell shock. Who wouldn't have been suffering from that. He then was assigned to a trainer role in Illinois where he met my Mom at a USO dance and they married shortly in Texas where he was later based before he was discharged after Armistice Day.He was a quiet and gentle man who did what needed to be done without complaining.¬†He wasn't a paragon of course. Rather introverted and a perfectionist which was both a strength and a characteristic that was a challenge for my brother especially as I got the emphasis of my Mom's perfectionism more. My parents sort of divided up their 2 children - Mom spent more time with me and Dad more with my brother - when he wasn't working 6 days a week. One thing I was always confident about was that my Dad would take care of us. I have lots of good memories of special times with him¬†and knew I could totally count on his love and support.He had¬†lots of artistic talent that he was pursuing pre-war and then was unable to pursue until he retired and took up pastels and excelled at portraits. From photos he did portraits of his grandparents and my Mom's parents.Pre-war¬†Pre-war¬†Ôªø¬†Post-retirement pastels of his maternal grandparents¬†ÔªøHe lived to 88 despite lots of cardiovascular challenges which he tackled head on with multiple surgeries (quadruple bypass, carotid artery, abdominal aneurysm, pacemaker, etc.) and medication. When he learned that no more medical intervention could keep him alive he faced dying with his usual courage and went into hospice care where he only accepted morphine but no liquids or food.I did not really appreciate and understand him until I was in my 50s. What I have taken from him as a role model is profound for me. Live in the present. Face challenges with determination and a problem solving approach. Be happy that you are alive and woke up this morning. Love your family with all of your heart. Be kind."},

Our older son and DIL are such fun to be with and I am really looking forward to their visit Thanksgiving week.- Shrimp cocktail- Stuffed turkey breast¬†- I leaned that the Whole Foods butcher will bone and flatten the meat for us making it easy to assemble this turkey roll- Cranberry orange sauce - just substitute maple syrup for white sugar and we are good here- Savory mashed sweet potato- Green beans with lemon- Apple pie with almond and cashew crust- White wine* Had a lovely long lunch out with a friend. We also tried a new restaurant and had a really great time catching up on each others lives.* Made myself let go of some more clothing that I don't love at all. A donation to the animal rescue thrift shop. I haven't made any progress on yard work as it has been raining a lot and our yard waste was not picked up on trash day. This is the first time in 18 1/2 years that the sanitation crew didn't finish the route or come back the next day. I did call but it is still sitting there.

{"title": "No Repeat November - Week 1 of Shopping my Closet", "date": "Sunday, November 8, 2015", "text": "As you know, my lifestyle is super casual and I have been working on getting my colors and outfit shapes to be more flattering.I've set some rules for myself in addition to not repeating¬†outfits.- Only items of clothing count as the outfit. Accessories (shoes, scarves, jewelry, purse) and coats are repeatable.- Outfits must use only my colors as determined by the fabulous Imogen Lamport during my 7 Steps to Style program participation. - They also must fall in line with my style inspiration which is California wine country casual - translated to Atlanta weather.- I can stretch the boundaries on my medium value contrast and low medium color contrast just a bit.- My only allowed clothing purchases should I happen to find the right items are smart casual slacks and shoes and possibly a fedora to go with my trench coat.I'm still finding it hard to figure out the right combos that help me feel and look vibrant, but have settled on a few things. - There always must be vibrant color for my top or topper. The rest should be neutrals or monochromatic in color.- I need the benefit of shaped clothing on top- One significant accessory is usually enough for me so it is a necklace, statement earrings or scarf, etc. but not together. Small earrings work with other things though.- I really need to do some dedicated shoe shopping to find more pairs of comfortable shoes given the ongoing foot pain I am experiencingHere are the results for week 1.These were my favorites and the first two got the most compliments from the facebook style group that I participate in. I think I like the complexity of the shapes and/or design of the fabric as well as the vibrant colors.The winner!¬†¬†I even got a compliment from the librarian.¬†This was the¬†2nd favorite.¬†I also liked these as well - same top with different cardigans and jewelry.¬†¬†¬†I'd rate these as average & need to figure out what to do differently or not wear them again LOL.¬†¬†I will not repeat this one!¬†I keep re-learning that I always need color in my outfits.

{"title": "Looking back - Moving forward", "date": "Friday, November 6, 2015", "text": "In just over¬†18 months¬†my husband can retire with a pension and then we will sell our home and move across the country back to California. I am going to use the next year to prepare myself and our home for these changes as much as I can by myself. Then we will hit preparation hard together.First I want to look back at our¬†California life and style of almost 20 years ago and see what I would like to recapture right now as well as when we move back.- I liked being out and about more. We lived outdoors much more than we do in Atlanta as the weather and our home were very conducive to that.¬†I walked most mornings for exercise, we hiked and biked and generally were more physically active. Part of that was being 18 1/2 years younger as well as having active young teen and young¬†adult children living with us, but it was mostly that our environment encouraged it. - I liked being thinner.¬†I weighed somewhere around 115 - 118 instead of the 133 I weigh now. Again, I was younger and hadn't reached menopause BUT I see women my age who have managed to stay thin. They probably don't eat muffins, biscotti and cookies LOL. Losing 5 pounds would be great; 10 would be amazing.- I liked that we spent more time having fun with friends and family and a lot less time watching TV or reading. We seem to have hunkered down by ourselves on a daily basis these past 10 years or so.- I liked that we had a less stuff in a smaller home that housed more people as well as a larger dog. We¬†spent less time cleaning and¬†did less home maintenance. A larger home and yard with more stuff is harder with each year that passes. My husband remarked recently that it is amazing that we have kept up with this house and yard for 18 1/2 years as we do most of the work ourselves.- I was out and about more doing meaningful things not just running errands and that was better. True, I was working at a professional career, but still I did a lot of other things and¬†wasted less time. So what changes can I make in the next few months to start living more like that again?Exercise¬†daily rain or shine, hot or cold!!! Preferably getting outdoors but inside if the weather is too inclement. - A long challenging walk, Pilates session or a stretch or strength video inside. - I want¬†to include a strength workout 3 times a week - Pilates counts as one time. I need to rearrange the study so that it is easy to do this early in the morning without bothering my husband. - If a weekend has decent weather take an urban hike together.- If I need to acquire clothing to make outdoor exercising¬†easier then do so. Develop eating habits that will reduce my weight to what it was when we moved here 18 1/2 years ago.¬†I read that to lose 1 pound a month you need to cut about 250 calories a day. Half will be exercise and so that leaves cutting 120 calories a day from my diet each day. I should be able to do that.Invite friends to dinner/brunch or out to lunch.Seriously Marie Kondo my own stuff using her method. Encourage Hubby to do the basement and shed jointly so those aren't such a big chore closer to selling the house."},

I'm not including coats, shoes or purses as those are few in my closet and used to be functional or blend mostly.Want to have fun and join in?This has been a good exercise as I've seen what items I really want to wear. Going forward I'm putting all the clothing I may wear in the fall/winter together as I like to layer and our weather varies wildly.

Once my wardrobe capsule¬†is workable then I can just replace pieces or add a piece that fits a true new need.During these 10 days I added¬†4 items (tangerine scarf, orange & blue scarf, blue cardigan, indigo trench) and subtracted¬†3 items (black top, walking shoes, black purse) this week as I wasn't wearing the first and the others are vacation/exercise specific.

The jeans were on sale at Macy's and the tops are like new from my favorite consignment store. I've ordered a variety of shoes to try on at home to replace worn out ones. I made sure they had free returns and have my fingers crossed. That should be the end of my clothes shopping for a while."},
{"title": "Ongoing thriftiness ", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2015", "text": "Often I don't think about the things we do that¬†help us build our retirement nest egg while enjoying eating out, travel, Pilates, movies & theater,¬†and other pricier things. Instead I have mostly focused on our pre-tax retirement accounts from work and the money I inherited. We are very fortunate that at this point we are able to plan and spend on what we enjoy¬†while still saving for the future. Of course it helps that we aren't into buying the latest cars, d√©cor, etc.I think once we are retired,¬†that these small thrifty things along with our use it a long time & keep it in good repair philosophy¬†is what is going to keep the money going for the rest of our lives especially since we are moving to a more expensive housing, insurance and general cost of living area. As I've mentioned we come from long living families and hopefully have a lot of years ahead of us to finance and enjoy!Some of the things we do routinely are listed below. What do you do that I could add to our habits? Where do you get your inspiration for living a full life while managing your assets?Clothing:- Wash laundry in cold water, buy inexpensive laundry soap on sale and use white vinegar as softener- When shopping for new clothes for myself I start with consignment/thrift store, then discount store (Tuesday Morning, Marshalls, etc.), then lower cost department stores and finally higher cost ones but watching for sales.- Mending/alterations are done by meFood:- Hubby takes lunch to work almost every day and I eat lunch at home now that I am retired unless I am having lunch out with a friends- We cook dinner together most nights going out about once every week or 10 days- Make bread crumbs out of bread ends, freeze overripe bananas for banana bread later, make chicken stock from carcass and generally minimize food waste- Use coupons and/or shop sales for items I would buy anywayUtilities including phones:- Turn off lights when not being used-¬†Keep thermostat setting as high/low as possible in summer/winter - I keep a spreadsheet of our electricity, gas and water usage which enabled me to see a few years ago that there was a leak in the water main. It was costly to fix but we were able to get a partial refund.- Right now we have very low cell phone costs - Hubby has a work phone and I use a Tracfone. Not a help when we travel and wish we had all the lovely iphone features but work for day to day. We will switch when he retires.Home:- Do all yard work and housework ourselves; we do hire out tree trimming and heavy landscaping- Do¬†home repairs ourselves if possible - Use linens, furniture, decorative items, etc. as long as possible and then replace through consignment stores or sale items if possibleFinances:- Pay all the bills I can online to save on stamps and checks- Track and monitor¬†our spending- Review bills and accounts routinely; contest or change providers as neededHealth:- Keep vaccinations current and take medications as prescribed-¬†Keep up on routine preventative medical and dental care services- Plan meals to meet our low salt, non-dairy, gout appropriate diet needsAutos:- We keep our cars a very long time and follow the preventive maintenance guidelines- Combine errands to save on driving- Get insurance discount for completing a safe driving course onlineRecreation & Hobbies:- I check online listings for free musical performances at a nearby college, outdoor activities, etc.- We purchase an annual membership at the art museum which enables us to see all exhibits including the special ones at a much reduced cost- Most books read are from the libraryOther:- Use scrap paper for notes/lists and print on back of sheets-¬†Buy note cards at thrift store- Reuse plastic shopping bags and newspaper wrappers for dog pickup and trash- Wash dog in bathtub between grooming appointments. Keep up with her ear and eye cleaning and medications to avoid further vet costs."},
{"title": "Part 2 of our excellant NYC adventure", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2015", "text": "We slept really well after walking all over the place on our first full day in NYC and congratulated ourselves on navigating the subway fairly well. This day we planned to head a different direction and started off to the subway. That ate up a bit of time until we figured out an alternate route since the train we wanted wasn't running LOL. Again, these aren't my photos but rather ones from the internet.We made it to the 9/11 Memorial which my husband really wanted to visit and I really didn't as it made me too sad. I sort of walked around while he saw what he wanted and then we headed off to points of mutual interest.Next stop was the Alexander Hamilton Custom House which is again an architectural gem and has a wonderful ceiling mural (seems to be the trip theme by default!). We only saw the first floor which is where the National Museum of the American Indian is housed. A fabulous exhibit of modern silver and turquoise jewelry by members of the Yazzie family and way out of my price range but truly works of art.After lunch nearby we took the Staten Island ferry for the best free harbor tour and Statue of Liberty view available. I was intrigued by buildings on Governor's Island and the other forts in the area. I have since learned that this is Castle (Fort) Williams built in 1807. It was in active use during the Civil War and then converted to a prison in the early 1900's. I'd like to go back in the summer when the island is open and tour the island.We did walk a little on Staten Island and went to a small museum there that had the history of the ferry boats on display. Then road back and hiked up to the American Museum of Currency (again Hubby's list) only to find it closed for a special event. Oh well, fortified by coffee we hit the subway and went back to Greenwich Village for a terrific Italian dinner in a cozy basement restaurant just down the street from our hotel.For our last half day we started with a walk on the Highline in Chelsea/the Meat Packing District for great views of the Hudson River and the city skyline. Our love of architecture was again satisfied in enjoying the ways the rail lines were incorporated into the walkway and planting areas.¬†We also walked through Chelsea Market in repurposed warehouses and could have spent more time there browsing but the outdoors was just too lovely. Instead we bought salads for a picnic lunch and sandwiches for the plane and took them back to Washington Square Park. We watched the filming of a scene for a move or TV show, an artist painting a large canvas, hear¬†a classical violinist and listened French students on tour singing for fun while we ate lunch and rested our weary legs and feet.That is our little fall vacation to NYC. Hope you enjoyed the tour."},

Not the Broadway show or shopping types when faced with incredibly lovely and warm Fall weather, we were outside most of the time enjoying the sights of many parts of the city. We didn't take any photos so the ones below are images from the internet.We stayed at the Washington Square Hotel right in the heart of Greenwich Village and very conveniently located for subway use. Thanks to a recommendation from An Exacting Life we looked into this hotel and it turned out my husband stayed there years ago on¬†a business trip. It worked out great. Originally the Hotel Earle opened in 1902 as a small 8 story residential hotel.¬†The first afternoon we took a self guided walking tour of the Village, stopping for coffee and a scone at a local bakery. We also wandered through a gallery and sat in Washington Square Park for a bit. Amidst all the glorious old buildings was this wonderful building of the New School.The next morning we headed to Rockefeller Center to check out the ice rink and plaza¬†and meet a friend we first met 26 years ago in San Diego when she was the 13 year old next door to our first home! She was our tour guide as well as a wonderful time. We are all into architecture so we went to Grand Central station and admired the renovated ceiling, checked out the lobby of the Chrysler Building, wandered around the NYC Library especially the map room and saw the lions of course. This picture shows the¬†ceiling restoration in progress in 1988. They left a tiny spot of dirty¬†ceiling so you can see what was cleaned off. The restored mural is magnificent as is this Beaux-Arts building.The main NYC library is also Beaux-Arts architecture and the map room is glorious.I guess I have a thing for murals on ceilings because I loved the Chrysler Building lobby one as well. It was painted on canvas and then glued to the ceiling! Love Art Deco architecture.¬†After lunch¬†we walked through Times Square because Hubby really wanted to and up to Central Park. A short walk through the park and then into the American Folk Art Museum (free, donation requested) to see what turned out to be a rather odd exhibition of art by mental patients in Europe during the 1930s. Since our friend lives in Brooklyn we asked to go to one of her favorite restaurants there for dinner. First we walked around Brooklyn Heights and enjoyed the Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn Bridge from the promenade. I didn't take the photo below but the weather was this lovely although the trees were starting to turn. Dinner was in Park Slope and then we parted ways.¬† Stay tuned for Part 2 of our whirlwind vacation in NYC."},

Of course that is Atlanta cold, not real cold.So for the first week of Fall (self declared to be the first week of October I wore 21 items that count in Project 333 in addition to 2 workout outfits, one grubby yard/house work outfit and 2 sets of sleepwear.

I know I'd get terribly bored if I didn't add other options so I'll bring those in as the weeks go by and our¬†weather evolves. My favorite \"nice\" outfit this past week was a sparkly yellow tank with the tiny diamond necklace made from an great-grandmother's antique earring, patterned olive slacks,¬†and ivory cardigan for book club evening.

Since I haven't I'll take that as an indication of how wearing the right clothes helps!My favorite \"everyday\" outfit was a striped 3/4 sleeve top, medium¬†wash¬†jeans¬†and the wide bead bracelet for some sparkle.I'm not so sure how I feel about these thrifted¬†tangerine jeans, but¬†I'm playing with them to see if they stay.

I highly recommend it.In the fiction arena I have to my own surprise gotten hooked on a historical romance series about a Napoleonic War era group of spies including a woman code named The Pink Carnation. Not everyone's cup of tea but I find them fun.

We are arranging to spend a day with her while we are in NYC in October as she lives in Brooklyn. Will be so much fun to see the city with her as we travel around being tourists.- Had a nice long chat with a friend who just got back from an Alaskan cruise. She was so happy with the experience and is figuring out how to go back to Alaska next summer. I am so happy for her as she doesn't do much for herself and was concerned if the money she spent on the cruise was going to be worth it.Other happiness inducers were:- When I walked into Kroger on Wednesday morning they handed me a yellow carnation. It is in a bud vase brightening a corner of our home right now.- I got my flu shot at the drugstore and am very happy I realized it was time to do this and that there is no cost due to my insurance. Most people aren't happy to get vaccinations but I was terribly ill with the flu a long time ago to the point of losing 10 pounds after living on water and a bit of bread for a week spent lying down. Although I would like to lose 10 pounds I don't want to be that sick ever again if I can avoid it!- We had our giant sugar maple and oak trees pruned to thin the crown and pull it back some from the house roof and power line.

The dog was happy because the recipe only uses egg whites and she got an egg yolk doggy omelet for brunch.- Wow, we were crazy busy at the Friends of the Library book sale on Saturday and almost sold everything which is my goal. I don't know how much we made yet as there wasn't time for the treasurer to count the money. At the end of the sale which is outside we were all tired so we stuck the money in the library safe and went home. We weren't sure what the impact would be of the Decatur Book Festival setting up tents in the street in front of the library - and right in front of our sale - but it seemed to increase our business which is good!- When I took my lunch break during the sale there was a line out the door at the restaurant where I usually grab a sandwich. Since I was by myself I went into one I had been wanting to try and sat at the bar to speed things up. I ordered something I used to eat as a child - a BLT and man was it delicious. Turns out they use garden grown tomatoes and it tasted just like my childhood memory. I am so glad to have happy memories of my Mom triggered as I seem to still be mourning her death over a year later.- Speaking of my Mom, my brother closed the last account for the trust we inherited and sent me a check for half splitting it down to the penny.

Often playing to sold out stadiums and broadcast on TV ‚Äì roller derby teams relished the showmanship and theatrical antics that riled up the crowd.¬† Modern day roller derby has moved away from scripted bouts of the 70‚Ä≤s and is a true full contact sport that focuses on athleticism and agility.3. While we were on vacation we spent an evening¬†with our sons and DILs just hanging out and eating BBQ salmon and lamb chops along with other delicious foods. They served¬†homemade Chimichurra as a sauce for the¬†main dishes. We had never had it but it was delicious.¬†An Argentinian sauce it is made with flat leaf parsley, garlic and more. Sort of pesto like. Here is one recipe if you want to try it.http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/chimichurri/4. I'm feeling excited about our decision to live in the Eagle Rock community of Los Angeles if S. CA is our relocation target. If it is N. CA we will probably try out Oakland as I think Berkeley is out of our price range. 5. Regardless of where we move we WILL HAVE A SMALLER YARD! I spent a total of 4 hours pruning bushes in our yard this week and am only half way through the front yard which¬†has fewer bushes than the back yard. Since I need to make it around the entire yard I want to see how long that takes LOL.6. Sometimes there are viable alternatives to buying items packaged in plastic¬†if you look hard enough. I like to make muffins and use paper cups to line the muffin tin. The ones I have been buying come in a plastic container so I searched Amazon to see if I could find any packaged in paper. I did and I looked harder at the grocery store and there they were and cheaper than ordering online!"},

{"title": "What we did for fun while staying in Pasadena, CA", "date": "Friday, July 31, 2015", "text": "When you visit family in a place where one of you grew up and the other moved as a young adult you don't really want to play tourist even though we moved away 18 years ago. While much of our time was spent with family hanging out or going out to eat, we also did some fun activities.One day we and the \"kids\" took the Metro to Little Tokyo/The Arts District part of downtown LA. We walked a bit and saw some amazing murals on the old warehouse buildings.Then we had lunch outside at the Urth Caf√© nearby.We followed this with playing pinball and video games at the Eighty Two Arcade Bar. I have always wanted to own a pinball machine so this was my fun place.¬†¬†The next evening the kids went to a free outdoor concert and took a picnic but I was too worn out to go. As I mentioned, we also fit in a nice visit to the Norton Simon Museum. So many options!ÔªøYup, we are definitely home from a week long vacation in S. CA visiting lots of family. The laundry is done, groceries bought and dog washed! You see, when we go on vacation the dog does too. She stays with her other family (former foster family) and her best dog and cat friends. It is like a kid going to camp. She comes home dirty and exhausted after have the most fun ever! This time she brought home a new squeaky toy as they love her as much as we do.Our vacation accomplished just what we wanted it to. One son and DIL also flew in to we had both our boys and their sweeties for the weekend. We also visited with my FIL, BIL & SIL, 2 nieces, a nephew, 3 aunts, 2 uncles,¬†2 cousins - and one grand-dog. Not all at once though. Lots of driving, lots of meals out and lots of love. That still leaves 5 cousins, one nephew and a number of friends that we didn't get to see this time.We did take a bit of time off and had an outdoor lunch at the Norton Simon museum in Pasadena. Afterwards we enjoyed their sculpture garden complete with blue and orange dragonflies. We then took in the exhibits before heading out for more family time. We also spent some time touring possible place to live when we relocate. Although old town Ventura was great we decided it was too far away from everyone. Surprisingly we have selected the Eagle Rock neighborhood of LA as our target. We lived there 35 years ago when we first got together while in graduate school. It is much trendier now but still has that blue collar edge along with an artsy hippy vibe that we like. We could afford to buy a home there and it is the location of Occidental College and a short surface street drive from Pasadena where our son and DIL live.If N CA becomes the target instead we have suggestions on neighborhoods to research in Oakland and Berkeley so we are making progress with 23 months to retirement.I am following Mette's example¬†and keeping track of the clothing and other personal items I buy each month in hopes of creating a 5 year shopping calendar like she has. So in addition to my vacation (a different post!) what I bought this month was the following.1. Makeup - I haven't worn makeup for a couple of decades except for tinted moisturizer. I decided to buy a couple of items and try them though and am happy I did. All told I spent $131.28 on these items plus makeup remover. Just think of all the money I have saved over the years by not wearing makeup LOL!- It Cosmetics Ybbb Your Brows but Better Brow Powder Skinny Pencil - I bought one at Ulta and then was told they were almost half price on QVC so I bought 2 more. I'm stocked up!- Christian Dior Abricot Creme - Fortifying Cream For Nail - 10g/0.3oz - Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Spot Treatment Concealer, Fair/L... 2. Walking sandals - I went to REI and bought a pair of ECCO sandals so I could walk on vacation comfortably. They were great and I wore them part or all of each day. A great purchase and happily a near skin color in my color palette so they went with everything. I used our REI member rebate from last year's purchases to reduce the list price of $130 plus tax to $113.60¬†and I'll get a rebate on some of what I did spend.3. A Kindle book - I broke my no more buying books rule because my book club is reading The Nightingale and the waiting list at the library was huge. It is now on my Kindle but won't be added to my shopping calendar.August shopping will include:- Exercise/physical therapy gear (lacrosse ball and foam roller)- Sock for waterproof walking shoes- Another summer dress"},

Once I get it up and running successfully I can transition the Membership chairperson responsibilities to the person who has raised his hand to take it on. I am determined to leave this organization in better shape than I found it and carefully transition everything I have been doing to others before I exit and move. On a more fun note, we have been checking off the planning and scheduling elements of our next trip to Los Angeles to visit family. We had out Friday and will be spending time with our kids, cousins, FIL, nieces and nephews. Lots of driving but also lots of visiting with loved ones.

{"title": "Stretching my mind", "date": "Saturday, July 11, 2015", "text": "You may recall that in a burst of determination I signed up for 6 short courses through my local OLLI program (Osher Lifelong Learning). I have a tendency to talk myself out of doing things that require a commitment of time or substantial money. Well these classes are inexpensive so it is just time and I don't have to go if I don't like them. Each is one hour a week for 7 weeks held in (extremely) air conditioned comfort with intelligent and interesting classmates.They started this week and 5 of the 6 are very interesting.Life and times during the Revolutionary War - complete with show and tell objects! The instructor is cheerful, deeply knowledgeable, enthusiastic and used to talking to school children with short attention spans! No recitation of battles, politics or strategy. We are talking why the uniforms looked like they did, flogging with the Cat-of-9-Tails, sashes used as stretchers and so on. Interesting.History of music part 2. Again a cheerful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic instructor. I really loved that he picked unusual performance versions to demonstrate different music. You haven't lived until you have heard baroque music played on the accordion.Current trends in neuroscience - again complete with show and tell objects! Of course we are going to cover neurodegeneration, memory, etc. but the young doctoral student instructor is going to bring the medical school's set of teaching brains to class next week for us to look at and touch so we can really get a sense of neuroanatomy before proceeding. She was afraid we might not want to see them but of course we were enthusiastic.Art and politics in the middle ages. What can I say - another great instructor and visuals.Atheism. I was concerned about what kind of questions might be asked here in the Bible belt but they are interesting, thoughtful and wide ranging. Another winner.I won't name the sixth class because I left at the first break. The instructor talked as though reading from a script, restricted questions to set times and was inflexible. I hope the group sticks with her but I prefer the free wheeling discussions and engaging tones of the other classes. So I have 5 more weeks of interesting classes to look forward to even though I'll miss the 6th week due to vacation. The one surprise to me is how used I have gotten to not doing anything meaningful outside of the house every day. Getting up, dressing smartly, and heading out to classes three days a week is great."},
{"title": "Counting down", "date": "Monday, July 6, 2015", "text": "I'm thinking about several things that are coming up soon enough that I am counting down the time.23 months to my husband's retirement eligibility6 months until 20162 months until I turn 662 2/2 weeks until we head to CA and see our kids!1 day until my OLLI courses startNot all of these are of the same level of importance of course but they are popping in and out of my head each day.And while I am thinking about them I am wondering what possessed me to sign up for 6 classes at OLLI. Of course I don't have to go to them if I don't enjoy them but what was I thinking?We are starting to make detailed plans for our trip to CA. The northern CA pair are flying down for a long weekend and we are all staying a few blocks from the southern CA pair. It will be a great weekend and then we will visit other family members and do some exploring of areas where we might land when we move. We are coming to grips with the reality that where we might choose to live may not be where we can afford to live so we need to explore more.No plans for my 66th yet. I am thinking I may head to Boston and NH to visit family. Or perhaps the two of us can go to NYC and then I can go on to those for visits. Since my Mom died I have connected with some extended family on my Dad's side and I would like to see them as well as my cousins, brother and SIL. My youngest niece may be back at school in Boston by then too.Well, now it is one hour until my Pilates session so I am off to the studio. Have a great week."},

What a joy it is to have redeveloped the habit of listening to music as we prepare and eat dinner or while reading the paper or a book.The addition of trying out new CDs has made all the difference. We have added an Irish music one, Beach Boys, swing music and traditional tango with singing.

{"title": "Hmmm, why do we tend to think more is better?", "date": "Tuesday, June 16, 2015", "text": "I am in the midst of listening to our CDs to decide which ones to keep and to bring music back into my life. I am finding ones that I hadn't listened to for years that I enjoy. I'm also finding that we have too many in different categories.Yesterday I listened to 3 Frank Sinatra CDs. I enjoyed 2 of the 3 and found one¬†to be of poor acoustic quality. The question that popped into my mind though was why did we have so many in the first place? Probably one would be enough but I kept the 2 good ones for now.Today it is the 3 Cuban/Latin CDs. Tomorrow will be the 5 (!) Pancho Sanchez ones. I know why we have so many of those though. We went to an outdoor concert by him 25ish years ago and had a grand time so we loaded up on his music.I've also been listening to the ones I brought home from the 100s recently donated to the Friends of the Library. Those are easier to make decisions on. If I don't like the first track then it goes back. So far I have only picked 3 to add to our collection and I am waffling on one of those LOL.For me at least as far as music goes 1 or 2 is better than 3 or more. I am a person who like variety and at this time can't stand to listen to music that isn't uplifting.I think that often we think more is better when we like the initial item a lot. How many times have you bought more colors of a top or shirt when the one that you really liked was the first one you selected. More wasn't better then either. The same can happen in other areas of our lives. I am trying to notice what I do automatically that doesn't add value for me and this is one of those things."},

We are judiciously making the home repairs and improvements required to put our house on the market. A lot of work by a good crew and a big check later this one is done.The main part of our large lot is flat but we own a small portion of the wooded area that runs behind the houses on our street. We have to have access and the house came with two sets of stairs built out of railroad ties held in place with rebar that stuck up. They worked for us for 18 years but the main ones were no longer safe. There was also some debris that had been used as a retaining wall - steel drum, sheet metal, bedframe, etc. Then there was a useless and rotting fence between the two sets of stairs. We fixed one set of stairs and had retaining walls built. Now it is safe and more attractive although not visible from our house.

{"title": "Practicing Lagom (Enough, sufficient, adequate, just right) to increase my contentment", "date": "Thursday, June 4, 2015", "text": "My Swedish ancestors should be happy although I'm not sure the concept existed in their era when they were fleeing famine and betting it all on a new life in the USA. Anyway, I am really trying to keep the definition of lagom at the front of my mind as I make decisions about spending money, spending my time, spending my energy.Today I needed to replace the dog's leash as the hooking mechanism is not working right and we are concerned that it will come loose. She has what I have to say are the cutest and most appropriate for her collar and leash that we bought for quite a lot of money when we adopted her and went rather crazy in the pet store. We will clearly need an intervention if we ever have a grandchild LOL.Anyway, her set is a squirrel decorated collar and matching leash. Little did we know how squirrel obsessed she was when we picked it out. I went to the company's website and came very close to buying a new, equally cute set for $70 plus shipping¬†- but, she only needs a new leash. Hmm, replacing the same one she has is $48 plus shipping. Maybe I could buy it at our nearest pet store and save the shipping. Yes, they are listed as carrying the brand. So I went to the store and fortunately for our pocketbook they didn't have them. As I browsed I thought about what I really needed and there was a brown leash that would match her harness (dog fashion being important of course) and it rang up at under $12. Is it enough, sufficient, adequate, just right? Definitely. She sniffed it and then raced to the door for her walk because that is after all what is really lagom! In addition, the money I spent on lunch with a friend today and will spend tomorrow for lunch with another helps me reach lagom in social interaction/friendship building which is clearly a higher priority than a decorated leash. Bonus: She is still wearing her squirrel collar that makes me smile and she is her entertaining self as usual.In the same line I keep¬†reminding myself that I need to take care to keep a supply of library books at home to satisfy my reading passion. Lagom is having one to read at ALL times so I don't resort to buying them to get my daily reading fix.I'm not sure if this fits but my attempt to bring music back in my life is proceeding well. I've enjoyed some CDs¬†that I had forgotten we owned.¬†I've got two suggestions for free music streaming - Pandora and Google Play Music. I will explore both. I also realized as I sorted donated CDs that we will sell for¬†$1 each at the next Friends of the Library book sale, that I should bring home all that looked slightly appealing and listen to them. I haven't taken my $5 worth of free books/CDs at the last two book sales and certainly I can find 10 that will be lagom! I'm listening to one right now that I am enjoying a lot. Curating a collection that I actually listen to plus a source of streaming new music that fits what I like and I will be all set!"},

I've never fainted before and it was very strange to be trying to figure out where I was and how I got there. My husband said it sounded like a very large tree branch hitting the roof. We got around later on Friday to joking that it was a branch of the family tree that fell!The best I can come up with is that the dinner plus possibly the Ibuprofen I took caused acute gastris and that resulted in a rapid drop in blood pressure. Go figure.After spending Friday being waited on by my husband, napping excessively with the dog, and eating very small bland meals I seem to be on the mend although the aches from falling are compounded by those from the really hard Pilates session I had on Thursday.

I'll go to my book club summer swim party and will (making a commitment here) read the book too.I've also decided to delve into listening to music again and have started by listening to one of our CDs a day - really listening, not putting it on as background noise. If I don't like it though it is leaving the house as part of our ongoing pre-move belongings reduction. I'm thinking about pulling out my drawing supplies as another activity. Perhaps I can find a free tutorial/inspiration series online.We have coordinated plans with our sons and DILs and booked a vacation trip to CA for late July. We will all be together for a weekend (yeah!) and then we will stay a few days more to visit with other family members. The dog gets a vacation out of this too as she stays with her former foster family who she loves dearly.Then there are the 6 (gasp) OLLI courses I just signed up for while telling myself that I will go to each and every one except when we are gone on our trip. Hold me to that please. I signed up for an interesting variety of courses held on three different days and then will also have the opportunity to attend some Lunch 'n Learns one day. So here is what I signed up for - a mix of history, music, current events, & (non) religion:Behind the Scenes of the Revolutionary War -¬† Join us for lectures on myths of the revolution, spies, court martial findings, American Indian wars, naval traditions, and colonial medicines/cures. As time permits, subjects may also include clothing, uniforms, weapons, and home life during the Revolutionary War period.Sight and Sound - Famous Popular, Folk, and Classical Music From Around the World¬†-¬†Using music videos we will explore the enduring songs, singers, and folk instrumentals from many countries, including France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, Japan, North Africa, the Celtic World and the Americas. Music that has enchanted people from other countries will delight and educate. Background information and brief biographies will be provided.The Atlanta Beltline Project and Streetcars in Atlanta¬†-¬† The Atlanta BeltLine is the most comprehensive transportation and economic development effort undertaken in Atlanta and among the most wide-ranging urban redevelopment programs underway in the US. The BeltLine is a sustainable redevelopment project that will provide a network of public parks, multi-use trails and modern streetcar transit along a historic 22-mile railroad corridor circling downtown and connecting many neighborhoods. The class will cover BeltLine history, project updates, and long-range plans. It will also touch on streetcars in Atlanta from 1890 and the planned Atlanta Streetcar System, which includes the BeltLine. The class will culminate with a 3 hour tour of the BeltLine.The Brain Times: Neuroscience in the News¬†-¬†Interested in learning more about how the brain works? We will explore basic functions of the brain and discuss diseases that impact the brain. We will then discuss various examples of neuroscience in the world today.The Middle Age: From Byzantine in the East to High Gothic in the West¬†-¬† Images, objects, and structures from this 800 year period as viewed from an interdisciplinary perspective.Atheism and Secularism: An Introduction¬†-¬†This course will be divided into six sessions. Part I: Purposes, labels, definitions, and questions. Part II: Main arguments for theism and atheism. Part III: Secularism--history and logic of church/state. Part IV: Religion and Morality. Part V: History of Atheism. Part VI: Resources, questions, and conclusions. What do you have lined up for summer?"},
{"title": "Changing habits by setting intentions", "date": "Tuesday, May 19, 2015", "text": "As my readers know, I have been struggling with how often I go to the coffee shop and buy a treat as well as healthy habits overall. Trying to not do something is different than trying to do something so I am making an effort to state my positive intentions during the day.Yesterday it was that I would only buy what was on my Whole Foods grocery list and head straight home. Yesterday's eating intention was to eat meals that would hold me without a snack until the next meal. Today my intention was that I would shower after I did my work out. I also stated to myself that I would have a large salad for lunch today.I'm thinking that the urge to head to the coffee shop about 3pm each day has more to do with being bored and feeling housebound as well as being my low energy time of day than it does with wanting coffee. I do have coffee at home. I'm trying to have a plan in mind of something to do each afternoon instead. I'll probably switch many of my errands to after lunch instead of morning. I am a morning person so I tend to power through my to do list in the morning and then fade mid-afternoon. Time to change my day's routing to up my energy in the afternoon without eating sweets while having a coffee out!Its early days yet but I am finding this approach works much better for the way I work! Breaking habits without something to substitute for the undesirable habit is virtually impossible - at least for me.Have you tried an approach similar to this or another way of changing your habits?

Right now it is windows, patio doors, tile floors and summer outdoor \"stuff\".I mentioned that I did clean one set of patio doors, the BBQ and some patio chairs. We fired up the BBQ on Saturday for chicken shish-kebabs and enjoyed them thoroughly. We didn't use it at all last summer and I am determined that we will get our money out of it this and next summer before we leave it behind in our move.I finished the 4th tile floor this morning and am starting on the kitchen windows and door¬†that collect so much tree pollen. So far I have hosed them down well and soon I will be outside on a ladder washing.I'm also going to spend some time admiring our new retaining walls and stairs that we can't even see from the house LOL. They cost a small fortune but half the amount of the first bid and are a necessary maintenance project that we couldn't do ourselves. The crew worked incredibly hard and a side benefit it that the tire, bedframe, steel drum and other assorted trash that was semi-buried in the hillside by previous owners of this house are all gone to the dump. That alone makes me very happy as does the fact that I won't worry so much about breaking an ankle when I go down into the woods to clean and spray kudzu. One more pre house sale task checked off. At the end of May we will be 24 months out from when Hubby can retire and we are starting to work on what we think needs to be done. We also had the crew remove some diseased bushes and we will be planting different ones ourselves to save money. Hopefully they won't look too pitifully small by the time we sell.Have a great day!"},

Work out at home¬†with weights AND do stretch DVD program at least twice a week AND walk on other days (unless traveling, etc.).* I gave up. I do so much better with a scheduled out of the house activity. I am going back to sessions with a Pilates trainer as I felt best when I did that regularly. Yard work is in full swing which is good exercise along with short dog walk and a very long walk on a sunny Sunday.3. Buy the clothing needed to have a wardrobe I love to wear that fits my life right now.* I¬†browsed in lots of stores I normally would not have visited as well as the usual suspects and found a few summer clothes. The surprise was¬†a 3 color sunhat in my neutrals at an active wear store near me. I also bought a new pair of capris and thrifted 2 more pairs and two tops.¬†Some less¬†loved and worn out items left my wardrobe. I have 3 items to alter to make them fit better/be more useful.4. Go through all files, office supplies and my books and only keep what brings me happiness, is used regularly or will be used up over time.

Disentangle from all of my volunteer roles for the Friends of the Library in preparation for moving in 2017.* No progressThen there are the mushier goals.6. Love and be loved.* Friends: A friend had free tickets to see the play \"Our Town\" at The Shakespeare Tavern. They serve dinner before if you want and we did. I'd actually never seen or read this play and it was really good. Also went out to lunch with a friend who is facing hip replacement surgery in early May.* Family: Dinner with Hubby at our favorite Thai restaurant twice just because. We also¬†celebrated our 34th anniversary with lunch out and went out to lunch in the middle of a very long walk.¬† Our¬†younger son had a birthday as did our older¬†DIL although we had to celebrate those long distance unfortunately.

One is \"Art in Havana\" and the other is \"Eight Retired Physicians Share Their Expertise on Timely Medical Topics\".¬†¬†Both are very interesting so far and I'm glad I am taking them.So, what's on deck for May?- Lots of yardwork- Regular phone calls to family- Pilates sessions- Walks- Finish OLLI classes- Plan next trip to CaliforniaWell now that was fun! Hubby spent the weekend painting over the patching he did to fix the wood rot in some siding. The paint doesn't match quite but will keep the siding safe from further rot until we have to whole house painted to sell it.I sprayed the entire lot for mosquitoes and tried to prepare the BBQ to make shish kebabs. When I opened the lid to get the grills out to wash though a hoard of ants scurried to carry eggs to safety. The entire thing has been \"marinating\" in bug spray overnight and one of today's tasks will be to wash it all very thoroughly.Today I also get to scrub one of our two sets of patio doors and screen doors. We wanted to open it this past weekend to help air out the house now that it has warmed up but there was so much pollen embedded in the screen and track that we thought better of that idea. The other door and screen isn't as bad so it will wait for another time.If I have time I will get out the patio chairs and table and scrub them as well,¬†prune, spray for weeds and put down more weed preventer¬†but that all may also have to wait. We have a very large city lot and lots of bushes and trees with wood chips instead of grass. It takes a surprising amount of work to keep it up which we were blissfully unaware of when we relocated from an arid climate.I do have to admit though that it was lovely weather all weekend (finally) and we took advantage on Saturday by going out for gourmet tacos and taking a walk. We chatted about how we miss our Mother's and not having anyone to celebrate on Mother's Day when we came up with the idea of celebrating our 4 surviving Aunties. We stopped and bought cards and our hearts felt much better!Hope you had a great weekend and are being able to enjoy the out of doors."},

Why is that?I am concluding I really like going out for coffee and a sweet each day much more than I like the potential benefits of not doing so (save money & calories; less saturated fat). At least we did walk for 1 1/2 hours on Sunday.My skills for making new friends and being a good, close friend are pretty rusty and I'm not even sure what I used to do differently. I am delving through the changes and challenges of the last 20 years to see if I can figure out what happened and what I used to do.

{"title": "How many is too many? How many is enough?", "date": "Monday, April 6, 2015", "text": "This is one of my first world problems. How many of each type of thing if just the right amount?So much has been written about how to declutter or reach the right balance point for your belongings. So many different approaches.This is what I am trying right now.I am following Mette's lead as she discusses in her post about creating a five year shopping calendar¬†but I am¬†trying to create a one year shopping calendar for my clothing and other useful things. The first step is to decide how many of each type of garment is the \"right\" number. I managed to shed older tops using this approach while others had not helped me let go of them. Did they bring me joy per Marie Kondo? No, but they stayed in the closet. Had I worn them in the last year? Yes, but more because I felt I should wear them because they were hanging there. So 10 short sleeve/sleeveless casual knit tops is my number to try and I have 11 now plus 2 dressier ones. At the end of the summer if not sooner I will let the one go that is most worn out or least suited to me. I will not buy anymore until Spring 2016 when I will replace one or two.As I continue to work on decluttering the office I have lots of these choices. Three exercise DVDs when I barely use one? Two are being donated. Two books on colored pencil drawing when I took a class and then haven't drawn since? One will be donated but I am keeping the pencils and one book as I have realized that I like draw.So my decluttering and therefore shopping questions for now are:- How many is the right number to have?- If I have too many should I let them wear out or remove them?- If reducing the number I have, which ones of what I have are the best and/or most used?- Do I need to add or replace in this category?- We will see how it goes."},

Should we consider that mode of moving our belongings vs. a rental truck vs. regular movers? Has anyone had experience with PODs for moving?Who is likely to buy our house - someone who will live in it as is and slowly improve it, someone who will do a major renovation and/or addition before moving in, or a developer who will raze it and build a gigantic house on our big flat lot which is unusual in this part of town? Could we do a For Sale by Owner? Not my preference but we are going to talk about it at least.What should we repair or redecorate in the next two years based on how best to market our house for the least investment? We definitely are not going to remodel the baths of kitchen. We probably will have the exterior trim painted and some of the interior. We are fixing soon the retaining wall and stairs down the hill into our wooded area. It looks like we have found a reasonable approach and contractor for that. At the same time we will replace some dying but highly visible bushes so they have time to fill in.How much of our stuff are we taking with us and how do we go about sorting and de-acquisitioning the rest? How far in advance do we need to start seriously doing this?How do you transport a dog across the country without it getting lose or having a terrible trip?Where will we live in California?

Eat to reduce bad cholesterol levels - not pastry/cookies out, less meat and even more vegetables.¬†Weigh self daily and record.- I am struggling with this to be honest. I have the habit of going to the coffee shop to get out of the house and then I eat something unhealthy. - We are also struggling with selecting the¬†foods¬†that will help my husband with his gout, my low salt needs, etc. while being healthy. So many competing food needs due to health issues and conflicting scientific advice. I am working on creating a list of entrees that meet all of our criteria so I am not making it up each week.- My husband can no longer drink wine or beer due to his gout problem so I have joined in abstaining except when out to eat or at book club. Fewer calories!2. Work out at home¬†with weights AND do stretch DVD program at least twice a week AND walk on other days (unless traveling, etc.). -¬†Also struggling with this. I hurt my foot so walking has been a challenge. I have settled on a spot for my indoor exercise that works. With my husband's gout problems we were discussing that we may have to take up swimming as our exercise program in the future instead of walking but for now I am walking.- Monday I did the stretch DVD and floor and weight exercises I learned at the gym and am sore today which is good. Tuesday was¬†a walking and yard work day. Another habit to form as I am determined to be physically strong, flexible and have good balance as I get older.¬† 2. Buy the clothing needed to have a wardrobe I love to wear that fits my life right now.- Added 2 scarves that I really like although that doesn't really help with my hot weather wardrobe needs. I have made a list of stores to try for shorts, sundresses, tops, etc. and need to make myself schedule visiting them and just do it.3. Go through all files, office supplies and my books and only keep what brings me happiness, is used regularly or will be used up over time. This has been expanded to include getting rid of other items as I encounter them and trying to only replace not add to our stuff.-¬†I eliminated 86 items and 1/2\" of paper from the house.- What came in: a bathmat replacing the current one, a hanging shoe holder replacing 5 shoe boxes and 2 scarves for my wardrobe.4.

Have fun - and I'm adding, have adventures.- Need to work on figuring out what fun and adventures are for me at this time of life.7. Find joy in everyday life even when it involves chores LOL.- Our little dog has passed the one year mark for living with adrenal failure (Addison's disease) and her tests show she is doing fine on the medication regime we are following. It has taken time for me to learn what is normal variation in her energy and activity and what signifies a need for additional medication between her monthly shots but we are at a nice stable approach now. She is a daily source of joy for both of us so this is a great outcome.So, what's on deck for April?- Warmer weather will enable more walking outdoors which I prefer. It also brings more yard work.- I've identified a number of things we could do for fun: an antique car parade, free concerts, and two art festivals. We also will celebrate our 34th anniversary, our son's 32nd birthday and a DILs birthday although the latter two are long distance unfortunately.-¬†I have book club and will attend.- The two OLLI classes I signed up for begin and I have committed to attending all sessions. One is \"Art in Havana\" and the other is \"Eight RetiredPhysicians Share Their Expertise on Timely Medical Topics\". ¬†- My husband has three overnight business trips and I will carefully plan what to eat while he is gone so I don't slip and eat poorly out of lack of desire to cook - although I may treat myself to going out!- I will visit the stores I have listed and buy enough clothing for my hot weather wardrobe and quit obsessing about it!"},

Oh well, its not in my control except to pay the darn estimated taxes and probably have paid too much.Since I will turn my full retirement age (66)¬†this year, I reread some information about when to start your social security payments IF you can afford to wait. Clearly the longer I wait the better off I will be if I live as long as my Mom (93) or longer which is likely. Absolutely will wait until Hubby retires from full time work and perhaps a while longer to reach 70. We may decide for me to collect starting the year after he retires and have him collect the spousal benefit on my earnings until he reaches 70 since he is 3 years younger. That would ensure whoever lives the longest the highest SS income possible. More number crunching as retirement gets closer to figure this out.My frugal wins this week were about salvaging what we already own. If you want to take a crack at fixing something of your own that you don't know how to approach, simply pull out or download the manual, look for a YouTube video on the subject, Google your problem, post a plea for help on Facebook or simply put on your thinking cap and try whatever pops into your mind. It's at least worth a try.One of the handsets for our house phone wasn't working and we were afraid we might have to buy new ones. I checked everything listed in the manual with no luck. Then I thought of trying the battery from a handset that was working to see if we needed a new battery for some reason. The handset worked but more importantly when I put the original battery back in it also worked. It must have just jiggled loose. The pocket in my purse had developed a hole and small items were falling inside the purse lining. A few stitches by hand and that is problem of the past. A pajama top for warmer weather was just too¬†dark of a purple and actually made me shudder when I looked at it, so I ran it through the washer with some bleach. The bleach took out some of the black undertone so now it is a lighter but still dark purple top I can tolerate wearing for lounging and sleep. There was a hole in the pocket of a pair of knit pants - no longer a problem. So glad for all those 4-H lessons and sewing experience from my childhood.I am totally resisting buying anything for this house that isn't essential. 27 months until my husband can retire and we are starting to figure out the logistics of our move back to California. This move will clearly include as little stuff as possible to reduce the cost. Still, we have to live here in the meantime and need to keep everything working for us and looking as good as possible.We¬†needed to buy a new bath rugs for both bathrooms as they are falling apart to the point of being un-washable. We found one for the downstairs bathroom but it made the colored towels look shabby so I decided to see what would happen if I bleached the towels and they came out a nice cream color and look almost brand new! Still looking for one to go with the upstairs bath d√©cor and need to check out more stores now that the weather is cooperating again.Today I will at least sign up for a beginning jewelry metalworking class, watch a session of a Craftsy class, do housework, run errands, walk the dog, call a friend or two, do some volunteer work online, start altering an old pair of capris¬†and very gently stretch my back. Such is my life in retirement in winter."},

Pretty funny as a juxtaposition to the amount of time I am spending thinking about clothing right not - more than at any time in my life except the teen years by the way.Anyway, I now have a lovely swatch of 50 colors representing the 50,000+ that would look good on my at this time. I'm dealing with spending where I have shirked in the last couple of years - belts, bras, everyday winter coat,¬†shoes, gym clothes and lounge/sleep wear. I will need to replenish my cold winter wardrobe a bit next Fall too.The bulk of my wardrobe shopping though needs to be for a spring and summer wardrobe for those warm to very hot months we have a lot of in Atlanta. I want to spend my money very well this time around. My shopping time too as it is one of my least favorite activities and even more time consuming now that I am taking color into account as well as lifestyle, size, fit, style, ease of care and price.So I am shopping my wardrobe first to see if I truly need anything to make it through early spring when it is cool to warm.¬†I was able to create a potential color palette¬†from the colors in my eyes and came up with these eye enhancers.¬†The red and coral are the closest colors in my swatch to the colors near my iris and were a surprise to me as I thought it was brown! There are also tiny flecks of teal to my surprise.Three neutrals and four colors - I could live with that but I'm also waiting for a sunny day when my husband is home so to take the appropriate photos so I can get Imogen to pick out my signature colors. Also, I don't own many items in these colors for spring/summer although I wore them a lot back in my teens/early 20s. So back to shopping my closet I go.I did find enough clothing for early spring that blend with¬†colors in my¬†swatch.ÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøThe overall color scheme for early spring¬†¬†And a few closet orphans that will work too with each other, denim or soft white.I love the versatility that my¬†color swatch gives me and have been pleasantly surprised at how many clothes I own that blend but please notice there is no black. Charcoal is my new black. So black is gone as is bright white, fuschia, and cool red, but there are plenty of colors left and they do look better with my current hair and skin coloring. I did sneak in a too white zip hoodie until I can replace it. Overall I have a trench coat, blazer, zip hoodie, 3 cardigans, 16 tops, 2 jeans, ankle pants, 2 capris and a skirt for a total of 28 items plus 3 pairs of shoes and 2 belts for a total of 33 without including accessories. Not bad for shopping my closet.It's not a perfect wardrobe eye color wise but I have plenty of clothes for the transition from cold to hot weather. I may need to add one or two smart casual outfits for going out or those occasions that require more dressing up. I definitely need those shoes, belts, and accessories mentioned earlier.Onward to creating a wardrobe that works for hot/very hot & humid weather that will be here way to soon. I'm going to add to that wardrobe using my signature colors/eye enhancers as much as possible so I expect to end up with two capsule wardrobes that don't work together very well. One will use the existing pieces that have at least one more season in them but won't have anything added in those colors. The other will be my new or thrifted purchases in my signature colors or colors that blend with them. I'm looking forward to the journey and will share my learning with you as I go."},

Love and be loved.- Our trip to CA certainly was filled with love - time with sons, DILs, FIL, BIL, great aunt, cousin & nephew.- Had lunch with a friend and coffee date with another right after our vacation- Called my great-aunt who was like a big sister to my Mom. I'm really missing my Mom.- Two books on building patios were donated to the library book sale and I picked them up and mailed them to the son who has that on his home improvement list.6. Have fun - and I'm adding, have adventures.- We planned into our trip to CA two days just for us to drive up the coast from the LA area to the Bay Area with overnights in Cambria and Santa Cruz.7. Find joy in everyday life even when it involves chores LOL.- I've been remembering to really play with the dog, find reasons to laugh, light scented candles. I almost always wake up in a good mood so my measure for this goal is if I am still in one when I go to bed! Haven't kept track but I think it is going pretty well.So, what's on deck for next month?- More time at gym plus a bunch of preventative health care appointments for a physical, dental and orthodontic check ups and another massage I hope.- My book club is meeting and I have a lunch scheduled with former co-workers. Friends of the Library book sale is hard work but also social as I see friends all day. Need to schedule some more social activities.- I want to plan something fun for Hubby and I for Valentine's Day- Keep plodding away at decluttering the home office, creating a small wardrobe that I love,¬†and transitioning roles in the Friends of the Library group.

What kind of lifestyle do we want in the first phase of retirement? Where will we live precisely and in what kind of housing? What will our income stream be and will it be sufficient? What do we need to do in 2015 to prepare?Well, you already know part of the answer to the last question. Some reduction in the amount of stuff we own is to happen both through another round of decluttering focused initially on books, paper and office supplies as well as very carefully limiting what we buy. That will make keeping this house clean take less of my time too.The other major pieces of what to do in 2015 are financial planning and action as well as perhaps some home repairs. We are very fortunate that we can keep on living on a similar budget to what we have been doing and that is¬†part of the financial plan. We also did a review of our retirement accounts and decided to keep on with what we are doing at least for the first quarter.¬†Possible home repairs still need discussion although at the moment we are trying once again to find out where water enters the basement during a heavy rain and then fix the source.We have discovered that we have different visions of our future housing situation so lots more discussion and thinking on that to come.What we have agreed upon¬†is to build in a bit more travel just for fun this and next year.

A work in progress. I highly recommend Imogen Lamport's Evolve Your Style and 7 Steps to Style programs which both include private Facebook groups of lovely, kind, supportive women from around the world.- We started talking about where we might live and the lifestyle we want after Hubby retires in 2 1/2 years.

My roles in this organization also need to be transitioned to younger people over the next two years and I announced that! - Our little poodle princess is doing well on her medication for her Addison's disease.

Whew!So far we are trying to wrap our minds around the following:- Would we rent or buy when we move? - How much cash will we need for the move and first year?- Should we leave the cash from my inheritance in a money market account in case we decide to buy?- Where precisely would we look for a place to live and what are the criteria for making that decision?- Is it possible to find a place we can afford that would allow us to age in place near family for 15 to 20 years with our budget?- What repairs/upgrades do we need to make for our current home to sell it for top dollar?- Would we try to time the sale and move to coincide with his retirement or start working on the sale after he retires?- How and what would we move across the country?- Would he look for work that requires being \"in the office\" or only do consulting work? This really would affect where we live?We both spent a few hours yesterday looking through houses for sale sites to get a sense of what might work for us. We know it would be more expensive to buy there than what we can get for this house even though we will be downsizing. Moves are so much work that we really need to think through how to do this. When we moved here we rented an apartment on a month to month basis and stored our belongings. Hating living in the apartment drove us to buy a house too quickly I think. 2 1/2 years seems like a lot of time but with a change this big and wanting to be happy with our living circumstances means that we need to start thinking about it now.If you have any words of wisdom based on experience please share them!"},

In the middle of the raking a friend dropped of a carload of books to donate to the library and we moved them into my car.Then came the not so fun part. I woke up in the early hours of Sunday to find my little world was spinning and I ached. A whole rainy day of napping and hanging out in PJs with my faithful little dog staying close and Hubby fixing me meals, washing sheets and going grocery shopping so we won't have to brave the stores again until after Thanksgiving.Much better today although still achy and the dog is very rested and rambunctious!"},

They have planted lots of trees and meadow areas and one of my favorite art installations was a herd of metal goats in a meadow grazing away except for one that was staring at the walkway. Lots of other neat ones that are harder to describe.It may still be pretty warm here in Atlanta but the leaves are falling anyway! Yesterday I raked enough of them to fill 9 trash cans and a 10th was filled with branches. At least it is good exercise.I have been banging my head (figuratively) against the computer as I try to pay for something and can't get the site to delete my cancelled credit card or choose the new one for payment. I'll have to get on the phone at a moment when I have the patience to be on hold forever.Speaking of exercise, I went to the gym this morning and then walked the dog. Vacuuming is on the agenda too. Oh what an exciting life I lead!There is a coffee date with a friend scheduled for Wednesday afternoon and we are going to a party on Saturday night so life is not all exercise, chores and playing dress up.What are you up to this week?"},
{"title": "Playing With Clothes Part 4: I've learned a lot that is helpful", "date": "Sunday, November 2, 2014", "text": "At this point I am at day 26 out of the 31 days of challenge for Evolve Your Style. Well, that is if you don't count the three I have skipped and need to come back to. They involve makeup - which I don't own - and a dress. The only dress I own at the moment is my Mother of the Groom dress which I am going to try to style for a cocktail party/fancy event assuming it still fits.However, this is turning out to be the best money I ever spent on my appearance. As Mette says in her summary post at her interesting blog, Evolve Your Style - my reflections and a review, the closed Facebook group for this challenge is a friendly, kind and helpful one where you get great suggestions and develop a sense of community with women from around the world. In an odd coincidence, someone I actually know IRL here in Atlanta just joined too which was a nice surprise.So I'm not ready to do a full summary but here are my favorite outfits from last week and some key learning so far.ÔªøWear flowers day - dressed to head to a funeral unfortunatelyÔªøWear a jacket with jeans - my only jacket and ever present jeans on the way out to dinnerÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøOne of the surprising things I have learned that is very helpful is the idea of contrast level. I think that when people age and say they feel they are fading away it is because of this issue of changing contrast level. If I wear the same color combinations then my clothes will take center stage and make me fade away or look outdated. I have to laugh when I realize my Mom never felt that way about her appearance but she was a blonde who still had just a few white hairs when she was 93. So I didn't learn this at home, but you can learn more about contrast levels on Imogen Lampore's blog (Getting your value contrast levels right).¬†I used to have dark brown hair which meant I had a higher contrast level than I do now. So I could wear a bright red jacket with a black and white stripe dress, etc. and it looked fine. This group helped me realize that the overall affect of my mixed white and brown hair is more of a dark blonde look which means my contrast level is low medium and I need to wear outfits that have less contrast. Bright colors are still fine they just are mixed differently and are more in the secondary color range. For example the jacket above is a yellow green not a primary green. ¬†Evidence of my current low medium contrast levelSo I tried \"wear flowers\" another day when I wasn't constrained by the etiquette of funeral attire and mixed grays with black jeans for another low medium contrast look. That is a charcoal gray sweater - I'm having trouble with color accuracy in my selfies..¬†ÔªøThen there was style a skirt day and I took a chance on making a summer cotton skirt work for fall weather with this low medium contrast look. With tights it could work out but I'll probably keep it for warmer weather. ¬†¬†¬†I haven't spent much money on this style challenge as my experimental purchases have mostly been from thrift shops. Yesterday I did buy a couple of sweaters that I am very happy with in terms of color and style. Shopping choices were easier with the knowledge I have gained as I passed by many items that appealed to me visually but wouldn't work with my contrast level.¬†Contrast level helps me understand in part why I didn't like the first outfit below although the color combination works and is something I have happily worn in the past. The second one is lower contrast in my opinion and I really felt good in it. I hope I have explained this correctly LOL.¬†¬†¬†¬†Ôªø"},

One set of exercise clothes for each season (fall/spring, summer, winter) plus one jacket is enough.

Which was odd for me because although I like having a small wardrobe I do like mixing colors and being playful as well as comfortable in my clothes. Well the challenge is fun and the feedback through the Facebook group is really nice and helpful. I love seeing what other women of all ages from¬†around the world are wearing too. It has given me many ideas for making the most of what I have and for adding the right things to my wardrobe.Here are three winners so far:ÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøWear a statement necklace dayI made the necklace long ago and never wore it with these complimentary colors.ÔªøWear pink dayThe belt and cardigan were thrifted just this past week.Double up on necklaces dayThe pearls were from my Mom's jewelry collection and I really didn't see myself wearing them but I like it in combination with a more casual necklace.ÔªøÔªøI'm finding for me that what is making the difference in how I feel about an outfit is adding accessories or making sure there is something of interest in a plainer combination of clothing. This fall and winter I am not following Project 333 but instead am going to track what I actually wear that I enjoy. I'm shopping for bargains to add some fun to my wardrobe and still sticking to a small, versatile collection of clothing and accessories.It is fun to play \"dress up\" even at 65 and a good push to make sure I don't fall into a rut in terms of sticking to an easy \"uniform\" for my casual lifestyle."},

What a great movie!I also checked out Chinatown although the story line of that movie takes a lot more liberties with history. I remember it as also being a great movie.I finished reading Saving Italy which is by the same author as Monuments Men and am waiting for a copy of the movie Monuments Men to become available for check out.Any other ideas for book and movie pairings."},

Yesterday I was in the mood to shop and drove to my current favorite thrift store only to find that they were closed for a vacation. Today the mood escapes me.Still feeling the need to do something productive, (darn those Puritan ancestors!) I am currently making vegetable broth from peelings, ends and scraps that were in the freezer. Then there will be split pea soup. I will shorten the sleeves on a new to me windbreaker and possible have a go at trying to narrow the legs on a pair of too large yoga pants.That loan hard cooked egg lurking in the frig became curried egg salad served on whole grain crackers.

{"title": "Got that off the to do list!", "date": "Saturday, October 4, 2014", "text": "Yesterday I looked at the item that just kept getting transferred from one to do list to the next to do list and got realistic about the chances that I would actually do it!I had items from my Mom's estate that still needed to be sold (old watches and jewelry) and thought I should put them on eBay. Yet I didn't do it.Our cousin makes an early retirement income from managing estate sales and selling on eBay and at a flea market. He does a great job and recently handled my FIL's moving to assisted living¬†sale. I decided to have him see what he could do with the items and help him out at the same time I could let go of the guilt of not acting.That led to making decisions about more old jewelry, etc. that I had sitting in drawers. Most of it was items my Mom had given to me that had belonged to her, her parents or¬†her¬†grandparents. They meant something to her but not enough to keep them and I only used about 5% of them over the last 20 to 30 years. I packed them up too and shipped it all yesterday. Consider that project 37 completed out of the goal of 52 for the year.I feel relieved.I also decided that I need to look at other unfinished and optional projects the same way. - Am I actually interested in finishing this project or do I just feel guilty for having it unfinished for so long?- If I really want it done, can someone else do it for me?- If I really don't care, then what am I going to do with the half finished project and supplies?There are enough things in life that truly have to be done. Laundry, meal prep, cleaning, yard work, bill paying, exercise, preventive health care, etc. There are enough worthwhile and fun things to fill the rest of the days. The decluttering of part of my Mom's stuff also led to going through a bit more of the things I had brought home from her house. Do I need Christmas cards sufficient for the next 10 years? I kept the ones I really like and the rest will go in the Friends of the Library book sale. Still have other things to go through but the progress felt really good."},
{"title": "How about a GAP year for new retirees?", "date": "Friday, October 3, 2014", "text": "We have started letting the idea of taking a \"Gap\" year immediately after Hubby retires float around in our thoughts and conversations. I'm thinking of a gap year like some students take after high school/before college.Prior to this we were focused on making long term decisions along with selling our house, moving across country, making all of the retirement financial decisions, etc. I thought why not let our selves off the hook, find a lovely place to live and rent affordably that is generally in the right part of the country and use the year to travel, explore where we might really want to live and put down roots at this time of our life and adjust to Hubby not working full time?I'd love to find a resort type community and enjoy that lifestyle for a while. We may need to be within easy driving distance of my FIL as well as able to see other family easily. This may not become our plan.However this idea has shifted our very preliminary discussions. We are ruling out some ideas and brainstorming others. Retirement for Hubby won't happen before May 17, 2017 and may wait until the end of 2017 but dreaming is good!What ideas do you have for us to contemplate? We will need to be near Pasadena or Berkeley, CA and possibly restricted to S. CA for helping my FIL. We love water, art, theatre, nature hikes, a community that welcomes newcomers and much more."},

For years I have pursued art and although I am going to keep at it at some level I have to admit my talents are modest. My MIL was a fabulous artist as you can see by the unfinished painting below. I had it shipped home when we were in CA for my birthday as no one in the family wanted it when my FIL moved into assisted living.

WWII seems to be the theme as I also have Good Evening, Mrs. Craven by Mollie Panter-Downes waiting in the wings. I'd like to visit London again and go to the War Museum among other things we didn't see when we were there.

We lent a significant sum of money to a son and DIL to help with the down payment for a house and they sent us the first repayment check only 6 months after buying. They had to do the usual additional investments in fixing things in the house and we didn't expect to get a loan repayment for some time. Yeah for them.In the middle of last week I stopped by my favorite thrift store that supports animal rescue groups. I was looking for a belt, but you have to be open minded when shopping thrift stores so I had other things on my mental list. No belt but I found a fleece pullover, zip windbreaker, yoga pants, shoes and a bracelet. It was 50% off Get a New Wardrobe day (which I didn't know so that is the serendipitous part) so I only spent $11.77. The dog is not thrifty, but is good at photo bombing!¬†Then I shopped for new running shoes for now and waterproof walking shoes for winter. Let's just say I have feet that are tricky and hurt easily so that was¬†money well spent and since I found them at REI I will get my 10% dividend¬†refund early next year. I walked the dog this morning in the running shoes and my feet were happy so money well spent.Its been grey here so I bought some flowers at¬†Trader Joe's and¬†made the bouquet larger with some Camilla branches from the yard. Cheered the house for almost a week.We went out to eat twice. After walking over to a street fair and listening to an excellent male acapella group, we decided to have a drink at a restaurant we hadn't been to and that turned into Cuban sandwiches for lunch too. Then we took advantage of a restaurant week special in a nearby neighborhood to go out for drinks and tapas at a restaurant I hadn't been to but DH had visited with a friend. A lovely evening out on a weekday. I'm¬†thinking¬†that we will start trying new recipes for Sunday night dinner to get out of our cooking rut and find some meals that we could prepare for guests. We are out of the habit of entertaining and would like to get back into it rather than only going out by ourselves.In my efforts to push myself to do more in many ways I have signed up for an archery lesson orientation for this coming Saturday. I¬†have enjoyed archery whenever I tried it so this¬†is a candidate for a new hobby. They have lessons available on Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoons once you complete the orientation and provide the equipment so I'm going to give it a try.Nothing much else planned this¬†week otherwise. I am going to¬†consider rejoining the gym as working out at home isn't working out. Otherwise it is catch up on house work, more yard work, more library volunteering, seeing if a friend wants to go to a photography exhibit and then have coffee.¬†Deal with my to do list that doesn't inspire me.¬†Take dog to the vet for her monthly shot for her Addison's disease. That archery orientation. Find a place to get a free flu shot as my Dr. doesn't have the vaccine yet. A Craftsy class I bought and haven't taken yet. Look for that belt I need.

His wife is taking very good care of him this time! All good news for this Mom.Four opportunities to socialize this week made me a happier woman. Three were library volunteer work related: 2 donation sorting mornings and a Friends of the Library board meeting where we were able to not only agree to pay for all remaining adult, senior and youth programs for this year but also give $7,500 to buy additions to the collection. We have the best volunteers who help run our used book sales three times a year and donate money as well.The fourth social event was last night; a surprise 60th birthday party for a friend. She was in fact surprised and it was a lovely party and evening.I've been taking longer walks with and without the dog as planned and also spent yesterday morning doing yard work by pruning almost every bush in the front yard. This morning is the back yard and yard work will continue to dominate the week. The weather has cooled, no rain and the leaves aren't falling thick and fast yet so it is the perfect time to whip the yard into shape and get some exercise as well.I am hoping that we will spend this afternoon walking over to a nearby small business area for an Open Streets event with performers and food. This is becoming popular here and involves closing a section of street to traffic and encouraging pedestrians. I looked at the performance schedule and there are going to be acoustic drummers, a cappella singers, and lots more to see. Hope you had a good week and have something fun happening this weekend."},

{"title": "That pesky planning for 2015 finances and goals", "date": "Wednesday, September 10, 2014", "text": "Once again my father in law took a sleeping pill and a few hours later got out of bed to use the facilities and fell. He wasn't hurt thank goodness, but had to call for assistance in getting up. So the place he lives had to notify us (on the other side of the country) and that was at 3:30am. I couldn't go back to sleep and am really shattered as the Brits would say.Forging ahead I grabbed an extra cup of coffee and went to the library to put in my time sorting, pricing and packing donated books and media items for our next Friends of the Library sale and am happy to note that the one over Labor Day weekend made $5475+ which was a good take. The donations keep coming like a flood though so we are on to preparing for the next one. Then I went out to lunch with a friend as I still needed to go to the grocery store and drugstore on that side of town. Right now I am debating the wisdom of a nap vs. more coffee. Even the dog has decided on an early nap as I messed up her sleep schedule too.Yesterday I started¬†thinking about next year's finances and family goals. I am trying to cut back in some areas so we can save even more and still travel as much as we want and need to. So far I have eliminated life insurance for me due to my inheritance and not bringing in any income that needs replacing.¬†We will keep hubby's as he is¬†working through 2017 and since he hasn't started receiving his pension the amount I would get as a widow would be smaller than the survivor's share once he is.I also really looked at my clothing situation and came up with a very short list of things I actually NEED - waterproof walking shoes for winter, replacement running shoes and sandals in the spring and some underwear. I am going to take a sewing with knits Craftsy course so I will be making some items as an interesting challenge and hobby for myself. If I actually limit my shopping to that my clothing budget will be low. Hubby needs to replace much of his wardrobe as he has lost weight he didn't need or want to lose due to a chronic illness and has reconciled to not being able to put it back on in the foreseeable future. He gets the bulk of the clothing budget.We have to decide what to do about the need for a retaining wall in a hidden area of our yard. I am leaning towards shoring up what is there rather than spending a lot on a new one. I want to spend money on travel - at least 2 visits each to N and S California to see our kids and other family, one trip to NH to see family and a vacation trip to Santa Fe or NYC. Hubby will probably go see his Dad at least 2 additional times so it adds up quickly.However, I am confident that our gift budget will be much smaller as we have no planned large gifts to family. No planned technology upgrades, no planned home improvements or large repairs and no planned new large health care expenses for us or the dog. There are always¬†unplanned ones though aren't there? So right now our bottom line for next year looks good and planning is all I can do.Although I won't know what increases we have in health, car and home insurance costs, property taxes, cable fees, etc. until later, I do know they will all go up. Starting to think about where to spend vs. where to save may also help out this last quarter of 2014.Have you started thinking about your budget or plans for next year? How do you approach it?I was talking to someone this morning who is heading off soon on vacation and you would think they were being taken to a dreadful event or place. Anticipatory negativity - not worth the effort. Why think like that when you can be grateful and look for the good in what has happened, what you have and what is ahead?So I am going to go through my 65th year with the \"I'm such a lucky girl!\" attitude. Right now I am thinking I am lucky to -¬†Have had these two as parents! My cousin gave me this photo of my parents probably taken before my brother was born as he is not in the photo.

She wanted to play with Dabney, the little chocolate mini poodle, who is such a friendly dog. If they had a fenced yard they would have such a great time as they have the same energy level. Then she ignored the gray standard poodle named Rufus - she knows him and he was on the other side of the street. But the white and black standards were of her same vigilant disposition and barked first I must say! So she showed them what she was made of and we moved on home.More bark arrived in Hubby's car - 14 bags worth that he hauled to the yard and I spread on the bare spots. We need at least that many more bags to finish the targeted area and that was the third load as it is! A big back yard. We have no grass and¬†southeastern neophytes that we were thought that was a good idea when we bought the house. Coming from the southwest who needs grass.

We went to our favorite Thai restaurant and checked out there expanded and redecorated dining space. It is lovely and much less crowded in the seating areas. They don't have new photos up yet on their website but we really enjoyed the new space and the food as always.Today is focused on bits and pieces of catching up inside.

Our talking more often and deeply is something great that has come out of our Mom's death.I thought to stream KJAZZ from Cal State Long Beach all morning and loved the music as we did when we lived nearby.The dog loved (!!!) her bath as always. She starts \"talking\" as soon as the towels come out and then jumps into the tub as soon as I take her collar off. She knows the routine and helps with each stage including the hair dryer. When all is finished and her collar back on, she runs laps around the house and then is high, playful energy for hours. I will plan on giving her them more often in the future just because she enjoys it so much. And half the house was clean which is pretty good considering my aches and pains. The massage was lovely and worth every penny.Today is more book sorting, pricing and packing but I am going to be very careful so my back stays mending.

I Googled the park and then the memories really came flooding back. The short trail with 140 steps, the ledge where the turkeys used to roost, the rock outcropping along the river's edge where we found the fossil I still have, and especially the ladders you have to climb from the gorge bottom up to the cliffs on one trail. Amazingly they are still part of that trail - they seemed much taller when I was a child though!I need a writing sample to read out loud at the start of the writing workshop I am attending at the end of the month. It is being led by author Janisse Ray and held at my friends' N. Georgia retreat center. I will focus on nature and memoir writing so I am taking time to think about Mom and write about her. Here's the start:She loved birds, being a homemaker, her children, dogs, herdaughter in law and son in law, Turkey Run, her friends, going out to eat, hergrandsons and great granddaughter, reading, art, cookies and ice cream, havingseen parts of the world, history, old sitcoms and movies, shopping for newthings, day trips, letters, Simon Pearce restaurant, her library and localhistorical society, her nieces and nephews, her Aunt Juanita, trees, her Dadand Step Mom, getting new clothes, laughing, plays, talking about her past, decoratingthe house, flowers, and my Dad. Oh how she loved my Dad. And she wascourageous. That is what I wrote when I was brainstorming how topersonalize my Mom‚Äôs obituary after she died this past April. It didn‚Äôt allmake it into the obituary but part of what has been running through my mindsince then is that she loved birds, flowers, and going to Turkey Run. I haveremembered how she was my introduction to loving nature.As an adult I tended to think more about how we weredifferent than about what we shared. Since she died in April what keeps poppinginto my head is the fact that my love of nature was nurtured by her. She wasvery connected to the earth and noticed every bird, flower, tree, and animal ‚Äìall the things alive around her. Dad share her interest in birds and animalsbut he was less tethered to the ground. He shared his joy in flying through theair and traveling across water. Mom pointed out the small wonders of the worldand shared her favorite places.As a small child we would take little journeys early in theSpring to the piece of yard under my bedroom window to see if the violets wereup and blooming. They always seemed to be available for putting in the Maybaskets that she had me weave from strips of paper and hang on our neighbors‚Äôdoors.In the summer she showed us how to catch fire flies in jarsthat had holes punched in the lids and we would use them as nightlights in theyard and then let them go before bed. Then there were the day trips to Turkey Run state park inIndiana. We always took a hike. When I was little it was the trail along theriver that crossed using the covered bridge. Usually there was a deer sitingfor added adventure. As I got older we went on the harder trails including onethat required climbing wooden ladders up a cliff from the trail in the ravinebottom. I was sure those would be no longer there (insurance you know) but Ijust looked on line and they are definitely still part of the trail. Wow, thosephotos really dredged up nice memories of walking and climbing in thosespecific spots. Part of the fun besides the geology, animals, river and hikingwas that this was one place where my Mom let go of her fears that someone wouldget hurt. She never admonished us to be careful when we were there. I left home right after high school and throughout the restof her life I received letters and calls that talked about the birds andanimals she had seen or the flowers that were just planted or blooming. Whenshe came to visit us wherever we lived she always wanted to know the names ofthe birds, plants and trees that were different than the ones she knew.Memorizing facts has never been a strength of mine so I rarely could answer.That has created an ongoing joke and favorite memory. We were all at our house in Glendale and she saw a smallbrown bird outside the kitchen window. Probably some kind of sparrow or wrenbut then most birds in Southern California tend to be brownish. She asked mewhat kind of bird it was and of course I didn‚Äôt know. It was thus declared aLBB ‚Äì little brown bird forever. Even in the last year of her life she wouldrefer to seeing LBBs out her window and I loved that connection."},

{"title": "Thinking about investments for retirement - what a hard job!", "date": "Friday, June 27, 2014", "text": "I just spent a couple of hours thinking through how to change our investments to incorporate my inheritance. What a hard job this is!I asked myself several questions.When will we need money and how much do I anticipate we will need at each point?How will we fund catastrophic health problems and/or long term care?What is our current non-retirement account investment mix?How much risk can we tolerate and still sleep at night?What is reasonably available as investments right now with low or no associated fees?So here is how I thought it through. I am very curious how others are thinking about these things as they prepare to enter retirement or manage their finances in the early years of retirement.When will we need money and how much do I anticipate we will need at each point?When hubby retires from his current job at the end of 2017 we plan to sell our house and relocate back to California. There will be lots of costs associated with this. In addition, there is an unknown period of time between when he retires and when his pension will start being paid as there is a retirement processing backlog for Federal pensions at this time. We will need cash flow then.How will we fund catastophic health problems and/or long term care?We have been holding on to our term life insurance as a way to fund these. Now I am going to use a 5-year CD ladder as this fund.¬†What is our current non-retirement¬†account investment mix?We have CDs and I bonds as well as savings accounts. Some are performing relatively well and others aren't.¬†How much risk can we tolerate?We are pretty risk averse but trying to push ourselves to deal with the risk that we actually are losing money due to inflation and taxes.What is reasonably available as¬†investments right now with low or no fees?I expect to create a 5-year CD ladder, hold on to some I bonds¬†that are returning decent rates of return and keep some money in savings for cash flow spikes. I also going to invest in¬†one of Vanguard's target date retirement index funds¬†as well, but still need to decide which one to use. Where is that crystal ball when I need it LOL!I realize that we are really fortunate to be able to have this challenge at all. However, I don't want to squander the money that has been accumulated by our hard work as well as the hard work of my parents and maternal grandparents. In addition we come from very long lived families and reasonable need to fund 30 more years of life. That's the proposal I am presenting to Hubby tonight. If you have thoughts or experiences to share I'd love to hear them."},

I¬†thought about it when I broke my favorite coffee mug and realized I really don't enjoy using any of the others that we have. I could give those away and only have one that is just right and drinking my coffee in the morning would definitely be more enjoyable. Perhaps I out to buy 2 though the previous one lasted many years.I¬†thought about it when I was contemplating how to deal with the family photos from my Mom's and in storage boxes and on our computer. I have decided to make photo albums of¬†a carefully curated selection of photos using Snapfish. I will make note cards or calendars using photos of my art. Then I will get rid of all the print and digitized photos except for the best ones to save as a backup. This is a huge project but I will be happy to have photo books to look at instead of unused photos stored away.I thought about it when I cancelled my gym membership and pulled out old exercise equipment and dvds. I started walking the dog more and am going to create a home based exercise routine and take more walks with friends.Instead of focusing on decluttering, frugality or happiness,¬†I am going to focus on improving my lifestyle in this way."},

Now to the hard stuff. I managed to feed us dinner this first week of our additional requirement of \"gout prevention\" dietary challenge (along with no milk, low cholesterol, low salt, low sugar) and discovered some new and delicious main dishes. You'll see it was all very heavy on veggies and light on protein. For example, when we had turkey burgers we each had one half of a burger. When you are limited to 4 to 6 oz. of meat/fish/cheese per day that isn't much. Nuts, yogurt, tofu¬†and soy milk don't seem to need to be counted in that - hope I'm correct about that. For the first time we coordinated planning what Hubby made for his lunch and what we had for dinner. He is having less pain in his foot but who knows if diet is making any difference. He is not on any medication except ibuprofen as needed so perhaps it is. The whole point of this is to lower his uric acid level enough so that his body will reabsorb the crystals deposited in his toe joint.So what did we eat?Monday ‚Äì Ate out: Thai restaurant - hubby had veggies with tofu and riceTuesday‚Äì Healthified seared tilapia with lemon tarragon sauce(delicious), pasta, zucchini, peachesWednesday ‚Äìveggie salad w goat cheese and pecans, watermelon/peach/kiwisaladThursday ‚Äì turkey burgers, roasted new potatoes, steamed carrots& snap peas, sliced tomatoesFriday ‚Äì steamed mixed veggies (carrots, snap peas, summersquash, broccoli), saut√©ed Savoy cabbage & red pepper, brown rice, cucumber& radish salad, orange slicesSaturday ‚Äì pasta sauce (leftover turkey burger, bell peppers& tomatoes), fruit salad, marinated golden beetsSunday ‚Äì chef salad (heavy on chopped veggies & light onchicken), fruit salad"},
{"title": "Wardrobe: A casual summer in \"Hotlanta\"", "date": "Sunday, June 22, 2014", "text": "I'm retired, we prefer casual entertainment and I am not a dress up kind of person. I've also discovered that I prefer to have a small wardrobe (Thanks Project 333). In the summer the news calls Atlanta by the label \"Hotlanta\" which only reflects part of the weather. The other part is humidity unless it is too hot to be too humid.So my summer 2014 small wardrobe by design has turned out to be two capsule wardrobes plus some denim that goes with both. It is two because of the color combos. Right now I have a preference for this one and anything I add going forward will be in these colors - blue, white and black.This capsule is good enough for everyday even though some of the tops don't flatter my complexion and best style. I also don't really like khakis but they sure are versatile and don't collect lint and dog hair. Eventually I will merge the tops that remain in good condition with the other wardrobe. I've done some alterations and refashioning so some of these items fit better and I will either wear them out or decide they no longer fit my wardrobe. I think that totals 43 items. I will weed some out as I go and I may try color remover on some of the bottoms to make them white to fit in with the other capsule and perhaps dye them and some of the tops. Shooting for 33 first!And then there are the denim shorts and capris. Add to that a black short sleeve sweater, an orange 3/4 sleeve sweater, fuchsia pashima,¬†black sandals, flip flops (sand color), tan Keds and pewter flats. Occasionally I wear a¬† bracelet¬†and pick from these 3. They all were my Mom's at some point and I like the style and colors.I am in the process of making a summer cotton skirt that I hope will work out and go with several of the tops that I already have. I have fabric to make a dress or top and skirt in addition to that, but we'll see when that happens!In the meantime this wardrobe¬†is enough with the addition of my yard work¬†and exercise wear.UPDATE (already!): I have removed 3 tops that I am always fussing at as they don't fit quite right. I forgot to count a pink pashima, belts (2) and hats (3) so I am at 43 items. I printed out a list and will check off the ones I wear between now and the end of August. I'll remove anything I don't wear.26. Hubby fixed wood rot above the back door overhang27. Sprayed invasive plants in wooded area28.

It doesn't have the purine levels¬†but I've made a spread sheet and other cheat sheets based on research based dietary advice that actually showed the purine levels of food as well as providing general guidance.

Well that changed this past two weeks as we started talking about where to invest the money I will inherit from my parent's estate (thanks Mom and Dad! I'd rather have you still around though.). That discussion led to creating a spread sheet of each different savings account, CD, bond or retirement fund with the associated rate of return this past year. Yikes.We are conservative investors and pretty risk adverse yet we also know that inflation and taxes are currently nullifying what we are earning if not diminishing the principal as well. So we moved one retirement fund to a target date fund that is about 50% in stocks at the moment but will have a slowly decreasing percentage invested in them over time.¬† That still leaves us with¬†conservative investments overall and we know we missed the stock market party of the last few years. Sigh.It is so difficult to balance all of the economic projections, our risk tolerance, inflation, projected longevity, etc. and make what seems to be the \"right\" decision. I know we are truly fortunate to have this problem but it is a problem none the less!Still undecided as to the appropriate investment for my inheritance but I am leaning towards a target date lifecycle Vanguard fund to minimize annual fees and hopefully have¬†a balanced investment. We never factored this money into our retirement financial planning so we are hoping it can sit and grow for at least most of the rest of our lives. It will be our self funded long term care insurance most likely.How do you make investment decisions? How often do you review them? Do you look at your total financial picture before making changes or only at the specific investment?"},

Sold my Mom's wedding/engagement rings, loose diamonds¬†and some other estate¬†jewelry. Tip: find a diamond broker to sell to rather than going to a jewelry store as they will buy a wider range of gems and pay more for the gold.22. Replaced shower door \"sweep\" with one bought through internet after the local company I tried to use was unresponsive. The sweep is the vinyl piece that fits in the bottom of the door to keep the water inside and the old one was warped and grungy.In addition to the above, I did the following.- Ate all dinners at home - that is an accomplishment for us. Since we have company next week and will be showing them around and taking them out, this was a good week to stay home.- We are now on the summer electricity rate plan which means rates are higher from 2 to 7 pm on weekdays. I have adjusted when I do laundry, run the dishwasher and use the computer to use the low rate time only. Nothing I can do about air conditioning, but I am opening the windows/doors and running the whole house fan in the morning if it is cooler outside than inside and not too humid. Also am using small fans to cool area where I am instead of turning down AC to a lower temperature in the afternoon.- We stopped drinking beer and wine as a result of Hubby's gout and the¬†research that shows not drinking and/or drinking very little beer can help prevent future¬†episodes.- ¬†Bought a discounted gift certificate for a haircut and a CVS gift card for¬†10% savings on each.- Submitted on-line application for Medicare Part A.- Remembered to ask if had accumulated enough points for a free dog grooming and was far past number needed. Dog was groomed for free except for tip for the groomer.- Let my sons and DILs decide what would work best for our family visit. They decided to all meet in Pasadena over Labor Day weekend so it would include my 65th birthday! We are going to rent a house through Airbnb so that the 4 of us who don't live there can stay comfortably.

The conundrum is that they are at both ends and our kids both have recently started new jobs so time off is probably not an option for them. That means seeing them on weekends and older relatives during the week. We have thought of 4 scenarios to handle this so far.1. Ask the family in N CA to come to S CA for the weekend and all celebrate together followed or preceded by a side trip somewhere.2. Go to visit one part of the family then and the other in about 6 weeks later.3. Plan a long trip that includes two weekends and go somewhere else in the middle.4. Go somewhere else in the country entirely - Santa Fe or New York City are thoughts.We are stymied a bit as to where to go for our side trip if we go to CA as we have been many places in CA on vacation while living there for decades. We thought of Monterey as an option as it would be cooler. Palm Springs is an option if we go twice. Ideas? How would you coordinate a trip like this? Where would you suggest going? I want it to be fun and not outrageously expensive."},

Right now not many squirrels are out and about at 8 am so it isn't too stressful for me as she does lunge at squirrels. Don't know if she would without us having emphasized her squeaky squirrel toy which is her absolute favorite. Probably she would!- I found a pair of shorts and a nice shirt on sale.

She said she will think of Mom and her departed husband every time she looks at it.- We donated her clothes to a charity, two chairs to the local library and are trying to find someone who couldn't afford to buy one to donate her electric recliner (helps you stand up) to so that they can live a better life now.- We identified silver, jewelry and¬†some antiques to try to sell. I get the fun of trying to sell the jewelry. My brother gets the silver and antiques as I couldn't easily bring them home in my car.- We identified someone who will buy the contents of houses. After the house is under contract we will get an estimate. We may need a second buyer for what they don't want.- What remains will be donated.That is it. We like to keep things simple and since there was little of significant value we can do so.

{"title": "Part Four: Deciding what to keep after a parent dies", "date": "Saturday, May 17, 2014", "text": "I decided to drive to my Mom's house for three reasons: I simply felt like I had to make this a journey, especially the leaving. I wanted to put a physical limit on what I would bring home. I wanted to have an open ended timeframe.I also went with the idea that I would bring home 4 of my Dad's pastels, family photographs, a family marble sculpture and two items my Dad fixed up for my childhood bedroom. We also had a list of things we could potentially use in our home or that might be an upgrade from what we have.The surprise was that once I really looked at the childhood objects I did not want them. The same with the sculpture which is quite fragile at this point as it was made by a great-grandfather - my brother took it as he lives nearby. The memory of them all was better than the current reality. I did take the pastels and some framed photographs, but we stored all of the photo albums and some framed photographs that need to be copied as well as genealogical materials. That will all require time on another visit.What surprised me was what I wanted instead. A vase Mom treasured. Needlework that she, my Grandma, and I had each done. Some jewelry including an antique ring I had never seen that belonged to my maternal grandmother. A fossil I had as a child. A rarely used set of dishes with 12 servings (our old ones will be donated).¬†Binoculars, recipes in a large wooden box. Decorative items to change up our home a bit. A rattan chair I had always liked. Wine glasses as ours seem to be getting broken by guest lately. I'm sure there are other small practical items that I am forgetting to list as I am in the process of putting things away.As I think about what I wanted to take home it seems they fall into several categories.- Art and needlework made by loved ones.- Objects that remind me of a loved ones and that I like as well.- Useful items that we had been thinking about buying or will use up over time.- Random decorative items or furnishings that will spruce up our home and we both like.I am very glad I had thought about what I might want before I arrived at Mom's house and equally glad that I let myself change my mind. I know many people have difficulty going through and letting go of a loved one's belongings. In fact while we were going through the house we heard about someone who has had a portable storage unit full of stuff from their parent's house in their driveway for years. Others were said to have taken three years to get around to clearing out a house. I can't imagine that it gets easier with time. Of course I strongly believe that life is for the living and that we only have now.¬†I also¬†believe memories are more powerful and greater than things but I know many others feel differently.The size of my car was a good limiting factor and believe me it was packed full for the drive home. The only items I brought home that I am not sure what to do with is some of the needlework as the colors are odd for our home. We are also considering whether or not we can and want to actually hang all of the framed¬†photographs. I am not regretting leaving the items that I thought I would want and happy that I didn't try to add more stuff to our home.As a friend told me when I said I was starting at unpacked boxes after arriving home - \"It can wait. Stuff can't love you back.\""},

She wanted to be able to appreciate the support and memories and not be so deep in grief that she couldn't be present for them. She did select the town historical society as the place for donations to be sent and that worked out.This time my brother and I talked and decided that, since Mom had been very involved with her local library for the 30 years she lived in town,we would make that the focus of her memorial. We wanted to do something that would be lasting and speak to who she was. We talked to the librarian and some board members to find out what this very small town library had on their wish list. Two things on the wish list were appealing to us: an upholstered chair for the children's room and restoration of a¬†circa 1890 painting by a (at that time) well known local woman artist, Adelaide Palmer. The library owns two of her works and was hoping to have them restored and hung in time for the¬†town's 250th anniversary celebration this August. We were able to help with the chair situation by donating two from Mom's home. That didn't feel like a memorial though.However, the painting¬†awaiting restoration funding was perfect. - By a woman artist - my Mom painted some. - There is a companion photo of the artist painting this work - Mom's family owned a photography studio and retail store where she worked at various times. - It is of mountain laurel in bloom - Mom loved flowers. - It will be hung on the wall you see entering the library - Mom loved to walk into that space and talk¬†with her friends including other volunteers and board members.We decided that the¬†painting would be restored in her memory. The library board will hang a plaque with her name, etc. under the painting. I think we were lucky that the idea came together and was such a great fit for us as well as our budget. We were also able to say in her obituary that¬†the library was the place for donations to be sent and I know some family members¬†and friends have done so which is terrific.¬†In the end we knew this was the right memorial because we felt such a glow after seeing the painting and making our decision. We know Mom would¬†think it was perfect and that is what makes it right for us."},
{"title": "Part Two: Going through your parent's house", "date": "Thursday, May 15, 2014", "text": "We had to go through my Mom's house soon after her death if we were going to get the house on the market during the prime selling season in her area. So Hubby and I got in the car and took three days to drive to my brother's house. We could have done it in 2 days and in fact I did make it home in two. However we took the time to enjoy a part of the country that we hadn't seen before and particularly enjoyed the drive through central Virginia - I think it was the Shenandoah Valley - during spring. After the first half day all of the drive was new to us. Surprisingly we were able to set aside our grief and have a little vacation for ourselves. This was good because the next 7 days were hard work both physically and emotionally.¬† I do have to mention though that we did not work on the house for 7 days straight as we had appointments with bankers, etc. and visited relatives and friends as well as those coffee and pastry breaks I mentioned.Our goal with the house was to prepare it for listing for sale and showing by realtors. To do this we had to:- Identify paperwork that needed to be saved.- Find my Mom's ring that she had stored somewhere for safekeeping.-¬†Identify and remove the items we or our children wanted to keep or that we would sell separately through specialized sources¬†(e.g. jewelry or antiques).- Pack and donate or gift items that we weren't going to sell. - Take to recycling or trash the appropriate items. - Do a little cleaning and stagingTo figure out the best way to approach this I had talked to my son about his experience working for a firm that helps seniors downsize or heirs go through homes. I also did a bit of online research regarding how best to approach this job. In the meantime my brother collected boxes and packaging materials as well as researching how to sell what was left of her furniture, decorative items and kitchen ware. We were all quite familiar with our parent's belongings and both thought in advance about what we might want for ourselves or our children. We had 1 1/2 days where there would be the four of us working and then my Hubby had to fly home to go back to work. It turned out to be wonderful to have the four of us working together. When one of us was feeling especially emotional it turned out that the others weren't so we helped each other through it. We stopped and had lunch together each day and went out for coffee in the afternoon and that was great. My SIL made sure we had delicious picnic lunches each day.It would have been so hard to do it alone as I found out the couple of times later in the week when I went to the house by myself while my brother took care of other tasks. So I would highly recommend getting someone kind to help you if you are faced with doing this by yourself.Here is how we chose to approach this task. I hope this helps someone else.- We took to heart my son's suggestion to finish a room before moving on. By finish he meant to remove all items you had made decisions about. - We designated¬†areas where we would place the items each family wanted and those we couldn't decide on quickly. The idea of having a place to put things you weren't sure you wanted was a great one as it kept us moving forward. Over time the decisions about those items became easier.- We also decided where to move the items we were selling separately, donating or¬†gifting,¬†and those that were to go to recycling or trash (areas in the garage in our case). - First my brother and I walked through and discussed the items we already had in mind to take to make sure the other person did not really want it. This was easy for us and we are fortunate that way.- Then we walked through the house and each took framed photographs, handmade items or gifts that were primarily of or from one family or the other. Framed photos that we both wanted¬†were packed¬†in a storage container for later copying. - We did the same walk through together with our spouses to split up the art work done by our parents and other decorative items. We left art that we did not personally want hanging on the wall and later returned to it to take photos to send to the grandchildren so that they could pick what they wanted. Then we took the photographed artwork to my brother's house to await their decisions.- Then my SIL and I started going through Mom's clothing while the guys helped pack it up and also packed up the jewelry to take to my brother's house to be gone through in the evening. If you go through someone's clothing remember that you need to check each¬†pocket as you go. We had a laugh over this because rather than money all we found in pockets was Kleenex!- While my brother and Hubby cleaned the outside entrance to the house and the screened porch, my SIL and I went through the upstairs bathroom, kitchen, china cabinets and writing desk.- We kept on going through each room in this two story house the same way on other days. We found that we could consolidate items to make later action easier. All cleaning supplies went into the coat closet, all bedding and other linens in one linen closet, etc. - We packed up all paperwork and took it to my brother's house to go through in the evenings.- We left until the end all of the old photo albums and slides, genealogical records and other things that will take a lot of time to review. Fortunately there is room at my brother's home for storing them as we ran out of the ability to make any more decisions! If there was no place to store them I would have had them shipped to my home as there was not the emotional bandwidth available to go through them in a thoughtful way at that time.- We left in the home for now the larger furniture items my brother and SIL are taking. They will move them in a week or two. We took everything else that was being removed to their house, to where it was being donated or gifted, packed it in my car or had it picked up by recycling/trash.I'm sure I am forgetting something but this is what stands out in my mind. If you have other suggestions that might help someone else please add them in the comments."},

My Mom was in the hospital or a skilled nursing facility for two months before she died so they had removed perishable items¬†and done laundry as well as other things.

We buried our Mom and arranged for carving of the headstone she shares with our Dad and for a gravestone. We dealt with the paperwork to change bank and investment accounts to our names only. We made phone calls about other accounts and services and returned her cable TV box. We interviewed and selected a realtor. We visited and made a memorial donation to her local library (more about that in Part 3). We visited our sole surviving aunt and one of our cousins and Mom's best friend. We drank quite a bit of wine and went to King Arthur Bakery for pastries and coffee at least four times. We talked more than we had in decades as we had more time to do so than living in different parts of the country has made that difficult.We also prepared her house for sale and removed all personal items as well as most of the things that we wanted to keep. We packed my car with the things I was bringing home (more about that in Part 4), moved items to my brother's home¬†and left some things in storage at my brother's home so that we can go through them together during a later visit. We went into it with a plan and goals for what we needed to get done and how we would all work at it together (more on that in Part Two).Mom's engagement pictureMom & Dad on their wedding day in 1945¬†What we didn't do was argue or fight about who gets what.

Of course we wish she was still with us and we are glad she is not suffering.Here's some observations on the first week of grieving and starting to take care of all the things that have to be done.- It is hard to call people to let them know that your mother has died and the calls lead to lovely stories about their memories of her. Most of the stories I have heard so far are new to me and I am loving the spontaneity of the memories.- People want to do something to show their love. We are having a private burial and have decided to establish a memorial fund at her beloved local library to honor her. When people ask if they can send flowers and I tell them this is the plan they say \"Oh, she would have loved that.\" so we did the right thing.- I cried the day she died and since then I have known I was grieving primarily because my spine seems to have lost its ability to hold me¬†up straight. I told my husband I felt like a stuffed animal that had had half its stuffing removed. We all grieve differently and apparently my way this time is very physical. Walks are helping as is time with friends.- When you are a recovering perfectionist it is very important to be kind and gentle with yourself during a time of grief. I'm letting a lot of things slide and only doing as much as I want to or absolutely must do each day.- My parents really made settling the estate as easy for us as it possibly could be. Everything is in a trust so no probate, etc. The paperwork/legal involvement is minimal and we are so very grateful.- We do have to go through the house and personal belongings. Fortunately after my Dad died my Mom made it a mission to declutter as much as possible to leave us with less to do. Still a lot but oh how much harder it would have been if she didn't do that.- My brother and I really are working well together on this. He is there and I am far away (although I am going there to go through the house with him) so we are finding anything that can be done at a¬†distance and those are my share. Between the two of us we seem to have one sufficient brain in terms of knowing what to ask or do. It has been good to work together.I have heard so many stories of the difficulties - legal and familial - that other people have had after a parent died, but so far we haven't had any of those. That really, really is helping. Of course we are pretty much a \"no drama\" family anyway but the preparation that was done is making a huge difference.I would encourage everyone in our generation to really think about how well they have set up their own affairs and take time to do what you need to make it easy for those loved ones left behind."},

She loved her family and friends, dogs, reading and her library, traveling to new places, art, bird watching, learning, going out to eat and to plays, and so much more.

She has some severe and painful medical challenges ahead if she survives much longer so we are hoping she can leave us peacefully with as little pain as possible.My Dad died a few years ago and the realization has hit me that when Mom passes away then my brother and I will be the \"oldsters\" in our little family. The idea of having no one left who loved and remembers all about me from the day I was born is unsettling. I know though that I have been very fortunate to have parents who lived a very long time and until recently my Mom was fully present in and enjoying her life despite some health challenges.Something positive has come out of the last two months of her illness as my brother and I have talked on the phone very frequently as we navigate through this time with him being in the same town as Mom and me far away. We have shared more about our thoughts, values, concerns and feelings than ever in our life. Fortunately we have also worked as a team with no difficulty and I have been able to find ways to contribute and share a bit of her care long distance. As a result we are closer than we have ever been in our lives at least from my perspective.If you have become the eldest generation in your family recently through loss of a parent how has it changed your perspective?"},

So far we have had some mega veggie salads and a wonderful rainbow chard dish as well as zucchini sauteed with onions and garlic. I also made applesauce out of some apples that weren't sitting well in our stomachs when eaten raw. This afternoon I decided to deal with others in the bin so I washed all the rest of the salad greens and cooked the baby beets and beet greens. I mixed them together and added a bit of vinegar. We will have them tomorrow.Tonight is fish with leftover green salad and some sweet potato that I bought today. I plan on making a big batch of roasted veggies on Friday to use up a lot of what is left. I might actually make it through it all without tossing any!Cooking meal after meal is an interesting challenge. Sometimes I am diligent about making up a menu plan and shopping to it. Then I get tired of that and just buy what looks good as well as what we are out of and is on the list.

The frequency of her treatments may change as we get more experience with how she processes the corticoid steroid, but right now it is every 30 days at $60 per shot. She also gets Prednisone when she is under stress or much more active than usual. So when she is boarding at her former foster family while we go to Key West (yeah!) she will get a small dose each morning since she is much more active there with her doggie and cat friends available for playtime. I have some Prednisone left from the initial treatment when she was so sick a month ago and I have no idea how quickly she will go through this medicine in the future. She will also require a special blood test once a year to make sure she is not getting too much medicine which could affect her sodium levels.Too much information? That is just the start as we have to monitor her symptoms in case she needs treatment more or less frequently.I am aware that this is nothing compared to dealing with a chronic or progressive human illness, but we have talked before in this blog about the cost and benefits of pet ownership. We adore this dog and will take great care of her. However, if you just looked at the numbers though here it is. She is 5 years old in July. She could live past 15. So that is¬†over $7,200 of additional expenses for her care. She can still develop other illnesses or problems of aging and she still needs her annual checkup and shots, monthly preventative medications for fleas, etc. and has to be groomed routinely as well as fed and provided with squeaky toy squirrels LOL.So if you or a loved one is considering a pet in retirement make sure you are committed to the potential costs of their care. If you love pets please also consider supporting rescue groups and those that provide assistance to low income pet owners.In the meantime please excuse me as I have to go throw the tennis ball for a happy and energetic once again little dog!"},

In addition she has had mild dementia, mostly short term memory problems, for some time. It has been difficult to determine where she no longer could function although there were many spaces where she was just fine.Increasingly it became clear to me that there was a critical link between short term memory problems and ability to make decisions. If you can't remember the information you received although you discussed it clearly and rationally at the time it was¬†give, how can you make a good decision? No access to critical information means poor decisions.This all came to a head this week when she needed to agree to a medical procedure and couldn't do that. Fortunately we had medical power of attorney and the facility agreed that it was time to activate it. So now my brother and I are the decision makers. This is now causing her some distress unfortunately. The good news is we got two unnecessary medications removed from her daily regime and hopefully as they work their way out of her system we will see some improvement in her cognitive capability.I am not bringing this up because of my Mom's situation but because it is so hard to deal with slowly progressing dementia which may become significantly worse under stress or during an illness. How do we talk to our potential caregivers about when to take action? Do we all have medical powers of attorney in place? Why are healthcare providers so slow to address the implications of dementia in the oldest of patients?I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think we should all be thinking and talking about how to ensure good care for our loved ones and ourselves."},

Not that I don't know! My Mom and Dad really believed this as well as having to do so for many years earlier in their marriage do to financial concerns. Later on it was more due to being perfectionists! Fortunately my Mom has accepted that she has to hire people to do things for her at this stage of life but that is another story.There was a point where¬†we hired a housecleaner. We had a preschooler and a teenager who were involved in assorted activities that we supported, worked very long hours and just wanted some time to do other things that were more fun. We quickly found that the cost was not worth the time savings for us and went back to doing it ourselves. Of course both sons were also trained in all housekeeping skills and helped out and as adults they continue the tradition of doing most things themselves.So what have we done lately that is just routine for us. I mentioned renting the right saw so that Hubby could take down the damaged fence sections in the woods. I fixed a small hole in a favorite shirt so it will last another year hopefully and hand¬†washed an alpaca sweater rather than having it dry cleaned.¬†I used a box we had plus drawing paper for packing to ship a book sold on Amazon. Due to decluttering I was able to repurpose a small plastic storage container to hold small kitchen items making a drawer less cluttered.What to we outsource? Mostly things that are beyond our skill levels or current physical capabilities. There is a crew taking down our at risk trees. There will be a crew building a new retaining wall. However we first try to think through if there is a way we could do the work such as when we rented a saw rather than hiring someone to do the work.I am much less of a perfectionist than my parents yet continue to live this tradition.

I am grateful we can hire such a competent tree removal company. Do you think I can count the trees in my decluttering total, LOL?I've taken a positive step also by moving some of our cash to a higher interest rate CD although I made the mistake of using an online interest calculator and confirmed that we are still earning less than inflation even before taxes are factored into the equation.

There are only 5 that I¬†use regularly - 2 for grocery shopping, 1 for gym clothes, 1 for small item shopping,¬†and 1 for library books. Hubby really should keep one in his car too for¬†the occasions he stops for groceries. That would be a total of 5.Then there are all of the others. 3 canvas bags (2 of which I used to take when I walked to the farmer's market regularly), 1 vinyl tote I used to use for work before I retired,¬†and 3 other grocery totes that I don't like as much. In case you weren't counting that is 6 totes that aren't used regularly. Why do I have them? I either used them in the past and since they are small they have stuck around or they were gifts and I have trouble letting go of gifts even if I don't use them.They could go to good use elsewhere. We sell tote bags at the Friends of the Library book sales and the thrift store I like to support sells them as well.So here is a situation where I could almost cut in half the number of items we have in a category without any daily impact. I could actually cut it further and not have separate gym and library bags but I do like having them.So I'm letting go of¬†5 extra bags. I'm taking inspiration today from Janet at The Gardener's Cottage who wrote Having just enough¬†and only keeping what I am happy to see and actually use in the life I live right now.I'm very happy with our decluttering progress - 110 items out in 14 weeks.

Buying fresh flowers and¬†seasonal fruits and vegetables; NOT gardening although yard work continues- I want some tulips or daffodils in the house right now! But Whole Foods has them on sale March 7th so I'll wait.2. Writing and taking photos; NOT painting or drawing- I have 3 more paid for painting classes and if I do not want to go I don't have to. The money is gone.¬†I am going to soon put away the paints and get out the journal and camera.3. Taking long walks in the city; NOT driving somewhere to hike- We have been doing this every weekend the weather is good. Yesterday we walked a section of Peachtree St. in Midtown Atlanta and had lunch before heading home. 4. Art exhibits and live theater; NOT movies or outdoor festivals- We are getting season tickets to our favorite quirky theater and my 85 year old friend is going to join us.5. Doing small repairs on our house as needed; NOT remodeling for resale- I'm putting away the lists of remodeling ideas and the photos too. I am going to get that replacement strip for the bottom of the shower door this week.6. Exercising at the gym 2 to 3 times a week; NOT exercising with DVDs- This is going to be a priority starting this week. I'm keeping the DVDs for now.7. Taking dog on short walks and going on long walks without her- The dog likes the familiarity of the same route. I enjoy walking without her freaking out. A win-win. I do see a woman in my neighborhood taking very long walks several days a week and need to check out the clothes she wears and add good walking clothes to my wardrobe.8. Cooking similar¬†meals repeatedly and going out to eat more unusual foods; NOT cooking new recipes to get variety- I pretty much already do this. I just need¬†to stop feeling guilty about it.9. Shopping in thrift stores or local small stores; NOT going to the mall- I'm working on this.10. Wearing clothes I truly like and that fit how I spend my time now; NOT keeping things because they are still useful- I'm saying goodbye to you gray turtleneck that I keep tugging down and old suit jacket that is a great color but not a good fit for my life.11. Letting go of anything that doesn't fit into my life right now; NOT holding on to things because I might want them in a future version of my life¬†- Well that is pretty much what my decluttering project is about isn't it?Suggestions for additional goals?

This is one gigantic goal!So no hoarding or stockpiling, no extreme limits on the number of possessions, always considering the impact personally and globally of¬†deciding if and what to purchase, and defining carefully what is \"enough\" to bring happiness without being burdensome. It is a big goal because it requires really being aware of who I am and what I truly want right now and continuing to do that as time goes on. A very conscious mindset all the time is required I think although perhaps it will become a habit.Contentment. Fun rather than chores. True enjoyment of food and objects that are bought. Assessing the current usefulness of \"tools\" presently owned. By tools I mean all material objects.Shopping secondhand first.¬† Refining (curating?) the¬†collection of items acquired during the first 64 1/2 years of my life.¬†Experiences and people over things - hence our large travel budget. Knowing that gifts don't have to be kept. .And it means for me living with desires for acquisition for a while before buying. Not responding to those \"I want ....\" thoughts for at least a week.

Currently I have a home maintenance purchase list that looks like this:Plant fertilizerCompost?3 clothes hooks2 fluorescent tubesShower door bottom strip replacementI've been waiting for the discounted Home Depot gift card I purchased through the online resale market to arrive before going shopping and my list kept changing while I waited. I found some plant fertilizer stored away. I need to see if there is something lurking in the shed that I can use instead of buying compost. I found out¬†the light fixture by the washing machine in the basement is the problem not the light tubes and eventually the lights come on. If I had rushed to the store when each item popped into my head I would have even more things I don't need stored in the basement and shed. I also have a secondhand store shopping list. I bought 3 things on my list earlier this week when I went to my favorite thrift store that raises money for animal rescue groups. I also dropped off some things for them to sell.

Now I don't disagree with the numbers regarding the percentage of boomers who have little or no money saved for retirement but I find the doom and gloom approach of these articles to be useless. At the end of this article there were a few suggestions such as spend less now, get out of debt, etc. Pretty generic.How about some creative solutions for those who find themselves often due to circumstances out of their control with limited funds to live on in their retirement. Move to an inexpensive cost of living area. Share housing. Live where public transportation enables you to not have a car. Investigate the non-consumer movements such as The Compact, Not-Buying It, etc. In other words, use the same problem solving skills that have helped you get through difficult times so far in your life and be creative.I'm not saying that people shouldn't save like crazy - they should if possible. If we are lucky eventually we will face illness or disability or just be too old to work and need to live off of retirement funds. But really - how do these no hope for boomers articles help anyone?We have saved, will get Social Security and a small pension yet we still wonder if it will be enough. We started our careers in our early 30's after getting PhDs and then were raising a family. Serious saving started too late according to the articles and if we had believed that we wouldn't have saved what we have or paid off our mortgage.I would rather see articles that encourage people to start where they are and improve their situation. The media doesn't do those articles often but there are great blogs that can help with ideas and success stories."},

The branch laying on the ground but still rooted had started a new, healthier plant so Hubby transplanted it and we are hopeful it will take. The same thing happened earlier in the week when I noticed a low stalk on the oak leaf hydrangea. When I went to cut it off I found it was broken cut still alive so I stuck it in the ground nearby to create a new plant.I have sworn off buying note paper, journals, etc. with the only purchases to be printer paper and cards as needed. So when I signed up for a July writing workshop that asked us to bring our journal I was wondering what to substitute. I have some tablets of paper but they are harder to carry and keep intact. Then I helped sort out book donations to the Friends of the Library and there was a blank journal with the spine broken but the pages still intact. We wouldn't put it out to sale but I can certainly use it! It even has a nice cover.These little events brought me smiles. Now I am hoping to come up with something colorful to replace the broken wind chime that was hanging outside from a tree. We can't figure out how to remove the chain that was already hanging from a high branch when we bought the house 16 years ago so we keep hanging something decorative from it LOL. Hmmm, I wonder if the tree removal crew could figure out how to unhook it when they are here next week. I'll have to remember to ask as that is my first choice and I know they would if they can.Any fortuitous events or surprises in your life recently?"},

Things to be grateful about so far - - My dog is doing very well with the cortisone supplements. We have been fascinated to learn what the adrenal gland does and how vital cortisol is to our and dogs (probably all mammals) lives. Thank goodness for a smart vet. She actually wanted to play a bit last evening. However the medication makes her very thirsty and she woke me up at 4:30am to let her out. She is back asleep but that isn't my fate LOL.- The weather is perfect so we have been doing outside chores. I've been doing some yard work and Hubby dealing with house maintenance. It is supposed to get up to 71 today so I plan more yard work and possibly a walk on The Beltline although I expect lots and lots of other people will have the same idea and it will be crowded.-¬†I was very tired when it came time to consider dinner and had stuck in my head that I wanted to eat salmon which we didn't have. We went to our favorite Thai restaurant just up the street and both were very happy with our dinners.

I am really looking forward to it and it¬†is¬†an early 65th birthday present to myself.The not so good part of the weekend is primarily that my Mom went into the hospital Friday as her ongoing health problems have worsened. Hopefully they can find solutions for her. The irony is that she is enjoying not having to prepare her own meals and says the hospital food is quite good so far. Thank goodness for my brother who lives nearby and is quite the trooper in these situations. It is hard to be so far away and know that there isn't anything you could really do to change the situation even if you were there in person. I am talking to her daily and my brother is very good about keeping me informed so I am grateful for that.

{"title": "My dog and President Kennedy: The unexpected costs of pet ownership", "date": "Friday, February 21, 2014", "text": "Our little poodle is always exhausted after her time at \"camp\" while we are on vacation. Visiting your former foster family and playing wildly with their dogs and cat is great fun but wears her out. Kind of like a kid at camp.This time when we picked her up rather late at night we got a subdued greeting and she looked very tired. Ok - maybe we woke her up and she was exhausted. The next morning she was moving slowly, wouldn't take her treat and had no interest in playing. Off to the vet and we all decided she had hurt her back or simply had weekend athlete sore muscles. The next day she had thrown up at least 3 times and wasn't eating much or drinking water although she did rally for a short walk. Then she laid down and started shaking. Back to the vet.Xray and blood test later there is the diagnosis that she has Addison's disease as did President Kennedy. Basically her adrenal gland is producing zero cortisol and possibly not producing the hormone that regulates electrolytes (potassium and sodium). However her low level of electrolytes could be because she¬† wasn't keeping water down and was very dehydrated.¬†They re-hydrated her and gave her a cortisone injection and a pill for the electrolytes after running another test to get a definitive diagnosis which will be delivered this morning. Given how much better she was after this treatment I can't believe the initial diagnosis will be proven wrong. A great explanation of the disease and treatment can be found here.¬†(Update: The test showed she isn't producing any cortisol so now we just have to get her back to normal and figure out her maintenance dosages. She is doing much better today.)The disease is treatable with monthly cortisone injections and possibly Prednisolone pills either daily or when under stress (boarding, grooming, etc.). With treatment she should have a normal lifespan. That means she will have monthly injections and possibly daily pills for 10 plus years which brings me back to the unexpected costs of pet ownership. We are fortunately in the position that we can handle the cost of her care readily, but many people can't. It is easy to take on a pet and they are great fun and bring lots of love and joy to your life. It can be much harder to decide how to handle an expensive illness or injury when they need care.I was talking to a neighbor about my poor pup and we decided there were probably three options for most people in these situations. First, if you can, you can pay for the animal's care and, if needed, possibly negotiate a reduced rate or payment plan. Another possibility is to utilize a veterinary school's clinic for reduced cost care if that is available. There are no vet schools in Atlanta but the Humane Society does operate a clinic and perhaps that would provide reduced cost care if we needed it.If you really can't pay for the care then you could decide to have the pet euthanized. Always a very difficult decision for me even when the best choice when the animal is suffering terribly and can't be treated and will die soon anyway.The third option would be to work with the vet and/or a rescue group to find someone who can afford the care required and who will adopt your pet.¬†I don't know that I would have thought of this option but my neighbor brought it up and I think it is a good alternative if needed. I have heard of cases where it worked out for the animal and humans.I don't want to discourage anyone from taking on a pet in retirement, but think it is important to be realistic about your financial situation. Pets bring great joy and carry a lifelong responsibility in my opinion. There are other ways to enjoy pet companionship if you can't afford to have one yourself. Offer to take your neighbor's dog for a walk or pet sit when they need it. Volunteer at your Humane Society or with a rescue group. Assist with a dog training course or pet event. Be creative in your solutions either in pet ownership or accessing time with animals other ways."},

Of course fire was also a possibility.Here in Atlanta I haven't quite got the hang of it yet. Tornadoes, falling trees, power outages, snow or ice shutting down the city. We have the basics - smoke and CO2 alarms, a supply of water, extra food for us and the dog, flashlights - and I thought we had battery powered radios. That is until I looked to see how old the batteries were (2010 expire date in one and no batteries in the other that is in the basement in case of a tornado). So I joined in the shopping for last minute ice storm supplies and now we have enough to get us through what would be a relatively short power outage if it happens. I'm also going to fill up some buckets and jugs with water for flushing toilets, minor washing up and dog drinking water in case the water supply pump is impacted. We have drinking water for us already.I know this is nothing for folks living in regularly cold climates but it really hits this city hard when we get freezing rain. We already changed our travel plans to 1 1/2 days later than planned because in all likelihood we couldn't have gotten to the airport early Thursday morning much less dropped the dog off Wednesday evening. So now we are scheduled to go Friday afternoon but come back the same day as planned. Cost extra and we will see if we get to go at all. I didn't want to wait until the airline cancelled because then the seats would fill full up fast on later flights.

I already switched to soy milk as my cartons of milk kept spoiling before I finished them. We have used a non-dairy butter substitute for years so I'm done with this week's challenge.Next week's challenge is to eliminate all meat, poultry, fish and eggs. Not going to happen in this house, but I will increase the number of days we have vegan dinners and make other meals more \"plant strong\". This part of the challenge will have to wait a week as we will be on vacation in N CA starting Thursday and so I will be focusing on how to eat healthfully when staying at someone else's house and eating out a lot.How are any changes you are trying to make in your diet going?"},
{"title": "Engine 2 Diet/Plant Centric Eating", "date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2014", "text": "Oh, the internet and social media do drive our choices these days don't they. I saw a posting on Facebook about a friend attending the Engine 2 Diet Challenge kick off at her local Whole Foods store, looked up when it was happening at my nearby store and signed up. I went to the first of 4 sessions tonight which was on cutting out dairy products which is relevant because Hubby is somewhat lactose intolerant and uses light plain soy milk although he eats some cheese. It was interesting and we got to try different nut, oat, soy, etc. milks. I won a carton of almond milk. What I didn't do was by the Engine 2 Diet book for $25. They have a website with lots of recipes and Whole Foods has recipes on their website too. And of course vegan recipes abound.I am interested though in seeing how we can change our diet to help reduce our marginally high \"bad\" cholesterol levels. Tonight's dinner was ratatouille (always makes me smile while thinking of the movie of the same name), sourdough French bread (thanks Trader Joe's) and salad. Oops, forgot the wine for me and beer for Hubby.Next week focuses on how to eliminate meat/poultry/fish - which we will simply reduce. I like being able to try different products without buying them so I will keep going. It helps me decide what to try which will increase our repertoire of foods.A recipe passed out tonight was for kale-almond bruschetta which I think I will try for the next book club meeting.Are you making any changes this year in your cooking or eating habits to improve your health?"},
{"title": "Health and volunteering week by default", "date": "Monday, February 3, 2014", "text": "Looking at my scheduled activities for the week I see that by default the focus this week will be on health and volunteering. I have a checkup with the dentist and follow up appointments with the orthodontist and opthamologist (re: cataract surgery). I also intend to go to the gym 2 or 3 times and we took and hour walk yesterday while it was lovely warm. In addition I signed up for the Engine 2 Challenge at my local Whole Foods and the first of four classes is Wednesday evening. I also plan to get new walking shoes and walk the dog as much as possible. Fixing healthy meals is on the list as always.On the volunteering list, I need to pass out book sale flyers today and do my usual morning of donation sorting Thursday for the Friends of the Library. The next day I will¬†lead the book sale set up and then the all day sale on Saturday. Everyone else has done their jobs very well (publicity, volunteer scheduling, table ordering, book sorting and pricing, etc.)¬†so think good thoughts that we raise lots of money. We have the greatest Executive Committee and volunteers.The other activity scheduled is¬†painting class on Tuesday evening.¬†Last week's was cancelled due to the snow storm traffic snarls so it will be good to get back to class.I'm also starting to get ready for our next trip to visit family in N CA. I just ordered a hostess gift for my DIL's mother as we are staying with her. Check out the Savannah Bee Company gift packs for some great gift ideas. I wanted something from Georgia to make it unique so I ordered the Everyday Honey Gift Set after consulting with my DIL. The other Georgia company that makes unique gifts is Doux South which makes the most interesting pickles. I sent a variety gift pack from them to my other son and DIL for Christmas and they really enjoyed them - especially the Mean Green Tomatoes.I think what is missing is a date night and a friend get together! I will have to plan both.What is on your schedule for this week?"},

Today we decided to go to Whole Foods to see if we could meet our craving in a somewhat more healthy, non-dairy ready made frozen version - and we did! We bought 2 Blake's Chicken Pot Pies as the sodium and saturated fat levels were ok although higher than we normally eat. They solved our craving - pretty tasty.While we were at the store I suggested we get some salmon for dinner. We ended up buying 2 pieces of cooked blackened salmon from the deli so it will almost feel like going out LOL. Just salad and veggies to cook.We have also been trying to come up with a¬†lower cost solution to the problem of removing 2 large trees down in our woods. I have emailed¬†the arborist to see if they could leave tall \"snags\" that wouldn't hurt any property if they fell and how much that might reduce the cost. The lowest cost proposal so far involves a crane and will remove all of the wood but will also require some landscape repair/replacement work to be done. At least the need to remove the¬†trees isn't urgent and we can explore alternatives.Luckily we didn't have the problem a neighbor had yesterday. Squirrels chewed through the insulation on the power lines going into her house causing a power surge that destroyed some appliances, a¬†tv and more as well as melting a surge protector and burning a hole in the rug where it sat. She came home in time to avoid a larger house fire. Yikes.A lovely short walk after lunch and now a peaceful and sleeping dog beside me."},

{"title": "A vet visit & why having room for the unexpected in your budget is so important", "date": "Tuesday, January 28, 2014", "text": "After we were visited yesterday¬†by the second estimator for our tree work, the Poodle Princess yelped when I picked her up. I talked to Hubby and we realized she was acting very subdued and unlike herself since Sunday morning. No racing around the house with her squeaky squirrel, no jumping on and over furniture, stretching carefully, staring at her bed before laying down¬†- not like her at all and she is only 4 1/2 years old. I decided to see how she did on a short walk and she was fine. But then I picked her up again and again she yelped so we headed to the vet.The vet thinks she has a slipped disc. It makes sense once you are told it - she has a spine and spines can have problems. It just never crossed our minds. Poor girl. She probably twisted too much catching a stuffed squirrel or thrown tennis ball. She is feeling better this morning what with pain pills and anti-inflammatory medicines. I was happy to see her tail up and a normal stretching sequence when she got up this morning. So that is all good.The point that I want to make though is not that dogs can have slipped discs or trees can develop problems and have to come down. The point is that you have to make sure you have room in your budget for the large (tree removal) and small (vet visit) unexpected expenses. The only way to do that is to figure out how to live well below your means and to build up your savings. This is as true in retirement as it is during your working years.I'm not suggesting that living below your means is easy - just necessary to be able to absorb unexpected costs."},
{"title": "Setting home repair/maintenance priorities", "date": "Sunday, January 26, 2014", "text": "Update: We can get both trees removed and hauled away for $3,000 using a crane. There would also be some landscaping costs to create and repair the access path for the crane. Still less than the other estimate and the wood would be hauled away¬†which is what we prefer (that was an additional cost with the other estimate).________________________________________________________I don't remember if I mentioned that, when I was outside right before our vacation convincing the neighbor's tree removal crew to remove the fallen tree from our property, I happened to look at a 100+ foot tree down in the woods and noticed a deep, long woodpecker cavity in its trunk. I had our arborist out to let me know how risky it was and we found another tree nearby that has significant rot around the base. Both are \"moderate\" risk¬†of falling - whatever that means LOL. We feel we need to take both down to protect our house and our neighbor's house. The arborist's company wants nearly $4,000 to take both down, remove the brushy branches and stack the cut up trunks. Hmmm - time for a second bid. To be honest I have full faith in the first company that they would remove the trees very safely as they took down a similar one in the woods a few years ago.Today we walked around in the woods to assess the damage done by the neighbor's tree removal to a retaining wall and relatively useless fence. We decided to have a go at removing the fence ourselves but I don't know if we can rebuild the retaining wall. I certainly can't lift the granite blocks. There is some trash (a tire, metal trash¬†can, plastic seed trays, etc. behind the fence. The previous owners chucked things there instead of paying for removal. I'll be happy to have it all cleaned up but we haven't made it a priority as it is out of sight. We'll start the next good weather weekend.Inside there are no urgent projects so everything is on hold until we find out what the trees are going to cost us. As you know, I'd rather spend the money on travel anyway!I did get some great bargains at the grocery store & CVS today along with a discount on a gasoline gift card. I can't make up the cost of tree maintenance but every bit helps."},

The crew managed to make it fall a completely different direction right toward our shed. I sat looking out the window expecting the shed to be flattened but just the top of the tree brushed the side. Boy were they lucky as the way it fell was a complete surprise to them. They then tried to get us to hire them to do tree work. Ummm, I don't think so. I did notice major woodpecker damage to one of our trees in the woods though and have scheduled the arborist for this afternoon.We are getting ready to leave Friday morning to visit family in CA and I am trying to wrap my mind around packing for highs of 85!

Technology is so helpful with things like that.We will be selling and buying in 4 years at a much different phase of life but probably moving from Atlanta back to CA and a much pricier market. It makes me think it will be a very challenging move not only on the usual retiring and moving levels but also financially. Hard to know what the markets will be like then but CA is always more expensive than Atlanta so it is good that we will be downsizing.

A couple of very short walks for the dog. No social life until today when I am having lunch with friends. Usually I spend Thursday morning with a friend doing volunteer work but she had a doctor's appointment so I was there by myself too.So as the weather eases I am also looking forward to doing more.

{"title": "What a day! And it is only half over.", "date": "Friday, January 3, 2014", "text": "Today is DS1's 43rd birthday so I started off the day with very happy thoughts as he is such a great person.I started the laundry and¬†scurried out the door, stopped to get a latte, and headed to the library to do some volunteer work. I was driving down a busy 4 lane street when a man started walking towards traffic right in front of me in the middle of my lane - yikes. Got past that, went a few blocks and there is a trash can blowing around in the street back and forth across my lane - double yikes. Went on very carefully and then a tractor trailer loaded with construction equipment started turning right in front of me despite my lights being on - triple yikes! I did finally make it without any actual mishaps and happily spent the rest of the morning working away. Also picked up a Friends of the Library membership renewal that included a nice additional donation.I found a bunch of books in the donations that I though DS2 would like and I just heard back that he does want all but one of them. So I can \"media mail\" him 6 books that I will buy for about $2 each and we'll both be happy.Went to Trader Joe's on the way home - lots of good fresh food to top off our week. Resumed laundry and had lunch. Sat down at the computer, looked out the window¬†and wondered if my neighbor has yet figured out if she or someone else owns the giant tree (100 feet tall at least) that has broken at the base, is leaning at a 45degree angle¬†and is being held up by two smaller trees. If it falls, and especially if it brings down more trees, it will take out our carport and perhaps the upstairs of another neighbor's house. We have moved our cars but still! I think that since we notified the neighbor of the hazard it will be their insurance that has to cover damage but am not sure. Last time one of their trees fell and damaged our trees and shed we had to pay for everything on our lot including removal of that part of the trunk. We are definitely following up tomorrow.Can't wait to see what the rest of the day brings!¬†INCOME/EXPENSES: I retired¬†during 2013, but am not collecting social security yet, so our total income dropped slightly.¬†I was only doing occasional consulting work so it wasn't a very big hit. We will have a slight increase in 2014 as Federal employees are¬†getting a 1% raise after years of no raises. Our expenses did drop compared to¬†2012 and hopefully will drop even more in 2014 with no wedding expenses and (cross your fingers) no major medical or home repair expenses.So what were¬†our 2013¬†savings and expenses? (All %s are of pre-tax income.)SAVINGS - 36.0% -¬†Our savings including retirement accounts¬†increased from¬†23.2% in 2012. I am aiming for an overall¬†savings increase to about 45% in 2014.MAJOR EXPENSES:Cars - 2.1% -¬†I'm sure that our car¬†insurance will go up in 2014, but won't know how much until the 6 month policy¬†bills are due in April and October respectively. We have done everything we can to minimize insurance costs with the latest being taking safe drive courses and moving my driving status to non-working to lower car insurance costs. I am buying discount gasoline debit cards when offered at the grocery store. Of course we have no control over the licensing cost and will just have to see what that is.Clothing/Personal Care - 1.9%¬†- This includes haircuts and clothes purchases/maintenance¬†for the¬†2 of us. We had higher than usual clothing costs as we bought our wedding finery. In 2014 I am going to track toiletries and laundry supplies in this category as well rather than in food in an effort to really see what food costs us. Communications - 3.1% - Cable TV, internet, landline, cell phone, computer supplies and equipment, Kindle, tablet, stamps, cards, newspaper subscription¬†- I think that is all that is in this category!¬†In 2013 we bought a new computer after the very old one failed, a Nexus 7 tablet and a cheap Tracfone. 2014 will bring lower costs in this category as we shouldn't be buying any electronic equipment. Food - 5.0% - I have been lumping together food from stores, household supplies, toiletries, etc. in this category - anything I buy at the grocery or drugstore except medicine. I try to shop on senior discount day and watch for specials/coupons. In 2014 I will also buy discounted gift cards for Whole Foods and CVS so there will be savings there. I am going to be buying more variety of fruits and vegetables though so it may balance out.Healthcare - 7.6% - Extra costs for final payments for braces and cataract surgery drove this up. Good news for 2014¬†- health insurance is only going up 2.4% for¬†slightly better benefits and late in the year I can add Medicare Part A at no cost.Housing -¬†8.4% - This category includes maintenance, furnishings, utilities, homeowner's insurance and property taxes. We don't have a¬†mortgage anymore, but have a relatively expensive house to operate despite doing as much maintenance as we can ourselves and watching our expenditures on utilities, etc. We definitely had a cooler summer in 2013 resulting in lower electric¬†utility costs, but last winter was cold so gas costs for heating were up. We¬†managed to not have too many home maintenance costs though. We used exactly the same amount of water as the previous year but rates went up and will do so again this year to help pay for county wide sewer work. 2014 will also see a big, but unknown, increase in property tax as home values have increased and the freeze on our tax (due to a successful¬†appeal of value 2 years ago) will expire. I'm sure that our¬†homeowner's insurance will also go up, but won't know how much until the next bill in¬†August. We haven't decided what optional maintenance to do as part of making our lives easier and more comfortable as¬† preparing the property to sell in a few years.¬†I am hoping we do all outdoor projects that need work. I have my fingers crossed on non-optional maintenance. Optional Insurance - 2.2% - We also pay¬†for excess liability¬†insurance and¬†the good news is that¬†it didn't increase at all for 2014! That was a surprise as insurance rates always seem to rise way more than inflation.¬† We both also both have term life insurance and it will go up too - next bills in February and March. We keep debating whether or not to drop the life insurance, but it does have¬†the benefit of paying in advance of death if you are terminally ill and as¬†we don't have long term care insurance we are using it as that right now.Recreation/Travel - 9.3% -¬†This includes boarding the dog as we consider that a travel expense rather than a pet expense. It also includes purchase of reading material and hobby related items or classes, movies, plays, etc.¬†as well as all travel expenses. In 2014 I am moving eating out and any alcohol purchases back into this category as they really are recreation and not a necessity.Taxes - 22.5% - This includes all wage related taxes.And the smallest expense with the most value? Poodle Princess - 1.0% -¬†That prize goes to the Poodle Princess!¬†Of course she also increases our travel costs but that is OK. We do order her¬†Greenies dental treats from Amazon's subscription service to save on cost. I also diligently claim the free bag of dog food as the 13th bag, but that takes a year or more given her size and the size of the food bags LOL. The groomer also eventually provides a free session after we pay for quite a few. We do pay a premium to board her with her former foster family as she just loves them to pieces and they adore her. Even their cat is happy to see her and their dogs do cartwheels, as does she ,when she arrives. She is little, but loads of companionship and fun."},

Plane tickets and dog boarding taken care of.I have signed up for painting studio for 4 weeks in an attempt to finish 2 paintings that I started early this year. I'm waiting to here when the welding workshop will be held and my friend is kindly going to schedule it around my commitments so I can be sure to come.Having received some 2 lovely pieces of fabric to make summer skirts I am looking to find a pattern and make a muslin version to get the fit right. Then I will be sewing and hitting up thrift shops to find cute tops to go with them. We also reserved free tickets to a symphony concert on January 4th and there are a number of free concerts at Emory in January and February on the calendar.¬†Book club is also meeting in January and we are reading The Goldfinch - I'm trying to get my hands on a copy as I am #276 on the library waiting list LOL. The Friends of the Library winter book sale is in early February and we are trying to sell some different items this time as we were given a lot of origami paper, reusable tote bags, blank journals, cute bookmarks and bookplates, etc. Since this sale is indoors we are trying a table just for \"fun stuff\" - we'll see how it goes.Then there is my commitment to myself to go to the gym 3 times a week when I am in town including taking a class on the middle day.

They also considered that I don't want to fill my life with unused stuff so the choices were things I will definitely use and that was very thoughtful!So here they are - they all tell a bit about me.First there is the¬†rosemary bush that Hubby got me. I love to use fresh rosemary in cooking and the bush we had has become spindly and minimal. Makes a good Christmas tree substitute too.¬†Then there is this pile! I had mentioned on Facebook that I have always wanted to learn how to weld (a friend runs workshops of various kinds and was thinking of a welding one) so I got this funny coffee mug from DS1 which says \"Welding - Live the Dream!\". Oddly he said he didn't have to special order it - who knew welding was so popular. DIL1 picked out the fabulous fabric to make summer skirts and the book of customized skirt ideas to go with it. They also sent the lovely handmade soap that the Poodle Princess was quite taken with as its complex¬†smells¬†were very interesting to her.¬†Her nose was also quite busy exploring the history and story of each gift before we unwrapped it.DS2 and DIL2 sent me books from The List: A Year of Reading the World¬†- another Facebook mention. One from each of 4 continents (excluding N. America & Antarctica). I love the interesting titles and that the one they picked from Africa is by a Kenyan author as my nephew and his family live in Kenya.My Mom always gives us magazine subscriptions that we really enjoy and this year she added a mug about the history of art. Definitely a conversation piece.I almost forgot this gift of a Trader Joe's dark chocolate sampler as it had already migrated to the pantry after I started taste testing LOL.We don't exchange gifts with the larger family as we all agree that visits and chats are better! I was happy that our gifts got to everyone on time. One package had a wrong zip code (I transposed some numbers unfortunately) and I could watch its journey online while it¬†circled the wrong part of California for a week before someone read the full address and sent it to the right place finally arriving late on Christmas Eve. We had lovely chats with our sons and DILs on Christmas Day and look forward to seeing them in January and February on our trips to S California first and N California later. While Hubby used his gifted movie pass to see The Wolf of Wall Street, I gave the Poodle a Christmas walk and made us a small holiday dinner of roasted turkey breast with gravy, butternut squash, cranberry sauce and rolls from our favorite bakery. We then drove around looking at Christmas decorations as we had not yet done that.All in all a lovely day all the way around with new memories. Today Hubby is back at work and I am working through a list of to-do items. I hope your day was lovely with your own special way of celebrating or just enjoying the mid-week break!"},

When it was all over all that was left was one cookie and some new memories. Well, we might have each had a cookie too.As is often the case with happy events, we enjoyed anticipating their arrival. We talked about my Christmas caroling experiences as a teenager in Illinois where it was almost always snowy and bitter cold at Christmas time. My Hubby remembered going caroling once in S. California where he lived as a teenager and where it definitely not snowy or bitter cold. Last night was a mild and clear evening here in Atlanta fortunately.Here is the cute version of Rudolph that they sang with gusto.Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer) Had a very shiny nose (like a light bulb) And if you ever saw it (saw it) You would even say it glows (like a flash light) All of the other reindeer (reindeer) Used to laugh and call him names (like Pinochio) They never let poor Rudolph (Rudolph) Play in any reindeer games (like Monopoly) Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say (Ho Ho Ho) Rudolph with your nose so bright Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? Then all the reindeer loved him (loved him) And they shouted out with glee (yippee) \"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer) You'll go down in history!\" (like George Washington)"},

California in a nice long chat with our younger son this weekend. Now to start shopping plane tickets. This past weekend we bought plane tickets for our early April trip to Key West and reserved a car for our January trip to S. California (plane tickets purchased earlier).I already found one item for this week's decluttering as we finished cleaning the upper kitchen cabinets. An old scratched acrylic serving tray is on its way out. If I clean any of the lower cabinets/drawers this week I imagine something else will pop up.

Hmmm - I'm sure I wrote the time down correctly when I called to make her appointment. The staff was gracious and offered to keep her until the vet could see her that afternoon but we just made a later appointment and went home. Never any trouble getting her to leave there LOL. The later visit was fine but when I got home I found they had given me one correct package of medication and one that was for a very large dog and a different brand. Third visit got it all sorted out.Then I checked our checking account online and noticed that I had \"misinformed\" Hubby when I told him that the reimbursement for the first of his 3 business trips had not been deposited. Hmmm - it was there and had posted 4 days before I swore it wasn't there yet.And the lentil soup I made for dinner last night? Well split red lentils are not interchangeable with the regular brown lentils. The soup is edible, but I can't say it was a hit. On the plus side, the red lentils cooked much faster LOL.I'm not going to bore you with any more examples but instead try to avoid too much more confusion!"},

It is amazing¬†how many types of already used bags I have been able to find to use for kitchen trash. Bread wrappers, dog food and dog treat¬†bags, larger newspaper bags, cereal box liner, lined coffee bean bag, etc. I'm going to see how long I can go without buying plastic trash bags.I also don't like to buy zip lock bags except for sandwich bags for Hubby's lunch items. I wash most larger ones and reuse them as long as possible but was throwing away the ones used for freezing raw meat. Solved that by using bread bags after wrapping the meat to prevent freezer burn.I also started saving vegetable scraps and peelings to make broth as we rarely have chicken bones to use. I made some this morning to use to make lentil and spinach soup. What a great use of \"trash\". We don't compost but if you do the used peelings could still be dumped in a compost pile. Mine go in the trash unfortunately.I'm looking for some other small ways to change our habits and save a bit.

We went to 4 stores and I would definitely go back to 3 and check out the clothing only sister shop of one of them and another consignment store that only handles furnishings.¬†I really was a big spender $2.07 for a big bag of bows, 9 Christmas cards and a roll of wrapping paper.

According to my SIL, she was attentive and seemed to process what the doctor said and the follow up medication instructions. I talked to Mom about 30 minutes ago and the drugstore had delivered a prescription earlier this morning. She didn't recognize the doctor's name or know why she got the medicine which she thought she shouldn't take. I guess they didn't send written instructions home with her although she has been diagnosed with dementia that has pretty much destroyed her short term memory. I did get her to call my SIL to check and see if she remembered the instructions and we think all has been sorted out and she will take the medication. So frustrating - what would she do if no one was checking in on her and making sure she remembered the important things? Why do doctors not recognize the need for clear written instructions? It is also worrisome in the what awaits me realm.Which leads me to my new volunteer activity. I am going to be a senior mentor for a first year medical student (other students involved are studying nursing, physical therapy, etc.). We have topics to cover but the whole point is for these doctors in training to get some perspective on how to more effectively treat older patients. Most of my input will be about my Mom's experiences and ours as her support system I imagine. It should be interesting. We are in catch up mode as her original mentor withdrew from the program.The topics to cover are:- Personal History/Background- Daily Diary- Nutrition- Health Systems-Medicare, Social Security, Aging Economics- Friendship- Volunteering- Function and Relation to Health- Values- Bucket List- Health Care Interactions with Older AdultsI checked off all my library related to do's this morning and came home with some interesting books. One of the advantages of sorting through the donated books is finding ones I've never heard of yet look interesting. I bring them home to read and then take them back for the next sale.

We headed off this afternoon to see a Picasso, Braque and Leger exhibit at a small university art museum near by and, we thought, to hear a jazzy Christmas concert. Well the concert is tomorrow afternoon so we will have to head back. However we enjoyed the exhibit which was quite unique.I had researched costs in advance - $5 each for admission to the museum & $10 each for the concert. I noticed that for $30 we could get a one year dual senior membership so we did. Once we attend the concert we will have broken even and any other visits will be free.Otherwise just hanging out and preparing to eat our leftovers from Thanksgiving as even the restaurant portions were too large. What is Thanksgiving without leftovers?I am quite willing to spend money on those things that bring happiness - special meals out, travel to visit family, vacations, pet care, good food, etc. I also like the challenge of saving money as possible without spending oodles of time doing it. Add in some creativity of making do or using research and problem solving skills and I am really enjoying myself LOL.So some recent successes in shopping savings are to be noted.- I recently ordered a pair of loafers exactly like the ones I have that are wearing out. I bought them online with free shipping for the same price I had paid a couple of years ago. No driving, no disappointment that stores were out of them plus I get shoes I know will make my feet happy.- I tried buying a discounted CVS gift card from Gift Card Granny and it worked fine. An 11.2% discount just for waiting a week to have the card after buying it on line. Definitely will do more of this although I am going to wait until after Christmas as I think the discounts will go up from what they are right now as people buy them for holiday shopping.- The hair salon I use sends out emails when they up their gift cards to a 20% off discount (vs. 10% every day) and then I buy an amount that I am sure I will use up in the 180 day window.Thank goodness for the internet when it comes to researching and problem solving to save money.- Recently I needed to either replace the sponge mop on our mop or buy a whole new one. I finally found that a nearby hardware store carried the replacement item I needed at a lower price than I could get it online. We struggled to remove the old one and get the new one on but we did it and given my rate of mopping are set for quite a while.And in the creative make do category are these not so exciting to anyone else items.- I lead a Friends of the Library group that has 3 used book/media sales a year as fundraisers. I am always looking at how to sell anything that is donated and for the upcoming sale am going to try selling the good fabric shopping bags that came in with book donations. We needed hang tags to price them and the smallest package would be $5. We also had a huge donation of origami paper that I packaged in plastic bags but a few pieces weren't of sale quality. I cut them, made a single hole and attached a piece of string from the stash of stuff in our basement. Free and they are just as good as bought ones.- In addition I am going to try making an artist journal. I was going to use painting quality paper that I have but when I looked at my supplies found a stack of old album paper that already had two holes in the side. A piece of old ribbon tied it and now I will have my journal to play with.What are your recent successes?"},

A relaxing morning while Hubby raked leaves and walked the dog - yeah Hubby. Went to see the newly out movie \"Nebraska\" in the early afternoon and as Hubby commented you could either let it make you feel sad or see the humor in the story. He chose humor and so did I. Excellent acting and cinematography.Then out to dinner at a nearby restaurant which was literally packed with people. We had reservations but some seats opened up at the bar where the same food was served for $19 less per person. I had a cocktail called Pilgrim's Progress because I thought the name was great. We prefer to sit there anyway at this restaurant and have done so on Christmas Eve for the last few years. Good food and no cleanup. We brought home enough for another meal with a few additions of sides.Today Hubby has to work as he has lots to do and is the acting manager for 2 of the levels above him. He'll have a quiet day and I personally will be glad when his big project actually kicks off in mid-January and he can simply manage it rather than \"herding cats\" to get it ready to go. I think he'll be relieved too.I'm going to¬†take a long walk with the dog as the weather is warming up to where I don't mind being out. A bit of yard pick up post windy day,¬†online Christmas shopping, chores, picking a new craft project,¬†and reading. How is your weekend shaping up?"},

This is the first time though that the reaction has been tinged with hysteria. It's not that the police don't respond quickly so I'm not sure what is the difference except that there is a push to get everyone to join in on funding a private security company contract along with the neighborhood next door.I'm not against security - I'm just not sure how having rent-a-cops on call will change anything. Often the burglaries are smash and grab out of cars parked on the street. This time it is smash¬†entry into homes where the residents are gone and grab of laptops, phones, etc. Will paying $25 a month to a private security company change this? If it will, then I have no problem doing that but I just don't see the connection.Does anyone have experience with private security making any difference?

It was fine despite a day off sick. It was fine despite some rainy weather. It was fine despite nothing memorable.So why was it fine? I did some non-routine volunteer work for the library which had me interacting with some different people (happiness points for spending time with others). I made it to the gym twice including trying an introductory yoga class (happiness points for exercise). I walked the dog almost every day (happiness points for time with a pet). I went out for dinner and shooting pool with Hubby (extra happiness points for date night). We finally figured out how to visit sons in both S. CA and N. CA by giving up on the idea of doing it in one trip and also picked our dates for a Road Scholar program in Key West (happiness points for something to look forward to). And then there is something only problem solving, recycling environmentalist, budget happy people like me would find happiness in although cleaning floors is not high on my list! The internet told me I could find a replacement sponge/scrubber piece for our floor mop just up the street and it was less than ordering one through Amazon. Bonus points: it was hard to change out the old one but with teamwork and a few words we¬†managed to do it¬†(really engineers no one person could do this by themselves - you need to design things better). There were other things - talking, or rather listening, to my 92 year old Mom who is having a really good week and was quite cheerfully chatty about books she was reading and other things. She wasn't well for many months so this is so uplifting. Finding out the Bob Dylan is a welder who makes gates out of scavenged metal parts and that my friends are going to book a welding workshop at there N GA lodge. I've always wanted to learn to weld as an art form so hopefully I will be in town that weekend and go to the workshop. I'm excited about that possibility!Such an ordinary week that was perfectly fine. Today we are going to see The Dallas Buyer's Club and maybe stop for coffee afterwards.

Most of us have had our own¬†professional careers as well as having husbands with the same. Our stages of retirement planning and saving are quite different though. A couple of us are retired. One will retire soon. The others don't have any date in mind.The discussion of retirement finances has been rather general although indicative of concerns and various questions. One person seems to have quite a good amount of money and travels a lot. Another has rental property income as well as no mortgage and a husband still working. However, another couple have 10 years left on their mortgage although they are already 63 and 67. We¬†paid off our mortgage a few years ago although we plan to move to a more expensive housing market after retirement and this house is costly to live in until then.¬† Some of us will have pensions ourselves or through our husband's work. There is a lot of confusion about when it will be best to take Social Security benefits, how long to expect to live,¬†and how spousal benefits work.

{"title": "A rediscovered favorite blog & musings on spending categories", "date": "Tuesday, October 15, 2013", "text": "I woke up at 4:45 am and was unable to go back to sleep so I have been wandering around blog world and rediscovered an old favorite - Tasmanian Minimalist - and she has kicked off 365 days of not buying any clothing except for needed replacements. I don't have her wardrobe to fall back on but certainly don't need anything and have to keep reminding myself of that as I do tire of what is in my small wardrobe. That led me to thinking about where I do splurge. Eating out is one of our pleasures and an area where I am the one to initiate spending. Yesterday at the start of week 3 of Hubby's furlough we tried a new restaurant for lunch. It was a lot of fun and got us exploring a different part of town than we usually go to. I am thinking that going out to lunch needs to be our habit as it is less expensive than dinner. As a bonus, we are looking at different types of housing and neighborhoods with an eye to how we would like to live in the future. I think we would both move right now and experience a different lifestyle for the next 4 years (until retirement) if it wouldn't make Hubby's commute a pain. Guess we will have to start exploring new neighborhoods nearer to his office rather than the direction we tend to orient towards.I also booked a massage as I have pain in my upper back/shoulders. I could probably work it out with Ibuprofen, stretching and time but am impatient with these things. Again, spending that only I initiate.We both want to spend on travel but find ourselves gulping over the costs at times. Right now we are considering a trip to Cuba vs. Key West while we are living so close to both. Once the government shutdown is over we can plan dates with a bit more confidence and make a decision as well as when to head out to see our kids again.I did manage to reduce a bit the amount our car insurance increased. Now that I am retired one car can be reclassified for leisure use with a small corresponding decrease in cost. We are also both going to complete AARP's safe driver course since the resulting discount gets applied for 3 years. This 6 month bill however will hardly be affected as the discount is only a bit more than the course cost.I also cleaned out and washed my car as the full service car wash I have used has gone out of business and I couldn't think of another one nearby. After I finished I did think of one LOL. My car has never been so clean however and that paid for a bit of our lunch out.So much of our spending is necessary but not pleasurable. In those areas I really try to find out how we can reduce our costs (e.g. car insurance). I want to make sure we can still spend some on the fun things for the rest of our lives!"},

The building is gigantic and was only 10% occupied when the city of Atlanta finally sold it. The ugly 1970s addition and parking garage is gone. Yeah! Windows are being replaced. I guess it took about a year to empty the building of old office equipment and things like old phone exchange equipment, etc.¬† The whole area is changing. A wonderful park was built south of this building and that included uncapping a spring that had been sealed and making a storm control area into a beautiful lake and streams.I love seeing massive undertakings like this!"},
{"title": "5 new things this week", "date": "Wednesday, October 9, 2013", "text": "We love to try new things; have new experiences so this week we took advantage of Hubby's furlough caused free time during the week to:1. Have lunch at a Mexican cantina across the street from the main campus of the Centers for Disease Control. Lunch business is slow for all of the restaurants in this location as so many CDC employees are on furlough. No waiting to get a seat.2. Go to the Museum of Design Atlanta to see an exhibit of furniture made from used and destined to be discarded wine barrels. Very interesting. Here's one although there were some others that were absolutely fabulous! We were the only visitors early on a Tuesday afternoon.3. Walk on the¬†eastside portion of the Atlanta Beltline¬†to see outdoor art installations and enjoy this fabulous fall weather on a weekday morning. 4.5 miles round trip and it gave us a fabulous view or our neighborhood from the old rail right of way.4. Watch a movie or TV show¬†be filmed at a house up the street. Hubby was walking the dog and reports that the¬†line being filmed that had the street blocked off and required the hard working landscapers nearby to stop work was spoken to a car sitting in the street and was \"Yo, bring me back a burrito.\" He watched them do four takes of this short line and came home. LOL5. Unrelated to the furlough, but still new for me is that I agreed to participate in a program that has \"seniors\" meet once a month during the school year with a first year medical or nursing student to talk about things like nutrition, health systems (Medicare, SS, aging economics, friendship, volunteering, function and relation to health, values, bucket list) to help them overcome their preconceived notions about seniors and provide better healthcare to them. I'm a year short of being old enough but they need some people to step into spots vacated due to illnesses, etc. of other volunteer. Should be interesting."},

As a result I thought I would list 5 good things that have happened recently.1. The 18ft broken branch caught up in our tree was going to cost $300 to be removed by a pruning crew. Last night's storm and gravity brought it down and laid it where it did no harm. Hubby, being locked out of his Federal job, had time to cut it up an put it out in the street for pickup. Yeah!2. After my gym time I tried out a Kroger store in the same strip mall. It is fabulous compared to the one near me and will be my go to store. There is a Publix in the same strip mall and I will try it after gym on Wednesday. If it works out that will save me a drive every week to the one I have been going to.3. Our son and DIL are moving. DIL is friendly and met some people at a home improvement store who just had moved and wanted to get rid of their moving boxes. Score!4. It looks like Federal employees will eventually receive pay for the period they are locked out.5. My friend who broke her leg so badly that she needed surgery looked pretty chipper when I visited her at the hospital yesterday. She moves to rehab today so that will speed recovery and she will make a full recovery. I asked her what she really wanted that she couldn't get in the hospital and was told a Diet Coke with lots of ice so that was my get well gift!As a bonus, the dog asked to be in my lap while I was typing this LOL."},

It has taken some adjustment on all of our parts - even the dog has been a bit confused LOL.We haven't done any hikes yet but he has started in on a large cleaning job outdoors - patios, decks and the north side of the house. We went to see Gravity starring Sandra Bullock in 3D yesterday and ran into one of his colleagues at the 1:45pm show. Great special effects and the acting is good. I can't rave about the story line though I do recommend that if you see it you go to a 3D version.Today was to have been our lunch and theater day with friends. We are still going to the play but my friend fell and broke her leg very badly and is in the hospital following surgery, so they aren't going with us.

We walked to dinner and back as well.This could go on a long time and we are definitely not planning to go out to dinner each day LOL. In fact we are looking into how soon Hubby can apply for unemployment.¬†We¬†also decided that going to CA to help a son and DIL move was not a good idea - mostly due to the short notice involved, previously scheduled medical appointments, etc. but also due to the cost and the need to be able to go back to work if¬†the¬†shutdown ended. I know it was the right decision but feel a little sad all the same that I won't be seeing my kids soon!We do plan to go on some short hikes, doing some home maintenance and continue to enjoy free or low cost entertainment in our area.

{"title": "Getting a better return on your money", "date": "Sunday, September 29, 2013", "text": "I found two very different posts recently that, to me, speak to the same subject - how to get a better return on your money while living the lifestyle/retirement that you want. And neither one had to do with finding that tiny bit better interest rate!October pantry insurance challenge at Nanny's Place focuses on how to economically stock your pantry so that you have \"insurance\" in the form of a food supply that was bought as cheaply as possible and can be tapped as needed. She suggests steps that focus on organizing and auditing what you currently have, planning using store ads and coupons, setting a weekly cash budget for food shopping,¬†and customizing your purchases to fit what your family will eat.I'd add shopping on senior discount day if it applies to you. I save 5% on everything purchased at the standard grocery stores that way. However, we have lately found better prices on many things at Trader Joe's and there isn't any senior discount there.How to juice up your retirement returns at Retirement: A Full Time Job focuses on larger expenses and gives great examples. She also makes the point that a penny saved is equal to about two pennies earned if you are taxed on those pennies earned. Great incentive to not spend. I like the focus on larger expenses. We already are mortgage free, clean our own house and do our own yard work except for things like trimming large trees. Our credit card doesn't give us airline mileage points though and that could be helpful given the amount we travel. I also have friends who do¬†home exchanges to travel less expensively in this country and abroad and they have had a good experience.I think I would add some other things to think about.1. Be careful before investing in home repairs/improvements.¬† Do your research. Make sure it is necessary, has a good return on investment, or will make you so deliriously happy now that you won't wish you still had the money when you are 90! We are slowly moving on fixing a bent pipe in a shower. Today we took things apart enough to see that perhaps it can be fixed without tile being removed. We have a couple of other small jobs for a plumber so we will have them done at the same time. I found a source for matching tile in case we do need it and will call to see if we can order it and return it if it isn't needed. We will shop for the other parts needed too and then call the plumber. I hate paying the plumber to go shopping!2. Take care of what you already have. If it lasts longer because you took care of it, then you have a greater return on investment for the money spent. I am not willing to do as much as the Mom who writes CT on a Budget but I could if money was tighter.3. Make sure you really are using the services you pay for each month and see if you can get a better deal on any of them. I know this gets talked about a lot, but it really can save money. If you rarely use your cellphone, then Tracfone or something similar is much cheaper than a contract plan. If you actually go to the gym, then find a less expensive one or see if your health insurance has a subsidized deal with any gyms in your area - mine does and it is the least expensive monthly plan I can find at $25/mo plus tax.4. Make your PAID entertainment and eating out as well as book/music/chotchke purchases really pay for themselves in terms of pleasure received. A different kind of return on investment, but worth thinking about carefully. Will I greatly enjoy Thanksgiving dinner at a restaurant since just the two of us will be celebrating this year? Absolutely - just like we have made Christmas Eve dinner at the same restaurant a new tradition for our empty nest years. Do I really want to buy a book for my Kindle or will I enjoy a free one from the library just as much? Remember, you can get almost any book in hardback through interlibrary loan for just a few dollars if you can't get the book for free.None of us are getting very good returns on our bank accounts or other investments right now so we really need to find those returns elsewhere.Other ideas?"},
{"title": "Continuing to ramp up my retirement", "date": "Saturday, September 28, 2013", "text": "I think this past week was a good example of where I am with creating a full and meaningful retirement.I spent one morning at OLLI classes and continue to be amazed at the poetry instructor. While I am there he makes me want to pursue learning all about Poe, Emerson or Dickinson. He must be around 90 and clearly has some physical challenges but he is so passionate about the subject! An inspiration.Another morning was spent at the library working on donated books with my 85 year old co-volunteer. Another inspiration.I went back to a tough (for me) exercise class and another day did a weight workout and walked the dog most days. My goal has settled on¬†4 times a week at the gym plus walking the dog a lot and doing stretches at home. I'm aiming to achieve that this coming week.So I managed to learn something, contribute something and improve my health while having good social interaction. Not bad. The rest of the week's hours was spent on those somebody must do them chores and errands, reading,¬†and chatting with Hubby.Also to add in is creating something. I should start with finishing the paintings that are half done but that may not be it. I am also researching options for becoming active in either an artist or writer related group.On the reading front, I highly recommend The Cuckoo's Calling by Robert Galbraith aka J. K. Rowling. I couldn't make my way through her other new novel, The Casual Vacancy, but this was a page turning mystery that I hope has sequels."},

He is a \"non-essential\" employee by the definitions used and would be sent home without pay if the shutdown occurs.Since my corporate employment days when we knew that any day could bring layoffs we have made it a point to not live paycheck to paycheck and are very fortunate that it was possible to do so. I do remember the days of no savings when I was a poor student though and wonder how employees who may be in that situation are going to cope.The situation also leads to thinking about cash flow once we are retired and there is no more money coming in to increase our savings or pay the bills each month from yet another paycheck.Just some random thoughts on a gloomy, overcast day LOL."},

{"title": "When you want more from retirement, shift from being a spectator to being an actor", "date": "Friday, September 20, 2013", "text": "I've been thinking a lot about how to \"rev\" up one's retirement and I believe one of the keys is to shift from being a spectator to being an actor; to take solitary pastimes and make them ones that enlarge your world.It looks like this. Lets suppose you like to read. That is a solitary activity. But take your love of reading and start volunteering to read to children at lunchtime, become involved in an adult literacy program, join a book club, lobby for more funding for your local library, volunteer at a book festival, join a writer's group, take or teach a class on poetry, or¬†get a part time job at a library or book store and you have turned your passion into action that engages you more fully with the larger world. It is when you become an actor in your area of passion that you become more engaged in the world as a retiree. You will develop more interests, meet people who share you interests and hopefully make new friends, and maybe even learn something.I think this is especially important for those of us who were so busy with work and family commitments that our few recreational activities before retirement were mostly passive. For example, my husband still is working and¬†likes to watch sports on TV. He used to play various sports and coached Little League for a few years. Now he mostly is a spectator. We were talking about what he is going to do when he leaves his current work and the idea of becoming an \"actor\" in an area where he now is a spectator appealed to him. He is going to spend today as a spectator at a golf tournament but he did try to find someone who would go with him which would have helped make it less of a solitary, passive activity so that is a start. We talked about other possibilities for the future: volunteering with the First Tee program, playing in a foursome regularly, or revisiting some other sports he used to play for ways to be an actor. He is lucky that he has a long list of sports to revisit - tennis, surfing, softball and skiing to name a few. One of the things I discovered when applying this approach to expanding my own life is that some things I used to really enjoy are no longer passions. So your efforts may involve lots of false starts but I hope you won't give up! You may even discover new areas of interest that will provide you with great satisfaction, create wonderful friendships and help you live a large life.I would like to hear how you have taken what can be a solitary or spectator activity and turned it into something that expanded your life."},
{"title": "Trying new things", "date": "Tuesday, September 17, 2013", "text": "I strongly believe that it is important to try out new activities and experiences. Several years ago I had tried classes at my local OLLI senior university campus which is actually within walking distance. It was ok but not that engaging. Well, I decided it was time to try it again. The class list was interesting and many were full by the time I enrolled so I ended up with 2 classes that started today. The first one is called The Decathlon of Life and is by the co-author of a new book by the same name. The people who picked this class are like me in that we all want to ramp up our fairly newly minted retirements.The second class is Keepers of the Flame on poets of the Emerson, Dickenson, Poe era. The teacher is a retired professor who must be in his late 80's and so enthusiastic. He also tells old vaudeville jokes such as \"Why did the young Southern belle turn down an invitation to an orgy? Too many thank you notes to write!\". The class applauded his declamation of The Raven that was complete with a croaked \"Nevermore\".I'm looking forward to both classes next week.I'm also adding an exercise class to my workout starting tomorrow. It is a 20/20/20 class for aerobic conditioning and toning. I'm looking forward to ramping up my exercise although I am sure I will be an awkward beginner for the first few times I attend.The other new things scheduled for this week are having the friends of the library board meet at my house instead of the library so we can celebrate another year of successful fund raising with wine and snacks. Everyone was eager to come once I brought it up. Then on Friday I head to St. Simons Island with some of my book club friends for a 2 night stay at one member's vacation home. I've never been to this Georgia Island but I have heard it is lovely. I'll enjoy seeing the lighthouse, going on a ghost tour, walking on the beach, spending time with good friends, and taking photos.I don't usually have so many new things in one week but they are making this week great!"},

{"title": "Life insurance as long term care insurance - will it work?", "date": "Tuesday, September 3, 2013", "text": "Yesterday when I was talking to my brother he mentioned that he and my SIL had applied for long term care insurance and told me what it would cost them a year if they get approved and go forward with the type of policy they have in mind. We had been discussing whether it made sense to continue to pay for my life insurance now that I have no earned income. Well, our current combined life insurance cost is half of what my brother and SIL would pay a year for long term care insurance (they are 5 and 3 years older than we are). Most likely we would either not qualify for long term care insurance or pay a lot for it due to pre-existing conditions.I recalled that our life policy allowed for an accelerated death benefit if you were terminally ill. I called and this is the case in GA where we live now and CA where we plan to live after retirement. You have to have a Dr. state that you have 12 months or less to live. Otherwise you could use the insurance payout to replenish the money spent caring for the disabled or ill person. For now we are going to use our life insurance as our long term care asset. This link Using Life Insurance to Pay for Long Term Care tells you about the various types of ways this might work for you."},

{"title": "Organizing a used book sale as a library fundraiser", "date": "Friday, August 30, 2013", "text": "Each year our Friends of the Library hosts 3 used books & media sales. Two are outside on the front lawn of the library - Memorial Day weekend during the local Arts Festival and Labor Day weekend during the local Book Festival. The third is in February and is inside in the library meeting rooms.Memorial Day weekend sale 2013¬†All year round the donations pour in and at times it feels like you are sitting at the bottom of a waterfall. Lots of things the library can put in the collection (dvds, large print books, hardback children's books and current best sellers), lots of them¬†we can put in the sale and I will even try to sell the containers they arrive in such as plastic storage boxes. Anything left after sorting¬†goes to the literacy coordinator who sends books to prisons, homeless shelters, literacy classes, health clinics, etc. Three of us do all the sorting, pricing and boxing up.The Friends group board members take care of publicity, signs, getting cash, signing up volunteer worker, etc. The library system provides tables and book carts. The guard shows up early the date of the sale to let us in before the library opens.Then comes the day before the sale. The book carts have to be filled. The 15 tables and all boxes and crates of books have to be moved to the front lobby of the library late in the afternoon.Saturday morning¬†the sale set up starts at 8am. We rather swarm in, quickly get the tables out and set up. Some people start putting up the signs on each table. Others haul all the boxes/crates of books out and onto or under the tables. Other volunteers \"flip\" all the books so the spine is up and easily read. The filled carts are brought up from the basement and outside. Our customer service volunteers keep the early bird shoppers at bay and answer their questions. The cashier tables are staffed and ready.Labor Day weekend sale 2012¬†At 9am the sale starts and we are swarmed. We get so many used book dealers that we have rules about how they can use scanners and where they have to take their large quantity of purchases for tallying and paying by check. Volunteers come and go and keep pulling books out of boxes to restock and moving books back to where they belong. Usually by 1:00 or 1:30pm the volume of buyers shrinks to a manageable number and it gets really hot outside (this is Atlanta). We start consolidating categories on table and start removing empty boxes, tables and carts. At 3pm we close and move everything that is left back inside. Typically we make $4,500 to $5,000 at a sale.¬†My goal always is that we sell every single item! Last time we had about 2 children's books and 3 cookbooks left and only a few more in some non-fiction categories. This time we have lots of VHS movies and music CDs as well so we will see if people still want to buy them.That is me in the red shirt LOL¬†Besides the money, it is great to see people of all ages from small children to elderly adults so eager to buy books! Sometimes the children simply sit down in the midst of the action and start looking at their new to them books! I've even seen them sitting under tables to read.This Saturday it will be hot, dusty and very busy and we will rejoice in it. Wish us luck."},

She has physical health problems and mild dementia. She has hired a lot of occasional help (cleaning, yard work, driving) yet resists more help. We are challenged as to how to help her.Lately my brother and I have been spending quite a bit of time on the phone figuring out how to team up to make sure she is taken care off despite her resistance. She says she is feeling lousy and in pain but has insisted that she go alone to the doctor. We know she doesn't give the doctor accurate info.We are getting better at influencing her. What we have discovered is that I can convince her of things on the phone that she will refuse to do if presented by my brother or SIL. So we made a doctor's appointment for her and my brother took her and will continue to simply take her to her appointments rather than asking if he can go. We will keep comparing notes about what she tells us about her health.The other things I do long distance is provide a less frustrated ear to listen to her and sympathize. I also read up on her ailments and provide my brother with info and suggestions. We are also concerned about her handling of her bills. When I visit next week she will want me to file and shred paperwork which gives me the perfect opportunity to see what is going on. I am thinking we will set up online banking (we are both co-trustees on her living trust accounts) and convince her that my brother will start picking up her mail and taking the bills out as we want her to get her personal mail. She uses cash to pay her helpers and we are thinking that a separate checking account with a smaller balance¬†might be the answer. I am thinking about how to get her to agree to all of this.She did agree, at least in one phone call, to discuss her preferences under various scenarios for the future. I told her I wanted to write them down so we would all know what she wanted so we could try to make it¬†happen if at all possible.I am looking for ideas as to how I can help in additional ways. It is hard on the sibling who lives close to have so much of the burden. Ideas?"},

We both eat breakfast, lunch and dinner from our food supplies almost every day. Hubby will continue to eat at home for breakfast and dinner and take his lunch to work while I am gone. I'll just have to fill in next Tuesday with more produce and that should do it. Of course we have food in our pantry, frig and freezer as well and some of the things I bought will last beyond the two weeks.I'm planning on several vegetarian dinners during this coming week - barley & sweet potato risotto, veg chili and green peppers stuffed with kasha pilaf. We'll also have turkey burgers, tilapia, salmon, chicken as main dishes and lots of fruit, green salad, kale with peppers & corn, spinach, etc. as side dishes.I find the photos other bloggers post of their food shopping interesting, so today here's what I got for our money in this round of shopping. Very few bargains were available. Produce prices are crazy due to the soggy summer. I can't believe the stores want at least $1.99/lb for zucchini in the middle of summer. I only had one coupon for $1, $1 off another item and got the 5% senior discount at two stores for $2.76 in savings and then spent that on a treat!Trader Joe's - $40.39 Lots of staples, lunch items and a pizza for a quick dinner for Hubby when I'm goneWhole Foods - $36.60 & much is non dairy for Hubby plus they have the best salmon & frozen blueberries (hiding behind the beets). Also got some small beets and kale which aren't carried at the other stores.CVS $11.87 & the shampoo & conditioner happened to be on sale - My receipt was almost as long as I am tall too!Publix $34.60Kroger $18.70And I just may have stopped at The Cupcake Factory since I was in the neighborhood.Cupcake Factory $2.97"},

We also need to find someone who will do a really small repair job on the wall and set in new tile although Hubby could do the tile work I think. We have to fix this as part of preparing the house for sale in a few years.

The third had moved, taken a job after 4+ years of early retirement and her husband had been laid off. The other two of us just kind of listened.I think the person with the most energy and zest for her changed life was the one with the biggest changes. Not that she is happy her husband was laid off from his job the day she started hers, but her big new job is very exciting and gets her \"out in the world\" more again. They downsized their housing and really are happy about that. Interestingly, she had decided to really shake things up in 2013.That may be what it takes.

{"title": "Decisions cubed! Pre-retirement seminar completed and streams of income issues", "date": "Tuesday, August 13, 2013", "text": "Today we attended a very informative pre-retirement seminar put on by the Federal government for employees. Contrary to what some people think, current civilian employees don't get pensions similar to military pensions. Instead they get a small pension based on years of service and salary, social security, and payouts from a retirement savings account similar to an IRA and dependent upon how much the employee contributed. A huge benefit though is the ability to keep participating in health insurance as long as you are willing to pay the employee part of the cost. Hubby is a federal employee so we are trying to learn about all of this and they suggested attending the first time when you are about 5 years from retirement. He has 4 1/2 years to go.We learned that not only do you have a lot of decisions to make but many of them depend upon what kind of income you need to generate annually, whether or not you want to bet on a long life and buy annuities and what kind of spousal survivor benefits you think might be needed. We also have my social security and IRA savings and Hubby's IRA savings from prior employment. Ouija board anyone?I'm not going to go into the details of what all we have to think through,¬†but we will have to sit down with a counselor from where are IRAs are (educational employee program) as well to understand our options there. And I think one of us needs to get trained as a financial planner in the meantime LOL.Seriously, the whole stream of income issue is one every retiree will have to address if they¬†have any sources of income available¬†in addition to social security. I think the decision process has to go something like this.- What are your annual pre-tax income needs based on your planned expenses?- How long do you want to assume you will live?- What inflation rate and investment return rates are you assuming?- Do you want a fixed annual income or a gradually increasing one to take into account inflation?- What kind of survivor benefits need to be in place to ensure the widow/widower is not economically strapped?- What income streams do you have available and how much do you want to take from each annually?- What do you need to do to set up these income streams? What are the tax implications?- Who can help you figure this out?????For those who have already set up their retirement income streams, I am very curious how you thought it through?I am so glad I have tracked our income and expenses for years as that will help a lot. However, since we will move after retirement our expenses will change in unknown ways.I did get one question answered. Since I will be eligible for Medicare in a little over a year, I should sign up for part A which is free. Hubby will continue to provide health insurance for both of us. When he retires I can sign up for Medicare Part B with no penalty so there is no need to sign up for it before then and pay the monthly fee."},

I want to be able to bike, run, jump, swim, hike - basically do anything I want to activity wise with ease. That is going to take some major muscle and aerobic fitness building. I'm not forgetting flexibility and balance either. And I'd like to have a lot more energy. I expect there will be inches and pounds lost in the process but that is not the driving force.So I started at a women's only gym today and am happy with the evaluation and weight training set up. They also have classes I can use for the flexibility, toning, aerobic part of the journey and I will try those out to create a 4 day a week program hopefully. So if there are no more bumps in the health road I feel encouraged that I can meet my longer term goal.I also put in 2 hours pruning and weeding this morning. I'm doing it by zones and the front yard is first. Working around this rainy summer means planning when to do yard work is interesting but I think August may be a bit drier and hope to at least make it around the entire yard. The wooded area will probably have to wait until September. Yesterday I had my final cataract surgery follow up appointment and ordered new lenses for my old glasses. I realized on vacation that I needed help seeing freeway and street signs far enough in advance to change lanes, etc. The will also have a correction for very close or small work but basically be my driving glasses. Most of the time I won't need to wear glasses which is great!Tomorrow we go to a play courtesy of our season subscription.

In looking at our expected and hard to impact expenses for the month, ¬†they add up quickly and include cable bundle, cell phone, haircuts,¬†homeowner's insurance annual payment, new lenses for my glasses (new prescription post cataract surgery),¬†that darn external USB case for the old hard drive, gym membership,¬†dog grooming, utility bills, Hubby's life insurance quarterly payment,¬†and payroll deductions for health insurance, health savings account, retirement accounts, and taxes.That leaves only these areas to impact - Books, Clothing, Entertainment, Eating out, Gasoline, Travel,¬†Food, Toiletries, Household supplies, and Home maintenance. I realize we could postpone the haircuts, reduce the cable package, etc. but that is not my focus as we can afford them and have our lifestyle and still save money. My focus is on the ongoing variable spending and how I, as a decision maker, impact the amount we spend. I may be spending on travel by¬†booking a plane ticket to visit my Mom if DB thinks early September will be a good time for a visit.¬†¬†And on eating out as I have one lunch with a group of friends planned and will go to that. Hubby really wants to see the new Woody Allen movie and that is ok and an entertainment expense.What I can do in August to tighten our spending:- Asking before any spending, \"Is this essential?\", \"Do I need it right now?\", \"Can I substitute something less expensive?\" \"Am I ok with spending on it anyway?\"- Menu planning and using what we have first- Not¬†initiating eating dinner out¬†as I am the primary cook and if I don't plan - well ...- Continuing to limit driving¬†by grouping errands to save on gas- Not buying any books or ebooksI'm sure I'll think of more things I can do such as washing our cars ourselves if they need it but you get the gist of my financial focus for August."},

Then I have to buy the correct external USB housing suitable for the hard drive which I hope the staff at Best Buy can tell me, get everything hooked up and transfer the files including all of my Outlook contacts, etc. So dealing with the old hard drive is my next big step! Think of all the new neuronal connections I am forming and all the money I am saving by working through this myself LOL.But as they say, one step at a time.I went to a meeting about the new volunteer work I am going to do and am a bit more excited. We are going to record brief interviews with parents and children about why they love the library and how it has/does impact them. These will be edited to make podcasts for the website and also quotes that can be used for fundraising appeals and grant writing. We realized how little we understand about the technical side of this project but brainstormed a good list of potential volunteer experts. I'm going to start at my library branch and I do love to hear people's stories so that part should be fun.The arborist came by to evaluate the mid-sized broken branch caught up in a large oak tree. He said if it was his house he would just wait for it to fall to the ground but if we were really worried it might damage the house then $300 would do the trick. I like the gravity approach as we wouldn't have even known it was there if a neighbor hadn't heard the crack when it broke and come over to see what happened.Add a quick trip to the grocery store and giving the dog a bath and it is mid-afternoon.

That works out but I'd like to try a bit more structured approach and further minimize the I'm burnt out on cooking so let's go out to eat nights.I've decided to pick a type of main dish for each day and plan from there.- Sunday: chicken or turkey- Monday: fish- Tuesday: vegetarian- Wednesday: chicken or turkey- Thursday: fish- Friday: pork or eggsI've started a list of dishes we like in each main dish category and that will make it easier to make a specific menu plan. The fish we tend to eat are frozen salmon or tilapia and canned tuna.There are also vegetables that I want to make sure we eat each week at dinnertime: - sweet potato or butternut squash- spinach, kale or chard- broccoli- carrots- red pepper- tomatoesAnd fruits that make it to dinner are¬†cantaloupe, watermelon, mango, pears¬†or oranges depending on season and canned peaches, pears, and pineapple.Generally leftovers either are eaten at lunch or used for another meal. For example, since its Tuesday we are having leftover barley and vegetable soup plus garlic bread,¬†a large salad that includes spinach and red pepper, and mango or cantaloupe for dessert.I'm not sure how this is going to work out, but it feels like it may be a good approach for me.

It was handwritten and very out of date and incomplete but interesting to double check.My reason for doing this is to add it to our fire safe as documentation in case of a fire or burglary. However it is sobering as I count the electronics, furnishings, linens, chotskies, etc. Why do we have so many of anything such as 3 leashes for the dog (we bought one, were given one, and one is a training lead) when we only use one? Once you buy or are given something it is very hard to let it go. Of course the moral is to not let it in the house in the first place but I'm dealing with what is already in!I am hoping that the secondary purpose will be to decide to let some of these things go out into the broader world. Tonight I'll be discussing with Hubby how many blankets we actually need and whether we can let that training lead go.And then there are the odd mismatches of use and need. We have 15 wine glasses, 12 drinking glasses and 20 coffee cups/mugs. We only a few people over at a time and never need 20 coffee cups. Of course 8 of those are cups and saucers that came with our dishes but really! However due to breakage over the years we keep running out of cereal/salad bowls with only 2 of us in the house. I think the kitchen will get a rethinking as part of this process to see if we can better match need and quantity without buying much. We expect not to move most of our dishes as they are old and showing the wear.Have you done a home inventory and, if so, to what level of detail?

I took the dog on a long walk first thing before it got too hot and she skipped and bounced the whole way; a happy dog. Did a little yard and housework. Went shopping for some replacement summer clothes and found two tops and a pair of capris. Read a bit. Played with my new iPhone trying to learn how to use it's features. Fixed dinner.And then we decided to take the dog on a short walk. It was going fine until I stepped on a 3 inch long piece of branch, rolled my ankle and went down on the pavement. I remembered our dog sitters statement that no matter what happens don't let go of the leash and didn't. Anyway the dog turned around and ran over to see what happened to me.I had forgotten how much scraped knees and elbows can hurt! Hubby took the leash, helped me up and home, helped me clean and bandage the wounds and provided appropriate sympathy. I took ibuprofen and put ice on my ankle and this morning I am fine except for the scrapes and even they look pretty good.I am reminded about a story our son told us after he had knee surgery and started physical therapy. He had done a number on his knee his freshman year of college by slipping on some wet grass while playing intramural soccer. He came home from the first PT session amazed that one of the older adults starting at the same time had required knee surgery after tripping while walking her dog.So, while I was lucky I'm taking this as a good reminder. No matter how hot it is, put on the athletic shoes when walking the dog not the sandals. When walking around brush or other debri helpfully piled on the sidewalk by laze homeowners, assume that there will be smaller pieces as well and tread carefully.The irony is that the experts say you are more likely to fall if you walk looking down at your feet. So I always stand up straight and look further ahead. Still stuff happens and I know I am lucky that nothing was seriously injured."},

It also mentions that cash register receipts contain BPA so you should wash your hands after touching them! BPA in Plastic Bottles, Food Containers, etc.Then there is this article (12 Tips to Reduce Food Contamination from Plastic) that says \"1\" plastic (PET) can lead to chemicals migrating into your food if the plastic gets hot.

He was not a talker but did find joy in life. He was so sure that he would die during WWII that when he survived he continued to celebrate being alive, albeit quietly. His thought that he would die was realistic as he headed off to serve on a bomber crew in the European theater at a time when very, very few men survived their tour of duty. He had wanted to become an architect and was set to attend Dartmouth before he enlisted. After the war he did not pursue that but rather worked as a commercial illustrator and a magazine editor before being laid off right after I was born. My Mom's stepparents finally offered him a job working for them at their photography studio and store so when I was 6 months old and my brother 3 1/2 we moved from NH to IL with $25 left in my parent's pockets. We moved into a house purchased and furnished by my grandparents and my Dad started working 6 days a week and never complained as I recall.Later in life he found true joy in being a glider pilot, retiring back to NH and doing amazing pastel portraits. He faced head on lots of cardiac related health problems always saying yes to any surgery or intervention that could keep him alive. When I would ask him how does it feel to be¬† 80, 85, etc. he always answered \"It sure beats the alternative!\". He died when he was 88 having lived longer than either of his brothers or his parents.I like to think I am a lot like him in the sense that I enjoy the present and look forward to the future rather than dwelling on the past or worrying unnecessarily. I have a bit of his artistic talent. I don't have his patience, attention to detail or apparent calmness in the face of difficulties. I miss him a lot and am glad he was my Dad.We are lucky to still have my FIL with us and I don't want to miss adding him to the day's thoughts.

I spent $124.65 on food, $2.87 on toiletries and $0.70 on over the counter medical stuff (distilled water). This is for 2 adults for a week and is once again more than I had budgeted. I didn't have any coupons, did find some store sales and got $2.60 for a senior discount. We will probably pick up a few more items during the week and we will also be eating what was already in the pantry, freezer and fridge.Am I the only one who thinks food prices keep going up? According to the US Food Price Inflation Forecast the most recent inflation rate is lower than it was a year ago (did I understand that jargon filled post correctly?). However what we buy probably isn't the same as their comparison food basket although I can't find a description of what is in that food basket.So what did I buy to feed us and replenish our longer term use items?Dairy - half gallon each of milk and soy milkCanned food - cranberry sauce, pears, peaches, soup. tuna (3)Frozen food - orange juice, peas, enchilada, salmon, blueberriesMeat - ground turkey, ham lunch meat Breads - cinnamon raisin bread (2), burger buns, tortillas, chocolate croissantCereal - toasted Os, shredded wheat, puffed kamut Fresh fruit - apples, bananas, mangoes, cantaloupe, pearFresh vegetables - lettuce, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, red pepper, zucchini Other - chutney, ketchup (expensive in glass container), cucumber dill sauce, prepared wasabi egg salad, coffee All was in relatively small quantities as there are only two of us and much of it will carry over to other weeks but that is the case every week. I would think that the typical food basket used to gauge inflation would have more meat and prepared food but less of the other category and fresh foods.I continue to try to strike the right balance between buying for what we will eat in a week vs stockpiling. Of course have things like condiments, partially used containers of grains, baking ingredients, etc. is unavoidable I am curious if I buy before I need things.

{"title": "Clothing - Why do we spend so much time, money and thought on it?", "date": "Wednesday, June 12, 2013", "text": "My version of this quote: ‚Äé\"People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel.\"- Maya Angelou isPeople may not remember exactly what you wore,but they will remember how you made them feel.Since I am participating in Project 333 and read the ongoing thoughts of other participants on the related Facebook page, I have thought quite a bit these last few months about clothes. Not only what clothes I want to wear out of what I have but what clothes to buy, how much to spend and why we even care about how clothing looks.There are many blog posts, web articles and books about what constitutes a reasonable wardrobe although they have to be considered with lots of caveats - what is the range of weather where you live, what is the life you actually live, etc. When I worked full time I liked the idea of capsule wardrobes with items that mixed and matched well. It saved a lot of money on my professional wardrobe and made it easy to pack for the travel required of a consultant or professional working for a nationwide company. We had a tight budget back then so this concept was very helpful in that arena as well and since suits or similar separates were the required \"uniform\" for women in my profession I went with that. Not a lot of angst there.Since I have been an independent part time consultant and now that I have decided to retire from that profession, the whole wardrobe thing has gotten harder. I spend a lot of time doing family/home related things, volunteering in a role that gets me dirty at times, and going out to eat/theater or meetings. Then there are the occasional party, wedding or, sadly, funeral. Add to that the fact that I don't love to shop for clothes but do love color, want to save as much as possible for retirement while enjoying ourselves, and like to feel \"put together\", and you have time spent on trying to find the simple solution to this stage of life that matches the professional capsule wardrobe of the past. So here are a few thoughts.Project 333 is a good variation on the capsule wardrobe approach and participating in the related Facebook page discussions is helpful. Both encourage you to streamline your wardrobe to one that fits you and your life right now.There are some very helpful blogs out there that will help you think about how to put together your wardrobe - check out The Vivienne Files or Over 50, Feeling 40It can be helpful to identify your style and put a name on it - for example \"Classic with a Twist\" guides a friend of mine.Likewise knowing what shapes and colors make you feel and look good will save a lot of time and money.Speaking of money, you don't have to spend a lot to have a wardrobe that works for you - read the Save on Clothing post over at TightwadIf you go to the store or browse clothing websites you may spend a lot more than you would like and still not like what you have - for help, check out Recovering ShopaholicClothing will not make you a happier, nicer, friendlier person nor make you life more meaningful.

Of course it was the hottest summer I've experienced in our 15 years here so the air conditioner was working hard during the most expensive time of the day. Our 12 month commitment to the plan runs through part of this summer so I am trying to figure out what I can do during the $0.05 per kwh time (7pm to 2pm) vs the $0.20 kwh time (2pm to 7pm).The air conditioner is going to run at the set temperature but so far this summer the weather is cooler which will help.I already make sure to shut the blinds/curtains during the afternoon and run the dishwasher only during the cheaper rate times. I was doing laundry on weekends when the variable rate doesn't apply but have realized that doesn't help me save money with the lowest rate so I'll do it on a week day morning.What else?

{"title": "Yikes! Lots of plastic touching our food", "date": "Tuesday, June 4, 2013", "text": "So how did that inventory of food related plastic turn out?We buy lots of food wholly or partially packaged in plastic: Cereal, dried fruit, pasta, rice, legumes, bread products, crackers, chicken broth, canola oil, honey, brown sugar, maple syrup, baking powder, nuts, peanut butter, mayonnaise, ketchup, salad dressing, BBQ sauce spices, tea, mil, soy milk, nondairy spread, mustard, sun dried tomatoes, yogurt, hummus, cheese, lunch meat, meat, fish, frozen vegetables and fruit, frozen waffles and pancakes, veggie burgers, coffee, and lined cans. Toothpaste and mouthwash count too as they go in our mouth.We store food in plastic containers, bags and wrap on serve it on plastic trays at times. We use plastic to prepare food: lettuce spinner, Teflon pans, nylon spatulas and spoons, measuring spoons and cups, whisk, pastry brush, vegetable scrubber, bowl, strainer, blender, food processor, waffle iron and ice bucket. Some of these items are rarely used or are hard plastic which I believe is less dangerous so they are low priority.I did pull out some plastic containers that have the telltale sign of having microwaved tomato based food in them. They will be re-purposed to hold non-food items if possible and, if not, recycled.So what is the plan? I am going to try to find substitutes for items as they are used up or in the case of plastic food storage slowly replace with non-plastic items. I started by moving three old Pyrex casseroles with lids that are never used into the food container drawer. I'm going to save a few jars to use to store items only available in plastic containers or to use for leftover food storage. I'll continue to reuse plastic produce bags and when they finally run out try to find non-plastic replacements. We do use plastic shopping bags as trash bags so I expect that will continue as will recycling what plastic we can.First up on the research list is a glass orange juice container to replace the old plastic one.Today's Decluttering Items2 foreign coins worth a whole $0.08 and from an African country we never visited.

{"title": "Rightsizing home improvement plans", "date": "Friday, May 31, 2013", "text": "As readers of this blog know, we only plan to stay in this house until Hubby retires in 4 1/2 years. However both of our bathrooms need total remodels and at least some improvement to make the house readily marketable. Several years ago we paid to have plans and estimates for redoing each of them and then were unwilling to pay the amount required. Part of the reason was that each realtor we have talked to has said our house will probably be bought by someone who will gut it and add on to it given the way the neighborhood is going.So, I have resurrected the what to do about the bathrooms question this week. I started out wanting to replace everything in the downstairs bathroom, but do it on a budget. That doesn't look doable based on my research. We had a discussion tonight and came up with a plan that does seem doable in stages.We are going to do the downstairs bathroom first.1. Get the window replaced, the second door closed off and a new door for the linen closet with the work done by someone who has done similar projects for us before. I'm calling him today.2. Get a company that refinishes tubs and counter tops out to see if they can successfully do that with the 1970's acrylic ones we have and what it would cost. If it is feasible then pick out the color and plan to do it after step 3. If it is not feasible then we will have to buy and have installed a new counter top, tub and surround. Cross your fingers for us!3. Get a grout repair company to work on the tile floors in both bathrooms. 4. Paint a lovely new color, buy a window blind that can be installed to open at the top, and perhaps get new towels.The master bath needs, in addition to the floor refreshing, the following.1. A new sink and medicine cabinet. This will take some research as it is an awkward spot to find the right products for, but the man we are having do the window, etc. downstairs would be good for installing these.2. The shower tile replaced and a bent pipe fixed. Not sure who we would hire to do the tile work, but we will start asking around for recommendations. And we will hope the shower has not leaked at all requiring repair under the shower pan.So what are we not doing? We are not replacing either floor nor the upstairs bath windows. We are not changing out any light fixtures, getting new fans or moving electrical. We are using the existing relatively new toilets and the storage units already in the upstairs bath. We are not removing the whole house fan from the upstairs bathroom and raising the ceiling. We are not painting the upstairs bath. We are not widening the door of the downstairs bath and rearranging the floor plan which would require moving the window too. We are not rearranging the floor plan of the upstairs bath to put in double sinks. And hopefully we are not replacing the counter top, tub or surround in the downstairs bath. So there you have it. Better \"curb appeal\" for much less than if we did the versions we really want. Still a major investment, but at least we can enjoy the results for the next 4 years and hopefully sell at a higher price when the time comes."},
{"title": "Further news on The Wartime Wardrobe Challenge", "date": "Tuesday, May 28, 2013", "text": "As I have mentioned, I am seeing how I do trying to participate in The Wartime Wardrobe Challenge. Check out the explanation and see the points chart at Jean of all Trades and you will see that you can only purchase clothes this year up to the value of your 66 \"clothing coupons\" using the updated Womenswear Rationing Chart.I only had 7 left for the remainder of the year but luckily secondhand clothes are points free. So the two sleeveless tops I thrifted recently still leave me with 7 points.This is a great challenge to do in conjunction with Project 333 as the whole point of that project is that we don't need so many clothes in a season's wardrobe and could do without a lot of our clothes shopping!¬†I keep shortening my clothing shopping list and in fact have cut it down to one item: a sleeveless sleep top which I bought today. I'm going to turn an existing pair of PJ pants into shorts and that will make a summer sleep outfit. PJs are 8 points but a shirt is 5 so I'm going to have 2 points left. For 2 points I could get a pair of tights/stockings/nylons or 2 pairs of socks or 4 handkerchiefs or a scarf/hat/gloves/mittens. Right now I don't want or need any of those things.¬†It is interesting to contemplate what I would do if this was real. I'd probably get one of those things with my last 2 points and trade it for something I need and would use if I could find someone who had excess or something that didn't fit. I'd probably be shopping secondhand diligently. Or I'd just get on with my life and focus on other things! Good advice at this time - instead of shopping, do something productive, interesting, kind, or fun."},

He also came home from work and drove me to the follow up appointment the next day. I am very grateful for such care and the outcome.2. My son who just got married is in town on business and staying with us for the weekend as well as last night. We took him out for dinner and had a good time. He planned ahead and asked us if we would like to go to a baseball game on Saturday and bought the tickets.

{"title": "The unpredictable cost of taking care of your health", "date": "Friday, May 10, 2013", "text": "Every article or book I have read about retirement planning mentions the two financial wild cards - health care and long term care costs. Both have been known to bankrupt retirees and younger folks as well. We aren't retired yet but do see the expense and unpredictability of health care costs in our own lives.First up are my teeth. I have been paying off the braces I've had for 2+ years and will have my last payment this month. Lest you think this was a cost driven by vanity, having had braces as a teenager I had no desire to go through that again until I was told it was braces or I could count on having at least 2 teeth pulled in the near future and then would need something (implants, a bridge, etc.) to replace them. Since my teeth are healthy, I chose braces. Of course in the last few months one of those healthy teeth with an old filling has broken and I now need a crown which was not budgeted for.Then there are my eyes. I was trying to hold off on cataract surgery until I had Medicare on top of employer health insurance. Less than 1 1/2 years to go for that but I am having great trouble driving safely under a number of conditions so I have the first cataract surgery this coming Monday. Yesterday I got a phone call telling me my copay would be at least $2800. When both eyes have been operated on and recovered I will need an eye exam and new glasses as well.We are very fortunate; we can afford this. However because the broken tooth and eye surgery were not planned/expected for 2013 we did not max out our health savings account which allows us to pay for health care expenses with non-taxable dollars and thereby reduces the cost.I dread to even imagine what our health care costs may run the rest of our lives as we develop more health problems. We both have had major health scares plus some necessary surgeries in the past 10 years that were very costly even with good insurance.We do what we can by eating healthy food, exercising, managing stress, etc. Still it feels like a roll of the dice and all we can do is continue to try to increase our savings so we have the funds to pay for whatever turns up.How are you handling the unpredictability of health care costs? Do you have a separated savings account for this purpose?"},

The rehearsal and rehearsal dinner were in a park late afternoon and the weather was very cooperative - hot and sunny. They hired a gourmet taco truck and provided vintage sodas, cookies and lots of yard games. We met lots more of our new DIL's extended family and friends and had a really good time.Saturday we headed to the boutique hotel the wedding party had booked exclusively. It was a great place for them with a large inner courtyard that had a fireplace, lots of furniture, space for hair and makeup stations, and it was also near the beach. They guys went swimming while the girl's started getting ready. We visited, ate lunch, got my makeup professionally done, and received gifts from our son - mine was a tote with Mother of the Groom in gold print on the side - fun and immediately put to use to carry some flats to the wedding so I could change shoes later!. We got dressed up (we cleaned up pretty well I think) and then helped chauffeur the wedding party to various photo locations and finally to the wedding venue. The wedding itself was lovely, very touching, very full of love and very personalized. They wrote the ceremony and their vows, planned every detail, and a friend officiated. Since he is a composer, he also wrote a piece for their recessional. My son and I danced the traditional mother-son dance which I happily and surprisingly found very emotional as we talked while we danced. Everything was great - great food, lots of loving people, lots of dancing, and a very happy newly married couple. We passed on going to the after party, but I heard it was lots of fun too.Sunday the wedding party and close family met up for brunch and then hubby and I stopped by the newlywed's place to help a bit. We spent the rest of the day on our own and flew home on Monday after taking a drive to return something they had rented.The photos taken by people attending are starting to roll in on facebook and are very fun to see.

Check out the explanation and see the points chart at Jean of all TradesAccording to this challenge you can only purchase clothes this year up to the value of your 66 \"clothing coupons\" using the updated Womenswear Rationing ChartI had already used 54 of my 66 coupons before starting this challenge and now I have use 5 more for a total of 59. Yikes, I only have 7 left for the end of the year.I did find a lovely dressy casual sleeveless top at a consignment shop and as secondhand clothes are points free that doesn't count. However I had to buy a loose fitting button shirt to wear to my upcoming cataract surgery as that is required and I don't own one. I tried on one of hubby's shirts but is was a lot looser than I think they are looking for even though he is quite slim! I tried hard to find a shirt that was inexpensive, loose enough especially in the sleeves (have to push up to put on the blood pressure cuff) and a color I would like to wear. I managed to fit the first two criteria and not the last. Unfortunately this is not an occasion you can ask to borrow something for except from hubby and I chose not to do that. I suppose that during the war I indeed would have borrowed a shirt and crossed my fingers hoping that it wasn't damaged or worn my hubby's.I've shortened my clothing shopping list but I need to find more secondhand wonders to finish my shopping for Spring/Summer:¬† - Black sandals- 4 pairs of shorts or casual skirts & 2 everyday sleeveless tops¬†- Dressy casual skirt or a dressy casual sundress for summer wedding- Dressy casual dress in dark color other than black (so can wear to funerals if needed)- Summer PJs/nightgownWith my remaining points I could buy new a pair of shoes OR a pair of shorts OR a nightgown. It must have been very challenging to live with this rationing but at least everyone was in the same boat.I have checked out three consignment/thrift stores and have decided the 2 nearest me have possibilities if I check them frequently. I'm really hoping to find a nice skirt to go with the top I just bought and wear that to the mid-July dressy casual wedding at Lake Tahoe.I asked my Mom about clothes rationing in the US during the war and she said she doesn't remember it being much of a problem for her even though she was in her late teens/ early 20s at the time. She remembers having 2 dresses for work and a pair of pants and a blouse but probably had more. She remembers quite vividly though getting a new pair of red high heeled sandals to wear dancing! The dry cleaners was on the same block (they lived in an apartment over their store) and she just had her clothing dry cleaned frequently. Given that she lived in Illinois with hot, humid summers and no air conditioning I be it was frequent."},

There was not a single bag in the store. Turns out there had been a massive recall due to salmonella contamination. Since my dog is fine with the bag of food she has almost finished, I was curious about the risk. Turns out it is a potential risk to humans that caused the recall.¬† I also learned that Innova was sold to Procter and Gamble so it is now made by a food conglomerate.We only purchased Innova because that was what she was eating when we adopted her and I don't like to mess with success where tummies/digestive issues are concerned. Today I ended up buying a small bag of another recommended brand, Nutri Source, to try to see if she does well on it. Turns out this is a family owned business that likes to do business with family owned pet stores like our neighborhood store. They also have shifted to compostable bags and seem to do other good things. Looks like we will be switching brands if all goes well with Lola's tummy."},

Wouldn't it be nice to have a lot of machines at home so it could all be done quickly LOL. I was talking with my Mom recently about doing laundry and she started reminiscing about how excited she was to move from a washing machine with a hand wringer to one that spun the water out. I remember that wringer washer. Most of my childhood she did not have a dryer and hung all of the laundry outdoors in the summer and in the basement in the winter. Then she would sprinkle water on the clothes to be ironed, let them sit for a while to get damp and she (or I) would then iron them with a non-steam iron. So I'm really not complaining!Yesterday I finally stopped procrastinating on a few things and finished altering a new pair of ankle pants to take up the waist a bit and mended a recently purchased dressy sleeveless linen/silk top bought secondhand. The top is supposed to be hand washed but I don't do that so it is in a net bag going through the washer right now and that hopefully will work out. I also buckled down and finished raking and sweeping the street and sidewalks to get up all the oak seed droppings before they were ground into dust even more than they had been. Clearly the drought is over here as I haven't seen so much mess from the oaks in the 15 springs we have lived here.Today I intend to stop procrastinating on a few more things.DONE next day - Clean the upstairs (have I mentioned how much I hate vacuuming!)DONE - Iron the shirt hubby bought for our son's wedding (I'll iron it just this once)DONE - Scuff up the slippery soles of the shoes I bought for the wedding so I won't take a prat fallDONE next day - Mend the little holes in our down comforter as we have the goal of making everything possible last for 5 more years and then not moving the worn out things.What is on your list for today?"},

In S. CA we had termites to be sure and the occasional lizard that came in the house (a broom sweeps them out the door) but not the pests and pestilence that we experience here.

In retrospect we should have bought a new house with very, very little yard but what did we know!On a positive note, our yard looks lovely right now with azaleas of all kinds in bloom, the trees leafed out or in the process and other blooming shrubs doing there thing. We have had some good rain on several different days which is helping with the pollen count although it is still in the thousands. Allergy meds make walking the dog doable and that makes her happy.

His fiancee is off on her Bachlorette weekend and his Bachelor weekend is this next one. They both are spending time with friends exploring restaurants and activities in different locations. Sounds like lovely vacations to me.Hubby then put a primer coat on the new TV stand for upstairs. We washed a very stinky dog and laughed again because she love baths so much that she jumps in the tub on her own. The hair dryer is a favorite too. I did some cleaning and fixed dinner featuring leftover turkey burgers, a mix of spinach, corn and grape tomatoes, and pink grapefruit. Exciting day huh?Today he plans to get two coats of pain on the TV stand and then in a week we can set things up so I can have an exercise area where there is actually room to move!

{"title": "Clothes rationing in Britain during WWII", "date": "Sunday, March 24, 2013", "text": "Clothes rationing began on June 1, 1941, two years after food rationing started.   Clothes rationing ended on March 15, 1949. Initially each person had 60 coupons for clothing per year, but it was later reduced to 48. Children received an additional 10 coupons to take into account growth during the year.People were highly encouraged to make do, mend and remake clothing as well as to use curtains, old sheets/pillowcases, etc. to make clothing. I saw one guide to encourage using men's wool suits to make new clothes since so many men were in uniform and the suits were mothballed. There was also a lot of knitting reusing yarn from unraveled sweaters and socks. You can watch a Ministry of Supply move about Make Do and Mend on You Tube. You can also buy the original or a reproduction pamphlet via Amazon but get a taste of what was recommended hereThere are archived free materials too such as MakeMendForVictoryMy personal favorite in the make do and mend category so far are the materials by \"Mrs. Sew and Sew\" as shown on this Pinterest boardTheir is a also a blog written by a woman who tried to follow food, gas, clothing, etc. guidelines for the US during WWII for a year. Lots of resources on the web and other blogger's challenges if you are interested in more.I can relate to rationing as a driver for limited consumption and extra creativity than I can to stories of suffering during the Great Depression. I think it is because everyone was in the same predicament with rationing (not true for food of course if you were a farmer) and that led to resources and community efforts."},

So here is the list along with some learnings.My colors for Winter were black, denim, gray, white, red & purple and that worked out well. We had a mild winter so I only wore my black wool coat once, never wore the hat & scarf, only wore the dressier black slacks a couple of times and lived in the jeans and a heavy black cardigan. I \"cheated\" by wearing a brown cardie, a couple of scarves and some jewelry not on the list a few times. I don't like the brown cardigan that much but got tired of black. I also don't like the gray t-neck but it was useful on a couple of really cold days. So I need to decide whether to keep those 2 items going forward. Maybe I'll replace the brown cardigan with a cardigan in a better color and get a warm top to replace the t-neck?My 33 clothing items this Winter.¬†¬†¬†¬† 1¬†¬†¬† black purse¬†¬†¬†¬† 2¬†¬†¬† black loafers¬†¬†¬†¬† 3 ¬†¬† black wedges¬†¬†¬†¬† 4 ¬†¬† raincoat¬†¬†¬†¬† 5¬†¬†¬† black fleece jacket¬†¬† ¬† 6¬†¬†¬† red anorak¬†¬†¬†¬† 7¬†¬†¬† black wool coat¬† ¬†¬† 8¬†¬†¬† hat/gloves/scarf¬† ¬†¬† 9¬†¬†¬† black casual slacks¬†¬† ¬†10¬†¬† black dressy slacks¬†¬† ¬†11¬†¬† jeans¬†¬† ¬†12¬†¬† jeans¬†¬† ¬†13¬†¬† jeans¬†¬† ¬†14¬†¬† black 3/4 sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†15¬†¬† purple 3/4 sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†16¬†¬† gray 3/4 sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†17¬†¬† red 3/4 sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†18¬†¬† lavender long sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†19¬†¬† charcoal long sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†20¬†¬† red orange long sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†21¬†¬† cranberry long sleeve shirt¬†¬† ¬†22¬†¬† red long sleeve shirt¬† ¬† 23 ¬† gray t-neck ¬†¬† ¬†24¬†¬† purple cowl neck sweater¬†¬† ¬†25 ¬† red cable cardigan¬†¬† ¬†26 ¬† red cardigan¬†¬† ¬†27 ¬† black cable cardigan¬†¬† ¬†28 ¬† black cardigan¬†¬† ¬†29 ¬† black fleece vest¬†¬†¬† 30 ¬† belt¬†¬† ¬†31 ¬† red, cream, blue scarf¬†¬† ¬†32 ¬† earrings¬†¬† ¬†33 ¬† necklace"},
{"title": "Choosing where to spend our \"optional\" money - what does it say about us?", "date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2013", "text": "Some of my friends have gotten very interested in helping me look as good as possible at my son's wedding in May. I had a makeup session with one friend, another has lent me a sparkly silver cardigan in case it is as chilly as I expect, and yet another is encouraging me to get a pedicure since my dress shoes are open toe. One of them wanted to lend me some beautiful earrings, but I don't have pierced ears. Such lovely friends!Since I stopped wearing makeup years ago and have never paid for manicures/pedicures, the idea of spending on those on a regular basis caused me to pause and think about where we choose to spend the money we don't \"need\" to spend. Some big optional spending categories for us are travel (mostly to visit family), gifts, Pilates private sessions, the Poodle Princess' expenses, and eating out. Others are technology (cable package, buying a larger tv this week and a Kindle), wine/beer, art classes, and theatre/movie tickets. I guess I should add having two cars as I no longer work and we could manage with one although it would be a pain and seriously limit my mobility as there is poor public transportation here. We don't spend much on cell phones, clothing, home furnishings, or books/magazines although we do get the local newspaper and use the library a lot. We do max out our retirement accounts which is chunk of money in itself.Apparently from our spending patterns we value time with family, experiences, having a pet, gift giving, staying fit, and saving money. In fact we would spend a lot more on some areas such as travel if we weren't concerned about saving for retirement and didn't have such a costly house to operate. I'm hoping that we can shift the proportion of money going to savings and housing vs. travel and fun once we retire and sell this house. I don't see us having one car though unless we can manage to live in a location with great public transportation and good services within walking distance.The only short term change planned is to stop the Pilates private sessions and use the now extra tv and existing dvd player to set up an exercise space. I'm also planning to join a gym that has Pilates classes and is a bargain because our insurance offers a discount on membership - I have to commit to a 3 month membership and will do that soon. I'll spend some of the savings on therapeutic massages as I am no longer seeing the physical therapist for my \"frozen\" shoulder but it is healing very slowly and still hurts. We will also soon be finished paying for my orthodonture but I'm sure some other health care expense will pop up.Have you ever looked at your spending in terms of what it says about your values?"},

{"title": "Part 5: Preparing for Retirement - Will you have enough money to live on?", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "Will you have enough money to live on after you retire? This question is so scary that many people just decide not to explore the answer. Others are put off by the repeated mantra of the media that you need \"x\" million $s to be able to retire as the vast majority of us will never have anywhere near the amount cited.Sharon of MidLifeMomMusings has used this retirement calculator to figure out an estimate of what she and her husband will need and made a plan to start working towards achieving those savings. I highly suggest you read her post and think about where you are starting from and want to end up.We went to a fee only financial planner some years ago and asked this very question. Based on the assumptions used for the calculations at that time we were going to be ok but a lot has changed in the world economy and our personal economy since then so I need to try out this calculator myself and keep adding as much as possible to our savings. If you do decide to run the numbers don't forget that many people manage to retire by downsizing their lifestyle or moving to a less expensive location. Others live in shared housing or take other steps to stretch what they have."},

It also provides some links to other sites. The site is created by Chanel Reynolds whose husband died at 43 after being hit while riding his bike. (read her story here. His death was tragically early but also left a lot of complications as his wife did not know the passwords to their online accounts, they did not have signed wills, etc. although they did have some life insurance for him. Her new website is designed to help others avoid her predicament.If you've been putting off all or part of this, perhaps this will help you get moving forward step by step. Tough stuff to think about so think about those who might have to struggle through dealing with things if you don't get this done while you can."},

I finally got around to buying season tickets to this theatre so we have \"The Book Club Play\" to look forward to on June 1st.Sunday was warm and sunny again so we headed to Piedmont Park with the Poodle Princess and gave her a good long walk and exposure to lots of people and other dogs. She was eager and seemed to enjoy it. We ended the weekend with dinner at the counter in front of an open window at a Japanese restaurant nearby.Had a great time and it makes for good memories now that Monday has arrived cloudy with rain predicted for the afternoon.Hope you had a good weekend too."},
{"title": "Part 4: Preparing for Retirement - Who would handle your finances if you couldn't?", "date": "Friday, March 8, 2013", "text": "I have had excellent role models for this part of retirement planning. My parent's took the time and effort to make sure both my brother and I have powers of attorney and health care power of attorney. Still, when my father was close to death we discovered there were some gaps in the legal authority to handle financial matters and had to have their attorney come to the hospital with documents for him to sign. We also had to change how the bank and investment firm listed ownership of /access to accounts. Not too bad to take care of because my mother was, and still is, living. We think we have done the legal paperwork our children would need to have to take over our finances but probably should get some legal advice as we did it all 15 years ago when we moved to the state we currently live in. I do update a list of all of our accounts including insurance annually and send it to the designated executors of our estate. With online accounts and no paper trail in many cases this becomes even more important.My parents also spent the last few years of my Dad's life showing us all of their financial records so we would be very familiar with it. We made lists of accounts, credit cards, etc. and make sure everything was easy to find in their files. That led to getting updated copies of their trust and other legal documents. We still review things for my Mom although she is fully capable of and does handle her own finances at 92.These are hard things to talk about and to take care of especially if your family is dispersed around the country as ours is. My brother has it even worse because one of his sons lives overseas. Yet it is important.Have you and your spouse if you have one addressed these issues for yourselves and kept them up to date? Are you open with information that the designated persons would need to take over?"},

However it hurts like heck while freezing up and then you have restricted use of your arm. I've been going to PT since late September in an effort initially to keep it from freezing up completely. Having had the other shoulder do that 10 or 12 years ago I didn't want the same experience and recognized the symptoms. Well that was successful and I have expanded the range of motion and functionality but it still won't move in certain directions. The therapist believes that they can't really help me any further and I just have to keep doing the exercises/stretches at home. I can go back if it regresses - which I won't let it.I can't swim or do exercises in certain directions but I can start doing more. So I'm, starting with a DVD program tomorrow and then joining a gym once I use up all my prepaid Pilates sessions.

It is a brighter blue than it seems and satin so it has shine. Much more \"me\" than anything else I looked at and I am happy with the purchase. The bride's mother decided on a short dress so I was able to go that route too.

I don't know what to do about these things.My life insurance is reasonable and if I needed long term care for a terminal illness it would compensate for the expense either post hoc or, depending on the state I lived in at the time, we could tap into it for those expenses as they occurred. I no longer earn any significant income so it isn't needed to compensate for lost income and we don't have a mortgage or other debt to pay off.

I just finished reading How to Retire the Cheapskate Way by Jeff Yeager (checked out from the library of course) and then an article in this morning's Washington Post. Both are correct and have wisdom to offer. And then there is the movie, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, that we watched last night - touches on all the same issues. Losing retirement funds, not having enough in the first place, surprises about finances after death of a spouse, needing to work in old age, health care problems, relationships, etc. albeit in a superficial manner.Yeager talks about how long term decisions can ease the financial burdens of retirement including buying a small forever home and living in it through all the stages of life. Those of us with careers that move us around can't do that, but we can downsize for retirement. He also talks about remedies for not having a lot of money to retire on and cites examples of people who are making retirement work on little money. His approach is to find ways to live happy and meaning filled lives regardless of your financial situation. He does bring up the health care cost conundrum near the end of the book, but really has no solutions for those with few assets and acknowledges that is a difficult and perhaps unsolvable issue. Fiscal trouble ahead for most future retirees talks about how the fiscal downturn destroyed 40% of Americans personal wealth coupled with pressures to reduce Social Security and Medicare benefits and evidence that 53% of Americans 30 and older are on a path that leaves them financially unprepared for retirement creates a perfect storm.A lot of people struggle with how to know how much they will have as income as they age and you can't know if you are on a reasonable financial and lifestyle path if you don't have that information. The Social Security Administration makes getting an estimate of your monthly benefit easy with their My Social Security page where you create an account that lets you get benefit estimates and later sign up for benefits, etc. If you have a 401k, 403b or similar account your account holder may have a web based tool that lets you estimate your monthly benefit at different ages or have a representative who can assist you in doing that. There are other tools available but pick them carefully as some are designed to encourage you to invest in their products.The key is to get an idea of what your after retirement income will be and how your income streams will be designed. That can include rental property income or renting out a room or storage space in your home. It may include a job but it can be risky to count on that as your health or the economy may make that difficult.We are just under 5 years from my husband's retirement and I have already basically retired (I'm older, have had health problems and seen my career derailed by the economy). This past week we have been looking at income estimates from our various retirement income sources and discussing some of the decisions we will have to make before knowing the final number (e.g. single life or survivor annuities, monthly cash withdrawals, etc.). It is not simple and we will take advantage of our access to Federal employee retirement seminars, TIAA-CREF's individualize counseling and online tools. I do update annually a simple spreadsheet with estimates for each income stream - it helps us sleep at night. On a personal level, the fact that concerns me the most is that health care costs continue to outpace inflation and long term care costs could wipe us out. Can't control that, but when you couple it with our plan to relocate close to our sons in S. Cal and go on at least one major trip a year and we will have a more expensive retirement than we would if we would live in a location with a low cost of living. So this is a topic of great interest to me.Some other aspects of Preparing for Retirement that also interest me and that I will be writing about are:- How you will spend your time in retirement & starting now to live it on a smaller scale- Keeping physically fit as you age- Living large while living frugally- Seeing the world and learning new things in retirement- When spouse's have different visions for their retirementSuggestions for other topics? I would love to get a discussion going about this!"},

Last year's weekly spending average was $139.82 so I have $7 to add to last week's savings of $43 for a total of $50.This past week's savings was very low because I bought things like maple syrup, dishwasher soap and other infrequently purchased items.

Hard habits to break and the challenge of balancing shopping once a week vs. when needed.I also seem to be finding it very hard to pass up sales on things I know we will use eventually.I'm hoping to have saved/not spent $100 by the end of February to make an unbudgeted contribution to a local organization that works to eliminate homelessness for families.As usual, we adjusted the menu to fit what came up and energy levels. We had turkey burgers instead of turkey meat loaf, an omelet instead of salad Nicoise, and vegetable soup (including the potatoes & green beans bought for the salad Nicoise) instead of minestrone. In fact we had soup two nights.

I just don't like financial surprises when I am feeling so good about the year's planned budget. But then I want you to please indulge me in a whine! I'll be better afterwards - I promise.It really is not budget friendly to have part of a tooth break off especially when you aren't chewing on anything hard. I need a crown although it is not urgent as there is no pain thankfully. Having braces complicates the whole thing and I'll see how the dentist and orthodontist decide to proceed. I made it clear I want at least a temporary crown before we fly off on May 2nd to attend our son's wedding! A dental emergency during the wedding celebrations would not be fun.Speaking of weddings, it turns out the hotel will not honor the wedding group rate for the last night we need to stay. We really don't want to get back to the East coast really late at night so unless our son can convince them to make a change to the contract that final night will be more expensive.¬† Moving on it is now clear why I can't see very well when driving at night, on overcast days, or very sunny/glaring days. I saw an opthamologist yesterday and I am now scheduled for cataract surgery. One eye in May and the other in June.Then there is the budget buster that has me totally baffled. Our Federal taxes for 2012 are almost identical to what we owed for 2011 although our taxable income is quite a bit lower. Truly don't understand that one! Even though I thought I was paying enough in estimated taxes on top of withholding from our paychecks yet we still owe a significant amount and possibly a small penalty. We will also need to make larger estimated tax payments this year to avoid this problem next year. At least the usual occurred with our state taxes. The withholding is always slightly more than what we owe and we get a few hundred back each year. After thinking about this one I am going to invest in tax software and see if the results are the same.The final unexpected expense is that we have what we hope is a chipmunk and not something worse that has figured out how to get into our basement by expanding the hole where the air conditioner unit hoses enter the space. Hubby has tried everything he can think of to close the hole and make it rodent proof but no luck. We've decided we have to hire the critter removers who squirrel proofed our attic a few years ago. All I can say is onward into the rest of 2013 with fingers crossed. We are fortunate that we can afford all of this but at 60 and 63 we are really trying to add as much as possible to our savings. My Mom is 91 and going strong while my FIL will be 86 this month. We need to plan on funding long lives which is a good thing!"},

Of course there are some emails, etc. between in person visits but still I think having that ease of long term friendship is marvelous.She is at a conference in my city so I picked her up and brought her to my neighborhood to see some of our favorite local places. I picked a Thai restaurant for dinner as I knew that on a Wednesday night it would be quiet enough for us to actually talk and linger over dinner. The food is always great too. Then we walked around the corner to my favorite and local coffee place and chatted more. Hard to believe we met 50 years ago when she moved to my home town!

I especially love watching the children pick out books and get lost in reading them while they wait for their parents.We raised at least $4800!

The donated used book and media triage at my library is interesting. First the library can take what they can use for the collection. They have had huge budget cuts and we are sending more their way. Then we pull out what we think we can sell. Then the literacy and outreach coordinator pulls what can be used for literacy programs or sent to county health centers for children, to homeless shelters or prisons, etc. The remainder gets sold for pulp - mostly the filthy, water or insect damaged, mildewed or just plain obsolete books.Lots of work but a good result."},

She is spending as little as possible so she can give more despite her own needs.When I read the list of what she will buy eventually I feel very spoiled. When I read about the activities she and her children are doing without spending extra money I feel a desire to be more creative. When I read about her efforts to spend meaningful time with friends I feel inspired.I like the idea of buying nothing extra and am going to apply it to food/household goods/toiletries for a month. Obviously I will spend, but only on the bare minimums. Since we are way over our planned budget in this category already in 2013, this should help us get back on track. I won't be buying anything extra no matter how good the coupons or sales. We don't need to stock our home. I can do that!What I will spend on: food that is store-bought, off brands if possible, in season fruits and veggies if possible, and only when I run out of stuff in cupboards, frig, freezer (or nearly out of crucial things like toilet paper!). Anyone want to join in for February?I'd like to make a donation to The Decatur Cooperative Ministry that addresses local needs for food and shelter by providing short and long term solutions. Their mission is to help families prevent, endure, and overcome        homelessness. This organization was not on our list of planned donations for 2013, but will be receiving a donation from us on March 1st.We could make the donation regardless, but I think for me the discipline of buying nothing extra; only buying what we absolutely need will be a learning experience.

I knew rates had gone up and had forgotten that it was an 11% increase. The same increase in rates will be applied in 2013 and 2014. That will be $45 to $50 annually for us based on last year's usage. It is to pay for massive sewer line work that had been delayed for many decades resulting in many sewage spills into creeks and rivers. A good reason to raise rates.I'm not sure how to reduce our water use further. Our new dishwasher should use less water and we can pre-rinse less. We could go back to collecting the \"warm up\" shower water in a bucket and hauling it from the 2nd floor to the basement to use in the washer. I think that won't happen due to my shoulder and Hubby's back problems. I'd rather shower every other day in cool weather to save water. Other increases in our personal cost of living for 2013? The cable/internet/phone bundle went up 21% as the intro rate expired and I imagine there were other increases in fees/taxes. I am sure we will see increases in car and homeowner's insurance although our excess liability policy stayed the same. Our life insurance costs go up each year as well. Of course our OASDI withholding went back up 2% to the normal rate after the \"tax holiday\" as did everyone else's. I think the Medicare withholding went up a bit too. Our property appraisal is locked for the year but the rates will probably go up so our bill will too. We are very fortunate that our medical insurance rate only went up 1% after years of larger increases. The only thing I can think of that will go down is the personal property tax on our cars as it is based on value and they keep depreciating.Of course that leaves our discretionary expenses as the only place to see reductions.

I did find a new set of pajamas for warmer weather that are cheerful and fit will. What with the resolution to be kind to myself I decided that I would buy them and throw out several really old ones.

I'm not good at being sick once I feel well enough to believe I should feel like doing things as usual even though I can't!I cancelled appointments and plans for early this week so I won't being going to PT until Thursday or the dentist for two weeks. No fun scheduled either. I'm thinking that book club on Thursday night will probably still be more than I want to do. Oh, woe is me - LOL.I am looking forward today to:1. Getting our replacement dishwasher installed. All I have to do is watch!2. Putting myself through some stretching and PT exercises.3. Baking some pumpkin bread? Its going to be a rainy day and that with coffee sounds good.4. Listen to a new CD, \"The Blanco Sessions\" by Janis Martin 5. A Friends of the Library book sale planning meeting - even if I have to sit far away from everyone else!6. And of course playing with the poodle princess who has been so good about being a quiet and calm companion while I wasn't feeling well. She does naps well!There is lots more I can do if my energy holds up. I'm going to act like I have energy and see what happens."},
{"title": "Personal annual cost of living report", "date": "Saturday, January 12, 2013", "text": "OK, I admit it. I am copying this idea from An Exacting Life. Love the idea of an annual cost of living report for the family. So here is my version comparing 2012 to 2011 and how we did in major categories:HOUSING RELATED COSTS - Still outrageous, but better than last year. We seriously need to downsize.In the meantime I've been watching utilities, fighting for lower property taxes and making sure we maintain this place. Natural gas ‚Äì We used 590 therms of gas in 2011, versus 400 therms in 2012, a reduction of 32.3%! Wish I could take credit for the reduction but is was a warmer year. Rates also went down a bit so overall we spent 35.2% less in this category!Electricity ‚Äì We used 9278 kilowatt/hours in 2011, versus 8977 in 2012, a reduction of 3.2%. Spent 5% less too.Water, sewer & trash ‚Äì A reduction of 4.7% in water use, but the cost was 6.5% more! More work to do here as the water is the only part of the bill we can impact (sewer is based on water use and trash is fixed cost).Property tax ‚Äì We challenged our property value appraisal and won a small reduction that will last for 2 or 3 years. Our overall cost stayed the same this year if you include the cost of hiring an expert to handle the appeal. Since rates went up a lot that was still a win.Of course I would have also been happy if my house had actually been worth what they estimated!Home insurance ‚Äì A 10.3% increase here plus our excess liability rider went up 4.8%. One of those areas where it is so hard to impact cost although I call each year and ask for ways to cut it down.Home & yard maintenance - This is a part of our budget that drives me crazy, but at least it went down 38.5%. I can't even remember why it was higher in 2011 - probably related to tree work. We do need to do some work inside this year and haven't even begun to grapple with a budget for that. FOOD & HOUSEHOLD GOODS RELATED COSTSI have been working on cutting back in this area and in fact we reduced both our shopping and eating out expenses. A reduction of 13.5% for shopping and 3.9% for eating out.CARS We have two of these lovelies and live in car centric Atlanta. No public transit for us. However we spent 10.8% less on gas in 2012. That is due to driving less, lower gas costs and buying discounted gas debit cards when offered as a promotion by our grocery store (more please!). Of course car insurance went up but since I track it with license and tax costs I'm not sure of the percentage.HEALTH CAREDespite new glasses, orthodonture, pilates and PT for me as well as the usual doctor and dentist visits we spent 3.6% less in this category. I'll take what I can get and be grateful for good health insurance.So now for the not so good news. We made less in 2012 due to Federal employees no longer being able to get bonuses or raises and a sharp decrease in my consulting work. We also spent 5% less overall, but the two didn't even out.Still, overall we are happy with how we spent our money this past year. We maxed out our retirement accounts, slightly increased our donations, and gave some major gifts to family members including our portion of our son's upcoming wedding. Our travel costs went up but we had more time with family and a brief vacation. I don't regret a penny of any of that although I know it will not be sustainable in retirement. Just means we have to move closer to family!Do you ever look at your spending this way?"},

{"title": "Fun trip to Los Angeles", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2013", "text": "Last week we headed to LA for a mini-vacation and family visit time. We started out by staying one night at a hotel downtown so that we could explore on foot some of the changes that have occurred in the 15 years since we moved away. Straight from the airport to an Italian Deli that has operated since 1929. We had lunch with friends from grad school 35 years ago. Then downtown for a self-guided walk of the historic buildings in the \"old downtown\" section. We rode the renovated Angel's Flight funicular, saw great architecture from the 1890s to 1930s and went through the bustling Grand Central Market and by other stores nearby including this Quinceanera dress shop. Sorry for the blurry photo; just think of it looking like the girls are all dancing!¬†The next morning we hiked down to the Staples Center to see the part of town that now is full of lofts, condos and apartments as well as restaurants and other shops. It was great to see so many people out walking their dogs early on a Saturday morning in a part of town that used to be pretty deserted.Then we hiked up Bunker Hill to the Disney Concert Hall for another self-guided tour this time with my older son's girlfriend. He was sick and I didn't get to see him this visit as he didn't want to infect us (happened anyway!). I highly recommend touring the Disney Concert Hall. The architecture is fabulous and it reminded us all of Gaudi's works in Barcelona with a modern twist.Then we headed over to Phillipe's for French Dip sandwiches with our younger son, his fiancee and the older son's girlfriend. This is a classic old restaurant with sawdust on the floor near Union Station and Olivera Street which is the oldest part of Los Angeles where the original Pueblo was located - both of which we walked around.Then it was a break for coffee, heading out to buy wine to take to my husband's uncle's 90th birthday party, a stop at a wine bar to use up some time and then the big party. We spent the rest of the weekend at my FIL's with side trips to our younger son's place and a nice lunch and walk at the beach in Ventura.Lucky for me I didn't start feeling sick until the morning of the day we flew home. I see from the newspaper this morning that there are 3 viral epidemics in the country right now and I seem to have contracted the least bad one with no impact on our vacation. It was disappointing to not see my older son but kind of him to be worried about spreading the virus."},

After that hit, I am definately committed to sticking to our budget.We are leaving bright and early this Friday for a trip to be part of an uncle's 90th birthday celebration with the bonus of seeing both of our sons and their sweeties plus other friends and family members. The trip is mostly paid for (plane tickets and one night hotel) and I checked car rental rates about a week in advance and they had gone down over $100 from the reservation I had made earlier. That should help pay for some fun. This trip we are going to a relatively inexpensive restaurant for our lunch with our sons and their girlfriends and we are going to do a free tour of the Disney Concert Hall as part of exploring the changes in downtown LA and spending one night in a hotel downtown. The rest of the time will be with family.I did buy a lightweight cross body purse on sale yesterday to take as we will be walking around a lot and my one shoulder still hurts although it is slowly getting better. My physical therapist keeps reminding me that you can only get a frozen shoulder once in each shoulder. The right one happened 10+ years ago and I'm in the midst of the left one.¬† Since we are going away, today's grocery shopping was very light and I also resisted the urge to stop at the coffee house for a treat. Picked one up at the store for much less. No more shopping or spending before we leave.I have to admit that paying for a new dishwasher and installation was not in the plans. We did find one at Lowe's that has great reviews and that was on sale for $100 off. I charged it on 12/31 while their 10% off sale was on and saved an additional $50. Since our old dishwasher had surpassed the average life of dishwashers I think we did ok. It is 15 years old and the average is 9 years. That is why the maintenance budget line exists unfortunately.I'm doing the laundry so we can pack tomorrow (gotta love 8:30am flights) and making sure all the perishable food is gone or frozen. Have a stack of paperback books to take and need to print out some self-guided walking tour maps for downtown LA to use on Friday afternoon.Hope to take up some jeans & do some other mending this afternoon.

{"title": "Goodbye 2012 - you were great and I'm looking forward to 2013", "date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "text": "2012 was a year full of blessings for us. We were truly fortunate and we know it and are very grateful.Our family is well and happy as are we. We spent good time with our wide-spread family. We were in LA 3 times and saw lots of family each time - over New Year's with the bonus of seeing the Rose Parade with DS1 and his sweetie, in July right after DS2 and his sweetie moved back there, and over Thanksgiving. We¬† visited DS2 in Little Rock before his move to LA and helped him pack up his apartment. We also managed to go see my Mom and other family in NH twice.Rose Parade 2012Huntington Beach Pier July 2012At home in Atlanta what stands out was exploring new places and restaurants, participated in our first fundraising walk, seeing a couple of great plays at a small theater, fascinating art exhibits, the love and companionship provided by the lovely women in my long standing book club and the members of my Friends of the Library group (who raised over $22,500 this year!).I learned some new things - colored pencil drawing and how to use kitchen knives like a chef (also learned that it is easier to use them if you get them sharpened occasionally LOL).The drawing I did in class working from a pictureI also lost some things - 6 pounds personally and 225 things that were decluttered from the house. I hope to keep losing a few pounds and decluttering but I won't be counting the items decluttered going forward.I started participating in Project 333 and am enjoying my clothing more and not shopping or browsing out of a vague dissatisfaction.While we still don't love our house, we managed to complete 9 of the 12 House To Dos for the year. The most fun was getting this antique chair (early 1990s) restored. When I was a child we hung our stockings from the ears of the \"North Wind face\" and my children did the same. It only took me 15 years to get around to finding someone to glue it back together. I found out a friend is a talented woodworker and furniture restorer and asked him if he would do it. He did and also lovingly restored the original finish and then wouldn't charge me much. I'm really loving the result.We were able to share our good fortune through financial gifts to family members in need and for our share of DS2's upcoming wedding. Although my consulting business has diminished considerably over the past few years, I was able to earn enough to fund my ROTH IRA and pay for the orthodontist, new glasses, the physical therapist, and Pilates trainer sessions. My theme for 2013 though is MORE and although I just learned that I probably won't make as much in 2013 due to the impact of the world economy on the client company, it is still going to be ok to want more while making less income. That is because the MORE I truly want is- more family time- more time with friends- more art and theater- more cooking and sharing of healthy and tasty meals- more exercise¬†- more laughter- more contentment and joy¬†We already have plans for some of this. A trip to LA for an uncle's 90th birthday, DS2's wedding in May and a nephews in July. Meeting another nephew's wife and daughter (my great niece!) at that second wedding. Going to art exhibits and plays. Inviting friends over for meals.In addition, I am going to work on my 2013 goals while wringing out as much savings as possible from our income to boost our retirement savings, and Fix Things Up!¬† I hope you are looking forward to 2013 as well and will join me here as we journey through the new year."},

We leave very early on January 4th to head to LA for an uncle-in-law's 90th birthday celebration and the bonus of spending time with our kids and their sweethearts along with many other in-laws. Lots of my favorite people and we are giving ourselves a night at a boutique hotel in downtown LA so we can explore the changes that have taken place in the 15 years since we moved to the SE. Lunch with old grad school friends (has it really been 35 years since we met?), celebrate my older son's birthday and generally enjoy ourselves. And of course the poodle gets to go to \"camp\" at her former foster family's house while we are away which she finds so exciting!But back to food and cooking. First I want to share the easiest Christmas dinner ever. It was just the two of us so we cooked a turkey breast, heated a jar of gravy, microwaved an acorn squash and added dried, sweetened cranberries to a wild rice mix. All delicious and it think adding the cranberries was my favorite twist. The poor poodle princess made such a fuss while the turkey was cooking that she was banished to her crate during dinner and had to settle for kibble only. She might get some scraps today if she doesn't fuss. She also went crazy over the scent from the Cranberry Pomegranate Sugar Scrub by Burt's Bees that was one of my gifts. I think it was a food scent overload day for her and she needed a time out LOL.So here's what I am thinking we will eat for dinner these next 9 days although the order may get changed as I make sure we empty the fridge before going out of town. Also, I still have to go to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods so there may be some other changes. I am planning on us eating veggie burgers when we get home from our trip as they are in the freezer and super easy.W ‚Äì Wild rice mix leftovers, butternut squash, spinach, leftover cornbreadT ‚Äì Open face turkey sandwiches, broccoliF ‚Äì Breaded cod, coleslaw w. pineapple, squash & onionsS ‚Äì BBQ chicken, coleslawS ‚Äì Barley stew with carrots & green beansM ‚Äì New Year‚Äôs Eve: Pork roast, sweet potato, saladT ‚Äì New Year‚Äôs Day (aka parade and game day): Minestrone, salad, biscuits W ‚Äì ???T ‚Äì Pizza, saladTwo years ago in the middle of December we went to see a rescue dog after I kept staring at a poster in my favorite coffee shop. She was asking for us to adopt her apparently. We hadn't had a dog for 8 years and never thought about getting a poodle. She sat on the couch between us shaking like a leaf yet seeming to want to stay there and we were hooked. We went back the next day and she was more relaxed with us so the three of us went home. A great decision for us and we think she is pretty happy with it too. So here's some pictures showing her since day one to now.The \"where am I look?\" on the day we brought her home. And it was an exhausting day for her I'm sure. A new toy and getting on the couch helped a bit.¬†¬† ¬†New clothes and walks in the bitter cold helped make this new home more fun.More new clothes!

Two sessions of physical therapy and a trip to the orthodontist left several body parts in pain.

They will figure it out although they didn't plan it in advance.I think that for most people pre-retirement planning tends to focus on the finances and not on what you will be retiring to.¬† Leaving work means leaving structured days, possibly purposeful and rewarding activity, lots of social contact and perhaps intellectual stimulation.¬† How to prepare to replace all of that? Our plans are vague for our official \"retirement\" in 5 years when hubby turns 65.¬† That is when hubby expects to leave his current job and his plan is to move somewhere and find a new job. In fact a few days ago he asked me if he would need to earn the same amount from 65 to 70 as he earns now! He does love his work and I do think part-time work will make him happy. I'd like the flexibility of his working part time or on a project basis so we could travel more as a couple but we'll see what happens. I am already semi-retired/working part-time and am experiencing some of the challenges of moving into a non-working lifestyle. I'm not alone - it was a topic of conversation at my book club this week.So what will we be retiring to? It will have to be a combination of financial capability and desired or necessary lifestyle decisions.I recently received an email from TIAA-CREF which contained the following key lifestyle questions as part of an article on financial planning checkups. As they said, it‚Äôs not easy, but you should factor lifestyle issues into your financial  planning. To get started, here‚Äôs their suggested checklist of questions that you can copy and paste, and then modify with your own specific questions. Of course it is the answers that will matter the most!__In addition to my retirement, what financial issues do I need to consider in balancing multiple goals over time, such as funding education for children and grandchildren, caring for elderly parents, and providing a legacy for my family and charitable organizations?__What‚Äôs my target date for retiring? Will I be ready to leave my job? Will I work part time? Once I‚Äôm retired, if I underestimated my lifestyle needs, what next steps should I take?__As I near retirement, are there questions I need to be asking about transitioning to healthcare coverage for retirement years, election dates, continuation of coverage for my spouse or other dependents, costs?__Based on the lifestyle I want in retirement, what‚Äôs the best time to apply for Social Security and Medicare?

So health willing we are planning to officially \"retire\" at the end of 2017 when he is 65 and I am 68.I've been researching advice on what to do in terms of financial planning to prepare for this life change and here is what I've found is recommended for us to do in 2013.1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Cash Flow: Write out two budgets ‚Äì one with currentexpenses, the other with expected expenses in retirement.2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Investments: Use computer programs to project retirementneeds and investment returns.¬† Discusswith a financial planner your goals and how to adjust your asset mix to meetthem.3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Defined Benefit Retirement Plan: Ask yourbenefits office to project your pension in monthly and lump-sum payments4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†IRA & 403b: Put the maximum in yourplan.¬† Wait as long as possible to tapthe money so earnings grow tax-deferred.5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†SS: Check your earnings statement annually.Some of this makes sense and some doesn't.1. We have an annual budget and have tracked our actual spending for years. Since we expect to sell our house and relocate it is very hard to come up with an expected budget 5 years down the road. All we can do is continue to save as much as possible while making sure we also live each day fully.2. I can do this online and will do so.3. Again, this is available online.4. We do maximize these and will do so in 2013.5. Will do.The bigger question that is unanswerable right now is what will our life be like in 5 years?Will we both be healthy?Will our children still live near each other in southern CA so that will be where we will move? Will we still have elderly parents living on opposite sides of the country?How will we want to spend our time? Because I have greatly reduced my work hours I am faced with this now.How do you plan to prepare for your retirement when it is 5 years out - both financially and in terms of a satisfying lifestyle?"},

{"title": "Upgrading our technology - What's a frugal late adopter/laggard to choose?", "date": "Friday, December 7, 2012", "text": "Despite my best efforts to ignore the advances in technology, it is time to consider make some updates to computer, phone and perhaps to add an E-reader or tablet. As usual I am relying on my technically adept son to help with advice but I am really starting at a low point of knowledge. For example, I had to ask him how you access wireless service if you get an E-reader. He says he has an extra wireless router he can ship me. Still not sure how that works with our internet service.Anyway, here's what I am thinking.Easy - Computer could use a new keyboard although the current one works fine. I've asked said technically savvy son to give me one for Christmas. At least all the keys would have readable letters on them then.Middling Difficulty - I use TracFone for mobile service as I only use a cell phone when I am out of the house. My old cell is a very basic phone - no internet access or other smart phone services. I have lots of prepaid minutes I'd like to transfer to any new phone. I haven't sat through the interminable wait to talk to customer service yet to see if that is possible but I have asked same son to tell me if any of the phones they currently offer might be good for me. Step one at least.Most Difficult - I like to read and listen to music when I travel. I hate spending money on books as I am an avid library fan. I do think that I would like to have some sort of device though that brings me reading material on the go. I've asked my book club for advice in choosing between a Kindle Fire and a Nook HD and so far don't have any clarity. My son threw in the Google Nexus 7 as another option. Oh my aching head (from pounding against the technological horn of plenty). UPDATE: My hubby found this great LINK to help think through this question.Advice? Experience? Suggestions? Any and all help is appreciated!"},
{"title": "I'm Thankful this Thursday", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2012", "text": "This is the first day I have felt almost well since getting sick Saturday night. I have many reasons to be thankful but the ones most on my mind today are these.My hubby who has been so great - first dealing with my illness and injury in the middle of the night and then picking up the load so I could rest and recuperate.My stomach virus (I really think that was what it was) is almost out of my system and my pulled muscles are getting better.I feel well enough to go to physical therapy for my \"frozen shoulder\" this afternoon - with the bonus of seeing what I can do to help my pulled muscles heal faster.The poodle princess has been unusually calm and sedate even though I can't take her out for walks. She seems to know that I am sick and has adjusted accordingly. Which means that periodically she runs madly around the house doing laps to let off her energy. She \"huffs\" while she does it and has various routes she takes including just circling the dining room table or doing a circuit through the dining room, living room while banking off the backs of the couch and chair and racing from the dining room down a hallway and around the family room again banking off the back of a couch. It is very funny to watch and it does take the place of a walk somewhat lol.Heating pads, ice packs and pain killers were invented.And as a bonus, while sick I lost another 1.5 pounds. Now to just keep it off. Hope you all have had a good week and next week there will be more interesting posts here!"},

We have things delivered by Santa's helpers, so no wrapping either.So that just leaves deciding on a budget, picking out what to give and also finding gifts for the two who have birthdays around the holidays. We'll also send out a few cards, find some holiday music to listen to, drive around and admire the holiday lights, go to the neighborhood holiday party, I'll go to my book club party, and the two of us will go out for a special dinner Christmas Eve.

So although we are a bit jet lagged it's really not too bad. Even the dog was exhausted from a week at her foster family's house playing hard with their dogs and cat. In fact she is still sleeping.The reentry challenge though is usually around household matters. We ate oatmeal and canned fruit for dinner last night and were grateful that the milk hadn't soured LOL. Although I hadn't gained any weight over Thanksgiving, which is a wonder, I was feeling the effects of a higher than usual sodium diet so oatmeal was great.There are 3 loads of wash to do and food to be bought. I have an appointment this afternoon. Hubby made sure he didn't have any until afternoon so he could go in to work a bit late.I decided to try to make this as easy on myself as possible. Only one load of wash today. Only the 2 closest grocery stores and I bought everything there that I would usually buy at the third. A reward stop for a latte and pumpkin chocolate chip bread. And did I mention the dog is still exhausted? So no need to walk the dog thank goodness.It really isn't much of a challenge given that we are empty nesters but it is good to be kind to yourself when you can!"},

I'm sure this wouldn't be true of all sunscreens but this one is safe on the face and basically a higher SPF version of the daily moisturizer that I use. Save!Make It Last: I finished reading the manuals for the remaining kitchen appliances to see if there was any care or maintenance that I wasn't doing and should start. Nothing new for the stove, stove vent/fan or microwave although I learned that the oven door can be removed for cleaning. Not sure I want to do that lol. I did learn that stubborn spots in the toaster oven could be removed by setting a cup of ammonia inside over night not that it needs that. The one thing I did was to clean the inside of the garbage disposal. I had been periodically wiping the underside of the rubber flange but had never done this. The instructions say to put the stopper in the disposal, fill the sink half way with warm water, add 1/4 c. baking soda and then turn on the disposer and remove the stopper at the same time. Easy.We don't know the answer to this, but think we will probably have to replace all of the kitchen appliances before selling our home in 5 years even if they still are working fine. When we get closer to that date we'll see what the real estate market is like and talk to a few realtors. I'd rather do planned replacements using sales than emergency ones so we will keep focused on maintaining what we have for now. Make It: Although I haven't made anything for Thanksgiving table decorations yet I have been thinking of low cost ideas that can be done at the last minute using grocery store or existing items. We'll see how that works out!"},

Making good use of our resources is good for our finances and good for the environment. Here are some things I did this past week.- made a substitute for a maple Pilates dowel- fixed our leaking dishwasher- made Berry Applesauce to use as an oatmeal or waffle topping.Make it do - To do my physical therapy exercises I need 2 pillows, a rolled up hand towel, a shoulder pulley and stool. The shoulder pulley was lent to me by the therapist and the rest I have on hand. However I also need a 3 foot dowel like this maple one which lists online for $19 plus tax and shipping.So I went down the basement and found a piece of cabinet trim leftover from our long ago kitchen remodel. It is not round and one end is mitered making is quite uncomfortable to hold. Take two old washcloths and 2 rubber band (helpful poodle is optional) and the ends are now the right size with now cost.Make it last - Just as I was thinking about doing some routine maintenance on our 12 year old dishwasher as my next little Make it Last project, Hubby walked in and reported that it was leaking water and we might need to buy a new one.¬† It turned out to not be a very large leak. I turned to the internet for advice. This article (How to repair a dishwasher ) suggests cleaning and carefully inspecting the door seal as a first step. Guess what? The seal wasn't all the way to the bottom on one side and did in fact need cleaning to make it more pliable. I cleaned and worked it down to fill the gap.The trap over the drain is supposed to just pull out for cleaning. Neither one of us can get it out without potentially breaking it and it looks like it has collected a film of soap which may hinder draining. The manual recommends cleaning by adding 2 cups of white vinegar to the bottom of the dishwasher once it reaches the wash portion of the pots and pans cycle with the hot water setting on. We took off the decorative cover at the bottom of the dishwasher front so we could hopefully see where any leak was coming from and ran it through a cleaning cycle.No leaks! Love the internet for advice on how to fix things yourself.Simply making it - What to do with half a large¬† but mealy apple found in the fridge and frozen strawberries that looked appealing in the store but not so tasty when thawed? I peeled the leftover apple, cut it in small pieces and added some frozen strawberries, cinnamon and water. Cooked it slowly for a bit, cooled in the fridge and it turned into a tasty Berry Applesauce oatmeal topper. Any suggestions for the remainder of those frozen strawberries?"},

He wanted to be a pilot in the Army Air Force but trained as a bomber flight engineer instead. He was ready to head to college but instead headed to war. He thought he would die as had almost all bomber crews to that point and left goodbye letters for his family to open upon his death. Here he is in his official service portrait.He is the man on the bottom left in this photo of his flight crew. He hated his boring assignment to Alaska and volunteered to go to the European Theater. He lived through his missions flying out of an airfield in England to drop bombs over Germany and other parts of Europe. He saw many others die as their planes exploded and was actually hit in the head by a piece of shrapnel during one flight. Fortunately he had his helmet on that day - and every day after although not every day before. His older brother flew on cargo planes that supplied troops in the Far East and also survived despite harrowing flights over the \"Hump\" and other dangerous areas. He was grateful for and delighted with every day of his life afterwards. I'm very lucky he was my Dad as he was a wonderful, kind man with a zest for life. He finally got to fly when he became a sailplane (glider) pilot and co-owned a sailplane with a neighbor. That brought him great joy although none of the rest of us really liked our one time experiences in the plane lol. He died in 2009 at the age of 88 and I miss him a lot."},

Given how many months we have of hot weather vs. fall, winter or spring, mine is a 2 month project for fall and spring, 3 months for winter and summer will be 5 months. But the same idea applies. A wardrobe of 33 items not counting exercise, at home lounge, or sleep wear or underwear.I never have had a large number of clothes but I like color and variety so it tended to be a jumble when I looked in the closet each morning. This capsule is working out quite well and I didn't have to buy a thing. In fact I have already donated quite a few things that just didn't deserve space in my closet. There will be more out the door as I create wardrobes for the other three seasons and there will be lots of shopping for the summer one as it spans 5 months and sometimes two outfits a day if I am outside. Got to love Hotlanta!What do I have for our two lovely fall months (October and November)? 5 pairs of pants, 5 long sleeve shirts, 3 mid length sleeve shirt, 5 short sleeve shirts, 5 sweaters/vest, 2 pairs of shoes, a scarf, 4 pieces jewelry, 2 coats, a purse, and gloves. Turns out in addition to my basic colors of black, gray and denim, I had quite a few orange tops from blaze orange to melon. All mix and match.I did have to swap a few things out as the weather cooled - heavy black cardigan, black slacks and a third pair of jeans were put instead of short sleeve black cardigan, black capris and denim capris. I also grabbed a suit jacket from the winter clothes for a business trip. That's it though. I've already got the next capsule wardrobe pretty much figured out and a lot of these pieces will transition to the winter version. I'll post it when I switch on December 1st.Have you tried anything like this with your clothes?"},

The physical therapist uses one of those shapeable ice packs wrapped in a pillow case and I didn't want to buy yet another one as I have a large one for use on my hip. Well, over at One Good Thing by Jillee I read that you can take 1 part rubbing alcohol plus 3 parts water, put it in a ziploc bag and freeze for a homemade version. It stays pliable so you can bend it over your shoulder. I used a one gallon ziploc bag and ended up double bagging it. Works just like the one I didn't buy and when I no longer need to use it I can just dump it down the drain, wash out the bags, and not add anything new to my house!Make it last - I'm frequently glad I learned to sew as small mending comes in very handy. I have a pair of knit pajama bottoms that have developed a small hole suspiciously the same size as a poodle princess tooth! It just took a few stitches to fix it so it won't get larger.

Today it was 3 inches of paper that were records from IRAs long ago rolled over into the one IRA we each have. No need to keep it my tax adviser said. I suspect I could toss the paper copies of the investment contracts too but this is baby steps!Financial record keeping is the hardest for me to be sure of in terms of requirements. I tend to over save which has produced a lot of files full of paper. I'm in the process of looking at it all carefully and removing what is not needed and then shredding the appropriate papers before they are recycled. Not fun but then I don't want to move all this paper when we finally do sell this house! Maybe I will reconsider those paper copies of investment contracts and verify what is online. I guess all we need is a list of the account numbers.Onward.Update: I decided to keep the paper copies of the contracts for now as I couldn't find the same info online easily.

It has also gotten me to let go of clothes that were old, too big or just didn't do anything for me. I have also been combining clothes that I hadn't previously and am happy with the result. Deciding what to wear is very easy and I'm happy with the outcomes.It was also interesting to me to find out that I have three distinct color combo wardrobes beyond the neutrals that easily slot into fall, winter and spring sets of 33. Summer is another matter and I will need a major shopping to have a small but effective wardrobe next summer.Only 74 more items to go for this challenge. How is your decluttering going?"},

Interestingly my husband doesn't feel this way at all about how he is treated.Anyway - I arrived and was told that the dentist was not coming in due to not feeling well. Turns out they had called me 3 minutes after I left the house so they did try. However, the tone was rude, no apology, etc. I also found myself wondering if this was true or if he just wanted a day off and perhaps I was the only appointment.That did it for me.

I heard from two friends of the sudden deaths of young adults in their families. We were invited to a birthday celebration for friends in their 60s. A young adult niece had successful surgery and is recovering well. We all know that life is unpredictable and that now is all we have for sure, but do we appreciate that while we are living through the now?Yesterday I started to get annoyed as I arrived at the dentist only to find out they had called 3 minutes after I left the house to tell me the appointment was cancelled due to illness. I started to get annoyed when I came home and found out someone had run over our full trash can (which actually left a pretty funny situation with squashed trash trapped inside - if you could look at it that way). I had not slept well as is the case about a third of the time.It takes a conscious effort for me to recognize that my reaction to the daily annoyances of life really is unimportant. I feel much better though when I let it go and instead am happy that I and my loved ones are healthy and safe at this moment.I'm not sure I agree with this statement though. I guess it would all depend on how you define \"exactly as you please\". It would please me to downsize and move. My husband would not like that right now as he isn't ready to retire. It wouldn't please me to have him very unhappy. Hard to get life to be exactly as you please as it is too complicated for simple guidelines.I am holding in my heart and mind more clearly though that it is so important to not let the little things in life that go wrong have a negative impact on your appreciation of what is going right. Building you emotional resilience muscles is so important as whatever is next in your life will be wonderful, terrible, boring, inspiring, amusing, difficult, fun - who knows what will happen no matter how hard we try to steer towards our dreams."},

I want to socialize more. I want to lose more weight. I want to declutter more. I will be raking leaves (counts as exercise right?). I will be working some and traveling for work mid-month.

Once was getting clarification on when we would need to or should stop contributing to our ROTH IRAs. I want to emphasize that the information below is what I learned from various internet sites and in no way is professional financial advice.That being said, the answer seems to be that under current law you can continue to contribute as long as you have earned income (not investment income) and don't exceed the maximum income limits. You also cannot contribute more than your earned income. Although you have to start taking minimum withdrawals at 70 1/2,¬† you can still contribute if you are earning income. You earnings on your investment would continue to be tax free.I'm not sure what we will do while we are still earning income. Once we start taking withdrawals I imagine we will not continue to contribute to our ROTH IRAs. Of course the laws pertaining to them could change at any time and that would affect our decisions as well.Does anyone know more about this?UPDATE: See the comment below to see how wrong information on the internet can apparently be. I like the possibility that if I am not earning income in a few years as the older spouse then we can still put money into my ROTH. Ditto for not having to withdraw."},

{"title": "What I learned from my Simplify Challenge", "date": "Wednesday, August 29, 2012", "text": "I'm back from jury duty as I lucked out and only had to serve 2 days. I was selected for a jury but then the defendant changed the plea to guilty so we were through before we started.Thinking about the simplify challenge I followed caused me to identify some things that I learned.- My Hubby doesn't see a need to declutter more until we actually are getting ready to put the house on the market. I want to do it slowly; he wants to do it as a marathon. More discussion needed. That being said I am talking about hidden clutter not a messy house.- Paperwork retention is a challenge even in this paperless world.¬† We have stacks of paper from when we started our retirement plans in pre-online record days. Contracts and such. We also have stacks of paper from the sale of our two previous homes. I need to find out what we actually need to keep and then scan what I can.- We really need to socialize as a couple more. We are going to try a hiking group that a friend has created and start inviting people out to dinner with us once a month. - I hate to clean floors. This was not exactly a learning but how much I hate washing floors really became apparent LOL.- We need to buy a new shop vac that uses a filter. Ours came with the house and doesn't have a bag or filter available. We did manage to send 39 items out the door which is a great monthly total for us. The basement looks much better and some suitcases have a new home in cleared out storage space instead of behind a piece of furniture.I am motivated to keep going with fall cleaning and to finish cleaning the basement floor. We are currently looking to hire more help in the yard although it has been hard to find people who will do what we need. We are also considering whether or not to sell this house and move into a rental for the time remaining until Hubby retires (5+ years) as we are both very tired of upkeep. Hard decisions ahead.The rest of this week though is devoted mostly to preparing for the Friends of the Library big fall book sale. We are hoping that it won't rain!"},

I am number 253 and have little hope for being dismissed early. I've got two books and my lunch and a snack packed to help pass the time and have something healthy to eat. It could be interesting, but never has been in the past. Oh well.I'll post tonight about what I learned and gained from the six days of simplifying."},

The bare bones of my schedule are Pilates on Monday, grocery shopping on Wednesday, volunteering Thursday morning, laundry on Friday and on Monday. I work irregularly on consulting projects but when I am working it takes 20-30 hours a week. I tell myself I should walk the dog every day, but don't accomplish that¬† I live by to do lists for each day however and seem to get quite a bit done.We don't socialize regularly as a couple and want to change that.¬† We have decided to add hiking with a group at least one Saturday a month - possibly two starting in September. I'm thinking about getting season theater tickets and seeing if another couple would like to do the same. Perhaps planning going out to eat with others once a month as well.How do you socialize outside of work and volunteer activities?"},

Six days, six areas of the home to simplify. I‚Äôll be sharing my progress here all week.¬†I have four file drawers and two desk drawers to go of paper files as well as a fire safe. One file drawer holds genealogy records and I'm ignoring skipping it (for now).What I am going to do is make a list of actions that need to be taken regarding financial records such as scanning paperwork, turning paper bonds into electronic ones, finding out what records we actually need to keep on the three houses we have owned including this one, etc. I just learned that there may be a property tax break for us since I am over 62 - will call and find out requirements. We also need to look at what to do 5 years pre-retirement. I'm going to create a list and work at getting answers and taking action on this over time.Our budget is OK although we aren't saving as much as I would like. Of course if I would work more that would improve LOL. Next year will also be expensive with the final five monthly payments for my orthodonture, the second half of our wedding gift to our son, travel to his and a nephew's weddings in California, and other trips to see family. I am hoping to turn one of those trips into an add on vacation as well. We'll just have to wait until the beginning of next year to see what our 2013 budget will be after the actual numbers from this year are in.Update on yesterday's challenge: 6 items to donate and 3 to trash.¬† Slowly but surely decluttering continues."},

Six days, six areas of the home to simplify. I‚Äôll be sharing my progress here all week.¬†Our bedroom includes a large sitting room and too much miscellaneous stuff stored in cupboards - suitcases and extra bedding for bed sizes we don't own being the major culprit.¬† The guest room isn't in need of simplifying as it truly is minimal already except for an unused luggage rack. We have two bathrooms and they are not cluttered so I am skipping them too except to plan to wash our bathroom floor - eventually.Do I hear shouts of \"Slacker\"? I admit that, after the morning spent volunteering to sort books and prepare for the labor day weekend library fundraising book sale, I will be a slacker at home today!I plan to pull out all of the suitcases and the linens that don't fit any beds we still own as well as the luggage rack, clean where they were stored and put back the ones we use.¬† These will be discussed with hubby either this evening or coming weekend.

Six days, six areas of the home to simplify. I‚Äôll be sharing my progress here all week.¬†This was a pretty easy challenge for me. Good thing because I had a sore throat last night and feel a bit punk today.Like many people we have remnants of past hobbies stored away - from large ones like the ping-pong table in the carport and a major telescope to small ones like chess sets and art supplies. Most of these items are my hubby's or jointly purchased so I can't make a decision about them by myself. I did go through my art supplies. I ignored my minimal sewing supplies. Books are the same. A few belong only to me and I went through them again. Office supplies are already simplified so I ignored them too.Results:5 art items donated1 book donatedSome paper recycledHope you made more progress than I did today!"},
{"title": "If you crave novelty in your wardrobe - read this", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2012", "text": "This article -¬†New Clothes Won't Make You Happy ... For Long - basically describes what I did during the clothing part of the simplify challenge. I think that actually writing down what I owned (have already spent money on!!!) by category and adding up the number of items was sobering.¬† Then reading about the modern fashion industry added to that.¬† What are your thoughts? This week I‚Äôm following along with the Life Your Way Simplify for Fall Challenge. Six days, six areas of the home to simplify. I‚Äôll be sharing my progress here all week.¬†First of all I want to share the link to a booklet put out by The Environmental Working Group - Good Food on a Tight Budget. These are the folks who have brought us the lists of dirty and clean vegetable and fruits as it relates to pesticide residue. Now they are focusing on nutritional value for the low budget shopper.Now on with today's challenge results.¬† No way am I going to go through the whole kitchen in one day. It is already pretty decluttered although all the cabinets could use cleaning.¬† Another day LOL.¬† Instead I am focusing on the pantry, under the sink, and simplifying dinner planning.Last year I moved some things onto the pantry shelves because they took up so much space in the cupboards.¬† I moved the coffee maker and blender back into the cupboards and candles and matches into a drawer. The mixer and box of good silverware stayed in the pantry as they don't fit anywhere else.¬† I consolidated the dog's supplies near each other and put the extra vitamins and medicines in a drawer. Threw away a candle and put a set of coasters in donation bag.Looks better and roomier. We don't shut the doors unless we have guests so looking better is a good thing!¬†¬† Yes, we do keep our dictionary with the cookbooks so hubby can look up words in the morning while he works the jumble in the paper and drinks his coffee in the kitchen. That is the \"new\" dictionary I got for $5 from the library used book sale stash.¬† It replaces our 40 year old one that was coming loose in the binding.¬† Look closely and you can see the fire extinguisher and flashlight too.Under the sink just needed to be cleaned so I also found a few things to put away that were on the counter and frig top and wiped them down too.¬† I don't like to meal plan in detail. I am a think about it in the morning and cook it in the evening person. I do want to make grocery shopping easier and cheaper though. So I have decided that each week we will have dinners built around the following: Fish - 2 days, Vegetarian (including eggs) - 3 days, Poultry or meat - 2 days. I think this will simplify deciding what to buy each week.¬† I need to find more vegetarian dinner options and pulled out one cookbook to start going through.I'm glad this was an easy project because the mosquito spray has arrived and, since there was no rain predicted for three days, I hauled the hose around both the front and back yards and sprayed this morning before I started this project.¬† That is always a good workout for the upper body!What did you focus on today?"},
{"title": "Wow, that book really impacted me!", "date": "Monday, August 20, 2012", "text": "I just finished reading \"Over-Dressed: The shockingly high cost of cheap fashion\" by Elizabeth Cline and I went and pulled 2 of my tops, the shorts and dress from the donate pile.¬† I can wear the tops as is.¬† The shorts can be taken in.¬† The dress can be turned into a skirt that I think I will like.¬† I know how to sew and I need to wear what I have purchased.¬† I liked it once so I can find what that like was or redo it to fit better and get on with using what I have.This week I‚Äôm following along with the Life Your Way Simplify for Fall Challenge. Six days, six areas of the home to simplify. I‚Äôll be sharing my progress here all week.¬†¬†I have to admit I started this on Saturday so I could involve hubby over the weekend. We decluttered 28 items! I also cleaned and rearranged to reduce visual clutter and make storage areas feel more spacious.The thoughts that I had while doing this were:- What should I do with jewelry that has been passed down to me that I will never use? Some of it may have value, but I don't know how to sell it.- Why do I hold on to clothing that I am uncomfortable wearing or that really doesn't look right anymore? I don't like to shop, but that is no excuse.- How are we wasting electricity (or water or gas) that we might not know about?- I really should have washed the basement floor some time in the last 15 years LOL.¬† Better late than never. - My next home will have the laundry facilities in the main living space!!!!! Here's how we tackled Day 1. It took parts of three days.CLOTHES: Hubby took a look at rarely used clothes folded on shelves and a couple of dresser drawers. He decided that 16 pieces of clothing could be removed.¬† That created some empty shelf storage space and a less crowded dresser. For myself it was 4 items that I really don't wear - snow boots, a belt, a dress, and a pair of shorts that are too large. Yeah for weight loss!I am in the middle of reading \"Over-Dressed: The shockingly high cost of cheap fashion\" by Elizabeth Cline. It does make one think they should not buy any more clothes until they have absolutely worn our what they have. When she gives the statistics on the % of income that was spent on clothing in the 1960's vs now it also explains why back then my Dad made me the deal that he would buy as much fabric as I wanted if I made it into my clothes for high school. Now I just mend which is more than many do.However, on Saturday I received an early birthday present from my Mom that added to my clothing - a pair of winter PJs. I think she is tired of seeing me wear the same ones every time I visited her for the last 5+ years LOL. They are nice though and I will get rid of an old pair after I try these and make sure they are comfortable and not too hot. That will have to wait for winter.I've also added to my shopping list a versatile black, gray or tweed classic (but washable) skirt, a dressy cardigan - I'm going to check out thrift & consignment shops. I also will get a pair of water resistant lightweight hiking boots which will be much more useful than the snow boots. I'll be buying a Mother-of-the-Groom dress and dressy shoes for our son's spring wedding which will hopefully do double duty for my nephew's wedding in July. Then I will donate the black cocktail dress I never wear once I have something dressy that I like more. I have quite a bit of jewelry that I don't wear. It is now boxed it up and I will look at what I haven't worn in January to make decisions. That opened up room in a drawer and will make choosing accessories simpler.LAUNDRY ROOM: This was a challenge as it is in an unfinished basement and most of the clutter removal requires hubby making decisions about letting go of things. I focused on clearing off flat surfaces and cleaning the floor. Got rid of paint samples, sheet metal, a live squirrel trap, a tennis racket, and some other things that were tossed or recycled. Vacuumed the floor and started mopping it. I will have to do it in small sections so I don't add too much humidity.I also discovered that the old house alarm system was still plugged in!¬† We've been paying for electricity for it for years - but no more as I unplugged it and disconnected and threw away the part that was laying on the floor. The basement will never be a desirable place to spend time but it is cleaner and visually less cluttered. What did you get accomplished?"},
{"title": "Spa day for the dog; Chore day for me", "date": "Friday, August 17, 2012", "text": "All it takes is a trip to Glamour Paws doggie spa to turn this furry creatureinto this chic poodle! (Don't tell her, but she smells better too.)I again decided to pay cash to support this small business instead of charging it. As always, I gave a large tip. The groomer she sees is so sweet and gentle with her. She and the other staff have made this shy, standoffish, previously abused dog want to go in the door and be greeted. That is priceless.¬† As a bonus they have a frequent buyer card and the next grooming will be free except for the tip of course.I didn't get a spa day though - instead it was chore day. We are finally on the power companies variable rate plan as the new meter was installed yesterday. That means any optional use of electricity better not be during the high rate time of 2pm to 7pm weekdays. So laundry it is this morning.I also decided to really inventory my clothing in preparation for day one of the simplifying challenge next week. I counted everything except underwear and jewelry (but included exercise clothes, shoes, purses, coats, hats, gloves, scarves, belts and sleepwear) - 132 items!¬† I know that isn't a lot compared to some people's wardrobes but I only want to keep what I wear and don't mind being seen wearing out and about. We'll see how many items I can part with on Monday.I just finished reading Michael Lewis' (Moneyball and The Blind Side author) book on how the world ended up in its current economic crisis.¬† Check out Boomerang if, like me, you are not sure what happened in Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and California.¬† I found it fascinating and very readable.¬† Love the cover - don't you?"},

We aren't planning to take any of those steps but they are options.I am curious though what you have done or consider doing to save $50, $500 or $5000 a year?Hop on over to¬†My 1/2 Dozen Daily and check out her new giveaway!"},

There is no way they can produce income so with diminished assets they still have the burden of these payments.It has been a few years since we sat down with a financial planner and projected our own likelihood of having enough money if we live to be 100 - which is not an unreasonable assumption.¬† We are going to sit down by ourselves in June and really look at the numbers again given how little we are currently earning on our savings/retirement accounts, the increase in medical costs and the cost of living in our current house, and other things.¬† It will be an interesting discussion I'm sure and it is hard to make such long range projections and good decisions when there are so many unknowns.¬† But we have to do it!¬† We might live another 40 years.How do you approach this difficult area of your financial life?¬† I'd like to hear your thoughts."},

Even those with serious chronic illnesses enjoyed a sense of calm and contentment. A 92-year-old who can no longer do many of the things she once enjoyed said: ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm happier now than I‚Äôve ever been in my life.

Clinch for a Civil War (Union) living history tour.¬† The third day we took a boat tour on the inland waterways in the morning and saw the lighthouse that is stiill in operation. We had the rest of the day free.¬† Hubby and I drove south to the Kingsley Plantation (a NPS site) and walked around there.¬† The highlight of that for me was seeing a gopher tortoise in its burrow. The slave cabins were very depressing although this planter was more enlightened than some.We went out to dinner at a local foods/organic foods fine restaurant in old Fernandina Beach and sat out on the porch listening to music from down the street.¬† Very good fish and vegetable entrees.The final day we went to the Okefenokee Swamp and took a boat tour complete with lots of alligator sightings, had lunch and then went to one of the homestead sites where a house and working farm has been preserved.¬† Another nature hike, dinner, a great musical performance and that was the day.We skipped the talk on the shrimping industry this morning because we had a long drive back and didn't want to get caught up in Friday rush hour in Atlanta.¬† We got back mid-afternoon and picked up our dog who gave us a terrifically enthusiastic greeting.¬† What better way to feel glad to be back from vacation.I was a really fun and interesting vacation.¬† We are already talking about going on another Road Scholar program.¬† Check out their website - they have US and international programs, adult and inter-generational ones, easy activity and strenuous athletic programs, land and sea based ones, etc.¬† The price seemed like a great value for what all was included too."},

I really like having new experiences and will never be the person who goes the same place for vacation every year.¬† Next month we are going to visit the Okefenokee Swamp, and Amelia and Cumberland Islands by participating in a Road Scholar program.¬† We will be seeing those places for the first time and it will be our first group travel experience.¬† The one exception has been going to visit Yosemite which we did at least once a year when living in S. California.¬† I've been there in all seasons so perhaps that is the variety piece.3. I love seeing art and go to museums and on artist studio tours.¬† When I was in graduate school I was planning to go through the training to become a docent at the Los Angeles County Art Museum, but found a part time teaching position that interfered so I had to withdraw as I really needed the income.¬† I also have taken a number of art classes and have enjoyed most painting with acrylics.¬† My Dad was the one with the talent though.4. Goals are important to me so that I can see that I am making progress.¬† This is making semi-retirement somewhat of a challenge but some goals are developing now that I am finding satisfying.¬† 5. I have to consciously work at being positive and not complaining.¬† Enough said.6. I love animals.¬† The dog we have now is my fourth if you count my childhood pet.¬† We have also shared our home with cats, and due to our sons' interests with a guinea pig, a hamster, fish, a parakeet and a hermit crab.¬† I took horseback riding lessons at two points in my life as I love horses.7.¬† I have moved around the country in pursuit of my goals and jobs and while that has had its cost in terms of time with family and friends as well as the need to make new friends, I have enjoyed living in Seattle, Stockton, CA, the Los Angeles area, San Diego and now Atlanta.¬† I think I have one more move ahead when we really retire - we'll see where the family is mostly then and make that decision later."},

The money we raise goes to support musical, children's and senior programs at this branch, pay for minor facility improvements/repairs, and add materials to the collection.¬† I had the fleeting thought today that the hourly wage for the volunteers who make this happen is probably about $0.15 per hour - but that is not worth thinking about LOL.I'm off for the hard work of sauteeing some onions and green pepper and opening those cans to make chili.¬† I'll also continue to think about how much I need to do some housecleaning before deciding that it can wait for tomorrow.What are you up to today?"},

Cohen, were making the talk show rounds discussing his ongoing challenges of living with MS and then battling colon cancer twice.¬† They mentioned his book,¬†Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness: A Reluctant Memoit, and I recently started reading it.I'm half way through and I am finding it very interesting and potentially helpful to someone who has an illness or wants to support someone who does.¬† Some of my favorite quotes so far:\"The battle to control our heads is every bit as important as combating the attacks on our bodies.\" - I'm a big fan of cognitive behavior modification so this really resonates.¬† Our thoughts truly can drive our feelings and actions.\"Adjust, after the fact.¬† Do not simply react to possibility.\" - or as my Mother used to say, don't create mountains out of molehills.Seven years ago I had a serious illness that could have become a chronic and limiting one.¬† Fortunately I fully recovered but at the time I spent a lot of time wondering how one adjusts and lives a full and happy life with such severe physical limitations.¬† Millions do but I couldn't find any resources to help me.I wish I'd had this book!¬† I'm hoping the rest of the book is as good as the first part.¬† So far I highly recommend reading it.Please note though that this is an intensely personal book/memoir about one person's experience living with a progressive illness.Update:¬† I just finished this book and still think it is an interesting read.¬† He does spend a lot of time talking about his denial, anger, unwillingness to do what is needed (e.g. use a can earlier in his illness) and keeping his illness secret from most people for a long time which led to interesting assumptions by others to explain his behavior!¬† It is an intensely personal book and I think it does have valuable insights for others."},

Let's kick off 2012 with a plan and commitment to increase our energy levels by taking specific steps during the next 4 months!¬† Energy drives our ability to do so many things and certainly affects my happiness.1. Start by creating a customized energy plan.¬† 2. Set some real goals with deadlines and measurements.3. Commit to weekly check ins - how are you honestly doing?Want to create your own custom plan to increase your energy level?¬† You can get some great ideas by checking out this post by Myrko Thum; The 5 Most Effective Ways to Increase Your Own Energy Level, this article in Real Simple¬†How to Increase Your Energy Levels, a great post on 55 Ways to Get More Energy at Zen Habits, and this post of Gretchen Rubin's (be sure to check out the comments section for more ideas) 8 Tips for Boosting Your Energy RIGHT NOW.Let me know what ideas you are incorporating in your plan.¬†Here's mine.¬† It does not include a lot of things that you might think are essential to a high energy level.¬† I am not saying that getting enough sleep, reducing your stress level, eating a balanced diet, getting your thyroid level checked, making sure your vitamin intake is on target, looking at the positive side of things, etc. aren't important factors to consider when you want to increase your energy level.¬† However these are not concerns for me right now.1. Stretch every morning.¬† I know what to do, I have short sessions and a longer one with a DVD.¬† I just need to do it.2. Get moving more by having at least 20 minutes of cardio exercise 4 times a week!¬† Walking the dog doesn't count as much of the time is spent training (correcting LOL) the dog who thinks \"heel\" is a short term activity!3. Drink more water. I may be dehydrated which can make you feel tired.¬† This is the dark side of really liking to drink coffee.¬† 4. Keep my blood sugar balanced by having the right type of snacks that combine protein with carbs and a little fat.¬† Low glycemic foods (the good carb foods) include fruits and vegetables, grains, low-carb foods like meats, and pasta.  Check this chart of foods and their glycemic index before planning my trips to the grocery store. Lots of suggestions include nuts which could be a problem with my braces right now.¬† I need to explore this some more but possibilities include: peanut butter on a whole-wheat cracker, some yogurt with a handful of nuts and berries, granola bar, frozen berry smoothie, a low-fat latte instead of justa cup of coffee (a happy dance for this idea) with an ounce of almonds (does an almond biscotti count?).5. Deal head on with the afternoon slump.¬† I am definitely a morning person and an early riser which means I really have an afternoon slump built into my circadian rhythms.¬† How to counteract that?¬† Ideas:- Put on some energizing music and dance around the house to combat the afternoon slump.- Have some social interaction with an interesting/up beat person.¬† Get my mind firing on all cylinders by talking about something I feel passionate about.- Focus on something that really stretches my right brain (I am very left brain).¬† When I used to paint I know the time flew by without my feeling that my energy was low. 6. Go outside - dog included is OK.¬† Take advantage of sunshine and fresh air for some energy.BONUS:¬† Fix a \"squeaky wheel\" that is draining energy.¬†¬† For some people this could mean upgrade your computer that can‚Äôt keep up, or replace your dishwasher that requires you to spend time washing before and after.¬† I'll have to think about what it is for me."},

{"title": "Finding role models for aging successfully", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "When I work with my executive coaching clients I often suggest that they identify role models for specific areas of learning.¬† For example, if they are working on inspiring and motivating others then they are to identify 1 to 3 people who do this well and in a way that fits the coachee's style.¬† They then identify specific things these people do or say that leads others to find them inspiring and try out some of these behaviors themselves.I think I need a dose of my own advice.¬† The challenge for me is that I have not been clear about the ways in which I want to focus my own development vis-a-vis aging successfully.¬† I have focused more on what I don't want to emulate and lifelong frustrations with some of my personality traits.¬† So to turn those thoughts on their head I need to first think about what I want of learn, improve or become more effective at doing.¬† Well, the obvious way to approach that is to look at my Happiness Commandments which need work and look for role models in those areas.¬† That means I will have to find role models for aging successfully who:- handle difficult situations without complaining- have long term goals and take action to make them a reality- have lots of physical energy and endurance- make new friends regularly and spend time nurturing their friendships- listen with curiosity¬†- engage in activities/have goals that push them to learn something challenging- use their creativity in ways that stretch this \"muscle\"Since I am rather sore and tired from a Pilates session yesterday, I think I'll use the search for a role model for having lots of physical energy and endurance as one ages as an example.¬† I can think of several people right of the bat.¬† At Pilates yesterday was an older man who was working through an advanced routine by himself.¬† Turns out he is a Pilates instructor and a massage therapist.¬† In the newspaper was a story about a woman in her 70's who is a body building champion and who started working on this at 70.¬† Both of these people take working on their fitness as a primary part of their life.¬†¬†On the other hand I have a 104 year old neighbor who still take short walks each day and is able to climb stairs and a steep driveway with only the help of a cane.¬† My donated book sorting buddy for the Friends of the Library book sale is in her mid-70's and does this bending, lifting, stretching type of volunteer work 3 days a week despite needing to work with a chiropractor and physical therapist on her back problems.¬† She has tons of energy. And my aunt rides her bike or walks to the store, has a large vegetable and flower garden each year and swims regularly in her mid-80's.So what do I pull out of these example?¬† The fittest, most energetic persons make physical fitness activities a, if not the, core part of their life and/or livelihood.¬† Others build it into their daily life on a regular basis without fail.¬† What can I try to do that these role models do?¬† Continue with Pilates once a week and recommit to long walks with the dog daily despite the weather.¬† Take up my new friend's invitation to join her and others on some Saturday morning hikes.¬† Add in other planned physical fitness activities such as actually using one of those DVDs that I have.¬† Sign my husband and myself up for ballroom dancing lessons instead of just talking about learning to dance for our son's wedding.¬† Embrace raking leaves as exercise!This is a pretty straightforward example but one that has been a lifelong challenge for me as I tend more towards thinking, reading, creativity that involves sitting, etc.¬† However after visiting my Mom who has the same preferences and seeing how her lack of commitment to physical fitness has limited her even more than her arthritis, etc. requires, I don't want that to be my future if I can avoid it!"},

Choose optimism - My nature seems to be to wake up optimistic each morning.¬† The challenge has always been to keep that dynamic going all day and to apply it to the more difficult parts of life like health challenges, feeling in a rut, etc.¬† Focusing on what I am thinking has been a huge help for me in this arena whether the issue is large or small; short term or long term.¬† And that helps what comes out of my mouth.  2. No complaining - This was inspired by the Complaint Free World Project and is a habit now after a couple of years of practice.¬† It also includes no criticizing or judging which is harder.¬† I have been making an exception for \"discussing\" some tough situations or outrageous behavior of others that has left me shaken.¬† I recently complained loudly about being the target of someone's irrational anger so I guess I need to work on this for more extreme situations.  3. Savor the present - Getting better at this partly due to a lack of long term goals LOL.¬† I've never been one to wallow in the past, but the future is another matter.  4. Take action - Again working on this (see lack of long term goals).5. Focus on energy - I have been approaching this by pushing myself physically and when I feel physically exhausted reminding myself that I am building endurance for the future.¬† More work needed here.  6. Be connected - Doing well with family, OK with friends and taking steps to make more friends.  7. Listen with curiosity - Now that I think about this one it could become a long term goal.¬† Not there yet.8. Spend time enjoying nature - Dog walks and leaf raking are making this happen right now.¬† We went to the botanical garden recently too.¬† A pretty time of year to be outside.  9. Always be learning - The new consulting projects I accepted are giving me a good dose of this.¬† Hmmm - wonder what will help accomplish this in early 2012? 10. Work within the life I have right now - Yes.¬† Enough said.11. Have long term goals - See above.¬† Other than our financial goals and some travel goals this is a gap that needs correcting.12. Use my creativity - Not much lately.¬† I used to paint and have thought about doing NaNaWriMo or its equivalent by writing a murder mystery.¬† I am very busy this November so didn't do this but perhaps I should plan it for 2012 - a long term goal?It is interesting that as I went down the list I found I was less successful in living the commandment.¬† Perhaps I knew that when I created the list.¬† I'm going to think about whether 12 is the right number, if these are still the right ones, and what I can do in 2012 to be even happier."},

You will almost always change your mind, realize you don‚Äôt need it, find it cheaper somewhere else, borrow it from the library or find a substitute. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat will my life be like if I don‚Äôt purchase this?‚Äù This is a powerful question to ask yourself because 99% of the time you will realize that life won‚Äôt be better if you make that purchase. Ask also: ‚ÄúWhat is the opportunity cost of this purchase?‚Äù What will you miss out on if you do buy that thing you have your eye on.

This assumes of course that you don't cancel out this benefit by adding whole milk and or butter to your bowl of oatmeal or try to get your oatmeal health benefits from oatmeal cookies!¬† There are other health benefits of eating oats - check out what they are at Eat More OatsThen there is the benefit of not getting hungry for a good while after eating a bowl of oatmeal.¬† The process of digesting oats helps you feel full longer which helps you consume fewer calories.¬† Eating oats can also spread the rise in blood sugars over a longer time period which helps control blood glucose and insulin levels (also essential in preventing many of the complications associated with diabetes).¬† Of course this assumes you don't add a lot of sugar to that bowl of oats.¬† Add some high fiber fruit, greek yogurt, and/or nuts to your bowl and you enhance these effects.Now for the easy on the wallet part.¬† Buy a 42 oz. package of generic old fashioned oatmeal (takes a whole 5 minutes to cook!) for around $3.40 and you get 30 servings at $0.11 per serving.¬† Not bad for breakfast cereal!Lastly, it tastes good!"},

Giving was a big expense in 2011.¬† Although we reduced the amount we donated we have gave a lot more to family members.¬† For 2012, I want to continue to support our public radio and TV stations, public library, and Heifer International.¬† In addition I will have to think about where else to donate money given how people are truly struggling in this economy - perhaps St. Vincent de Paul for their food pantry.¬† Gift giving will be limited to our adult children and their sweethearts as well as flowers for my Mom and a token gifts for my father-in-law.Action Steps:Food, Toiletries, Household Goods - Compare Trader Joe prices on items purchased regularly.¬† Set a budget of $110 per week.Giving - Make a list of birthdays, other occasions, and Christmas gifts.¬† Look for inexpensive cards for those who don't have email or Facebook.¬† Set a budget for gifts.¬† Set a budget for donations and decide on recipient organizations (we do this every year - it makes responding to solicitation phone calls so much easier!).Other Shopping - Keep a record of where found lowest price for higher cost infrequently purchased items like printer ink.¬† Make a list of items to buy and shop sales, etc.¬† Look on Craigslist as appropriate."},

{"title": "2012 Planning - Travel, entertainment and eating out", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2011", "text": "Yikes!¬† I made a list of the travel I would like to do in 2012 and added up the estimated cost.¬† It came out about $3000 more than I expected and the same amount more than we will have spent in 2011.¬† That is for 3 trips to see each of our parents (and one son is also visited at the same time as one parent), 2 trips to see the other son (he comes to us on Thanksgiving for the time being), and one small vacation for the two of us.¬† A total of 9 trips assuming parents don't get ill and need help.¬† The largest expense is airfare.¬† I don't see any way to lower the cost of dog boarding and I already monitor car rental prices and change our reservation if there is a drop in price.Entertainment including memberships in museums, etc. will be reduced from 2011 I think. It wasn't a large expense in 2011 so we will only save a little money here. ¬† Perhaps we will just plan on a membership in the art museum, movies (my husband loves to go), an occasional play, and most of the rest being free concerts and other free activities.¬† We have taken advantage of free concerts at the university closest to us and need to look for what is happening at the other colleges near us.¬† I also scour the newspaper each week to see what we can do for free.¬† We really enjoy eating out.¬† I also enjoy going out for coffee and a snack as it not only gets me out of the house but I also enjoy the environment of our locally owned coffee house.¬† We have agreed that we get more pleasure out of going out to eat if we do it fewer times and go to nicer places.¬† It is hard to find savings in some of these areas, but these categories of spending are really important to us.¬† It brings us a lot of pleasure to do these things.¬† Although travel takes priority over the other areas for 2012 as it mostly involves seeing loved ones, we don't want to eliminate the others either.¬† Action Steps: Travel- I will continue to monitor prices and hope we can use frequent flyer miles late in the year.¬†  Entertainment- Time to find more sources for listings of free activities and keep on top of them.¬†¬† I especially need to find free things I really like to do that get me out of the house in the midst of our very hot, humid summers and during cold weather. - Use the discounts available by virtue of our public broadcasting membership.Eating Out¬† - The main way to save in this area is to limit the number of times we eat out each month and really make it a treat vs just not having to fix dinner.¬† We discussed this and think that going out twice a month for a nice dinner feels right.¬† I'm going to put it on the calendar!- Look on restaurant.com and other sites for discount coupons.- Have drinks at home first or just go out for a drink.- Really limit my trips to the coffee house or trade down to plain coffee and a biscotti vs. a latte and pastry (also good for my waistline).¬† Again twice a month feels right, but it will be a challenge to stick to that."},

Nourish My SpiritWhat things give me the greatest joy? (Not things at all but time with family and dog, viewing art, being outdoors on a beautiful day, etc.)¬†What makes me feel fulfilled, useful? (Helping others through my exec. coaching practice or volunteering; making sure we eat healthfully and have activities to enjoy)¬†When do I feel least joyful, least fulfilled? (Shopping for clothes or home/yard items; cleaning house; doing yard work) ¬†2. Put My Money Where My Values AreDoI spend money on things that don‚Äôt bring me joy? (Of course - top of the list is home repair/maintenance spending)¬†Can I find lessexpensive ways to travel, exercise, entertain? (This is one of my goals for 2012 -although exercising will stay the same - while at the same time increasing our fun quotient) ¬†3. Build Relationships and Support My CommunityWhatcan I share? (Time, knowledge/skills, tools, etc.)¬†What skills, services, products can I offer others? (I am really good at planning, organizing and at helping others think through difficult interpersonal interactions or draw conclusions from large amounts of information.¬† Then there are all of those 4-H learned skills like sewing, budgeting and cooking.) ¬†Whatopportunities do I have to barter and allow more people to operateoutside the cash economy? (I have great neighbors and book club members who freely lend items if asked.¬† I'll have to think about the bartering.)¬†Where can I connect with my community tocreate a safety net for myself and others? (Find even more local businesses to support; continue to raise money for library and see if there is a way to be involved in literacy program; see if book club wants to do a project related to literacy or food security; ask others for ideas.) ¬†4. Say Enough is EnoughHow much do I need to meet basic needs? (Less than I have)¬†How much do I need beyond that to be happy? (Enough to travel to see family around the country and experience the things that bring us joy)¬†Can I meet any of those needs without spending money? (Yes, there are many free experiences available in this city and I can take advantage of more of them) ¬†5. Decide How Much Job I Really NeedCan I work fewer hours? (I made the choice to do this some time ago due to health problems.¬† Although healthy now I have kept my work in balance with the rest of my life.)¬†Can I share my job with someone else? (This doesn't apply as I am a free lance consultant.)¬†Do I have enough freedom to make the job I‚Äôve always wanted?¬† (Yes, however now it is in the context of creating a retirement/third stage of life design that will help me thrive for the rest of my life.)"},

No rush to shop but when I do this will go with me.OK, I'm starting with the big three that I have little control over without major life changes - which we aren't making for at least 6 years when hubby is planning to retire.¬† These are certainly three big expenses with housing being by far the largest expense category we have overall despite no longer having a mortgage. Together, but minus the cost of purchasing a car (a one time expense), these areas account for over 40% of our 2011 living expenses (excluding taxes and retirement savings).¬† They also seem to go up each year.To me, housing expenses include insurance, property taxes, maintenance and improvements to the house and yard, home furnishings, and utilities.¬† In the utilities bucket I am including electricity, gas, water, sewer, trash service, and the home phone, internet, cable bundle.We discussed our homeowner's insurance with our agent last year and kept it from increasing by changing to a different company.¬† I expect it will go up upon renewal though.¬† Our property tax millage rate went up 29% for 2011 and our home value stayed stable although virtually every other neighborhood in the county saw a large decrease in value.¬† We have filed an appeal on the appraisal and a neighbor has a court case underway.¬† We'll see about 2011 and start all this again in 2012.¬† Our phone/internet/cable contract comes up soon and our goal is to change services within reason to try to keep the cost stable. I'll work on all of this, but still expect it to be higher in 2012 although I don't know how much yet.¬† We aren't ready to do without a home phone and dropping cable would certainly decrease fun for us.So on to the housing expenses where we have some degree of control.¬† We have no home improvement projects and no home furnishing purchases planned for 2012 (let's keep our HGTV demons under control please!).¬† This will be a matter of willpower since so much could be done to this old house.¬† Maintenance will include tree work as always and minor do-it-yourself stuff.¬† Something will break or there will be another tree that falls into our yard I imagine.¬† I hope it isn't anything big.¬† Car expenses are the usual - insurance, registration, gas, maintenance and repairs.¬† We changed insurance in 2010 and helped keep our bill from increasing.¬†¬† Otherwise, not much to impact.In the health expenses category I include insurance, medical and dental fees, parking, prescriptions, glasses, over the counter medicines and vitamins, and Pilates sessions and possibly a gym membership in the winter.¬† I am sure that health insurance will go up, but it is through my husband's employer and provides very good coverage which we have used quite a lot.¬† Dental fees will continue to be high until June 2013 when orthodontist payments will be finished.¬† We will once again maximize our use of our pretax health savings account.¬† The other items are needed and/or add significant value to our lives.Action Steps:¬† Only a few that I can think of,¬† but here they are.¬† They are all savings oriented although my hope is to at best hold costs even with 2011 although I expect them to increase.Housing - Keep to plan of no home improvements or new furnishings; maintenance of both only.¬† Otherwise continue strategies from last year - when insurance renewal time ask how to reduce cost, purchase lowest cost natural gas and phone/internet/cable contracts that meet needs, appeal 2012 property appraisal if appropriate .Cars - Be diligent about tire pressure.¬† Continue to minimize unnecessary trips. When insurance renewal time ask how to reduce cost (e.g. would taking a safe driving course pay off?)Health - Continue to maximize health savings account and shop for over the counter medicine sales.¬† In summer use up pool visits (exercise room also available) purchased in 2011."},

Keep in mind that if you are decluttering old books that libraries and other organizations only want books that are in a condition such that you would buy them used.¬† Literacy programs will sometimes used ones that are a bit more worn.¬† Lots of books that are donated to the library where I volunteer end up being recycled for pulping.¬† That is better than putting them in the trash, but please check what an organization can really use before you donate."},

I'll report back over the next few weeks the ideas and challenges I come up with for achieving these goals.Here are the spending and fun areas I want to think through for my 2012 plan.Cars - No more car replacements in sight.¬† We have one 6 year old car and one 6 month old car; both are compacts.¬† So the focus is on operating costs and maintenance.¬† Entertainment - We love going to the theater, movies, art exhibits, concerts and out to eat.¬† Can we do it for less?¬† How much do we want to spend?¬† How often do we want to experience these things?¬† What memberships in museums/organizations will we buy? Would buying some season tickets be a good idea?¬† Are there different kinds of activities we would like to try?Food - The goals is to indulge without spending as much while also continuing to prioritize healthy choices.¬† Giving - We don't expect to make large financial gifts to family this coming year, but what financial donations do we really want to make in 2012 and to what organizations?¬† Can we volunteer more or participate in more events that raise money and thereby have more fun while giving?¬† What kinds of gifts do we want to give loved ones and for what cost?¬† Healthcare - Evaluate our health spending including insurance increases, prescriptions, over the counter medications, and exercise programs.¬† Decide on amount to go into health savings account for 2012. Home¬† - What are the ongoing costs involved in operating, insuring, and maintaining our home and property?¬† Can they be reduced?¬† Are there necessary or priority home improvement projects to budget for?¬† This year we had to replace two rotting sliding doors and the trim around them which was a planned expense.¬† The surprise spending was that we had to remove a neighbor's large tree and part of one of our trees from our yard after their tree fell into our yard, damaged the shed roof and broke one of our trees on the way down.¬† Non-food shopping - Applies to clothing, haircuts, household supplies, toiletries, pet expenses, furnishings, etc. What purchases are necessary and do they make us happy?¬† Would spending less or buying less result in same happiness?¬† Travel - Plan travel for year both for family visits and vacations.¬† Look for ways to link vacations or work travel to family visits if it will reduce costs. This will be a challenge as we travel to visit family 8 times a year, we have to board the dog, and I just used up my available frequent flyer miles to get one more trip to see my 90 year old Mom this year.¬† Perhaps by mid 2012 we will have enough miles for at least one more ticket.¬† We already have decided to take a vacation within a 6 hour drive of our home by signing up for our first Road Scholar program (previously Elderhostel) in Florida.My goal is to save more for retirement and unexpected home and health expenses while enjoying our lives more right now.¬† A balancing act for everyone!"},

{"title": "Helpful Reading: The Boomer Burden", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2011", "text": "I saw a reference to this book somewhere and decided to order it.¬† The full title is \"The Boomer Burden - Dealing With Your Parents' Lifetime Accumulation Of Stuff\".¬† I am not designated as the executor of my mother's estate as my brother gets to do that when the time comes, but my husband will eventually be the executor of his father's estate and doing it long distance.¬† There will be stuff to deal with in both situations although my Mom is doing her best to get rid of the excess in advance.This book lays out not only an approach for emptying out a home after a death, but also for helping your parents reduce the amount of stuff they have while they are living.¬† It also has great suggestions for how to communicate effectively with siblings, sibling spouses, other relatives and friends of the parent during the process.¬† There are recommendations as to how specific professionals can be helpful, a discussion of the kind of items and hidden assets common in the homes of boomer parents, and very helpful checklists.Some of the gems I found included asking your parent to write down specific future gifts (Jimmy gets the walrus statue, etc.) and then sign the list, make copies and give one to each child.¬† Also the need for spouses to be excluded from some discussions was a good point and a good thing for me to remember when the time comes.¬† Being careful to not take to your own home lots of unneeded items in hopes that they will make your loss easier or \"honor\" your deceased parent was another key point.¬† Although we all know rationally that the memories and love are inside of us, it is easy to apply magical thinking to material goods especially during stressful times.The author also highly encourages each of us to make sure we clear out our own belongings, get all legal documents prepared, and leave clear instructions to help the future executor of our estate and our children.¬† I liked the example of the mother who had everything in a 3 ring binder and reviewed it with the executor and children.¬† Personally, we update a list of all insurance, accounts, etc. each January and email copies to our executor and children.¬† That would also be very helpful if a fire destroyed our home or we were ill and incapacitated for a while.I highly recommend this book if you will be faced with this situation in the future.¬† It will also encourage you to clear out your own living space!"},

{"title": "Are you an Early Boomer and what does it mean for retirement decisions?", "date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "text": "I am classified as an \"Early Boomer\" as I was born in 1949 - well within the 1946 - 1955 birth year range.¬† Supposedly our key characteristics are being experimental, individualism, free spirited, and social cause oriented.¬† In addition, the media says we are a well educated, workaholic generation who are independent, goal orientated, self reliant achievers who like to win. Our competitive spirit supposedly resulted in a focus on health and exercise.I liked to think of myself in many of those ways when I was younger - and still do.¬† I marched against the Vietnam War, was a workaholic, am well educated, and have always focused on engaging in healthy behaviors.¬† However it is hard to think of yourself as individualistic when millions of your peers engaged in similar behaviors.¬† I wonder if we weren't relatively conformist after all.¬† Only we conformed with each other not with our parents' generation and there were distinct groups of early boomers conforming in different ways.Now I find myself on the leading edge of baby boomer retirement.¬† What will our retirement look like?¬† Very different from our parents is the prediction.¬† So far that is true for me.¬†¬†¬† I'm not retired in the sense that I haven't stopped working entirely and don't collect Social Security or other retirement benefits.¬† I don't work full time instead taking on some consulting assignments.¬† I exercise and engage in healthy habits but have had some challenging health problems none the less.¬† I do some volunteer work but it doesn't take up much of my time.¬† I'm an empty nester with no grandchildren so I'm not raising or helping to raise children.¬† I cook, clean, do the shopping, laundry, yard work and other household chores but I have always done that and my husband does many of them too.¬† As he still works full time I may do a bit more but we have always adjusted who does what to fit our work demands.¬†¬† The other activities I have aren't that different than from when I was working full time.Being an Early Boomer though means that there aren't many road maps for us to follow as we head through our 60s and beyond. ¬† I've looked at what I would like to copy from my parents' retirement.¬† Their zest for travel and new experiences is one I share.¬† They prepared all of the legal documents recommended and keep them up to date and have a living trust.¬† My Dad had the attitude of being happy to be alive no matter what health problems he faced and he faced many.¬† My Mom has shown great resiliency in how she has coped with widowhood and living alone for the first time in her life at age 87.But in many ways the decisions we face are different than the ones they did.¬† They officially retired at the same time and never worked for pay again.¬† The did not have to decide when to start Social Security benefits.¬† They had lived in the same home almost their entire married life, moved close to my brother a few years after retirement and never moved again.¬† They had no living parents when they reached retirement age so no concerns about how to contribute to their care.¬† Although health conscious, they never \"exercised\" and instead just let daily life do the job and slowly stopped most physical activity.¬† My Dad was very concerned about leaving an inheritance for his children and so was reluctant to spend much money and kept many unnecessary items just in case they might be needed; fortunately my Mom is clearing them out slowly with our help.¬† So I have some parts of my retirement journey in place due to good role models, but have no idea about others.¬† We haven't thought through when to downsize or where to live and are not sure how to make that decision.¬† We have long distance relationships with our children who will likely continue to move around the country just as we did and one recently lived abroad for two years.¬† We each have one living parent (and each one sibling who lives near the parent) who we try to care for through frequent trips to visit, assisting when they are ill and making regular calls.¬† We both are reluctant to stop working altogether because we have invested so much in our professions and get satisfaction from our work.I don't think I am in denial about the challenges of aging, end of life and long term finances.¬† We have a lot of decisions to make yet though and will keep looking for role models for our own plans.¬† Then we will take action as best we can while also letting go of the idea that we know or have control over much of what the future will bring.¬† Hopefully we will ride this wave well along with the rest of the Early Baby Boomers."},

{"title": "Higher grocery prices", "date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "text": "There has been a lot of discussion in the blogosphere lately about how to deal with higher food costs.¬† This has ranged from grocery prices in general to how to eat healthier including using more organic foods while keeping grocery costs down.¬† I have also had the sense that grocery costs have risen although, since I only shop for two and also buy all paper and household products as well as wine at the grocery stores we use, it was hard to tell how much of the increase was due to food costs.¬† So I decided to do some research.The US Dept. of Agriculture initially estimated that food-at-home (grocery store) prices were forecast to increase 3.5 to 4.5 percent in 2011 while they only increased 0.8% between 2009 and 2010 which was the lowest annual inflation rate since 1967.¬† The also projected that 2012 would see 3 to 4 percent increases in food-at-home prices.¬† Read more about their projections and historical data starting here.When you look at a specific months data you can see though that not all grocery prices went up by the same percentage (check out this data).¬† So while everything has increased (a 5.4% increase in food-at-home costs July 2010 to July 2011), your own costs will be determined by what you buy.¬† For example, the price of eggs increased 13.3% in 12 months (although their price had dropped 14.7% in 2009) but poultry only went up 2.7% in the same time frame.¬† (Does raise the old chicken or egg question in slightly different form - LOL.)¬† Beef & veal prices however went up 9.3%.¬† In the produce area, fresh fruit 7.9%, fresh vegetables 5.9% and processed fruits and vegetables 3.3%.¬† Cereals and bakery products increased 4.3% and non-alcoholic beverages 4.1%Of course these are averages and price increases will vary by store and probably by region of the country.¬† For example I find our fresh produce prices quite a bit higher than they are in areas that grow a lot of produce. Bottom line is that if you eat a lot of beef and eggs you will feel the price increases more than if you eat mostly poultry and processed fruits and vegetable.¬† Either way prices have increased and are projected to continue to increase at least through 2012.¬† So I started wondering how food costs as a portion of income compare between the US and other parts of the world.¬† The most recent data I could find appears to look at relative expenditures on food for 2009 (here) but also has a helpful discussion of the average increase in food costs per household under specific inflationary scenarios.¬† Still, the percentage of household expenditures going to food was lower in the US at 6.9% than in any other country.¬† Not that this helps anyone who is struggling to pay for food out of a stretched household budget.I already do a lot to control our food costs (shop on the day I can receive the 5% senior discount, clip newspaper coupons for items we use regularly, check out store flyers and shelves for specials, shop with a list, eat fresh foods in season mostly, shop once a week, stock up on sale items within reason, buy store brands if cheaper) and rarely throw food away.¬† These are long term habits that don't take much time. In the past I haven't found it worthwhile to look for coupons online or stock up in major quantities and I don't garden preferring not to deal with clay soil and many varieties of rodents (squirrels, chipmunks, voles and moles primarily) to produce my own food - again because I only shop for two.¬† In addition, we very rarely eat beef, although we do eat pork, eggs and chicken,¬† we love fresh fruit and vegetables, and buy cereal, frozen breakfast foods and bread.So looking at the data, what else can I do to manage our food-at-home costs?¬† Personally, I am going to continue to buy primarily fruit that is in season and priced lowest out of the choices (exception is apples for husband's lunches), buy more frozen (e.g. processed) vegetables and fruits, limit pork purchases, and continue my other cost control measures.¬† If we were having a hard time paying for food I would stop buying even generic cereal and make oatmeal every day, fix even more meatless meals relying heavily on legumes and the cheaper vegetables like carrots, etc.What new steps have you taken this year to manage your food costs?I am delighted to report that my post on Why I'm not collecting Social Security benefits - Yet! is included in this week's Carnival of Personal Finance.¬† Head on over to Carnival of Personal Finance #327 - The Pirate Edition,hosted by Mrs Nespy's World to check out all of the great entries!I really enjoyed Vicki Archer's post at french essence about the essentials of inner joie de vivre and was happy to see that she included happiness on her list of the top 10.¬† She mentions that happiness can sometimes take work and that is so true.¬† I am not suggesting that with enough work anyone can be happy all of the time.¬† However, with work anyone can be happier.¬†Working on happiness may seem counter intuitive, but is highly effective in my experience.¬† Unhappiness has many causes including focusing on unhappy thoughts.¬† Changing our thoughts, or mental tapes as I like to think of them, is an exercise in changing thought habits.¬† Each time you catch yourself thinking something negative you can challenge yourself.¬† Is this thought true?¬† If it is not true, what can I think instead that is true?¬† If it is true, do I want to spend my time focusing on it?¬† If not, what can I think about instead?¬†It is the same with verbal habits that contribute to unhappiness.¬† Complaining, criticizing, comparing, etc.¬† Stopping those habits is a challenge that requires first to become aware of what we are doing.¬† Then the challenge is to substitute other statements or comments or to simply be quiet.¬†Then there is the whole category of things or problems in life that create unhappiness.¬† Not all of them can be addressed of course and sadness, pain and other sources of unhappiness are a part of everyone's life.¬† How people respond to them varies tremendously though.¬†The easiest physical sources of unhappiness to address are the small annoyances of life.¬† For example, make a list of everything in your physical environment that pops into your mind and annoys you to the point of unhappiness.¬† I did this once and it ranged from the loose faucet to chipped paint to unfinished work and so one.¬† Then start addressing each one by changing it or deciding to live with it.¬† Again the result will be an increase in happiness however minor.¬†Even small increases in happiness are worth the effort."},
{"title": "Sunk costs and decision making", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2011", "text": "In a recent conversation about having spent money on a swim pass that I hadn't really used, the concept of sunk cost was raised.¬† Basically a sunk cost (whether money or time) is one that has already been incurred and cannot be reversed.¬† That tends to fit many purchases unless there is some resale value that is actually achieved.¬† To simplify decision making about what to do with items that have been purchased but are no longer used, this concept can be helpful.¬† It also can help with letting go of guilt feelings over not using something that cost money and/or time.¬†¬†At the other end of decision making, how can the concept of sunk cost help with decisions about how to spend our money and time?¬† A simple example is to think about the cost per wear of an item of clothing or the delight per wear if it is something that won't be worn often.¬†¬†¬† A recent personal example is my need to acquire an extra large dog crate for when my son's dog visits over Thanksgiving.¬† Since I really did not want much sunk cost of either money or time for a potential once a year visit, I first tried to borrow one by sending out emails to friends to see if anyone had one to lend.¬† While it was surprising how many friends had dog crates stored in garages and basements, they all were too small or of the airline type which we didn't think the dog would like much.¬† I then looked on Craigslist and found one exactly like my son desired and it was only about a mile away.¬† I purchased it for about $100 less than a new one would cost and spent very little time on the transaction.¬† I won't know my actual sunk cost until I try to resell it in the future, but for now I have minimized my potential sunk cost be making conscious decisions about this purchase."},

{"title": "Specialty pet products", "date": "Friday, September 16, 2011", "text": "When we adopted our dog 8 months ago we went to the nearest pet store to buy her collar, leash, etc.¬† It happened to be a lovely store and we kind of went wild getting her fitted out without any comparison shopping.¬† What can I say - we had fallen in love with this rescue pooch.We are still happy with most of the purchases.¬† I have since been given a much better squeaky toy that seems to be indestructible unlike the one we purchased.¬† I've found a less expensive source for her food although we have stayed with the same brand as she is doing well on it.As we have started to use up some of the other products though I am shocked at how overpriced they were.¬† For example, poodles have to have the hair in their ears pulled out regularly to prevent ear infections.¬† Since poodle hair grows continuously like human hair this is part of the joy (NOT) of owning a poodle.¬† I do this every couple of weeks and had bought dog ear wipes to clean her ears which also soothes them a bit after the hair is pulled.¬† I learned that some people just use baby wipes instead of dog ear wipes so I shopped for those this time.¬† The difference - $9.99 for 25 dog ear wipes vs. $0.99 for 25 generic baby wipes.¬† Not to mention I had a soon to expire 30% off coupon for the store so I really only paid $0.66.¬† Amazing price difference for similar products marketed for different purposes.We'll see if my dog likes and tolerates them as well - not that she likes the ear cleaning/grooming process as a whole but she does seem to like the wipe at the end.Are there specialty products you have bought that you have later learned weren't needed?"},
{"title": "Which kind of people are we?", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2011", "text": "This week has brought two competing visions to the news.¬† At the Tea Party sponsored Republican Presidential candidate debate some audience members agreed that a person in a coma with no medical insurance should be untreated and allowed to die.¬† Then there is the amazing video of the group of people who lifted a car off a downed motorcyclist (with the motorcycle burning hard right next to it), pulled him out from under it, put out the flames on his foot, and then went on their way as emergency personnel took over.¬† Two competing visions of the value of life; of our obligations to others; of our own humanity.Intellectually I can think about the differences in the scenarios.¬† One was a hypothetical situation presented in a forum that was emotionally keyed up, televised and prone to provoking instant (and perhaps non-thinking) responses to statements in a political context.¬† The other was the reaction of people faced with a real human being in danger who was right in front of them.¬† The difficulty is that most of the time we are not face to face with the person who is suffering, ill or needy.¬† They are hypothetical to us although they are very real and very human.It is very important in my mind that we keep the humanity of others very clearly in our minds when we decide our positions on health care for the needy, food aid, housing assistance, etc.¬† Our decisions on sharing our resources through donations and volunteer work also need this kept in the forefront.¬† That is what keeps our humanity intact as well."},
{"title": "Healthy Wednesdays - The Low Salt Pantry", "date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2011", "text": "Years ago due to an acute health problem we had to take our already low salt diet down a notch to minimal salt.¬† During that process we learned about some no salt products we hadn't imagined such as no salt added baking powder.¬† We also learned to make no salt added bread (you haven't lived until you've had to eat that! LOL).¬† We've been able to ease up on the salt restriction, but still want to keep our salt intake low for our general health.So we've stayed with the no salt added peanut butter, ketchup, and chili powder as well as no salt added canned tuna, tomatoes, and beans.¬† We also make good use of low sodium soups, chicken broth, salad dressings and soy sauce.¬† But my favorite low salt items are condiments that add flavor easily to food.¬† This includes Dijon mustard of course, but also chutney, dill sauce, and teriyaki sauce."},
{"title": "Updating beneficiaries", "date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "text": "Making a list of all of our assets led to double checking for the first time who we had listed as beneficiaries on each.¬† It turns out there were quite a lot to check: credit union and bank accounts, I-bonds, life insurance, retirement funds, and government pension accounts.¬† All were correct as to the primary beneficiary, but we had to make some changes regarding contingent beneficiaries to make sure our sons were listed where possible.¬† Since we have no grandchildren and our sons aren't married, it was interesting to learn that, if a contingent beneficiary for our retirement accounts was deceased, their share went to the other contingent beneficiary unless we wrote a letter specifically stating differently.¬† We still need to talk to our sons to see if that matches their wishes.¬† I have added reviewing beneficiaries to our annual financial review done early each January.¬† I think this is especially important as we get older."},
{"title": "Why I'm not collecting Social Security benefits - yet!", "date": "Monday, September 12, 2011", "text": "I just turned 62 and of course I am thinking about how I could now collect Social Security benefits.¬† I am mostly retired so my income is not much higher than the annual earnings limit ($14,160 in 2011) for those who haven't yet received full retirement age.¬† That means that the income subject to the penalty of $1  in benefits deducted for each $2 in earnings is small.¬† We are fortunate that my husband works full time and we are able to meet all of our financial obligations without my collecting Social Security.However, I was very curious about the impact of starting benefits at different ages on my potential lifetime benefits.¬† The NY Times recently had an article \"When to Collect Social Security? A New Calculator\" which mentioned a new program created by two economics professors that provides a free report which generates the optimal age when you, and your spouse, should begin collecting benefits.¬† So I went to SocialSecurityChoices.com and completed the form.¬† All I needed was our most recent Social Security Statements so I could provide the estimated payment at full retirement age for my husband and myself.¬† Less than an hour later the report arrived via email.The results were very interesting.¬† I looked at the long planning horizon scenario as the most likely as we have long lived parents.¬† Note that my husband is three years younger than I am so our scenario reflects that.It suggested (based on our data; yours would be different) that to obtain optimal benefits, the following steps should be followed: First, the wife files for retirement benefits and immediately suspends them at age 69, year 2018.¬† Next, provided the husband has reached full retirement age and the wife has already filed and suspended, the husband files for a spousal benefit on the wife‚Äôs record at age 66, year 2018. The husband should be careful to apply for the spousal benefit only, and not for his own retirement benefits at this time. Then, the wife files for and begins to receive retirement benefits at age 70, year 2019. Last, the husband files for and begins to receive retirement benefits at age 70, year 2022.Who knew this scenario was even an option?¬† This report provided ideas I hadn't thought about and I need to learn more about how this would work, but we have time unless our financial situation or Social Security rules change drastically."},

{"title": "Figuring Out What You Want Most", "date": "Thursday, September 8, 2011", "text": "I have been thinking about a post I read back in July.¬† Kelly at Almost Frugal wrote about deciding what we really want most and then examining whether our actions support that.¬† You can read more about her thoughts here.¬† It's the same approach I have used with some of my coaching clients.¬† Really look at how you spend your time and then assess whether or not your time usage reflects your critical objectives.So looking at this stage of life - If you want to have lots of energy, why are you sitting around so much?¬† If you want to travel, why are you holding on to the house with the yard?¬† If you want great colleagues and to use your talents and experience well, why are you not looking for a job or volunteer work that provides that?Kelly suggest that the reason is that many of us trade what we want at the moment for what we want most.¬† I know I am guilty of that.¬† My trades are pretty typical.¬† I go to the coffee shop and get a snack as well as coffee instead of having a healthy snack at home, sit and read instead of taking longer walks, and go places by myself instead of making plans to go with a friend.¬† The challenge is that when I think about it I realize I really want all of those things.However, I do spend my time is on what is easiest at the moment and I don't take action often enough to do the harder things.¬† Courtney Carver at Be More With Less addresses this in her post 5 Reasons to Start Before You are Ready.¬† I most relate to her comments about momentum - getting started is the hardest part.So how do you figure out what you want most?¬† One way would be to keep track of how you actually spend your time and then ask yourself if those actions match what you really want.¬† Another would be to decide on something you really want as part of your life right now and each week add one action that will help you get there.¬† This will probably require that you drop something from your life as well.One thing I know I really want most is to maximize my energy.¬† Sitting defeats that goal.¬† I looked at the actions I already take: Pilates once a week, walking dog daily, relatively healthy eating, etc.¬† They aren't enough to get me where I want to be.¬† I decided to do three things short term to help my actions match what I want most.¬† I am going to take the dog on longer walks now that the weather is a bit cooler and we will both benefit.¬† I signed up for a once a week Zumba class (which will also help me be more connected).¬† I am spending more time planning dinner menus to make them even healthier.¬† Longer term I'm going to get better clothes for walking no matter what the weather and get a book on local hikes so we can get out in nature more during nice weather while getting some exercise.Do you find that you trade off what you want most for what you want at the moment?¬† Or have you pretty much aligned your actions with your wants?"},
