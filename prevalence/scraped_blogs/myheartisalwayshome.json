{"title": "Update + Less", "date": "Tuesday, January 02, 2024", "text": "I'm not even sure where to begin! Let's dive in. Megan started working and let me say that it was hard on this Mama! We had a tradition of having pizza most Friday nights. I wrote this on my FB page not long after she started working. \"Pizza Friday isn't quite the same without our working girl. She is rocking the working world, but we sure miss our evenings together.\"There were many replies from mothers who understood exactly where I was. One of my replies to a comment, \"Seeing her spread her wings and thrive is how it should be, but it doesn't mean it's easy on a mother's heart.\"It was eight months ago that I wrote that post and I can honestly say that it has gotten easier. Not only is she working, but is has also graduated from high school. She finished this fall. Now she has moved from a part-time employee to full-time. Megan decided that college wasn't the route for her. Honestly, we are super proud of her for this decision. Not that we didn't want her to go to college, but she backed her choice up well. She stated that it was a waste of money to go if she didn't know what career she wanted. Then she went on to say that its her hearts desire to work until she marries and then stop to care for her family.We felt that it showed great maturity to voice her desire. We know many who go to college, have a career and then really want to stay home and care for their families. Sometimes it happens, but many times we see that school debt and society pressure prevent that from happening. So now she works and saves for her future. Oh, she is also learning to drive. Dad is mainly in charge of that endeavor. Driving with a new driver raises my anxiety level!Chuck is working for a new company. He has been for a little over a year now. He is doing the same job and going to the same location. His previous company sold off several areas of the business and Chuck's area was one to go. It hasn't been an easy transition, but I keep reminding him to be thankful for a paycheck! He may or may not have asked me about our retirement account. My reply was keep working! lol So we have talked retirement and will sit down soon and set some goals so that can happen in the next ten years or so. As far as me, well the break has been nice and much needed. Somehow I am watching my seven month old great nephew. I am still trying to figure out how I ended up providing fulltime care! He is a joy and since his parents are both teachers I have plenty of off time. He'll be returning tomorrow (Wednesday) after two weeks away. I've seen him a few times while he was away. I'm looking forward to getting in some snuggles tomorrow.My word of the year (is that even a thing anymore?) is Less. The first thing is less stuff. I downsized Christmas décor and am going to slowly work through all areas of my home.  Load one is out of here and the living room is almost done.  Now, I will say that my living room is in no way cluttered, but those hidden areas are another story. I am cleaning drawers, cabinets and the closet. It's past time for a hard cull. We have some big financial goals for the year. The first one is to cash flow a vacation to the beach. It will be a trip with my parents, sister and nieces to celebrate Megan's graduation and the graduation of a niece from college. Chuck and I have already decided this will be our last trip to the beach for a long time. Even splitting the cost, it has become quite expensive. Our portion of the beach house is paid so now it's time to save for the trip there and back plus the expenses while we are there. Mainly groceries as we pretty much stay at the beach house. I mentioned earlier that retirement is becoming a more frequent topic. We will be cutting expenses as much as possible to work toward our goal of paying off our home. That is the one thing that Chuck wants accomplished before he will leave the work force.As always we have some home projects on the horizon. We have talked about a few things we'd like to do, but nothing is final yet. Chuck recently mentioned that we should sit down and make a list. I'm sure that will happen soon. It feels good to be writing in my little space on the web again. I have really missed sharing and being able to look back. So many times when we are discussing things Chuck will say, \"Look at your blog.\" It'll be good to be able to do that once again. See you all soon!Wendi"},

Through all of the fun it's important to remember the true meaning of Christmas. I've enjoyed sharing bits and pieces of ways we celebrate.

They will drive all night and be here some time in the morning. The next couple of days we will visit and wrap of some last minute details. Before we know it the big day will have come and gone.

{"title": "The Hen House", "date": "Tuesday, May 30, 2023", "text": "I've had several people reach out to me about blogging. It seems that this little space that thought might have run its course hasn't. One of the things that has been requested is post with our projects. So, here we go......In my previous ramble I showed our chicks. They have grown a ton and it was past time for them to leave the garage!This is all Chuck, well except the door. The only claim I have that is that I wanted it to look like a screen door. Megan wanted a dutch door. Chuck took our ideas and ran with it.  The solar lamps looks great at night. The wreath was from my decor stash and I thought the sign was cute.See the plastic coop? That is what started this all. Megan has wanted chickens for years. The cost was off setting, then we were given this coop, all the equipment and a little run for free. Chuck deemed the old run past its prime, so we ended up with this beauty.The chickens are happy in their new home and the neighbor cow poke is happy to visit.  Take care, friends, and remember to look well to ways of your household!Wendi"},
{"title": "Times Are A Changin'", "date": "Sunday, April 30, 2023", "text": "So much as changed, yet so much has stayed the same since my last post. Now, how is that for an opener. Just for a reminder, I live in the suburbs of a large city. I'm actually 2 miles from living in another city and county. For most of my life my little area has been a safe place. That has started to change.Sadly, not for the better. For the most part my little area of the world had petty theft like car and storage shed break ins. The shootings and murders were in other parts of town. Slowly those things have been creeping into my area. We have also seen a huge increase in homelessness. Every now and then I will see a small homeless camp and lots of beggars on street corners. I'm sure there are many that will say, \"Why don't you move?\" That isn't always easy. The housing values have declined, interest rates are up and our closest family members live near by. Thankfully we feel safe in our home. Our little street is quiet and we have good neighbors. I am hearing that this isn't isolated to my area. I see and hear that this is happening everywhere.I keep feeling this nudge to prepare my home for what the future may holds. There are many ways that this can happen. I know that the poster is from WWII, yet I feel the advise is pertinent for the times we are living in now. Late last summer we were gifted a chicken coop. Let me introduce you to our six girls. They have grown so much since this picture. They are in their ugly teenage stage, so I will spare you the pictures. *smile* Since they are growing fast we (meaning Chuck) is working to get the chicken run complete. Honestly, I can't wait to get the girls out of garage. They are starting to well, smell like chickens!Our spring has been different. One week we are warm and sunny, the next week we are having frost/freeze warnings. Gardening is on my mind. So far I have planted cabbage, potatoes, several kind of lettuce and 4 blueberry bushes. Gardening is pretty much a gamble. Some times the results are great, other not so much. So I will see how things go. A couple more weeks and I can start thinking about the big garden.The plan is to add plenty to my pantry. Although the grocery stores seem to be pretty well stocked, have you noticed that they aren't carrying as much? My favorite store has really cut back on the variety of pasta that they carry.  Many times when I go I see that the shelf isn't full in that area. (I will have to snap a picture.) I also see limits on the amount of items at different times. Some people will agree with this and other won't... I feel that it's VERY important to keep a deep, well stocked pantry. The example of limited pasta stock plus seeing limits on different items from time to time is one reason. Another is that I keep hearing about poor crops and of course there is inflation. I notice a slight increase most trips to the store. Stocking up when you find a good price is a great way to edge inflation. I also know that not only is the U.S. economy not stable, but the world economy is not stable. This could lead to so many things, one being job loss. Thankfully, we don't have that fear, but as we all know no job is secure. I am also making plans for my home. I have some projects in mind. Several years ago there was a series along the line of making your home a haven. That is exactly my aim. As the world gets crazier and crazier the more I want to be home. The world is a changin,' and not in a good way. Please know that none of this is written in fear. The good news is that as a believer I know how this story ends.Take care, friends, and remember to look well to ways of your household!Wendi"},
{"title": "In a Blink of an Eye", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2022", "text": "My father-in-law came into town for a memorial service and extended his stay due to Hurricane Ian. We will are super grateful that he made this decision. You see, he and his wife live in the Ft. Myers area about three miles from Ft. Myers Beach. After the hurricane went through, like everyone else, we knew it wasn't good. Friends made it to his place two days later. They didn't have good news. Then we found out that the community he lives in would be closed in ten days. We talked his dad into going to Florida. He and Chuck left on a Monday and when they drove up the house this is what they saw. The sun porch or Florida Room as Floridians call it was destroyed. Part of the roof that covered the living room and kitchen was peeled back slightly. All things that could be repaired. Then they entered the house.Chuck said that it smelled terrible. There had been several feet of water in the house. Things were soaked and already starting to mold.  The sad thing was that everything was still in its place and it looked like they had just walked out the door. They were able to salvage some clothing that was up high, dishes, pots and pans plus a few knick knacks. They ended up salvaging 20 totes, flower pots and two bikes.  Everything else is trashed. A total loss. Ron had been staying at a hotel while here. Once we found out that his home was destroyed we moved him in with us. It's crazy to think how in a blink of an eye everything can change.He went out and purchased a car today and will be receiving his car insurance money in the next week. He is still waiting on to hear from his home insurance and FEMA. The plan is for he and his wife (who is Hawaii taking care of her son-in-law who has ALS) to leave here (Indiana) the first week of December. They have been offered a free condo for four weeks while they look for a new home. To say that my life has changed dramatically is an understatement.  At the moment I am busy helping my father-in-law with paperwork, schooling Megan, keeping house and eating a little too much chocolate to maintain my sanity. *smile* I will be back as time permits."},

He said, he said I'm getting married!\"June paled and closed her eyes for a moment. \"Sit down, daughter.\"\"Sit down! How can I sit down when father is destroying my life!June sat down and waited for the dramatics to stop.Finally Alexi crumbled onto the bed in a mix of fury and what seemed to be fear. \"How could he Mother? I know you won't let him marry me off to a strange man.\"June was silent as she collected her thoughts. This caused Alexi to stifle her sobs and prop herself up. \"You, Alexi Mae, are the child we prayed and prayed for, our one and only.\"\"Oh Mother. I've heard this story my whole life.\"\"The problem is because you are our one and only we didn't tighten the reigns as we should have. You've always been a spit fire, a quality your father admires.\"This brought a smile to Alexi's face. She had always been the apple of her fathers eye; and she knew it. \"You see, your father and I haven't been pleased with your actions of late. We have spoken to you until there is nothing left to say.\"June had her daughters attention. Alexi moved to the settee along side her mother.June took her hand and continued, \"We've been praying and waiting for you to mature.\"Alexi groaned, \"Oh Mother, please tell me you are not on board with this nonsense.\"\"Your father spoke to me about this matter Monday evening. I've been praying and gave him my blessing this morning. Alexi, it's because we love and care about your well being.\"\"So, who is the lucky man?\" said with as much sarcasm she could muster. \"You will meet your suitor at supper Thursday evening. Please, please be on your best behavior.\" pleaded June.**************************************************************************Alexi didn't go down for dinner. She spent the afternoon in her room alternating between tears and anger. The problem was she wasn't sure if she was angry at her father or herself. After a quick bath she dressed for supper. She made sure to leave her hair down as she knew how much her father loves her curls. She'd need to pull out all of the tricks to get out of this one.The air was so thick at dinner that it could have been cut with a knife. June did her best to make polite conversation. Alexi tried to join in, but no matter how hard she tried it ended up in silence.Finally Richard broke his silence. \"Alexi, I hear your mother told you there will be a guest for supper tomorrow. I want to reiterate that we expect your best behavior.\"\"Why Father, are you afraid I might scare him off? Alexi said with a smirk.\"Tom is a decent man, I refuse to allow you to disrespect him or me.\"\"Tom?\" Alexi repeated as she thought. \"NO! You don't mean Carl Jenkins nephew?\"\"I certainly do.\"\"Tommy Jenkins is old! He lives at his uncles farm. Please tell me you don't expect me to move to a farm and take care of his uncle too!\" Alexi said with more force then she intended. One look at her father and she saw storm clouds.\"Tom is only 28.  Five years older than you. He only seems old because he is a mature man. More then I can say for you and the people you run around with. Sunday was the last straw. I will no longer be embarrassed by you!\" Richard raged. \"You think it's okay to stay out doing God know what with God knows who until late into the night on Saturday. You are barely presentable at church. Last Sunday you didn't even try. Telling your mother you had a headache and then joining my dinner table smelling like stale cigarettes and beer.\" Richard banged his fist on the table. \"I will not tolerate you to embarrass this family and certainly won't have our guest leaving here speaking about you like you're a Trollip!\" Richard pushed his chair away and stood.\"Another thing, you will be married in 30 days. Tom will be your husband unless you bring home a suitor suitable according to my standards. Alexi, I love you. I really do, but daughter, it's time.\"June quickly excused herself to see to her husband. Her father had never spoken to her that way. Alexi sat stunned."},
{"title": "Weekend Recap", "date": "Sunday, August 14, 2022", "text": "After what seems like years of hot and humid weather we finally had a cool down! That meant it was time to have some outside fun.The weekend started off at the Indiana State Fair. So many sights to see. In fact, so many we didn't see them all. We all had a list of must see items. I only wanted to see the high diving show. It didn't disappoint.See that tiny platform just below the flag?  Yes, someone dove off of that. You must be crazy to jump from this high into a 10 feet deep pool! Not for this girl!!Saturday was an at home day. I spent time giving my flowers love. They all needed some TLC and to be fertilized.Do you ever start a project and it becomes one thing leads to another type of thing? Yes, that is what is happening with the work on our barn. The siding was rotting and is being replaced which led to floor needing replaced. So far, it's been replaced enough in order for Chuck to finish the siding and install the new door. When thinking about this project we have been thinking about the future. If we had used treated wood then it would need to be replaced again. We opted to use products that should outlast us. The floor will now be out of PVC decking.    The plan was to end the evening with a fire. The fire was going and the yummies were purchased. Then, rain. Just enough that the fire was put out. Then of course it stopped. Oh well. I'll be ready for the next nice evening.Sunday Chuck and I snuck off for a late lunch. He was being quite silly while we were out! We both were fighting headaches. Once home I took a nap and he watched some television. It was a wonderful weekend. Have a great week!"},

Saturday evening we went out to cut grass about 6:30 and it was 93* with heavy humidity. Chuck trimmed while I rode the mower. I watered flowers when I was done and was beat when I came in. Whew! All of the heat gives me no desire to cook. Of course, I must feed my family. Eating out all of our meals isn't in the budget. I have been making quick items and avoiding the use of the oven.The crock pot has been a life saver.  I put a pork roast in for pulled pork, made cole slaw to cool in the refrigerator and served with potato chips. My go to recipe for cole slaw Chick-fil-A. Long time readers might remember that worked there for years. I have made this recipe countless times. A little secret is that they use Kraft Mayo. I'd love to hear your beat the heat recipes."},
{"title": "Hotel Life", "date": "Monday, August 01, 2022", "text": "Last week I accompanied Chuck on a business trip. Don't get too excited. We stayed near the Cincinnati airport, which is actually in Kentucky! Sadly the hotel didn't have breakfast included. After looking at the restaurant menu I decided I would eat in the room. The prices were outrageous, which is to expected. This was my breakfast of champions!I enjoyed a beautiful view! Ha! The room had a very nice desk. I took along all of the school books and was able to get most of this years school planned. Yes!While I was working on school was able to watch HGTV and Hallmark. Christmas in July! Who doesn't enjoy the Christmas movies. The room was nice until you got into the shower. It was super creaky!! You would climb in and everything was fine. As soon as you would move it was creak, creak, creak. I asked Chuck if he noticed anything about the shower and he immediately said, \"The creak.\" Yes! I told him I feared I would end up the room blow us! Seriously, I didn't think that would truly happen, but it did give us a good laugh. There was a nice town not about 15 minutes from the hotel. The first day we ran there for a fast food lunch. An hour wasn't enough time and we were in a rush so Chuck wouldn't be late for class. We ended up hitting a grocery store and had lunch in the hotel the rest of the week.That is except for one day when I ventured off by myself.  While blogging I have interacted with some ladies that have become friends. I was finally able to meet one of those ladies. Meet Kathy! She no longer blogs, but we have been able to keep up on Facebook. She is just lovely! She has a cute southern accent and we hit it off like we had known each other forever. We talked and talked for about 2 1/2 hours and could have chatted longer. She's super sweet and it was great to connect with a kindred spirit! The highlight of my trip. *smile*Hotel life meant we dined out every evening. I know to a homemaker that can sound like heaven. Honestly, I was sick of eating out by the time we left. We tried to hit local places. This restaurant had the best cheese fries we have ever had. You know so many places put cheese on top and the fries on the bottom are just fries. This place had cheese all through the bowl and big chunks of fresh bacon. Yum!While we were at the hotel Megan was 40 minutes away living her best life. This is one of the views she enjoyed for the week.She stayed with a cousin and had the best time fishing and roaming the countryside. She even brought some of the fish she caught home.  Thankfully they were already cleaned! We invited my parents over for dinner and enjoyed a fish fry.It was a wonderful week. Chuck and I had to reconnect and Megan was able to make life long memories. As great as it was to get away, there is no place like home!"},
{"title": "Season of Quiet", "date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2022", "text": "I felt a strong urge to step away and quiet my life. Oh, what a joy it has been! Many times I would think of this space and start a post in my head. Each time I would hear that whisper saying, \"Now is not the time.\" For the past couple of weeks when I would think about blogging I felt peace. Life has changed tremendously since I typed my first post. I no longer have a little girl by my side and under my feet. Megan is now sixteen. My, how fast it has gone! Many more changes are on the horizon: driving, first job, and finishing school (in two years). That is the joy of life, it's ever moving and changing. As most mothers know, these changes aren't always easy, but how beautiful it is to see your child grow!The season of quiet has led me to spend more time at home. I am currently working to slowly go through each space. Removing clutter, organizing and making sure each item has it's own place. I've tried doing this in the past, but would rush through it. This time it's a slow and thoughtful process. I imagine you will hear more about this. So, what to expect on the blog... lots of cleaning and organizing, DIY projects, gardening, and food storage as I strive to make my home a haven. Of course, there will be plenty of post about our family life. I have missed having a space to document our life, to share my thoughts and projects. I am looking sharing once again.I'm currently on a business trip with Chuck. I'm spending quiet days in the hotel working on school planning. I know, I lead such an exciting life! *smile*"},

If I don't like some ones content, they way they shop or their beliefs, I move on.  I don't understand why other people don't.  I also had someone, in my everyday life, make a snide comment about something that was on my blog.  (Please don't ask who or what it was regarding, because I'm not telling!)Now that my negative rant is over *smile* lets move on.  For everyone who sent an email or left a comment for me... Thank you!  I didn't respond to any of them while I was away.  I do have some regret for that.  I know it was rude!  I apologize. What have I been up to?  First of all WE ARE DEBT FREE!  If you follow Dave Ramsey we finished Baby Step #2 and have made a small dent in Baby Step #3.  As Dave says we are.... Megan is now a sophomore and still schooling at home.  I won't say we haven't had a few challenges, yet we all still happy with this decision.  We have the best next door neighbors!  Both next door men are named Andrew.  That doesn't get confusing! Only one is a family man.  Their boys are here often.  As soon as the older two see us outside they are asking to come over. In March they added twin boys to the mix.  I am their back up babysitter.  Last week week mom met me at the fence as she got out the car and asked me to take one of the twins that had been crying for 45 minutes.  Broke my heart to have to cuddle the little man. Seriously, it's nice to have good neighbors.  We often meet at the fence to borrow items or chat.On November 27th I became a GREAT-aunt.  It's such joy being an aunt!  I was happy to welcome my three nieces to the club. Meet Luke David.Saying we are all in love in an understatement. I am counting down the days until our family cookie day.  For the cookies?  No, for the baby snuggles!Here is are some highlights from the past year. We spent a week at our favorite beach spot in Hatteras, NC.  It was the most relaxing vacation I've ever had! My father-in-law and his wife sold their home and moved to Florida. (Megan is not happy about this.  She says he abandoned us. Yikes!) Chucks' company sold off his division and as December he is working for a new company.  The plus is that he works in the same building and does the same job.  We are praying for a smooth transition and that he continues to have a stable job.  He had been with the previous company for over 19 years. My everyday life hasn't changed much.  I still love home and look for joy in ordinary.  It's nice to be chatting again.  I will be back soon!"},

Below are the noodles that I used. Add remaining cheese on top and cover until melted. I served it with garlic toast and a side salad.  This was delicious!  There was plenty of leftover for lunch too.  I really like how vertitable this recipe can be.  You could use ground pork instead of the beef or you could even use both.  The noodles can also be what ever you have on hand. I think the cheese could be reduced or changed out also.  Maybe add cottage cheese to the sauce and mozarella on top.  You could even add ricotta cheese.  So many possibilities.

The Worlds Largest Sycamore Stump.  We thought we'd humor her and go since it wasn't far.  I'm really glad that we did as this was impressive. The stump was moved to a park in 1916 and is 57 feet around, 18 feet wide, and 12 feet tall.  Amazing!

Even with all of the current restrictions it has been  a busy season.  Thankfully I am starting to see a glimpse of life slowing down.As always there is housework.  I am thankful that Megan is helpful.  She is becoming quite the little homemaker.  We added a new member to the family.  Meet Link.  We went to the shetter and Megan picked him out for her birthday.  School started on Monday with our tradition of breakfast.  There was a slight glitch with our new online math.  Once that kink was worked it, it's been smooth sailing.A front moved through that brought lower temperatures and NO humidity.  We have been out enjoying it since the humidity will return this weekend. Oh my, it's been nice!I came out of the shower one morning and Megan had a pie in the oven.  She made it with no recipe.  I think she did a great job for her first solo scratch pie.  She was bummed that it didn't brown.  Don't worry, I told her the secret to making the crust brown. *smile*BLT sandwiches for a quick Sunday lunch.  We didn't have any large tomatoes.  There are plenty of cherry so those were used instead. I'm sorry about the wording in black and blue.  New blogger did not want to cooperate!Keep on keepin', friends!"},
{"title": "Putting up Corn ", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2020", "text": "First off  I'd like to say I never meant to disappear.  We all know that the world has been crazy.  Really, I think we all know, so there is no explaination needed.  I needed a social media break.   I almost deleted my FB account.  I didn't because I belong to a couple of pantry groups that I would have missed.  Instead I have been using the unfollow button and the 30 day snooze.  I have had all I could take and it has made my life feel more peaceful.  All that to say that I am in a better place mentally and am ready to give this a go again.  I recently stopped by our local farmers market and put in an order for corn.  I was able to pick it up this week.  There is an aroma that comes from freshly harvested corn that is hard to explain.  It has an earthly, fresh smell that can't be replicated.  I sat on the front porch with my mom while we shucked the corn.  Thankfully it was a day with lower humidity which made the task enjoyable. Once the corn was washed and cut off the cob it was time to get busy.  You'll notice I didn't say it was cut off after it was blanched.  The reason for that is I tried a different method.  After the corn was bagged in two cup amounts it was time to make the brine.  It consisted of 3 cups water, 1 Tbs salt, and 2 Tbs of sugar. This is heated until the sugar is disolved.  (This recipe is for 10 cups of corn, so I needed to make a double batch.) A 1/2 cup of brine is added to each bag. I had a little over three dozen ears of corn and ended up with 7 bags that have been tucked away in my freezer.  The instructions say to thaw the corn, drain and then heat.  Since this a new way of putting up corn I will report back later and let you know how it worked out.  Please say \"hello\" I know you all are still around!"},

The browning bananas became banana bread.I had used some beef broth in a recipe earlier this week.  I took the leftover broth and poured it into ice cube trays for later use.  I saved just enough broth to use in the roast I intend to prepare on Sunday.We had take out recently and there was a small container of dressing left.  That was added to my current bottle.I know I've mentioned this before, but you can write on plastic/glass containers with a dry erase marker.  I am now making sure to mark the date on all leftover.  I want to ensure that things are used in a timely manner.Beside the fact that finding food is scarce we also need to be diligent due to cost.  For those without a stocked pantry it's currently hard to shop on a budget.  No ground beef or chicken means you may have to buy the more expensive cut of meat.  The $1 loaves of bread out stock means you may have to buy the premium loaf.  All of those subsitutes can add up to budget crushers. I still find it unreal to think about all of the events that have unfolded in such a short amount of time.  If you let it, you could become anxious and paralyzed with fear.  I find that besides prayer, the best thing I can do is \"look well to ways of my household.\"Please let me know how you are doing."},

The jars I was using before had an attached lid and I had issues with the jar being off balance and tipping over when they were open.  I knew this was an area I wanted to improve.  I found some jars I loved in the Target Dollar Spot before Christmas.  I ended up picking up one or two each week until I had a nice variety.  I emptied this area and gave it a good purge.  I then added things to the new jars and gave them a label.I love how crisp and clean this area looks. To prepare for this project I have been buying all of the organizing items a little at a time.  I picked up some air tight containers to hold snacks. I love these!  I might purchase a couple more to hold crackers.  I also purchased this organizer.  It comes with a lid that didn't work, so I put it under the container in case I want to use it in the future.  The finished drawer.  It's been really slow going with this project.  As I have been gaining energy I have been able to tackle a drawer or cabinet shelf each day.  It's better to go slow in the right direction than go fast in the wrong direction.\"  ~ Simon Sinek"},

I tried to fight it as we had dinner plans.  By noon, I knew the plans had to be cancelled.  Bummer! The next day I felt even worse.  I had to go lie down while helping Megan with math.  I decided I needed to be seen.  I was diagnosed with a sinus infection.  I took all of my meds and my voice still didn't come back and I was very tired.Fast forward until today.  I had my regularly scheduled 6 month check up.  I ended with getting a chest x-ray, 2 shots, and a prescription for a very powerful antibiotic plus another item. .  It seems I have pneumonia.It explains a ton.  Like how I have been sleeping in until 9 ish, taking a two hour nap, and still going to bed and sleeping most of the night.  (sometimes coughing wakes me)I am under strict orders to STAY HOME and rest.  As my sister reminded me the goal is to not only get better, but to avoid a hospital stay.So rest and home is the plan.  I'll return when I'm feeling better."},

I'm super happy with how it turned out.  I feel like it is lighter, feels bigger and less cluttered.  Besides rest I hope to pull out the Valentine decor this weekend."},

This year I actually found my Christmas spirit!  I had such fun decorating for Christmas and enjoying all of the festivities that go along with it.  So much so that I only took one picture on Christmas. As I was thinking over 2019 I thought of all the time spent away from home and the projects that were never completed.  We were busy loving Grandma in her last days and helping other with projects.  I don't say that to complain.  The choice was made to do all of those things.  Pondering a word for 2020 I couldn't come up with one.  I was back and forth on home and accomplish.  I believe I will stick with both!  Spending time at home is a huge goal.  I want to fall in love with my home again.  One way to achieve that is to stay home and fluff my nest.  That is where accomplish comes in.  Chuck and I have a list of things we would like to accomplish on the home front.  The first item is already in the works and it just happens to involve both fluffing my home and accomplishing something on the list.  What might that be?Oh yes, taking down wallpaper.  A messy job! Once complete it was time to wash walls, patch holes, and wash the walls again and again.  Not fun, but certainly necessary.  Then the painting began. The pictures doesn't show it well.  It's a light gray with just a hint of blue.  Finally that was done and it's on to the fun stuff.  Here is sneak peek of one area that is complete.  I am waiting on new window blinds, painting a piece of furniture, and will be building a few things.  With that said it will be closer to the end of month before I am ready to mark it complete and show it off."},

They eat up the love and attention we give them.  All of their needs are met and then some, so when thinking about Christmas I knew they didn't need another toy to be tossed in the pile they already have.  So instead of purchasing them a gift, we invited them over to make cookies. I had made a tray of sugar cookies for them to frost. I think Eli enjoyed eating the sprinkles more than decorating his cookie!Once the frosting part was complete they opened up kisses while I made  a batch of peanut butter blossoms. The youngest, Evan, kept putting the unwrapped kisses up to his mouth.  Yuck!  I made sure to keep track of the bowl he was dropping his kisses into! Once that was complete the boys then rolled and cut out sugar cookies with the the help of Megan.  In the end the boys went home with a dozen peanut butter blossom cookies,  sugar cookies sprinkled with color sugar, and each had a plate of 5 frosted sugar cookies.  I was careful to keep the cookies they made separate to send home.  That way I knew little hands didn't touch the cookies left behind!  The boys are young and don't have long attention spans.  It wasn't long before they were done with cookies and ready to play.  While they played, Megan finished up the sugar cookies.  I sent two happy boys home with cookies and hopefully new memories.  It was a win, win for mom and dad also as they had time to do some shopping.  Sometimes, the gift of your time is the best gift you can give."},

As of last week she is now on hospice care.She had been slowly declining, but really took a turn two weeks ago.  She is now to the point where she is no longer mobile on her own.  Her eldest daughter, Brenda, moved in with her several years ago and has been a huge blessing.  Since Grandma is to the point that she is no longer able to stand up and take steps it now requires two people to be with her at all times.To make moving her from point A to point B easier, Chuck and a couple of his cousins have been ripping up carpet and installing wood floors.  As with any project, especially when it involves a home build in 1920, there are bound to be hiccups.  As you can tell by the picture a hallway was more entailed than just ripping up carpet and putting down the new flooring.  I don't have a picture of the new flooring, but it is pretty and was FREE!  Yup, free.  Uncle Tom had a friend that bought a house and hated the floor.  Tom was able to take the flooring if he helped pull it up.It has been all hands on deck.  Not only has Chuck been pitching in, but so have Megan and I.  Megan is the official dish drier!  Besides personal care for Grandma, there is laundry, housework, grocery store runs, and on the good days for Grandma there is plenty of visiting.  We not only want to meet her physical needs, but also want to spend as much quality time with her as we can.One evening we were leaving she was having a good evening and she mentioned she wished she could go with us because she wanted to get out.  I reminded her that she had been out that morning to go to the doctor.  She made a sour face. Ha!  I agree that going to the doctor doesn't count as an outing.  Anyway, I told her we would take her out to Cracker Barrel the following Friday if she was feeling well enough for the outing.When we arrived on Friday she was alert and ready to go.  I was surprised since the day before she woke up in a confused state and didn't recognize her daughters.  Anyway, she was happy to be out of the house and ate better than she had in weeks.  I'm not sure we will be able to take her out again.  The trip was tiring and getting her in and out of the car caused her some pain.We are taking things day by day and cherishing each moment we have with her.  If I'm not around this little space you'll know that I'm off serving at Grandma's.Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days. I find it's much harder to stretch my pennies into nickles. *smile* I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures and I hope you do also.Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},
{"title": "New Month & Grocery Haul", "date": "Thursday, August 01, 2019", "text": "It's seems that when August rolls around my mind starts drifting to fall.  It still feels very summer like so it must be the start of school that puts me in this mindset.  The area schools are all in session and I'm busy getting ready for our school year.  Our tentative start date is the 12th.  Generally the first of the month means a monthly shopping trip.  I love to see hauls, so I thought I'd share mine.  Before I start lets be clear this is a NO judgement zone.  You don't like what you see then please be kind and say nothing. *smile*  I went to Wal Mart, Sams and Kroger.  I did some stocking up at Meijer last week that I'm not including in this haul. I did forget to pull out a couple of things.  A container of ice cream and a couple of frozen dinners.  Chuck takes the frozen meals for lunch if there aren't leftovers.  I don't buy meat every month.  This month I needed to add a few things to the freezer.  I purchased the ground beef at Sams and all else at Kroger.  My meat haul was $48.96.  Meat is expensive!  Thankfully I will get more then one meal from each package except the cubed steak. My total for the month is $234.  I will to make a run mid month for milk and fresh items.  The goal will be minimal spending at the grocery for the rest of the month.  Oh, in case you wonder how I can make a month worth of meal from this, remember that I have a well stocked pantry and freezer.  Now to work on making a menu. Chuck and I will be working on the monthly budget.  I'm trying something new.  I will be using a calendar and making a new budget each pay period instead of one for the whole month.  I saw Megan at Debt Free Plus Babies work her budgeting this way on Instagram.  I'll see if it works for us.  Yes, this is all we need to pay a month with the exception of every day expenses like gas, groceries, etc.  All of our debt payments come directly from Chuck's paycheck. Doing it that way makes for a check that must be stretched.  How are you doing?  Do you have your budget made?  Are you making headway on your financial goals?  Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

{"title": "Changing My Mindset", "date": "Tuesday, July 23, 2019", "text": "It feels good to be back catching up on my little space on the web. I spent lots of time today working in the yard.  It's a mess!  The harsh heat we had last week is hard on plants.  All I could manage was to run out and throw some water on things.  Besides the heat, the mosquito population was out in full force. Needless to say lots of heat and rain made the weeds grow like crazy.  I've not done pulling weeds in all of my beds, but I made a huge dent today. Along with the weeding I am trimming bushes and cleaning up plants. My veggie garden is pretty much non existent.  My parents are getting a few things.  I went over and picked some things.  Peppers, onions, peppers and green tomatoes.  So far all of the tomatoes are rotting as they ripen.  Sigh.  I stopped by the in-laws to drop some goodies off for them. Next on the list was mowing the law.  School is creeping up on me.  I try to work on planning a little each day.  I feel like I accomplished a good amount today.  As always there is always more to be done.  That is where my change of mindset comes into play.  I love to make to do list, yet I have a love/hate relationship with them.. Many times I feel like I haven't done enough when I have items left on my list.  Yes, I know that is my issue.  The fix for is to a have  things done list.  That way when I get side tracked and complete things not on my list I can see all that I did accomplish instead of all the things I didn't complete. This is not my original idea.  I remember Laine mentioning doing this in one of her letters.  It's working well for me.  Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

Instead of using it on grocery day I put in the fridge for the afternoon I planned to work in the kitchen.  After running errands in the morning I returned home and put it into the crock pot to warm.  While it was heating up I got busy.  The first thing I tackled was to put up chicken.  Chicken tenders were on sale on Fresh Thyme.  We grill out tenders often and I'm happy to have these added to the freezer. Next on my list was corn.  I sat on the back porch shucking it so that I could blanch and add it to the freezer. I hope to find some at a farm stand to put up. Megan likes canned corn but Chuck and I prefer frozen.  Home frozen that is.  None us care for store bought frozen corn.  It seems to miss the sweet taste of Indiana corn.  The cookie jar was filled much to the delight of my family.A double batch of waffles was added to the freezer.  I like fast, easy breakfast for weekdays. By the time dinner was on the table I was done.  I popped the chicken and all the juices in a bag to take care of the next day.  I see chicken salad and stock with bits of meat for the freezer. The kitchen was tidied and then I headed outside to join my family.  Summer had been busy, so it felt good to get some thing accomplished. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

I guess the main reason was because of embarrassment.  I am growing and growing and no longer feel embarrassed to share our debt free journey freely. If you have shared your debt free journey I know how hard it was to put it out there. I also know what an encouragement it can be for other that are on this journey.  As you can image this is a vulnerable post. If you know anything about Dave Ramsey, you know that he has what is referred to as \"Baby Steps\" to follow.  We have completed Baby Step #1.  If you are unaware, that is saving a $1000 emergency fund.  Here is a link for free debt payoff tracking charts, including the one above. That money is safely tucked away.  Instead of moving on to Baby Step #2 we are starting another Savings Goal Chart for $1000.  The reason is to have the funds to pay to have a dead tree removed.  After that is complete it is then on to Baby Step #2.  All of our credit cards are cut up and no longer in use.Here is our current debt:                                                          Personal Loan               $ 2,000                                                          Furnace Loan                $ 2,100                                                          401K Loan                    $11,080                                                         Total                               $15,180Our 401K loan is combination of several things.  It includes the repair of our septic system, credit card debt and medical debt. Some may look at this total and think it's nothing.  For us, it's a lot of money.  It won't be paid off over night, but as we all know slow and steady wins the race.  Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

It's still cold, so it is lingering today.Not to worry it won't last long.  It's beautiful, yet makes me want to be snug at home.  That is exactly what I plan to do for the rest of the day.  I will put something warm on for dinner, do some puttering, and maybe watch a movie.  Those are are my plans anyway.  We shall see since Chuck has mentioned going to see his grandmother.Megan and I are in the last leg of school.  It looks like if we buckle down we can be done in four weeks.  If we work a little slower then it will be more like six weeks.  We are both ready to wrap it up.  I have some projects on the horizon and don't want to start them until I have more time.Although we have some snow today the weather is changing.  The bulbs are pushing up, the trees are budding, and there have been some days of sunshine.  Oh, how the sunshine improved me mood and motivation.  It makes me want to throw open the windows and get busy!  I still have show patience as it's still early for those continuous warm days.  They are coming and that gives me hope!It has been approximately eight months since I wrote this post.  I am doing much, much better.  I still have my moments.  Sometimes it feels down right crazy.  Like recently I had my annual eye exam.  I ordered my new glasses and once they were in I made an appointment to pick them up.  The morning I was suppose to pick them up I had crazy anxiety about going.  I actually thought about cancelling and staying home.  I talked myself through it and was fine by the time I went.  Unless this is something that you experience it's really hard to understand.  Thankfully those moments are few and far between.  I recently told someone that when I look back to where I was a year ago I have come a long way.  I still feel like I still have a ways to go, yet I feel tons better.  All I can keep doing is moving forward one step at a time.Along this journey I have found tremendous support.  The blogging community is one of the best!  People I have never meet and only know because they open up online to share about their life, their family, their faith and their love for home have become friends.  I can't thank all of you enough who have supported me by commenting on my blog, sending me e-mails, text, and even personal notes in the mail.I know that a gift isn't enough of a thanks, but I want to do something to show my gratitude.  The above picture of the give thanks sign and the home sweet home dish towel will be part of my \"I give thanks\"  giveaway.  All you have to do is leave a comment asking to be entered.  The drawing will be closed at 8 pm on Friday, April 5th.  The winner will be announced no later then Monday, April 8th.  I would love to give a gift to everyone who has supported me, but as you know that isn't possible.  From the bottom of my heart thank you for all of your love and support.Oh, and please leave me an e-mail address so I can get in touch with the winner. Thanks!"},
{"title": "Meal and Snack Prep", "date": "Sunday, March 24, 2019", "text": "I've been off in my meal prep and boy has it shown!  We've eaten out or had frozen pizza more often then I want to admit.  It was past time to get my act together.  I picked up some veggies, fruit, and a large package of hamburger from Sam's.  I made a menu and then it was time to get busy. I tackled the package of hamburger.  I was able to get three hamburger patties, make a meatloaf, and spaghetti sauce that will be used as part of the menu this week.  I also made taco meat and browned a package of sausage.  With all that I made I was also able to put two small packages of beef in the freezer. When I was done I had my hamburger patties ready for dinner, a meatloaf mixed up and put into the freezer.  The spaghetti sauce was more then I needed for the lasagna.  I bagged up what I need for the lasagna and then the rest was put away for future use.  The taco meat was broken down into three packages.  Two for future family meals and one for a last minute lunch if I don't have leftovers for Chuck's lunch box.  I like to have taco mixed this way as I can throw it frozen into the crockpot and have a meal on a busy day or for an after church lunch.  The sausage went to the freezer to be used as pizza toppings.  Next I put on some eggs to hard-boil and tackled the veggies.  I really needed some easy, healthy snacks.  I will admit I am sometimes lazy and find it easier to grab a cookie than to take the time to clean a carrot.  I looked for some convenient snacks for ideas and this is what I found.A veggie and drip snack container. They also had what they called a protein pack that had cheese, nuts, pea pods and a boiled egg.  This is the cost of each of those trays.  That shocking price was enough to get me moving! While I was cleaning carrots I prepped a pound and a half.  I cut slices for a chicken pot pie meal,  large chunks for a pot roast, some for cole slaw, and lots of carrot sticks.  The lettuce was washed and packaged in serving sized jars and I cut up leftover chicken for toppings.  You may notice I wrote on some of the containers.  Dry erase markers work great on plastic or glass containers.  Now onto convenient snacks.  I debated on how to package them.  Using containers would take up more room then I had.  I ended up purchasing a tray to contain them and packaged the items in snack sized baggies.  I invested in some plastic condiment take out style containers also.  This is what our new snack area looks like.  There is celery, pea pods, carrot sticks along with a single serving of ranch dip.  Cheese sticks or containers of cheese cubes along with pepperoni sticks (Megan's favorite), and scoops of cheese ball in the individual containers (my favorite).  So far this is working well.  Megan has been eating a ton of carrot and pepperoni sticks.  Don't worry there is fruit for snacking too.  Beside this snack container there are two containers that currently hold apples, oranges, and kiwi.  If you have any ideas for keeping healthy convenient snacks on hand I would love to hear about them.Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

Saturday morning we woke up nothing on the schedule.  Yes!  Chuck made us waffles. We then spent some time picking up the house, finished up laundry and such.  It was a beautiful day.  Sunshine, blue skies and puffy clouds.  I was itching to get out, yet it's still chilly.  I mentioned getting out of the house and Chuck obliged.Our first stop was for lunch.  We went to a local 50's style restaurant.  You can dine in or they provide curb side service.  There was quite a line inside so we opted for curb service.  They are famous for their tenderloin.  The food is always good here.This the view across the street while we dined.  I love to come here in the fall and see the farmers bringing in their harvest.After lunch we went for a long drive.  There is nothing like country roads and views to sooth my soul.I am super glad we got out of the house and I came back feeling refreshed.  Not long after we walked in the door I received a call that my cousin, April, had been killed in a semi crash.She and her husband were a driving team.  They were about an hour from home when the accident happened.  She was asleep in the back and her husband dropped his sandwich.  He picked it up and when he returned his eyes to the road the traffic had slowed and he couldn't stop.  He ended up hitting the back of another semi. I was very upset this weekend, but now things are sinking in.  She was a believer and I have seen many post on FB about her that speak of joy, giving, love and her faith.  It makes me wonder how many people that haven't trusted in Jesus have read the post about her and trusted Jesus as their Lord and Savior.   As sad as it is to grieve her loss it is always a blessing to know our loved ones are resting with Jesus.It feels good to be back on my little space on the web.  I'll be back soon to share bits and pieces of my life.Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

The original price was $4.28.  I'll take the savings of $2.78/each.  These will be put back to use in our school.  Turkey carcass was pulled from the freezer and five quarts of stock were added to my pantry.  They won't last long as I used one over the weekend and another this week to make soup. Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it. Proverbs 13:11   It's a great reminder to tackle our financial goals bit by bit. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money.

{"title": "Let's Talk Spices", "date": "Monday, January 21, 2019", "text": "We tend to have a mild pallet.  Most of the foods I make would mostly fall into the older farm genre.  Even though we like simple fare, I can't stand unseasoned, bland food.  I prefer homemade stock, yet it isn't always available.  I will use bouillon along with canned broth to add flavor. When I do make my own stock besides onion, carrot, and celery I also add garlic powder, parsley flakes, and bay leaf. You will often find me using bay leaf.  So much so that Megan calls it my secret ingredient. Ha!  I keep telling her that it's commonly used.  Do you follow Annabelle at http://thebluebirdsarenesting.blogspot.com?  She shows some the most beautiful, fresh bay leaf that she her mom grows.  It makes me wonder if it could grow in Indiana.  I might have to check out the conditions it needs to grow. Speaking of bland, unseasoned food, I know that is something that can be hard for a young cook.  It takes time to pick up the \"season to taste\" part of a recipe.  My advice to young cook is keep tasting and don't give up even if you don't first succeed.  Another thing I would say is don't discount plain ol' salt and pepper.  It's amazing what adding a little more salt can do for the taste of  dish.   Please share your favorite spice and how you use it.  I'm always open to learning a new trick or two in the kitchen. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},

This year you will see me talking about re-purposing leftovers, cooking from the pantry, and making things stretch. Christmas Eve we had lunch with the in-laws (Chucks' mom and step-dad).  My mil sent home one and a half of the chicken breast that she fried for lunch.  I decided to use it to make a pot pie.  Anyway, I cut the meat off into chunks and was able to get about 2 cups.  I sat that in the refrigerator for later.  As you can see in the pot I could have gotten some more meat off, but I decided to use it to flavor the stock since I only had the carcass of one chicken breast.  I threw in the skin, bits and piece, a carrot, bay leaf, sprinkled in a little garlic salt, and some pepper.   It made the riches, most delicious stock.  It had a ton of flavor from the chicken being fried.  My sous chef was in charge of peeling and slicing carrots.  She decided they would look better if she used the crinkle cutter. *smile*Once the pot pie was in the oven  I pulled the rest of the filling out for another use.  The good stuff was out into the refrigerator for later and there was still a good portion of the \"sauce\" left.  It was placed in the freezer to be used as a starter for soup. It would have been a much more frugal meal if I had made my crust.  I haven't had much luck with making a tasty pie crust.  That will be on list to conquer this year.  This was the best pot pie I have ever made!  I'm sure it is due to making my own stock.  Chuck declared it \"plate licking good.\"  Thankfully he has more manners then to lick the plate.  *wink*This is the time of year when there are plenty of leftovers.  I'll be back next Thursday with some more leftover makeovers.Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.

Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.After a hard, hard 2018 we are holding fast to the fact that His grace is sufficient... always.New Years Eve morning I hit the grocery store.  By 9 am I had hit both WalMart and Meijer.  The next stop was breakfast where we enjoyed a last meal of sorts.  You see I \"might\" have a slight Chick-fil-A addiction.  That isn't going to cut it on our debt free journey.  This is what I said about it on my FB page. \"Dear Chick-fil-A, I love you, but we need to take a break. It's me and not you. Saying good-bye is hard, especially since I really love your sweet tea. The thing is we have financial goals for 2019 and I want financial security more than your deliciousness. It's not good-bye forever. I'll drop by from time to time, just not once, twice or... it doesn't matter how often it use to be... Until we meet again, Wendi\"This was suppose to be funny, yet I had many people putting the sad emoji on this post. Ha! I don't know if they are sad that I won't be eating Chick-fil-A way too often or if they think we are broke beyond affording a meal.  We can afford it, but not if we want to irraticate our debt quickly.  Or at least as quick as we can. Slime!  Thanks for the wonderful gift from Grandma. I gave her hard time (jokingly) about it especially when Megan told me it had glitter. A simple donut breakfast set out for my family.  I had honest to goodness joy as I set this up.  I can't tell you how happy it made me to feel real joy in the ordinary! The first of what I hope many trips to drop off donations.  I got rid of lots of stuff last year, yet I'm still going.  Honestly, I think it's an on going thin.The first room cleaned top to botom.  Many of the above items were things Megan parted with.  For our pack rack daughter it was a big day!  Her bed was made with Christmas bedding and she so far she had been doing a decent job keeping it tidy. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations... keep moving forward, friends."},
{"title": "Forward", "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2018", "text": "I can't say I am sad to see a new year begin as 2018 was one of the worst years.  Sure I've had tough moments in years past, but nothing like a whole year of yuck.  Good news is that it's behind me and forward I go.It's time to put up a new calendar and enjoy a fresh start.  Obviously, you can't erase everything, yet mentally it feels like a fresh start.This is the year that I am going to keep moving forward.  I'm going into the year feeling better mentally.  I still have my days when I struggle and stress is a big factor with my anxiety.  I am finding that the anxious feeling is coming on less and less.I set up a breakfast for my family recently.  Simple donuts and milk.  I went to Chuck later and told him that I felt real joy in doing that task.  It's been a long time since I felt that kind of joy.  I can feel that I am moving forward and I'm so thankful!One of the big things last year is that we accured quite a bit of debt.  Both of our vehicles needed to have their transmission rebuilt.  Our furnace went out and we had to purchase a new furnace and air conditioning unit.  There is medical debt from where Chuck injured his ankle and debt from where Megan had to have some heart testing. We took a vacation that I knew we couldn't afford. We were eating out a ton and I knew things were a mess.I spent a morning going through each debt and making a list.  Seeing those figures in black and white, totaled up was shocking.  You see,  my state of mind last year lead to an I don't care mentality.  Bad, bad, bad as it lead to overspending, using credit, and not keeping good records.I told Chuck that we needed to talk so we jumped into his truck (that I affectionally call Trusty Rusty *smile*) and headed through the Chick-fil-A  drive thru.  We grabbed drinks and then found a parking lot to sit in.  I handed him the list of debt and then waited,  To my surprise he took it all with grace.  He accepted responsibility for his part.  Not saying no to eating out or questioning my spending.  Also for not taking over the finances when I was at my worse and asked him to. We both know that we have played a part in our financial disaster.All of that to say that we will be changing our spending as we start our debt free journey.  We've played at it in the past, but haven't had the desire or amount of debt we currently have. I haven't decided yet if I am going to share our total debt.  I might start by sharing our lowest debt in the sidebar.  Then I will update it as we pay it down.  In the end you all will know our debt total.  I have been talking about frugal living and then I bottomed out so it is hard for me to share how far we fell.  I may get more comfortable sharing as we embark on our debt free journey.As I move forward I am going to take better care of me.  I don't mean that in a selfish way either.  I need to get my weight down.  Before I started taking anxiety medication I was self medicating with chocolate.  I know that it will be a long and hard journey, but I need to change so that I feel better.  I also need to make time to spend in the Word.  Not a quick read, but a quiet time to meditate on what I am reading.I need to be in the Word so that I can see God's plan for me as a homemaker, wife, mother, and most importantly a child of God.  I feel like I bought into the world telling me that I need to spend, I need to keep up with trends, I need to vacation like every one else, live like everyone else, and basicly allowed all of this to make me feel like I was unworthy.  I can now see that comparison and buying into the lies of the world did not bring me happiness.  In reality it brought me to my knees. As hard as it has been, it might not have been a bad thing as it has changed my mindset.  I can now see that God will use the hard to mold and change a person.And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. Romans 12:2Another change is going to be in my home.  I plan to declutter again and I have a project or two planned.  Very frugal projects like painting and changing up decor (with items I aleady have).  I also plan to get back to basics.  Monthly/weekly menu planning.  Cooking more from scratch and lessening our food waste.  Last year was bad! I'd like to increase my pantry stock.  I also want to developing some new routines. All in all I want to make changes for my home to once again feel like a haven.I am hoping to post regularly, but I won't guarentee that it will happen.  I love blogging and reading blogs, yet I love my family more. I don't feel like I was truly present last year and moving forward that will be my number one goal... more time present with my family.I am ready to see what 2019 has in store.  Ready, set,.. keep moving forward!

We went to watch candy canes being made. Fun!Our first family gathering will be tomorrow afternoon.  This afternoon was spent getting the goodie trays ready to go.  All the cards are sent, presents are wrapped, treats are baked and most importantly my heart is in the right place as we celebrate the birth of our Savior.  I'm thankful for all of you who stop by and read my little space on the web.  From my family to yours....

It's one of those holidays that require food, family, and more food.  That is the only expectation.  So, I welcome November with open arms. November started off with monthly grocery shopping and meal planning.  I made a trip to Meijer, Kroger, WalMart and Sams.  Have to hit the loss leaders to stretch the budget and keep the pantry stocked.  My pantry and freezer are now full of good stuff.  I was hopeful to not return until the week before Thanksgiving.  I forgot to get a two liter of cola for making pulled pork and it looks like our supply of milk won't hold out that long.  Bummer, but at least the list is short.How did you do with the time change?  The only good thing about it is that for a few weeks I wake up earlier.I was rewarded with a beautiful sunrise Sunday morning.  Then came evening with the early sunset.  Boo!  I'm not a fan of the early darkness.  We left home at 9:30 this morning and didn't return until after 3:30.  We were invited by a family we meet this morning at church to join them for lunch.  She came up and introduced herself and chatted for a few.  She then returned a few minutes later and invited us her home. She said that she felt the Lord nudging her to do so.  It turned out to be the pastors' daughter.  After we arrived the pastor and his wife walked in.  Turns out that she makes a large lunch for her family and parents each Sunday.  It was a wonderful afternoon.One of things Chuck and I have talked and prayed about is finding a church were we felt welcomed and wanted.  It seems that the Lord is answering our prayers.The time change and a busy day have left this girl tired.  It's off to bed with me so I can be fresh for the morning.  May you find joy in the journey as you chase your life!"},

I find the hymns soothing.  Now, I do listen to contempory Christian music also.  In my current season I find them fine in the car, but at home I need something slower and softer.I am waiting for the washer to finish its cycle and thought I would sit and catch up.  I have a mountain of laundry to tackle today.  Once I sorted it I thought, \"oh my!\"  The change in season brings more laundry as pants, sweatshirts, and such take up more room.  Plus if I am honest I am a little bit behind. *smile*  Megan exclaimed that she didn't have any socks.  I'm sure she has socks, just not the ones that she wants to wear.  I can't say I blame her as I have certain clothing items I like more than others.Speaking of clothing; did the quick change in the weather find anyone else unprepared?  It did me.  I had Megan ready, but not myself.  It went from almost 90* one day to in the 50's the next.  We have now had frost and our first freeze.  Which might be the reason I have been under the weather for the past week.  Nothing serious.  I've had cough, congestion, headache, and tiredness for the over a week now.  We have all passed the cold around.  I am getting better and I am grateful!Hence the reason I have this quiet time to listen to hymns, do laundry, and chat with all of you.  I am waiting for Chuck and Megan to return home.  They had a few errands to complete before they came home.  Gas for the week and to pick up a couple grocery items.Are you ready to hear how I am doing?  Besides the change of season yuck I am hanging in there.  I had my stitches removed last week.  Oh, it felt so good!  They were to the point that they were driving me crazy. I still have a slight gash and it looks gross.  I will spare you any pictures. *smile*  It's heallng well and will take lots of time because of the location.  A knuckle is a terrible place for a cut.I have once again started reading.  Not to the level I was before.  You have to start somewhere, right? I have made sure that I am resting.  I find that if I'm overly busy that it stresses me out.  One day while I wasn't feeling my best I binge watched Pioneer Woman.I also did a little baking.I have gone back to church.  We weren't really settled anywhere so we decided to start fresh.  We went to a church not far from home. I haven't been to a service like this in a long time.  Some might call it old fashioned or the way church used to be.  The kind were you could tell the people weren't just attending, but family.  Hymns were sung with hymnals.  I haven't used a hymnal since I was a kid.  The pastor was in tune with the congregation.  He called out some of the youth who were laughing and not paying attention.  Then the service ended with an alter call. We intend to keep going and see if this is where we are meant to be.  Incase you are wondering this is an Independant Baptist church.Overall, I am doing well.  I have moments where I struggle.  Thankfully I am able to work through them.  The hard days seem to be farther apart.  I keep reminding myself that I didn't get to this point immediately and I won't get through it immediately.I've rambled on enough for one day.  My family is home and it's time to close up the computer.  I'll be back when I can."},

It is super freeing to say the least.  I have been through every space in my home.  Closets, drawers, under beds, cabinets.  You name it and it has been been looked through, sorted, and purged.  The final things in my home were gone through this weekend and most of it was hauled off.  That is the best piece of advise I can give you when you purge...  get it out of your space!  It does no good to remove clutter from your home just to have it stacked up in your garage.  There are a few items left from this pile.  Those items will be taken to resale shops.  Anything not sold will be immediately taken off for donation.Once that is complete I plan to run through my home one more time.  I will never be a minimalist, but this lighter load feels great.  So great in fact I over heard Chuck on a phone call saying that after this we will tackle the garage and then our two storage sheds.  I guess you could say that the purge bug is catching!   May you find joy in the journey as you chase your life!"},
{"title": "Fall in My Home", "date": "Monday, September 24, 2018", "text": "Fall decided to let its presence known by ringing the day in with much cooler temperatures.  Awe... what a relief that was after our string of hot, humid days. For the first time in several years I put more then a mum out front.  It was fun!  Enough chat, lets get the tour underway.  As you walk up the sidewalk you are greeted by this display before you turn to step up onto the porch.  Once to the door you are welcomed by a door that is wide open to let the natural light into my home.  I love doors and curtains/blinds to be open during daylight hours.  Besides letting the sunlight in, it makes a home feel welcoming. On top of the hutch I put together an array of fall items.  The display box on the entertainment stand was updated with seasonal decor. My scent of choice for this season.  It smells wonderful! I generally use my decor from year to year.  This year I added two pillows to the couch.  A banner that greets you as you walk from the living room into the kitchen. My table centerpiece.   The thankful container is a new add this year.  I put small pine cones in the jars and then added a candle.  I tucked in a vine with berries and mini pumpkins.  Then placed a couple of real mini pumpkins in the center.  I plan to make a mat to go under my centerpiece.Now for the window above the kitchen sink.  This is an area where I spend a great deal of time.  I hung the harvest banner I made several years ago. The only change is that this year I wove a strand of bittersweet berries through the top of the swag.  I added field corn, gourds, and mini pumpkins to my vintage scale.  The window was finished off by adding the autumn blocks I previously made and Megan's small pumpkin.  I'll enjoy standing in this space as I watch the season change.As small plaque that hangs off of the cabinet that disguises my Kitchenaid. A great reminder as I putter around the kitchen cooking, cleaning and schooling. A couple of small touches on the back porch.  I added mums to the hanging baskets.  I am able to spy these from the kitchen window.  The finishing touch was to change out the flowers in my little wagon.  I usually have inpatients here that last until the first frost.  This summer wasn't a good growing season for them.  As the weather cools I enjoy sitting out here with my Bible and a cup of tea in the morning. I'm grateful to live in an area where I am able to enjoy all of the seasons.  Welcome Fall!  May you find joy in the journey as you chase your life!"},

{"title": "In the Moment", "date": "Saturday, September 08, 2018", "text": "The past week I feel like I am on a one of those Tilt-a-Whirl rides and can't seem to get off!  Labor Day weekend was spent moving my niece.  She bought the cutest condo!  Two family members went to their heavenly home. (my brother-in-laws mother and Chuck's great aunt) Chuck has continued to work overtime, plus had a few evenings away from home. Then the van broke down.  We think it has a transmission issue.Monday is the funeral for Chuck's aunt and then I hope, hope, hope that things will settle down.  It has been crazy and I don't like crazy!In the mist of all of this happening there has been good.  I was able to talk about Jesus to one of my nieces while comforting her.  Aunt Audrey was surrounded by those she loved when she went home to Jesus.  I had some quiet time Friday morning and I was able to pray for many things.  I prayed for rest for my weary husband and I saw that prayer answered.  Chuck was told there was a problem with parts and he didn't need to work Saturday.  Thankful for that answered prayer!Speaking of Friday morning.... I spent some time tending my petunia containers.  They had been neglected and needed to be dead headed.  They also needed to have some dead vines cut out.  As I started tending to them I was thinking of all the things that needed to be done.  After a couple of minutes of that I thought no more.  The chores will always be there.  I started to think about how I want my life. If I truly want the life that is simple, slow, and full of joy in the journey then I need to live in the moment.  That is exactly what I did.  I blocked out the other things.  I prayed, listened to sounds of the morning and went about my task with joy, living in the moment.  All of the other things like laundry, cleaning, bringing the checkbook up to date, making plans to go out of town for a funeral and so forth will still be there.  They are task that will need to be thought about and tackled but why fret about them when I can't do everything at once.  Stopping and realizing that living in the moment is best changed my entire attitude.  Instead of fretting about a difficult week and my to do list I started to enjoy my task and I honestly say I found joy in that task.  Life will bring us difficulties and there will always be task to complete.  It's the decision to live in the moment and tackle one thing at a time that can make a difference in our attitude, gratitude and stress level.Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Matthew 6:34May you find joy in the journey as you chase your life!"},

{"title": "Noodle Makin'", "date": "Tuesday, August 28, 2018", "text": "I supervised Megan making noddles one morning.  If you haven't tried your hand at this it is fairly easy. You'll need:2 cups of all purpose flour3 eggs1/4 tsp of saltThat's it.  See I told you, easy!Make a \"well\" in your flour/salt mixture and add the eggs. Using a fork start beating your eggs and gradually adding flour into the well with the eggs.Once it is fairly combined then you use your hands to mix and kneed the dough.   On a lightly floured surface you need to roll, turn, roll, turn, roll. This step take quite a while to thin out the dough.  If you don't have a noodle maker then you keep doing the roll and turn step until you get the dough to your desired thickness.  I'm not a huge fan of pictures of myself.  Megan has found her \"selfie\" love so I suck it up and smile with my girl.  I figure at least people will know I really did exist. Ha!One Christmas I was gifted a noodle attachment for my Kitchen Aid.  I ran strips of the dough through twice to thin it and then ran it through the noodle cutting portion.  Again this is not necessary.  Until I had this attachment I would roll and roll, then use a pizza cutter to cut the noodles.  Place your cut noodles on a floured towel, cover and let dry until you are ready to use.  If you don't need them all you can also freeze them after you had let them dry a few hours.   This batch of noodles was used to complete our chicken and noodles dinner.  Yum! May you find joy in the journey as you chase your life!"},

Working six days a week, leaving the house at six-thirty and returning at seven in the evening, means few meals are shared.  The petunia planters on the back porch are still going strong.  Most of the other plants have given it up due to the heat.  We've had a hot, hot summer.  I never know what random shot I will find when uploading pictures.  We did have a couple days of cool temperatures.  Sadly we are back under a heat advisory.  The sight of the turning leaves reminds me that it won't be long before it cools down and the season changes.  I don't know about you, but I'm ready for the change.  Summer hasn't been my best season and I'm looking forward to fall.  It generally means things slow down and I'm ready for cooler days, slower days, and comfort foods simmering the day away. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

Although I might not have felt as organized and ready as normal I pushed through and I'm glad that I did.  It feels good to be getting back into a routine.  I set the stage by doing the fun things like supply shopping and creating our bulletin board. The night before we began I set the breakfast table.  I also set up our breakfast bar.  This our second year of having crock pot oatmeal and fruit.  We decided to do something different next year as oatmeal isn't enjoyed quite as much when it's super hot and humid.  I'll have to think of a new breakfast tradition.  It wouldn't be the first day of school without the picture by the front door.  Taking it here each year has allowed me to see how she has grown.  It's crazy how fast it has gone since it feel like yesterday I was taking a picture to send her off to kindergarten.  Sniff. We hit the floor running and are now into our second week.  Things are going well.  Megan has impressed me with her willingness to get it done. This morning we ran errands.  When we returned home  I was clearing off the table and she asked a couple of times if it was time to start school. It's wonderful to be able to sneak out in the afternoon to enjoy a treat together now and then. Schooling Megan at home is a privilege I don't take lightly.  It's a joy to be able to have this time with my girl.  Ready or not seventh grade here we come!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

I know that I am doing as well as I am because of your continued prayers. Friends, I have been overwhelmed by the support I have received.  The comments, text, emails, and even a sweet card in the mail.  God is certainly hearing and answering. How I appreciate each one of you!I've had time to think, reflect, and be in deep, deep prayer.  Oh, how I've prayed!  Not only for my situation, but for those who have reached out saying they are weathering the same storm.  Also those who have shown me love by their prayers and kind words to me.   I can't express what a great, compassionate man I married.  He is a constant of support, love, and at times truth.  Sometimes the truth hurts, but spoken in love it's meant to help us grow. This walk is just that, a walk in faith.  There is no quick fix, just a process to heal and realize that life will forever be changed.  I am taking care of me.  Not in selfish way.  In a way that will allow me to be better at taking care of those I love the most.  I am getting better day by day. I am recognizing my limits.  Realizing the things I need to do to be healthy.  In this process I am finding a different kind of perfect.  A perfect that isn't based on comparison or my high, sometimes unreasonable standards.  A kind of perfect that is based on grace.  I'm grateful that God's mercies are new each day.  No matter the day before we all get a fresh start each day.  As I wake up each morning I remind myself to rejoice and be glad.  I do plan to return to blogging, please be patient as work through this season.  Again, thank you all for your support and continued prayers. Warmly,Wendi"},
{"title": "Lost, But Hopefully Found", "date": "Saturday, July 14, 2018", "text": "Friends, this is a hard post to write.  I've actually written it several times and then deleted it.  For the past two years I have been struggling.  My life has been full of anxiety and I feel stress and overwhelm by everything.  I do want to say up front that none of this stems from marital problems!  I have to put that out there because I know that many will automatically think that is the issue.  No, no, no! In the past I had a moment here and there like this but had always been able to work through it.  In the last six months it has come to the point where I pretty much just don't care.  I have been going through the motions, yet I find no joy.  It makes me super sad as I have always found joy in the simple, ordinary things.  Honestly,  I generally have a huge love for life.  I think that is the hardest thing about the whole issue.  I have a great life and it's hard to understand why it isn't giving me joy. A couple of weeks ago I told Chuck that I was going to speak with my doctor.  In typical Chuck manner he said okay and gave me a slight pat on the back as we walked to the house.  I was like really!  I know my guy and he has to process things.  Later that evening we talked for a really long time. He knew that I had been off some, but thought that it was due to a busier than usual schedule.  I hid it well as he had no idea how bad it had become.  You know that saying, \"fake it 'til you make it.\"  Well, that was me.  It has been getting harder to fake it. It is having an impact on the social aspects of my life.  For Mother's Day we were suppose to go to Chucks' grandmothers for a family gathering.  I hemmed and hawed around about not going saying stupid things like I wanted \"my\" day to spent at home.  The truth was I didn't feel like I could go.  We finally went and I was ready to leave as soon as we arrived.  I love his family and this hadn't been the case in the past.I am not a huge fan of driving, but it has gotten worse.  I am fine in my little area.  When I leave that comfort zone into places unfamiliar I panic big time.I have barely made dinner since we returned from the beach.  We have eaten out so much that my family is sick of it.  I actually took a peek at the menu in my pantry and it's from April!I won't even begin to tell you the state of my home!  Although Chuck assures me it isn't as bad I keep saying.  Ha!I am generally an avid reader.  I've read two books this year.  I just don't have the desire to pick up a book. The anxiety comes out of no where.  I can be at home and have a horrible feeling of anxiety.  No reason that I can see at that moment. Probably the worst of everything is church.  We haven't been to church since April.  (See a theme, April must have been the final straw for some reason.)  Oh church, what can I say.  We still haven't found a home church.  I'm sure that isn't helping matters.  I keep saying we need to find a church.  Chuck agrees, yet I can't get up and go.  I start having anxiety issues Saturday afternoon and then Sunday morning I can't get up and go.  I'm generally fine once the service starts, but getting myself up and there has become a huge issue.  I know, I know. I went to my normally scheduled doctors appointment and spilled it all.  I have been seeing this doctor for years and he actually attended our former church.  He listened and listened, asked me a bunch of questions and advised me.  He is a compassionate, gentle man.  I was back in the exam room with him for almost a hour. I didn't like everything he had to say, but it needed to be said.  He was kind.  He talked about my spiritual life and how Satan will use this issue to keep me from church today, tomorrow and then eventually forever.  He also told me that it isn't all about me since my family doesn't go to church without me.   Let me assure you all that I haven't lost my faith. He advised me to get up and do things even if I don't feel like I can or want to.  Such as making dinner or going to church.  Then he suggested that I try a low dose medication.  Then my doctor did something that moved me to tears.  He asked if he could pray for me.  I was choked up as I thanked him.  Then he made me laugh as he paused before he left the room and said, \"Wendi, I think you're salvageable.\" For the first time in a long time I felt that someone other then Chuck or my close family cared for me.  You see, I tried to talk to someone about this maybe a year ago.  I told her how stressed out I was feeling and her response in a sharp tone was, \"What do you have to be stressed out about.\"  I didn't say anything else about it to anyone until I knew I could no longer handle this myself.  I've felt very alone. Many times I feel like I'm reaching out for friendship and it never happens.So I've started medication.  I want to love this life that I've been blessed with.  I want to feel the joy that I use to.  I really, really do.  I want to go to church, family functions, make friends and enjoy it all without faking anything. I shared all of this to ask for prayer, if you are so inclined, and to let you know that I am stepping away from my blog for a while.  As my doctor advised I need to get up and do things.  So that, my friends, is what I am going to do.   This is not good-bye.  I'll be putting one foot in front of the other, praying deeply, and working to love my life and find my joy!  I'll be back!!!Thank you all for the encouragement you have given me again and again.Wendi"},
{"title": "  Penny Smart #6 ", "date": "Thursday, July 12, 2018", "text": "This a place where I share how I've stretched a penny, saved a penny and in many cases spent no pennies.Purchased a kit that contained all of the spices I needed to make dill pickles for $2.99.   I didn't have all the spices I needed on hand.  It was going to be less expensive to purchase this than to buy jars of the spices I needed.  I could have invested a little more to have the spices for the future but at the time this fit my budget better.I've been using rain water to water my flowers.  Free from Mother Nature! The garden is producing well.  That means less fresh items to purchase at the store. That also means there is plenty to put up for future savings. Patsy at A Working Pantry has a $5 or less pantry challenge.  She will take five dollars a week and add to her pantry.  This is separate from her regular grocery spending.  Since adding to my pantry is a goal of mine I decided to take up this challenge.   I added seven cans of pork and beans.  They were on sale for $0.62 cents making my total $4.34.  Yes, I know I could increase my savings by using dried beans.  Both Chuck and I were raised eating these and it's our preference.  Sometimes it's better to pay a few extra pennies to have something you enjoy and know that you will eat.Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it. Proverbs 13:11  It's a great reminder to tackle our financial goals bit by bit. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days. I find it's much harder to stretch my pennies into nickles. *smile* I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures and I hope you do also.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Original Homestead", "date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2018", "text": "My mom was born and raised in northern Virginia.  She moved to Indiana in the early '70's when she was married. I spent summers there on my grandparents farm. We still have family there and our roots run deep.  Growing up I had heard my mom mention a family cemetery.  It was rumored to be on the property across the street from where she grew up.  She had never seen it.  For one she was a kid and by the 1950's the property was no longer in the family.  Fast forward and the land is now in the hands of a developer.  The cemetery was discovered but no one knew who was buried there.  A public meeting was held and I guess it became a little heated.  Some digging was done after the meeting and one day my mom received a call asking if she was familiar with this cemetery.  After tons of research and phone calls it was determined that it was in fact the Donohoe family cemetery.  On our way back from the beach the developer meet us at the property and we were able to explore.When we pulled up we saw this house.  Here is the history of original property owner.  His name was Cornelius Donohoe and he immigrated from Ireland in 1745.  He is my 9th great grandfather.  He ended up in what is now Virginia and purchased 61 acres from Lord Fairfax in 1757.  He live here with his wife, Maggie, and their children. The original part of the house was built of stone and was added on to in the 1800's.  Considering the age of house and the fact that no one has lived here since the 1960's the house in remarkable shape.  We were able to go inside.  The view below is a peek into the original house.   After peeking inside we walked around to the back and that is where we saw the original stone house. The first floor was dug down several feet and then there was a second story.  The wood section above the stone is not part of the original house. I was fascinated by this window and door way.  I can imagine my grandparents going in and out of the door and looking out the window to view the falling rain or snow. It's surreal to walk the same ground as my first ancestors in America and touch the door way that I know they used. The views were incredible.  Can you imagine looking out the window and seeing this every morning?  Beautiful! Not far from the door way was the spring house.  The sight of this thrilled me!I am an avid reader of historical fiction.  One thing mentioned in almost every book is the spring house. Not only did I get to see a spring house, but the one Maggie would have used to store things from her family. Wow!!Several barns were still on property.  Chuck was able to salvage some wood to bring home. After we explored the homestead we headed over to the cemetery.  I'm super grateful that it was discovered.  It would be easy for it to be missed.  Especially if the developer had come through with large equipment to clear the land.  An archaeology firm has been out and confirmed there are nine graves.  The one below is the headstone of my 9th great grandfather, Cornelius Donohoe. We drove in late morning and were back on the road by late afternoon.  On the way out of town we made a stop to visit my grandparents. Right next to them is my great grandparents and great aunt.  I can't even put into words how incredible it was to be able to walk the land of my family and see where they were buried.  To know exactly where your family settled and be able to walk on that land is something most people will never get to experience.  I love family history and being able to make this trip and see where it all began is life changing.  I'm grateful I was able to do this.  As a family we have decided to ask for the cemetery to be moved.  I know that this is something that makes people uncomfortable.  It is something that hasn't been taken lightly.  At first we all said it should stay.  We have thought about it, prayed about it and talked and talked about this decision.  We knew that big changes were coming to the land and my thought was that we didn't want this area to be the only green space in a concrete jungle.  We all have seen those.  People zoom by and pay no respect and many times they are only the green space in an area and it becomes the area to hang out and smoke.  That is not respectful to my late family.  The court will make the final decision and if granted we are asking the developer to move our family to same cemetery where my grandparents, great grandparents and many other Donohoe family members are buried.  A final resting place that we know will not be sold for development and there will never again be the question what to do with their final resting place.  After visiting the site and seeing how the area is growing I feel peace with this decision.  Thanks for sharing this incredible journey with me. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Beach Memories", "date": "Monday, July 09, 2018", "text": "Chuck finally transferred my pictures from my broken laptop to the new one.  We vacationed in Hatteras, NC on the Outer Banks. Here we were crossing over Alligator River which means we are getting ready to drive down the North Carolina coast.  Before heading off of the coast and out to the Outer Banks we stopped to see the ocean.  Once over the bridge to the Outer Banks it's a beautiful drive.  Driving down the coast is one of my favorite things to do.  Finally we are at our final destination.  While we settled in Megan hit the beach with her cousins.  I snapped these pictures from the deck outside of our bedroom.One of the things Megan really wanted to do was fish.  She picked up a new pole from a local shop and we went down early one morning. The first day we were there a V-22 Osprey flew over.  Over the next several days we saw several different planes, including a F-16.  We later found out that we were on the flight path for border patrol.It was really neat to see the daily flyovers. No trip to the Outer Banks would be complete without a trip to a lighthouse.  We only went to one this trip.  Right up the road from us was this lighthouse. The neat thing was that at night we could stand on our deck and see the light spinning around. We were much further down the island than in the past.  That meant we weren't able to view the sunrise over the ocean.  Regardless it was still beautiful. Megan found a couple of clams.  She threw one back into the ocean was going to bring one back to the house.  That is until it started to open.  She quickly dropped it when that happened!An evening storm rolled through leaving behind a beautiful rainbow.  We were about three miles from the end of the island.  Chuck and I had the opportunity to venture out alone one morning.  We went to breakfast and drove to the end of the island.  We then sat on the dock watching the ferry run. No trip would be complete without a shot of the whole vacation crew.  We vacationed with my parents and sister and her girls.  Sadly my brother-in-law and nephew-in-law couldn't make it.It's always a great place to visit.  We are already talking about our next trip. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

Anyway, it was awfully hot so I was okay with skipping.  After lunch we headed to my parents and meet up with my sister and her crew.  The afternoon was spent swimming. The water was cool and refreshing!It was then time to grill out.  We had a traditional meal of hamburgers and hot dogs.  The holiday flare came through in the desserts. I made the cookies and the cheesecake was made by my nephew. The highlight of the day was fireworks. I love fireworks!I love, love the 4th of July! As an American, I have freedom that was bought by brave men who gave up their lives so I can enjoy mine.  That is something that I take for granted sometimes.  But most of the time , I feel gratitude beyond comprehension.  Even with all of the issues that we are facing in our nation I can honestly say I love my country!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Birthday Girl!", "date": "Monday, July 02, 2018", "text": "We spent the weekend celebrating Megan!  It's hard to believe that she is twelve. She is still very much a little girl yet I can see a glimpse here and there of the young woman she is becoming.  She brings us great joy.  She is funny, has a quick wit, and is still very head strong.  As frustrating as that sometimes is, I know that is a quality that helped her in the first months of her life and will make her a strong woman.  We just need to work on how to hone it into a positive attribute!  She is certainly an introvert and timid with those she doesn't know or isn't comfortable around.  As we move toward her teen years we will be working to help her improve her social skills.  I know first hard how hard it is to put yourself out there, but she must learn how to function in the world without her parents always being by her side.   Megan has a creative soul.  I often refer to her at a girly tomboy!  She is able to keep herself busy by creating things from sticks, mud, popsicle sticks, and loves using her glue gun.  Her latest fascination is working with leather.  I look forward to watching her learn this skill.  She isn't afraid of hard work or getting dirty.  She often amazes us by how she will jump in and help someone with a project.  She recently helped Grandpa spread mulch at his church.  She jumped right in carrying bags and getting down and dirty spreading it out. It made me smile when he told me this because that is so Megan! Although she is timid and her circle of friends is small, she is loyal.  If she invites you into her life you have a friend that will love you, support you, and value you.      I often wonder how the years have sped by so fast.  The years of little were good, but so is today.  It's my joy to watch my girl grow in a young woman.  I pray continuously for her future.  My greatest prayer is that she continues to grow in her faith and follow the Lord.I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. 3 John 4Happy Birthday, Megan! We love you!!!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

So far the garden is doing really well.  Today pickle relish was on the agenda.It has a very good flavor.  It's another one of those things that is easy to make and only requires a water bath caner.  Here is the recipe if you are interested.6 lbs of cucumbers, seeded and diced.4 cups diced onion2 diced green peppers1 diced red pepperRun through food processor, chopper or dice fine.Cover with 1/2 cup canning salt and 2 quarts boiling water.Stir and let sit for 1 hour.Drain and squeeze out excess water.Put in large stock pot and add1 tsp mustard seed1 tsp turmeric1 pint white vinegar5 cusps sugar1 Tbs cornstarchBring to a boil and boil for 1/2 hour.  Spoon into hot pint jars and process for 10 minutes in a water bath canner.Here is your gardening bonus for today.If your soil is wet tie plastic grocery bags around your shoes.  The mud will not stick to them like it does to  shoes or boots.  Best gardening trip I've ever learned!Next on the preserving list is bread and butter pickles.  If you need me you'll find me in the kitchen!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Penny Smart #5", "date": "Thursday, June 21, 2018", "text": "This a place where I share how I've stretched a penny, saved a penny and in many cases spent no pennies.While on vacation we paid the teenage daughter of a friend to water my flowers.  The first time Chuck turned on the hose water sprayed all over him.  Oops!  The hose burst while we were gone and it had been taped where it split.  At first Chuck was going to remove the hose so we could purchase a new one.  On second thought he said that he could cut off the section that was broken and buy a new connector.  For $6.00 Chuck was able to repair the hose.  We lost about 10 feet of hose.  No big deal, especially when you consider it would have been close to $100 to replace our 200 feet hose.  Good job, Chuck!The day after we arrived home my laptop died.  I was not a happy girl.  Especially since I had uploaded all of my pictures from our trip.When we went to look at laptops there were several on clearance.  This new laptop cost less then $200! Did I want to spent $200? No, but it was much better than full price. Patsy at A Working Pantry has a $5 or less pantry challenge.  She will take five dollars a week and add to her pantry.  This is separate from her regular grocery spending.  Since adding to my pantry is a goal of mine I decided to take up this challenge.  Kroger had a Saturday deal where ketchup was 99 cents each when you downloaded their coupon.  The limit just happened to be 5!  This is a huge score on two counts #1 we go through a ton of ketchup and #2 I haven't been able to find my target price of $1.99 in a long time. Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it. Proverbs 13:11 It's a great reminder to tackle our financial goals bit by bit.So there you go.  I hope this encourages you to do things to save money.  The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days.  I find it's much harder to stretch my pennies into nickles. *smile* I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures and I hope you do also. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

When we arrived we were told that it had been a busy season and we'd need to be exuberant for u-pick.   Megan dove right into the berries.  Well, that is until she found a stink bug in her box! We had quite a chuckle from her reaction. There is nothing quite like local, fresh strawberries.  They were eaten plain and sugared over angel food cake. Of course, I had to make jam. We have already had a sample and it's delicious!If you are new to home canning or want to give it a try for the first time I recommend that you start with strawberry jam.  It's super easy! We prefer the cooked method.  I follow the direction that are provided in the Sure Jell package.  I know that many like the freezer version.  So roll your sleeves up, put on an apron and get in the kitchen!  No matter which version you choose I know you won't be disappointed.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

Once home I started unpacking suitcases while Chuck was still emptying the van.  I'm weird about that.  I start laundry, put things away, and am not ready to settle back into home life until the suitcases are ready to return to the attic.  That's just how I tick!After that I finished up my grocery list. Unless we wanted to live on pickles with your choice of condiment sauce and a sprinkle of yeast a grocery run was a must.  I had been shopping light, and eating out of the pantry for a couple of month.  We had no fresh foods and were out of chicken.  That wouldn't fly since we eat chicken often.I had let Chuck know that I needed to do a big shop once we returned home.  I scanned grocery ads, had my list in hand and we headed out bright and early.  First stop was for a quick bite for breakfast and then the fun began.  I hit four stores and we are now super stocked!I feel like I have been on the move since we arrived home. There was a ton of outside work to catch up on.  The garden is looking well and thankfully the weeds weren't too bad.I jumped right back into homemaking and there have been some things to pull me from home.  It looks like things will start to settle down.  I don't like to keep a crazy schedule and am working to get it back under control.  I want to be able to enjoy home, summer and have lots of time to visit my parents' pool.Once I get back into my groove I will share about our trip and a unique stop we were able to make on our way home.  As great as it is to go on vacation it is even better to be home sweet home!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

{"title": "In the Garden", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2018", "text": "First off, let me say, that I know I haven't been a good blogger lately.  I don't know if it's busyness, laziness, or lack of interest.  Maybe a combination of all.  I have loved this space for a long, long time and I'm not quite sure I'm ready to let it go yet.  So bear with me as I go through this season.As I previously said the weather has turned.  That means that we have entered my favorite season of all.... gardening season!  The garden is planted and so are the flowers.  Let me give you a tour of my favorite spaces.I was super happy to see my lilac bloom this year.  I wasn't sure it would happen since many spring plants didn't.  I guess the wet and cold early spring didn't affect them.  Yeah! My dad came over to till the garden and Megan and I got busy.  We planted green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, zucchini, and bell peppers.  My mouth is watering already! I also have all of the annuals planted.  Megan took this close up.  She captured the beauty perfectly. One of my favorite things is the hanging basket plopped into the bucket we salvaged from my grandparents farm in Virginia.  Have you seen the drop in planters?  I found them at Home Depot and love the variety. My mom and I found a new to us greenhouse this year.  I purchased two of these gorgeous baskets.  Not only are they beautiful, but for a basket this size they were inexpensive.  I enjoy finding new local places to support. All of the plants I put into this planter last year came back up.  Yes! I can't wait for the clematis to bloom. Although I don't want to rush the season. There are two window boxes on the west side of the garage.  A couple of years ago we had to cut out part of the sidewalk that runs along the garage.  It made a perfect spot to plant flowers.  I always plant impatiens in the window boxes out front.  For Mother's Day Chuck and Megan gave me the gift of labor.  Together we trimmed bushes, planted flowers, pulled weeds, and the Chuck went to get fresh mulch for all of the flower beds.  The labor of love is one of the best gifts!Since I took this picture the peonies are about the burst.  I can't wait to cut a bouquet for my table. I just need to remember to shake the ants off. Ha!After years of the east side of our home looking horrible we added this bed last year.  I like the simplicity of it. Several years ago Chuck got this bell from a cousin of mine.  We have been trying to decide where to put it.  I suggested we mount it on the clothesline.  That made Chuck happy as he didn't have to dig a hole for a new post.  Plus there isn't another thing to mow around. Win, win!I've been spending most of my days outside.  I enjoy this time of year where there is grass to mow, flowers to tend, and I wait patiently for the garden to produce.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Around My Home", "date": "Tuesday, May 01, 2018", "text": "After the coldest, wettest April in 35 years the weather had finally turned.  I am one happy girl! My first lined dried items were our sheets.  There is nothing like sleeping on bedding that has been kissed by the sun. In March we had a dead tree removed.  To cut the expense we had them to leave a large portion of the tree.  We might have asked ourselves a time or two while we were cleaning up what we were thinking!  The last load was taken away this week.  Chuck has a buddy that took most of it. We had a hard time getting anyone to give us estimates.  We weren't happy with the tree company.  Chuck built our fence and is kind of partial to it.  He asked the guys several times if he should remove more panels.  They said no even after he let them know he wouldn't be happy if they hit the fence.  I bet you can guess what happened.  Yup. they hit the fence.  Thankfully it went between the two post and only damaged one panel.  I spent time painting one side of the pickets.  Chuck got them installed.  Notice how the pickets aren't even?  We have a very uneven yard.  Once the pickets were up Chuck cut the signature swoop and now you can't tell how up and down our yard is.  Hopefully I will get the rest of the pickets painted this week.  For the second year a Carolina Wren family is nesting on our back porch.  It is fun to watch them fly in and out taking care of their new babies. The change in the weather makes Megan a very happy girl.  She has a great imagination and loves being outside.  Her latest thing is mixing dirt and water.  When the mud seems like too much I keep reminding myself that soon she will outgrow this type of play.  Please, not too soon!It felt sooooo good to get my hands in the dirt.  If things go as planned I hope to have the main garden in by the weekend.  I have most of my goodies ready to go.  I'm going to run out in the morning and get some dirt so I can plant the impatiences in my window boxes.  I picked up a rotisserie chicken while at Sam's Club this week.  After we ate a meal off of it I put it into the pot to make stock.  I will pick off the remaining meat (there is a ton still on it) and hope to make chicken & noodles and have enough to freeze for another meal.  As always there is plenty to keep me busy around my home.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Weekend Puttering ", "date": "Sunday, April 08, 2018", "text": "There was nothing on the calendar this weekend and it was heavenly!  I feel like I've been on the go to much and this was a much needed break.  I went to pick up a few groceries.  I love to see others grocery hauls, so I thought I'd share what I purchased with you. The items on the left are from Aldi and the things on the right from Meijer.  I spent a total of $47.66 ($19.16/Aldi and $28.50/Meijer.  I did really well at Meijer getting fresh items, boneless chicken breast, chicken drumsticks and milk.  Chuck and Megan were with me at Aldi and few extras made it into the cart.  *smile*  I threw all the cold items into the frig and this mess greeted me in the morning. I don't know about you, but I don't feel very inspired when things aren't tidy, organized, and in their proper places.  I knew that taking care of this business would need to be a top priority.The first thing I did was take things out of the refrigerator one shelf at a time.  I wiped the shelf off and then sorted the items.  I had things that needed to be washed and prepped.  I also had items that were almost past their prime.  Those items were set aside to go into the freezer. Once that was complete I tackled the items that needed washed and prepped.  Once that was done the refrigerator was complete. Awe... much better. I then packaged up a few things for the freezer and wiped down the counters  There were a few things still on the table from my shopping trip.  I took a few minutes to put them away.  I tend to take things out of packages and place into glass containers.  Not only does it look pretty, but prevents anything from getting into the containers.  Next I went to the garage.  The items I had prepared for the freezer were added to the big freezer and then I needed to make room in the freezer above the garage frig.  I generally keep baking items in there.  I purchased 25 lbs of flour that had been in the freezer for a while.  I always do this as I want to kill anything that might turn into a creepy crawly.  *shudder*This allowed me to make room for the 18 lbs of butter I had previously purchased on sale at Aldi.  Then it was time to sit down with a glass of tea and work on the weekly menu.One of the best ways to tighten the purse strings is in the kitchen.  As I mentioned last week we had to purchase a new furnace.  We also purchased a new air conditioner.  We debated and debated on doing this.  They offered us a great deal if we purchased both.  Since they were both the same age and we had the air conditioner repaired last summer we did both.  Our neighbor did the repair and said it most likely couldn't be repaired again.It's a good thing we did as the installer said that one of the items needed to make the air cold was down to zero pounds.  This particular gas/liquid, whatever it was, isn't available any more.  So we would have had no air conditioning and would have been told we had to purchase a new unit this summer  Amazing how God looks out for us and meets our needs!Anyway,  with making this large purchase we are really pinching pennies.  I found that when I have my food organized that I am more willing to jump into the kitchen and get something delicious and nutritious cooking.  This time spent in the kitchen will have a huge pay off.I also tackled laundry.  I was able to get all of the laundry washed, ironed/folded, and put away.  A great feeling that will last until we get into our night clothes. *smile*I also started my spring cleaning.  Megan helped me to wash down the laundry area. When we were done Chuck used the shop vac to vacuum the dust from behind the washer and dryer.  I then mopped and vacuumed the runner in front of the washer and dryer.  I love it when an area is spotless!It's been crazy weather around here.  It's been cold with snow.  Then we had a warm day that caused flooding.  Now we're back to cold and I hear there could be some light snow overnight.Now that I've started spring cleaning maybe Spring will actually come. Ha!  I'm feeling refreshed and ready to enjoy a new week. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "An Easter Glimpse", "date": "Monday, April 02, 2018", "text": "We took some time off of school the week before Easter.  That enabled us to to a few fun things.  Megan slept over with her cousins and then the next day I meet up with them, at my parents, to color eggs. I had grand plans to make cupcakes for our Sunday gathering.  Things didn't go quite as planned.  In part due our furnace breaking Thursday evening.   We received the bad news on Friday that the control panel had been fried.  After looking at it we are thankful that we didn't have a fire.  They were suppose to install the new one on Saturday.  It was cancelled and it was installed today. Yeah!  Anyway, I decided to show myself some grace and certainly needed less stress after Friday.  I purchased cupcakes from Sam's Club.  I changed out some of the butterflies for Peep bunnies.  The best part is that they tasted great and saved me a ton of additional aggravation. Sunday morning found us making our traditional breakfast of cinnamon biscuit bunnies.We stopped for a quick picture before heading home.  I needed to make a quick mac and cheese before it was time to hit the road again.  This year we went my father-in-law's.  After dinner, eggs were hidden and then they were off!We had a wonderful time celebrating our risen Savior.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

There were tons leftover which inspired lunch the next day.  If you don't already know that I am obsessed with Chick-fil-A, you will now. *smile*  Megan loves their chicken minis so I set out to recreate them.  The first thing I did was make up a batch of honey butter.  1/2 cup soft butter1/8 cup honeyMix together.  Meanwhile cut your rolls almost completely in half.  Place into a baking dish and coat the top with the honey butter. I had a ton leftover that will be used on our cornbread when we have chili later in the week.  Anyway, place the rolls into a low heat oven.  I believe I had it set at about 225*. I cut up one chicken breast that I coated with salt and pepper.  Next I set up my breading station.  Dip the chicken into milk wash.1 egg1 cup milkBeat together.  Dip your chicken into the milk wash. You'll want to let the excess milk wash drip off some.  (I use to work at Chick-fil-A and once they dip the chicken into the milk wash they let it sit on a wire rack for a moment to let the excess drip off.) Next you coat your chicken in the season coating.1 1/4 cup flour2 Tbs powdered sugar2 tsp salt1 tsp pepper1/2 tsp chili powder1/4 tsp paprikaShake off excess coating and add to hot oil that is heated to 350*.  Cook the chicken until you reach your desired brown color.  Approximately 3-4 minutes.Slide a nugget into your hot roll and enjoy!I also made hand-cut waffle fries and of course I had serve it with sweet tea!  Healthy... no.

{"title": "Homeschool Update", "date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2018", "text": "It's been a while since I have chatted about our homeschool journey.  We are starting to wind the school year down.  We have about 6 1/2 weeks left.  Give or take a day or two.  I need to sit down and do the the final count to ensure that we have our 180 days completed. We tried not to take lots of breaks.  We ended up taking time off around Christmas and then a day here and there as needed.  The flexible schedule is one of the things that I really enjoy.  We hadn't planned to take time off for fall break.  Megan was invited to join her cousins for the day at her grandparents.  Which led to her spending the night there.  She ended up missing two days of school.  No problem!  We added in a Saturday morning school day here and there when the weather turned cold. There are tons of options for schooling.  Parent led is the best option for us.  I love that we are in control.  Megan didn't want to do the chapter in science on bugs.  She can't stand spiders and I was fine with skipping.  The thought of a few weeks looking at and learning about bugs didn't appeal to me either.  Yuck!  It has also allowed us to speed up or slow down as needed.  I can see her weak spots and can adjust things to help her.  I knew that her previous school didn't spend a ton of time on grammar.  Their focus was more on writing.  There are severe gaps in her grammar knowledge.  I've been able to slow things down to make sure she understands the concept.   Since I'm always curious about what curriculum others use I will share what we use.  A beka parent led.  It is what her previous school used so our intent was to start with that and then make changes as needed.  I have looked at other curriculum and we are sticking with A beka.  It's familiar and I worry that if we moved to another program, a different teaching technique that it might be frustrating.  This is working and there is no reason to cause unnecessary frustration. Megan has also expressed that she likes workbooks and not working on the computer.  So, I need to take that into consideration.  My only hesitation about A beka is that is set up as a curriculum for a tradition Christian school.  When reading the lesson plans I have to take that into consideration and take out the busy work.  They plan the work to stretch for a 7 hour school day.  Honestly, we are done in two to three hours most days.  Some day we will hit that speed bump, usually math, and it seems like we'll never get done.  I do sometimes feel like the homeschool stuff is taking over!  As most of you know we have a smaller home.  That means we don't have a dedicated space for our homeschool things.  I am able to hide the teaching manuals and extras such as flashcards in a cabinet.  There is a cart in the a corner of our living room with daily supplies and day to day lessons.  I admit that there are times I wish could hide it.   It's not meant to be so it's something I accept.  Besides the living room there is poster board in several places in the kitchen.  I guess that is just part of small house home learning. *smile* It's been fun to add in the extras, like the solar system project.  There were plain white balls in the kit and the instructions said to paint them a certain solid color.  Megan took the initiative to look up the planets and to paint them more realistic.  Another one of the perks is that we don't have to conform so that a classroom of twenty children can stay on schedule.  I know that doing this project in the classroom would have meant painting each planet a solid color per the instructions. Like I said we are usually done in a few hours.  This has led to a much more relaxed home.  Chuck no longer has to come home to chaos where we rushed through dinner so we could do homework, shower and get ready for bed.  It made for some unpleasant evenings.  Megan also has more time to be a kid.  The afternoons are free for playing outside, drawing, and pursuing her interest.  I'm not going to paint a picture that everything is smooth sailing.  There are days when there are bad attitudes (both hers and mine!).  There are occasional tears and frustrations.  I'll be honest and tell you that I don't know everything. *smile* I'm learning right beside her.  It's like everything there are pros and cons.  In this case the pros certainly out-weigh the cons.  We're growing, learning and this is working well for our family.  So well, in fact, that we are already making plans for next year.  My advise for anyone that is considering homeschool is to pray a bunch and if you feel peace then go for it!  I know it's not for everyone, but you'll never know unless you try. There is no shame is saying this isn't working and going another route.   If you do try, then do what is best for your family.  There is always going to be someone to tell you about the best curriculum.  If you're happy with what you have then you need to look no further.  There is always going to be someone to tell you that you need a co-op or an art class or this or that.  Only you can decide what extras you can afford financial and time wise. There is always going to be someone to tell you that homeschool isn't the right choice.  You know your child, you know yourself and you need to be true to that.  What works for one family might not work for another.  So you do you and what works best for you, your child and your family.  Most importantly take it all to the Lord.  Only he can give you the knowledge, strength and peace you need to make all of your decisions.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

My, what big eyes I have!\" My little sunshine always makes life better!  I'm thankful that I was able to recharge this weekend.  Now I say, bring on Monday!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

She said that K is adamant that she is not going back to school.This little girl use to come down and play.  She stopped coming because she was more mature than Megan.  The things Megan wanted to do she found boring. I find it hard to wrap by head around the fact that this happened.  There are many things I could say, but I won't.  I'm trying hard to love. I left an open invitation for K to come down anytime and craft with Megan.  Time will tell if she accept the invitation.This week I feel like I have been on the go non stop.  My dad made two trips to the ER within three days.  The first trip was an ambulance ride from my home on Monday. Yikes!  Thankfully he is doing much better.That threw my week off.  My grocery trip planned for Monday was shifted until Tuesday.  Then Wednesday it was back to the ER.  Thursday I had an eye doctor appointment.  The running plus some late nights have left me tired and my home in need of some TLC.  I'm thankful it's Friday!Today I will work on laundry and we will catch up on school.  What I don't get done around the house today we will all tackle together Saturday morning.  I wish I could say that the weekend would be slow.  We have some things planned for Saturday evening and then Sunday is church and we will go visit my father-in-law.   It should be good though.  A day of rest today and getting things back on track should help.Since we haven't had a visit since March began I'll update you on my no spend February.   HA! HA! HA!  Does that tell you how it went?  It seemed to be one thing right after the other that required spending.  Not little spending either.  Things such as Chuck had his truck into the shop twice.  We still need to get the leak fixed on the van.  It was suppose to be dropped off at the shop Monday evening, but that didn't happen.  Hopefully next week.  Two trees were cut down.  They were both dead and one was becoming a danger.  The area it was in would have caused damage to structures when it fell.I feel like this post has been all doom and gloom.  Honestly, even in the rough patches there is good.  K didn't take her life and can now get the help she needs.  My dad is feeling better and will continue to seek treatment to ensure that he is healthy.  Although we didn't want to spend it, I'm thankfully we had cash to cover the truck expenses.  The trees are down and when the strong winds come with spring storms we won't have to worry.Spring is coming!  Oh yes, this one makes me super happy.  It is staying lighter in the evenings.  The grass is starting to green up a little bit.  There is a warmer day sprinkled in here and there.  The robins are back.See, there is always a reason to be grateful!"},

My sweet Julie was killed in a car accident yesterday morning on her way to college. I feel as if I am shattered in thousands of pieces and all that is holding me together is the arms of Jesus.Donna lost her husband to illness a year ago and now her beloved daughter, Julie.  One of the things I enjoy most about the blog community is how supportive we are of one another.  How we cheer on others in their triumphs and cry together when there is deep sorrow.  I would appreciate it if you, my friends, would lift Donna and her family in prayer.  If you feel led maybe you could stop by her blog and leave an encouraging word on her last post.  I know she needs all the love, encouragement, and prayers we can provide. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. John 15:12"},

The heart table cloth, the pretty flowers, the balloon for Megan and and a gift bag in front of Megan and Chuck's plate.  I thought about all of those families that had the Valentine treats or dinner plans for those they love dearly and how it would never come to pass. I went to back porch called Chuck, sobbed, and cried out to Jesus.  My heart is broken. A friend posted the following on FB this morning.  Jesus. Yes, the hope in Jesus is what I need.Every broken relationship.Every school shooting.Every abandonment.Every betrayal.Every act of violence. Every perversion. Every child abduction.Every heartbreak.The answer is JESUS.Jesus does not take away all your pain.But he brings a hope that this world is not the end.There is more, my friends.More joy. More forgiveness. More grace. More love. More happiness. More worship.More glory.More beauty.MORE than we can even imagine.If you do not know that hope - the hope that can only come from Jesus - please reach out.He loves you. He is waiting for you. He is ready to welcome you with open arms.Jesus.Jesus is the answer."},

{"title": "No Spend Month", "date": "Thursday, February 01, 2018", "text": "Hello February!  It seems that January has flown by. It was a very good month.  Generally January is a hard month.  Thankfully we haven't had a ton of snow and I've been out and about quite a bit.  Sadly that out and about means I've spent a little bit more than I had put in the budget. Yikes!Today is the day that I steer this ship back onto course.  February will be a no spend month for us. Actually our first no spend month ever!What does that mean.  Well, exactly what it says... no spending. I guess I should clarify that there will a little bit of spending.  Of course the bills will be paid.  There are also a few groceries such as milk,  fresh fruit and veggies to purchase.  It will be the minimum needed to get by.  I went the grocery store earlier in the week and have a full pantry and freezer.  Don't worry we have plenty to eat!  I'll update you each week of the month if there is any spending on groceries.Many of you might ask why February and not January as that seems to be the go to no spend month.  Besides the overspending in January the van needs some work.  The main thing is a new radiator.  In order to get us by while we save to take care of that repair we can can buy a can of stop leak if the leak gets worse.  Chuck isn't sure that it will work but it's worth a shot if needed.Besides saving for the van repair we need to save for vacation.  I know, I know. How can we take a vacation when we are knee deep in debt.  We agreed to this vacation before the medical bills grew and the vehicles need repairs.  We seriously thought about cancelling.  In doing so we would have lost money as we have been paying for the beach house.  We also factored in the fact that Megan will be 12 this summer. The years for family vacations is slipping away.  After the vehicle and vacation funds are filled we will back to full force debt reduction.  Follow along as we tackle a no spend month.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

{"title": "Kitchen Time", "date": "Sunday, January 21, 2018", "text": "I didn't mean to disappear last week.  Honestly, I had no desire to blog.  I spent some time away from home and was extremely tired.  I've had some issues with insomnia since about the week before Christmas.  It's awful to still be wide awake, yet exhausted at two in the morning.  I finally mentioned it to Chuck and he came home with an over the counter sleep aid.  It helped termendesly! I no longer need it to get to sleep but I still feel tired.   A couple of my outings were food runs.  Meijer has some items as part of their 10 for 10 with the 11th free.  I took advantage of it to stock my pantry. Sorry no pictures of that purchase.  A trip was also made to Sam's.  We had run out of chicken.  While there we decided to do a little more stocking up.A couple of reasons for this.  One I was gifted some birthday money that we decided to spend on stocking up and the final reason is that it looks like we might be eating out of our pantry.  I mentioned before that there is an issue with the transmission on Chuck's truck.  No worries as he has been driving the van.  We noticed that the van was leaking something so while having the oil changed we asked them to see if they could find the issue.  They found it alright!  It needs a new radiator plus a couple of other things to the tune of $1457. Ouch!  Thankfully it can still be driven.  Chuck will just need to check the fluids frequently.  Then there is the wonderful govenment shutdown.  The company Chuck works for receives 99% of their work from military contacts.  A small shutdown shouldn't effect us, but if it continues it will impact us.  You know how it works.  If the company isn't being paid then they can't pay their employees.  We'll need to be cautious.   Anyway, this my meat haul. The first thing I did was marinade a package of chicken breast.  My go to marinade is italian dressing, honey and lime juice.  I had almost three pounds of chicken so I used 1 cup dressing, 1/2 cup honey and then three tablespoons of lime juice.  While it marinaded the packages were broken down into meals.  I ended up with 10 packages of ground beef (I package between 1/2 to 3/4 pound), a container of taco meat, browned beef to use as a pizza topping and three hamburger patties.  The patties were used for a meal that evening.  The chicken tenders netted 11 packages.  Once the chicken breast were done marinading they were grilled and then sliced.  Except for half of one that Megan snagged to make a sandwich for lunch. *smile* The slices were put on a baking sheet to flash freeze.  I packaged 2 oz of slices into a snack bag and then placed them into a freezer bag. These will be used to top salads for lunch.  That is if I can keep Megan out of them! Then it was time to put every thing away.  While taking care of that Chuck helped me straighten and inventory the freezer.  I'm happy to see it well stocked!While I was at it I also packaged some other things into serving sizes.  Baby carrots and animal crackers.  It's eye opening when you start to measure servings.  It helps me to make better choices when I think \"that's all I get\" opposed to \"wow, that's a large serving. I made some jarred salads.  I use to make these often.  I find that I eat better when it's ready to go.  The thought of cleaning and chopping will make me pass on the salad.  No excuse now!The frig is stocked with good for us foods.  Salad, blueberries, ready to eat carrots, apples, oranges and lemons. I have an issue with not eating correctly.  As in I won't take the time to eat properly and then I either feel sick or benge eat late in the afternoon.  I'm hoping that having things ready to go will help with this issue. A small investment of time in the kitchen that will have a big return.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

{"title": "Joy in the Journey", "date": "Wednesday, January 03, 2018", "text": "Look around, really look around and you will find joy... joy in the everyday... joy in the ordinary things.The week between Christmas and New Year is one of my favorites.  Chuck's company was on shut down from the Friday before Christmas until the day after New Year.  Sadly, Chuck had to go in and work two days after Christmas.  Once work was out of the way we were back to family and home time.Much of our time was spent playing with new toys.Christmas decor was put away.  I know many feel a let down once it is put away.  I find it fresh and uncluttered.  Doesn't everyone have wheat growing on their kitchen window sill? I spent many evenings planning.  I am happy to report school is planned for the remainder of the year. Yes!I always feel the need to purge, organize and clean after the holidays.  I guess it has to do with the desire for that fresh, uncluttered feeling.  My first project was my baking cabinet.  Do you think I might have a cupcake addiction?  Oh, and I also have a container this size of sprinkles!  I guess my addiction could be worse. *smile* I cleaned out this area that just happens to be under the baking cabinet.  It's right next to the door leading to the garage and happens to be our catch all area.  I'm hopeful that we can keep up on this area as it drives me crazy!! New Year's Eve I made appetizers.  We snacked all day and I didn't have to worry about making meals.  Win, win for everyone.We all agree this should become a new tradition.This was the temperature about 7:15 on Tuesday morning.  It was up from a record tying -12.  It hadn't been that cold here since something like 1897.  Brrr... we've been joyfully staying in our cozy home enjoying the warmth.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Back to Basics", "date": "Tuesday, January 02, 2018", "text": "I've been thinking for the last three months about what changes I would like to make.  As the New Year rolls in and life get back to \"normal\" it's a good time to implement changes. Mind you, these are not resolutions, but rather goals and lifestyle changes.   I believe the theme for this year is going to be back to basics.   The best way to get back to basics to be a good home economist.Part of being a good home economist is running your household well.  I don't feel like I have done a great job in this area.  The areas I'll be focusing on will be finances, pantry and food, organization and new skill building.First off let's talk about why.  Goals, my friends.  We have some goals to meet.  The year 2017 was expensive!  Our little water leak required us to do some remodeling.  Generally we save and cash flow those projects.  Since it was unexpected and needed immediate attention we were not able to save for this project.  This project ended up being a mix of cash payments and added debt.We ended up adding debt by purchasing new kitchen appliances as our previous ones all decided to die within months of each other.  I can't complain too much as they were all 16 years old.  Appliances aren't made to last like they use to and it's poor planning that caused us to go into debt for these.  We should have planned better and been saving for new appliances.  Live and learn!We also added debt by taking out a loan to cover the remaining balance of my heart surgery.  Then several days before Christmas we received another large medical bill.  There was a huge dispute between the hospital and our insurance company over this bill.  In the end we ended up being liable for paying 64% of the bill. I called and made payment arrangements for the lowest amount possible.  Honestly, I'm not sure how we are going to manage the payment as it is more than our monthly deposit into our HSA.  I keep telling myself that \"the Lord will provide.\"Besides debt reduction I also want to continue to build my pantry.  I keep feeling a huge nudge to expand my stock.  I'll share more about my pantry in another post.Another reason for getting back to basics is that we have been eating far too much processed foods.  I need to spend some more time in the kitchen cooking from scratch.  It's one of those things that I need to find the right balance.  Many times buying pre-packaged is less expensive.  I need to compare cost vs health benefits. I believe food is going to be the key to helping with my ongoing medical issue.  It's hard as many of the good for you foods such as salad and veggie sticks don't settle well with me.  I'll be working on trying new things in the kitchen this year.Also on my list is to go through my home and declutter.  That seems to be an ongoing task.  I'm my no means a minimalist, but I do see the benefit in lightening the load. Laura talks about claiming real estate space by removing items from your home.  I intend to claim some more of my space!Learning new skills is part of my back to basics plan.  Both Megan and I want to learn to knit.  We can take a class at the local craft store.  Neither one of us have had much luck learning from YouTube.  There are a few other things I'd like to learn, but keeping with my simple and basic theme I believe we'll tackle one task before moving on to another.I'll take you along in my journey as I get back to basics and learn to be a better home economist.May you find joy in your journey!"},
{"title": "Peace", "date": "Monday, January 01, 2018", "text": "I have been thinking and praying about what I desire as we enter a new year. Now this isn't a resolution but more of a goal or you might say a lifestyle or mindset change.  Peace is the word that kept coming to mind.According to the 1890 Webster Dictionary here are a couple definitions:In a general sense, a state of quiet or tranquility; freedom from disturbance or agitation; applicable to society, to individuals, or to the temper of the mind.  synonyms: tranquility, calm, restfulness, peace and quiet, peacefulness, quiet, quietness, contentmentThe crazy thing is that the current Webster and the KJV Dictionary have almost the exact definition.  That shows me that peace is timeless.  As the world had changed the need for peace hasn't. It's easy to say that I want peace.  In reality wanting something isn't enough. You have to work or strive for the things you desire.  So, where do I begin?First off I must realize that not everything will be full of peace.  It's in those moments that I have to make a decision of how to react.  Something I'm not always great at. *smile* Most importantly I need to stay in prayer and in the Word.  I will be making a list of verses that refer to peace to study through out the year. Did you know that there are 27 verses that mention peace?  Then there are verses about peaceable, peaceably, peaceful and pacemakers.   Plenty of food for thought.Then I've been thinking about how to find peace in the day to day.  The number one thing that comes to mind is the state of my home.  I don't find it peaceful if things are in disarray.  I will work to insure that things are decluttered (more really is less), tidy and organized.  The feel of the home also comes to mind.  I can set the tone by my attitude and the way I run my home.  It's up to me as the keeper at home to provide an environment that promotes calm, rest, quiet and certainly contentment.I've been promoting finding joy in the ordinary for a while.  It's accepting what the Lord has given you with gratitude that fuels contentment.  Honestly it's a choice to \"give thanks in all circumstances.\" Yes, I know that is sometimes easier said then done.Being a good steward to the monies we are provided is also another way to have peace.  Living within a budget and without debt will certainly bring freedom from \"disturbance or agitation.\"  This, my friends, is a work in progress for us.  Something I will be touching on as the year goes by.Honestly, I've felt like I've been flying by the seat of my pants for while.  When you feel like you are going this way and that way; when you turn on the news; when you walk into a store and really listen to what is going on around you,  for the most part there isn't a feeling of peace.   I'm looking forward to finding the \"state of quiet and tranquility\" that peace will bring.Happy New Year!"},

We had our first snow fall on Saturday.  It was less then an inch and was gone by the evening.  It was super pretty to watch it fall. The falling snow put us in the perfect mood to head to my parents for cookie day! We baked with my mom, sister and nieces.  At the end of the evening we were able to make trays to share and the guys joined us for pizza. A fun tradition!Chucks' company provided tickets to Christmas at the Zoo.  It was extremely hard to get pictures. Trust me that the lights were beautiful.Three of my nieces went along.  The company provided ride tickets snacks and hot chocolate.  It was a nice evening.The girls used their ride tickets for the carousel.   Lauren and Kayla behaving like typical teenagers. Ha!We rarely leave our suburban area. Since we were already downtown we decided to drive by the Circle of Lights.  Well, this is as close as we got. It was crazy! We were about two blocks away when I snapped this shot. Aftert this we turned off and said forget it. The traffic was that crazy. One of the reasons that we stay in our burb! After our trip to the zoo the calendar is clear.  We have nothing scheduled until Christmas Eve. That means we are enjoying cozy days at home.  Megan has been spending her time crafting and I've been reading. In case you are wondering how we don't have a jammed packed schedule ... we made a conscience decision a few years ago to step off of the crazy train. Not only at Christmas, but everyday.  We don't feel like we have to keep up with others and their over packed calendars. Our goal is family and home; not a long list of activities.  Now with that said, this is what works for us and if you thrive on the packed schedule this isn't meant as judgment.  We realized that wasn't the life that brought our family joy and started living the life that is best for our little family.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

We had anticipated paying upwards of $1000 or more in the Spring. A blessing indeed!I am still working on the room remodel project.  I sprayed the gold rod black.  If I'm doing things such as curtains then you know we are getting close to finished.  Can you feel the excitement?!Megan decided she needed a kitchen to play with.  It's been years since she has had a toy kitchen so she got inventive.  Cardboard boxes, thin cardboard sheets and a glue gun was all she needed.  I must say I was impressed with her sauce pan! That goes to show that when there is the will you will find a way. Each morning, courtesy of my early rising husband, I walk into the living room with the tree glowing.  It gives my day a warm and cozy start. The cards have been mailed. Cookie baking has begun.  These are tucked away in the freezer waiting for our annual cookie day with my mom, sister and nieces.  It's time for me to get with it!

She offered me a seat at her table and once I confirmed I could go she was like; \"Well, I might need some help setting it up.\"  Which turned into me basically picking out the design for the center piece and spending a day out shopping with her. At first I wasn't very happy because I've been super busy and didn't feel I had the time. Honestly, I didn't, but I made it happen. I told her next year she'll have to give me more notice then two weeks! I didn't feel I was able to give it my best, but in the end it turned out well.  I also happened to enjoy it once the day arrived and I blocked out the other things on my list.This is our table.I thought you might light to see a few of the other tables.  The cookie baking theme was my favorite. I also liked this one a lot.  Simple and peaceful.There were many comments on this table.  I don't think everyone understood the concept.  I thought it was clever since the purpose was to invite people to be guest at your table and show them hospitality. In case you don't know the pineapple represents hospitality. At a distance it was hard to tell what the theme of this table was.  It turned out to be Alice in Wonderland.  It was a nice afternoon.  We enjoyed delicious cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory.  I had birthday cheesecake which was layers of chocolate cake with cheese cake in between.  It was fabulous!I ran into a few people I know and was able to catch up with a ton of women that went to our former church.  It was fun to get to know my mother-in-laws friends better. They are a lovely group of ladies.There was musical entertainment and a guest speaker.  We even sang my favorite Christmas song \"O  Come All Ye Faithful.\"  I left feeling refreshed and ready to enjoy this Christmas season. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

I feel like I was able to accomplish a few things and am seeing light at the end of the tunnel for our big project. I felt like we were running out of good weather opportunities to get pictures for Christmas.  Chuck agreed that with the coming cold weather and a busy schedule it wasn't looking good for family pictures.  Off to plan B.  If you've been around a while you know we generally take our own pictures.  Thursday was a warmer afternoon so Megan and I headed out for a photo shoot.  A windy day might not have been the best day to use a brown paper back drop! It made for some silly out-takes and many laughs.  I did manage to get a couple of good shots.  I won't reveal the shot I used until the cards have gone out in the mail.  Chuck was off on Friday.  We took advantage of the day to drop Megan off at my parents and head out together.  We went out for lunch and then did some shopping. The new drywall in our third bedroom turned office/craft room/pantry is complete.  Chuck finished the sanding and then cleaned the walls on Saturday.  I'm sure you all heard my happy yell. *smile*  I don't know if you've ever had drywall work done, but let me tell you it's a dusty process.  Even with the door to the room taped off the dust escaped to every nook and cranny in the house.  While Chuck and Megan were out helping someone Saturday afternoon I started cleaning.  The first room was the living room.  A light dust wouldn't cut it so I deep cleaned the space.  Everything was taken down and washed.  Furniture was moved and every space was vacuumed or wiped down with a damp cloth.  All I need to do is clean the carpet.  I'm saving that project for when all the rooms have been cleaned and will only bring the carpet cleaner out once.  All of the Fall decor was out during the dust storm.  It need to be cleaned also so I decided to go ahead and put it away.  I couldn't see pulling it down and the putting it back up.  One less thing I will have to do the Friday after Thanksgiving. When we came home Sunday afternoon the drywall was primed and one coat of paint was applied.  The plan is put the second coat on tomorrow.  Time permitting I will spend the rest of week painting shelves.   Chuck said the ceiling and hopefully trim will be done next weekend.  I'm seeing the finish line and it makes me sooooo happy!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Making My Freezer Work", "date": "Friday, November 10, 2017", "text": "A freezer is a great tool.  Not only for freezing uncooked meat, vegetables and prepackaged food, but for your own convenience foods.  I have been working on stocking my freezer and keeping it stocked as I use things.  When making a pot pie for diner I made an extra for the freezer.  When filling the cookie jar I made a double batch. I bake what I need for today and then scoop the rest onto a cookie sheet. I place it into the freezer to flash freezer and then drop them into a freezer bag for later.  I purchase most of my meat from Sam's Club or the clearance rack at Kroger.  When I buy the large package of ground beef from Sam's I put it to use.  After this particular run I made a package of patted hamburgers for the grill and mixed up a meatloaf. Once formed I wrapped it in freezer paper.  I find that I don't like the texture of ground beef after I thaw it. It's fine for browning but I don't like it if I have to mix it uncooked. Personal issue! I browned some of it to freeze to use to top pizza, make a quick meat sauce or to quickly start a chili. Some was made into taco meat and divided into two meals.  I also made meatballs while mixing the meatloaf. I baked them and made a spaghetti sauce to freeze.  When I am having a busy day I can open the bag of spaghetti sauce or taco meat and place into my small crock pot.  I place it in frozen and let it simmer on low while I am away or occupied. This is really helping me since starting to homeschool.  My former routine was to meal prep for the day in the morning.  There are time now when there isn't time.  This is helping tremendously!I then wrapped the remaining meat to thaw and use for whatever. To stretch my meat I never freeze an entire pound.  Usually between half and three-fourths.  My family never notices that I haven't used the entire pound.I do this with more then ground beef.  I will cook a large pork loin for dinner.  I generally make pulled pork.  I will set aside what we need for dinner and then bag up dinner size portions for the freezer.  This then goes into my little crock pot frozen and I add bbq sauce to make sandwiches. Chicken is something else I like to keep in the freezer.  I will boil a large batch and then dice and freeze.  It is a head start and time saver when making casseroles and dished such as chicken and noodles. I also like to make what I refer to as lunch kits.  I will use leftover burgers or freshly made for this purpose and freeze the patty, bun and a slice of cheese in a freezer bag. I like to make the kits using sloppy joe also.  I bag up the slopping joe and add to a larger bag with a bun.  This is great when we don't have leftovers.  A bag can easily be grabbed for Chuck's lunch bag.   Anytime we have more then we can eat I will also bag it up for the freezer.  We had meatloaf on a night when we didn't need leftovers for the lunch box the next day so it went into the freezer for later use. I don't care for garlic bread so I purchase a loaf of french bread to serve with dishes like spaghetti.  I will slice the loaf when I come in from the store and place in a freezer bag. When I need a few slices I can pull out the desired number and heat them in the oven along side the garlic bread.This prevents waste and over eating.When I see the mark down bananas or have one past its prime into the freeze it goes.  I like to place them in with the peel on. There are many ways to freeze, them this just happens to be my personal preference.  Now when I need to make pancakes, muffins or bread I don't have wait for my ingredient to over ripen.Those are a few ways I'm making my freezer work for me.  Please share the way you use your freezer to save time and money. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

Not mentioning any names, but the lady of house has eaten her share.   I was in the other room while they worked on putting a new shelf together for Megan's room.I enjoyed listening to them work on this. Megan tends to be a free spirit and likes to do things off the cuff.  Chuck would ask what was next and she would spout what she thought was next. I had to laugh as he said read the directions; what do they say is next? It's good for her to learn to follow instructions and not do things her way. The struggle is real with reigning in her free spirit without crushing it! The above picture of the tree was taken last Tuesday and the same tree below on Monday.

That was all before the time fell back! Daylight savings time is very hard for me.  When it is pitch black by 5:30, the skies are gray for days and I can't get outside I tend to go into a funk or get what I refer to as the blues.Some years are better than others.  I've already been giving myself the pep talk about how to prevent this. We've had quite a bit of gray, rainy days that prompted me to contemplate the coming winter. In the late afternoon, rain or shine, I've been stepping on the back porch to enjoy a cup of tea.The few minutes alone to breath in some fresh air helps.  I know there will come a time when I won't be able to do that due to the cold temperatures.  In the meantime I will continue to soak up as much outside time as I can.When the snow flies and it gets cold I tend to hibernate.  Probably not the best thing for me.  I'm going to try to go outside every day.  A walk up the street, tea on the back porch and when the weather doesn't permit it I'll go out the door to breath in some fresh air for a minute or two.I will also leave home more often.  A quick trip into the grocery to get out and walk around, a trip to the library or even a short drive should help.Then there is the obvious such as exercise, eating well, and spending time in the Word.I'm also making a list of things to keep me busy.  The big item on my list is to sort and organize photos.  Since Chucks' parents are divorced neither one of them want the pictures from their 17 year marriage.  That means that Chuck has been given all of those photos.  They've been stored in the garage, under our bed and most recently in a chest.  I've decided it's time to store them properly.  Those months stuck inside seem like the perfect time.I'm hopeful that by being proactive, having a positive attitude and keeping busy I can prevent the winter funk.  I'm also praying for sunshine. Lots and lots of sunshine.  I'm a sunshine girl and even when it is cold and snowy the sun helps.Please share what you do to prevent the winter blues.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "The Year of Three", "date": "Friday, November 03, 2017", "text": "I have been deep in thought about many things for the last six months or so. Many things in life are complicated because they are things you have no control over.  I've been thinking about the things I can control and how to make them less complicated.This time of year where Christmas starts to creep into every ones mind. How can it not when you see countdowns on Facebook, Christmas decor and music in the stores. (I won't even go there!)  It seems to be one of those seasons where things can get very complicated. I often ask myself why we have let this happen.  A season that should be filled with hope is many times overshadowed by stress.sourceI'll be the first to admit that I have over complicated the season many times. How?  One is over planning.  We'll say yes to more things then we should.  I have been working on this for several years and pretty much have it under control. Another is trying to over achieve. I will do this in the giving of homemade treats.  I have simplified this to baking cookies with our extended family for our traditional cookie day and then only making two treats in my kitchen.  Besides cookies the favorites have become caramel corn and caramels.  I only make the caramels once a year and the caramel corn usually only one other time besides Christmas.  Not only has this taken away the pressure to be in the kitchen forever it has formed a lasting Christmas tradition around these three treat making days.Finally is gifts.  That is another area that can get out of control and cause stress.  Sure I love to give and would enjoy giving to everyone.  Honestly, our budget can't support that.  We generally buy a gift for the nieces and nephew on Chucks' side and they buy for Megan. I am putting a stop to that this year.  Number one is that they all receive more then enough gifts from the grandparents.  Number two is the cost factor.  Both of hubbys step-brothers have broken marriages this year.  That has put a financial burden on them.  There is no reason for them to buy gifts for Megan when they could use the money for day to day expenses.  Honestly, it would lessen our burden to not buy for them also.  I really hope that doesn't sound unkind.As far as gifts within our household we have decided to limit it to three gifts a person and three stocking stuffer's.  We started doing Santa many years ago and so far Megan hasn't lost interest in that.  Santa is also putting a stop to over spending and over indulging.  He will only leave two gifts under the tree for Megan.SourceI love, love Christmas and I really hope I haven't come off as a scrooge. *smile* I've felt for several years now that we had lost what Christmas was suppose to be and feel like.  I am hopeful that these changes add less stress to the season and bring the joy back into Christmas.I'd love to hear what you are doing to simplify your busyness and gift giving.  How are you are making Christmas less commerical and more Christ honoring?***BTW... this is the only post I'll have about Christmas until after Thanksgiving. ***"},

It was the first time I had done a swap in a long time. Fun! I received this from Chrissy.This is what I sent to my swap partner. We have had a ton of rain which has caused the mushrooms to pop up. On the nicer days we have been wrapping things up outside.  Megan decided her favorite friends needed to hang out for some fresh air.Chuck spent a day burning the brush from a tree that was cut down.Megan had fun playing with the crickets that came running when the brush was stirred.It was finally cool enough to enjoy one of my favorite soups.

The thought of going to the pumpkin patch to purchase a pumpkin was overwhelming at this time.  The pumpkin was purchased from the grocer. I wanted to make cookies, again no time, so they came from a local bakery. You know what; it's perfectly fine. It meet our need and it didn't add extra stress.  Sometimes you have to roll with what life is throwing at you.One evening Megan and I were out and about running a couple of errands.  I asked her what she was carving into her pumpkin and she said \"Daddy and I are going to try shading.  You know, where you don't carve the whole pumpkin away.\"   This picture cracked me up. Just like her mama with capturing life's moments on the camera! *smile* Once the messy insides were cleaned out it was time to move inside where it was warmer.  An inexpensive set of wood carving tools was used to help with the shading. They worked well! A Pac Man original by Megan.  The bakery cookies were plain so they were spruced up by adding a face using some gel icing.  Then it was time to settle down for the evening.  The cookies were munched on while a little Charlie Brown was viewed. It might not have been a Pinterest worthy evening, but we made memories. Honestly, this is real life and most of the time life isn't perfect. *smile* Laughs were shared, a new skill was mastered and memories were made. That, my friends, is what counts!  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

When our hope lies in Christ, and not man, it's certainly easier to keep moving forward step by step.  As I see more and more things that grieve me I will go on with my day to day while I pray for Las Vegas, our country and the world.  ***************************************************I had some less than stellar apples that I need to use.  I had some other things to do and couldn't babysit anything on the stove I decided to make cinnamon applesauce using the crock pot. I first peeled and cored the apples.  I threw the peels away but you could save them to make jelly. Here is the how to.  They were then quartered and tossed with 1 tbs lemon juice. I then placed them into the crock pot and add 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Stir to coat and then add 1/2 water. Cook on high for 4 hours. We like chunky applesauce so I used a potato masher to mush up the apples to the chunky consistency we prefer.This make my home smell wonderful and taste yummy too!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

She did a great job. For disclosure she helps with clean up, but hasn't taken on the task alone again. Helping Daddy to keep the van in working order. We traveled 80 miles south to attend a funeral for my aunt. Seeing Amish in this community is common.  When we turned into town we passed this man selling his produce.   I love country setting and small town feel of this place.  I can imagine myself living here. Friday evening it poured! After the hot and humid weather we've been having it was nice to sit on the back porch and watch it fall. My girl has been creating. She made a popsicle house complete with a table and a bed with a pillow and blanket. If you like down home food then this book is for you. I checked it out from the library.  It contains recipes and tips from the Farmer's Wife magazine.  The magazine was published from 1897 - 1939.  Not only am I enjoying the receipes but also the tips for the times. Fun book!The new frig. If you are wondering if the freezer portion is small, yes, yes it is. I was surprised by how small the freezers were on the new models.

{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #13", "date": "Tuesday, September 26, 2017", "text": "You know how things can have a domino effect? Well, that's what has been going on in my kitchen.  This year first we had to replace the dishwasher, then the stove, and now sadly the refrigerator. It was scheduled to be delivered on a Saturday. Before it arrived I wanted to move out our barely working unit and sweep and mop.  The plan was to this on Friday. Before I pulled it out I decided to give the entire kitchen a scrub from top to bottom.The first thing that was done is to take down all of the decor and wash/wipe it down.  While the decor was down the cabinet tops were washed.  I put everything back together and it felt super nice to have a squeaky clean kitchen.I stood back to take a look and knew there was one more thing that had to be done.  You see sixteen years ago when we bought appliances I picked out bisque.  That option is only available today by special order. When we replaced the dishwasher we made the decision to go with white. Reason one is that Chuck doesn't like stainless steel and reason number two is we were afraid that if we special ordered bisque for the dishwasher it might not be available when the other appliances needed replaced. Ha! Little did we know they would all need replaced this year. Anyway, I had painted the cabinets an off white to match the appliances and guess what? Ding! Ding! if you said the cabinets now clash with the appliances.The next thing to tackle was to paint the cabinets. Honestly, I was dreading this project. Dread or not, it had to be done. I finally stopped procrastinating and rolled up my sleeves.  The faux bead board had been dinged up on a couple of the cabinets so it was replaced. Then the real run began.  I'm soooo happy that I finally tackled this project. All that is left to do is to put the drawers back. That will a project for this evening.  Everything is crisp and clean. Even the inside of the cabinets. You see while the door were off I wiped out the insides and decluttered a couple of things.  The only thing that clashes now is the microwave. It's on its last leg also. It has a short in the start button. Chuck has fixed it several times and said he can't repair it again. We have to hit the start button just right to make it run. At least it works! I am inspired move onto another room to deep clean.

Although I'm not ready to say goodbye to warm days, I am ready to say goodbye to the 90's! Would you like to take a peek at my fall touches?  I also have seasonal wreaths on the front and back door plus I have brought out a harvest scented candle.

Once up and dressed we made breakfast. Once breakfast was complete I pulled out meat for dinner while Megan loaded the dishwasher. I threw in a load of laundry and then it was time for school. Megan rang the school bell about nine. In between helping Megan I worked on the laundry. We ventured out for lunch. Kids eat free! After lunch we went to my parents. Megan rode her scooter while I enjoyed some peace and quiet. On my way home I ran an errand to pick up some binders. While there some items were picked up for the church hurricane donation box. It was back to the books when we returned home.  School was complete at 2:30 and it was time for dinner prep. While I was peeling potatoes Megan asked to do it. It didn't last long as she isn't quite ready for this task. While dinner was cooking I worked on putting the daily school work away and pulling out things for the next day. Megan spent the rest of the afternoon creating in her room. Dinner is done! Well, the pie filling anyway. I'll roll the crust out and put the pot pie in the oven before Chuck comes home. Chuck is home at five and dinner is on the table. After dinner Megan goes out to play and Chuck and I sit on the back porch. We head inside a little before seven. Wheel of Fortune is viewed and then we have devotions. Before Megan is off to bed she lights a crayon. It really works! Megan goes to her room at eight. Chuck and I watch some television. A little before nine I step outside for some fresh air. Chuck joins me and then I announce I'm heading for bed. He agrees that is a good idea.

While Megan is writing a story for her creative writing lesson I pull down a box of fabric. When our lessons are complete I suggest she pick out a piece of fabric for the tea. She thought that was great! After lunch she washed the tea set and then sets the table. It's tea time!(Sorry for the picture quality. I needed more light, but that would have taken away from our candlelit tea party.) It was a sweet time with special memories to store away.

I pulled out the white board the next day and we went over the things she missed and did some additional practice.  She thanked me for stopping and explaining it again. She said that if she were in tradition school and she didn't get something they moved on to the next lesson and no one would have explained it further. That is one of the reason we wanted to homeschool.  Many times I felt they were moving forward before she was ready.   I keep getting affirmation , after affirmation that we made the correct decision to bring her home. I'm sorry we didn't do it sooner! Trying to teach herself a new skill. I'm not sure the knitting lessons are going well as I keep hearing her say \"slow down\" and \"noooo\" to the YouTube video.

She made sure she there was not one grain of sugar thrown away.It's during this time in the kitchen that Megan is learning valuable skills from her Grammi. While working mom opens up and talks about her time in the kitchen with her mom. I love hearing stores about her childhood and what life was like growing up on a farm.  She talks about all of the canning that was done by my grandmother. In those moments I learn more about my grandmother, mom and how things were in years past. From the stories I can visualize my grandmother in the kitchen making things to feed her growing family. The grape jelly made is a bonus. What it's really about is the memories shared and the memories made. I'll be back next week. Chuck's Friday off happens to fall on a holiday weekend which means we will have four glorious days together.

That is rare since Chuck is an early riser. I took advantage of the quiet to slip outside with my Bible and a cup of tea. It was only 58* when I stepped outside, so sipping some hot tea hit the spot. I spent some time with my Savior while watching the sun rise. A perfect start to what would be a perfect day!The night before we had to make a run to the hardware store. While there I picked up some fall pretties. While Chuck and I were weeding the flower beds Megan was romping around the yard.  When the weeding was done I started to plant. The petunias needed pulled as they were starting to fade. I traded them out for mums. I made a quick lunch of pizza roll ups. Easy, easy. Roll out refrigerated pizza dough and then add your toppings of choice. I used tomato sauce, sausage and pepperoni. Roll up and cut into slices, like you would cinnamon rolls. Bake in a greased muffin tin at 425* for about 10 minutes. A fun take on pizza. After lunch Megan helped Chuck with a project while I gave all of my flowers a good water. The impatiens in the window boxes on the front of my home are full and beautiful this year. It brings me joy to pull into the drive and see them. While Megan and Chuck finished their project I spent the remainder of the afternoon reading.

Always great advise but I can really see the wisdom in it as I have started to homeschool.  During week one the math lesson plan was set aside and I went with plan B. Why? My girl needs some review in one area. It's easy to want to stay focused and to stay on schedule. Sometimes holding those plans loosely is the best thing in all matters of life. Soon we we will pick back up with the planned math.Sleep is important! More important then a schedule. We had a late night and sleep in some. I should have let Megan sleep in more. We ended up with a few tears. (Hers not mine this time. *smile*) Only because my girl was tired. Lesson learned!!You have to stick with your own convictions. When speaking with those who don't get homeschooling or even those super homeschoolers it's best to give short answers, smile and agree to disagree. The plan for my family may not be what you'd do, but the beauty is we can each do what we think is best. This, this post right here really spoke to me. I've always felt tremendous pressure to be more, to do more and this post made me realize that the life I live is perfectly fine. It made me cry and realize that maybe I am doing exactly what God always planned for me. I am having one of those moments where I am emotionally spent. The truck is broken, the lawn tractor died and I am having a health issue (nothing life threatening). I keep giving myself the pep talk to be grateful we have the van for Chuck to drive to work, be grateful that we have a push mower for the lawn and to be grateful that my health isn't worse. We tried to buy a new lawn tractor. Inventory is low so it isn't a good time. Let's just say it was a disaster. I returned it yesterday and almost cried when leaving Home Depot.  My guy came home I fell into his arms and all was right with me again. Life can be hard.  Honestly we were never promised easy, but I know it will all work out.  I have been praying for God to help me to trust and have faith.I have joined instagram; wendib_well  My account is private so you'll have to send me a request to follow along. We have a jammed packed weekend planned. Friday we are going to the fair, Saturday we have people coming over to help cut down a tree and Sunday is our day of rest. After school I have to whip my home into shape and then do some grocery shopping for lunch on Saturday. You can't expect six men to work without feeding them. *smile* See you next week!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

She wasn't sure if she had an uneasy feeling due to the rain or because she felt like a fool for her behavior over thinking George broke an engagement to marry her. My, she had some things to learn!After breakfast George and Maggie took turns reading scripture.  Despite the rain the heat and muggy feel of the air had departed. There was actually a pleasant breeze coming through the windows. Maggie was glad there was something to be grateful for with the continued rainfall.The morning passed quickly.  It was comfortable sitting together and talking. The uneasiness Maggie felt upon waking seemed to dissipate. There was a new depth to their relationship since they cleared the air about Vivian.  Harry had been a subject discussed several times and George felt good to speak freely and fondly of his long ago friend.  There was even laughter over some of their boyhood antics.  He had come to the conclusion that calling Vivian ,Viv did add some intimacy and he would no longer call her Viv. He would not let the sorrow over losing Harry allow for behavior that was out of line for their now adult stature. He hated that Maggie had been hurt in the misunderstanding but he was glad that it opened his eyes to his short coming in the situation.After a simple Sunday dinner of ham steaks, green beans with potatoes and cornbread George asked Maggie to join him on a walk. \"With the break in the clouds and rain I wouldn't mind getting out.  Would you be interesed in a soggy walk over the hill to the pond?\" George asked. \"Sounds great!  I am starting to feel a bit of cabin fever only venturing as far as the porch.\" Maggie said as she smiled. \"Let me clean up dinner and I will be ready.\"\"I can't let you go stir crazy.  Let's get the dishes done and get out of here!\" George declared.It was a muddy, slick mess as they treked up the hill. When they reached the top and started down Maggies' footing slipped a little. George reached for her hand to steady her and didn't let it go as they continuted on.Betty and Jake must have had the same idea.  When Maggie steadied herself she heard Jake yell to them.\"Lookie what the cat drug out.\" Jake yelled in a kidding tone.It took a minute for them to respond as they needed to watch their step down the rest of the hill. Plus they were both struck silent by the size of the pond.\"I guess we all had the same idea. I don't remember the pond ever being so large. Do you, Jake?\" Betty asked.\"I don't recogin I do.\" Jake replied.  \"We had years with lots of rain just never this much at one time.\"They all started walking to the toward the narrow end of the pond so they wouldn't have to yell.  Betty took notice that George hadn't let go of Maggie's hand since she started to slip coming over the hill.  That made her happy.  Happy indeed.After a little bit of chit chat the men moved over to the edge of the Peterson cornfield. Maggie thought it looked more like a creek then a cornfield. Maggie and Betty hung back some. \"How worried is George?\" Betty asked.\"He isn't saying much but he keeps taking his coffee out to the porch. It seems he does more staring out at the horizon then drinking.\"\"Yes Ma'am, I've been seeing the same thing.  I think we might be in for a mightly long year. Looks like us girls will have to get creative making do. Jake and I have been through hard times but I don't think any have been as hard as what is coming. Jake said he thinks all of the crop will be lost.\" Betty shook her head as she continued  \"The only advise I will give you is to love your man, support your man, and make things as easy for him as possible. Most importantly pray and lean on the Lord.\"Maggie nodded.  She had been wondering about the crop. \"I know you said that you would be sharing the produce you put up.  If you can't spare them now I understand.\" Maggie softly said.\"Oh no! I wouldn't think of not sharing. I always put up enough for us, George and then some. As my Mother always said \"make hay while the sun shines.\" That is exactly what I do. I can until there is nothing let to can. You never know when that rainy day might come.\"Maggie could help but chuckle. \"I guess the rainy day has come!\" Betty laughed. \"I made a chocolate cake would you all like to come up for a slice?\"Maggie hoped so as she enjoyed chocolate cake. \"Let me check with George.\"\"Sounds great! Chocolate cake would be a good ending to the fine dinner I had.\" George said.Maggie blushed. It had been a quick, easy meal and nothing for George to go on about. She smiled as they started for the house.It didn't go unnoticed by Betty or Maggie that George slipped his hand into Maggies as they started off. \"Betty, this cake is delicious! Of course I am partial to chocolate.\" Maggie delared.\"Let me get you another slice.\"\"No, thank you, I couldn't.\" Maggie said shyly.\"Well, I don't know about you but I could use a little more. How about we split a slice.\" George said with a wink.The afternoon soon slipped into evening and Betty pulled the leftover ham out of the icebox and insisted everyone stay for sandwiches. She served a tangy potato salad beside it. \"George, have you been up the orchard recently.\" Betty inquired.\"No, I haven't. I imagine the McIntosh should be about ready.\" George replied.\"That's what I was thinking also. We'll have to make our way up there soon. Maggie and I will need to get busy and preserve all we can. Plus there might be some we could share or sell.\" Betty said. \"That's my girl, always thinking.\" Jake beamed.Maggie started to think of all the ways she could use apples. She hoped the harvest would be good. She had noticed George seemed to be partial to apple pie and it would be good to dry some for the winter.George came in from the porch as Maggie was wiping off the table. \"We should head over the hill soon. I want the light to be good so we don't fall.\"\"I'll be along shortly.\" Maggie replied.\"Let me send some cake and a few slices of ham for breakfast.\" Betty said as she pulled out a knife. \"I'll pack this up and send you on your way. The work is almost done in here and I can finish the rest.\"Maggie always enjoyed her time with the Petersons.  She felt refreshed as they climbed the hill. She was sliently giving praise when the skies open up and it once again began to pour.George and Maggie raced down the hill slipping and sliding.  They were sopping wet and both laughing by the time they reached the back porch.  Once they could stop giggling like school children George sent Maggie in for a warm bath while he went to do the barn chores. When she came out she found that George had changed into his bed clothes and was sitting in his chair in prayer.  Maggie quietly went to the kitchen to make some cocoa. George joined her as she was pouring it into cups. \"This is exactly what I needed.\" George said as he took a cup.\"Should you bathe to warm up?\"\"No need.  This will warm me up. Thank you.\"\"You're welcome. George, Betty said that Jake thinks all of the crop will be lost.\"With defeat in his voice George said, \"I pray he is wrong, but I believe he is correct. I'm afraid that before the fields will have a chance to dry the crop will mold and rot.\"Maggie reached over and placed her hand on top of Georges'.  \"There have been many times in my life that I have worried about tomorrow. More times then I would like to admit.  There is a verse that I turn to when I am uncertain of the future. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things.  Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. From Matthew. 6:34.\"George smiled at Maggie and reached over and put his other hand on top of hers. He knew with the Lord and Maggie he would be alright regarless of the harvest."},

Time keeps marching on, which I suppose is how it's meant to go.  The first of the month means that it is grocery day. I have been busy straightening the pantry, freezer and making my list. I plan to hit the stores first thing in the morning. I like to shop when it isn't busy. Megan received an invite to join her Papaw and a couple of cousins for the day. I dropped her off yesterday morning and headed back to a quiet home.  I took full advantage of the quiet. I needed to take care of some business. Making appointments and such. Then I knew with the change coming to our routine I needed some slooooow time. I made lunch and headed out to the back porch. I spent some time in prayer after lunch. I had a list of people I wanted to pray for.   I then made a list of words to describe how I want our little homeschool to feel. I prayed about our homeschool year and then spent some time in the Word. I read from one my favorite books, Proverbs.  The following verse spoke to me.That is exactly what I needed to hear. As we begin our new adventure to trust in Him, lean on Him, acknowlege Him and let Him direct our path. Yes!I have been busy planning for the coming school year. I purchased this cart to hold our daily items. It's been fun to get things organized!As with all things I've had a little anxiety about homeschooling. (Honestly, I have anxiety about everything! It's who I am. *wink*)   I prayed about it, talk to my biggest supporter, Chuck, and I feel at peace about things. We are ready to go!After a summer spent on the go I am ready to get back into a routine and spend more time at home. As you know, home is my happy place!Chuck surprised me by taking off work a couple of hours early. It was super nice to have some time with just the two of us. We went out for a little date.  He took me to the cutest cupcake shop! We shared a huge, delicious ebony and ivory cupcake. Yum!It was wonderful to sit with my guy and have a nice long, uninterrupted conversation.If you are looking for some encouragement as a homemaker I recommend you check out this blog When Queens Ride By. Be sure to start at the very beginning right here. I imagine many of you will recognize the first story as I have read it many times on different blogs and such. What I didn't know is that the story continued. I really enjoyed it and am sad that it looks like she is no longer writing. If you check it out let me know if you enjoyed it also.Grocery shopping awaits and then I have to get busy at home. We received a text on Sunday from a cousin. They are camping in Kentucky and will be coming through our area on Friday. They were looking for a place to pitch their tent on their way home back to Iowa. It will be great catching up with them!  As you know when company is coming you need to put a little spit and polish on things. *smile* I've enjoyed chatting, but now I must run.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #13", "date": "Monday, July 31, 2017", "text": "I woke up a little after 7. My guy was awake and we snuggle until 7:30. Yeah for Saturday mornings! Once up I headed to the kitchen.  I started to brown some sausage, got biscuits ready to go in the oven and set the table. When the sausage was ready I hit the shower. I then put the biscuits into the oven and started making gravy. After breakfast Chuck loads the dishwasher.Megan and I head out to start a load of laundry. Once laundry was in the works I went back in to help Chuck tidy the kitchen. A little after 9 beds were made and then I head outside to do some ironing. It was super peaceful. All I could hear was the rustle of the leaves, birds chirping and the wind chimes. I image my entire community needed this kind of morning after the last few days. On Thursday afternoon, less then a mile from my home, a police officer was shot and killed. It is really hard for us to wrap our heads around this. There was a traffic accident and when the officer tried to help the driver, who was in an overturned car, he fired on the officer. Although we are a suburb of a large city our area is quiet and these things just don't happen in my little area. My hearts breaks a little more each time I drive past the area. After ironing I switch laundry and start to weed. Oh my! All of my flowers beds are out of control. I hit this one first. Much, much better.It is now almost 11. I sit on the back porch and fold laundry while I watch Megan polish rocks. I put the laundry away and move on to another area to start weeding.  Megan comes and says she is hungry. I make her something quick to eat as it's almost 12:30. Chuck has been working on his own project while I have been working in the flower beds. He steps over and says he needs to make a trip out to the hardware store. The post he was intending to sand and repaint is rotten at the bottom and needs to be replaced. While Megan finishes lunch we get a few things ready to take with us. Our first stop is to recycle. We drop off the plastic and glass items. Then it's off to a local church to drop off our paper recycle. Chuck offers to buy me a sandwich.  My, what a big sandwich it is! I actually had two and they were plenty. A quick trip into the hardware store and then we are back home by 1:30. I continue to weed and my little helper is by my side. Chuck realizes he needs another tool. He and Megan hop in the truck and head to my parents to borrow it. They come back with garden fresh goodies! I continue to work in my flower beds and finish at almost 5 o'clock. I then take over a task Chuck was working on so he can work on his project. We are trying to not buy a new bracket but in the end we have to. I couldn't get all of the black paint off around the wording.  It's now 6 and I head in to start dinner while Megan and Chuck go back to the hardware store to buy a new bracket. I made the sides and when Chuck returns he grills the chicken. It's almost 7 when we sit down for dinner. This is a very late meal for us. After dinner we complete Chuck's project. Instead of purchasing another wooden post he decided to use plastic. He said it could be painted black, like the previous post, but I opted to leave it white. I worried about how the paint would hold up. We need a cap for the post but the store we were at didn't have a plastic one available. That will be an easy add on later. I love to have Old Glory flying once again!Once this is done it's a little after 8. We all head in and get in our pajamas. We watch a little TV and then I go in to unload the dishwasher. I then set the table and pull out the waffle maker, mixing bowl and waffle mix. Sunday mornings run much smoother with a little planning. It's now 9:30 and I am the only one still up. Not for long though! I think we are all looking forward to a day of rest.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #12", "date": "Tuesday, July 25, 2017", "text": "Today will be another painting edition. *smile*  The outside of the door that leads into the garage received a fresh coat of paint.  I had previously used some leftover stain, Navajo Red, from our barn. I always hated it because it didn't clean well.It's the only door original our home. This 1953 door looks a ton better although it still a little rough in person. We'll say that it has character!Another door that needed some work is the door between the house and garage. In this picture you get a glimpse of the door frame. Once upon a time there was a retractable screen door here and when it was removed it pulled off the paint. The door frame has been like this for more years then I care to admit.The door had seen better days. The paint was peeling when we moved in 16 years ago. At the time there were more pressing things to tackle. That meant this door was lightly scraped and a new coat of paint was applied. I'm sure you can imagine how well that made the door look. I thought I had taken a before picture of the door but apparently I didn't. There isn't one to be found. Sigh. Paint remover was applied and we were on our way. It was interesting to see the paint through the years. It started out as yellow on the side in the house and teal on the garage side. That would have been the original 1950's color. Then it went to a horrible green for the 60's. The 70's brought in a brown color and then it was painted off white and then eventually white.After the paint layers were removed, it was sanded, primed and a fresh coat of white paint was applied. Once the door was finished Chuck installed some trim around the door frame and then it was chalked and given a coat of paint.Ah... much better... but...it's missing something.I wanted the door to look pretty even if it is only seen by us and close family members. Let's face it you should be keeping home to make it a haven for you and your family and not for those who occasionally visit. I used the cherry fabric leftover from the laundry makeover to make the wreath. I cut the fabric into 1x5 strips and tied them onto wire wreath form in my craft stash. It was part of an old wreath that had seen better day.  This rag wreath was basically completed for no cost since I used items that were leftovers. Easy and you can find a ton of how tos on Pinterest. What projects have you tackled in the last week? Tune in next Tuesday to see what homemaking debt I tackle.   May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #12", "date": "Monday, July 24, 2017", "text": "Monday, July 11I awoke to a dark house and the sound of rain about 7:30.  It is one of those days when it's hard to climb out of bed. I finally pulled myself out at 7:45.  I had my quiet time and then looked at blogs. By now a wave of thunderstorms is rolling through. I regret not getting into the shower as soon as I got up. My mom calls and while we are chit chatting Megan comes out. There is a break in the storms so I hit the shower and send Megan to get dressed.  It is now after 9 and Megan asked if she can make pancakes. She did well... yum! After breakfast I start laundry and Megan goes to tidy her room.I spend some time in the kitchen putting together a lasagna for dinner. When I am finished I clean the kitchen.  I pop out to change the load of laundry and then return to mop the floor. After that it is break time for me. I head out to back porch and watch the rain fall. When I come back in Megan ask for permission to pull out some craft items. My silly girl showing off her pipe cleaner glasses. While Megan is busy creating I dust the living room. It is now well after 12 and it is time for some lunch.  Leftover chicken and cottage cheese is filling. The weather alerts are going off again saying a severe thunderstorm is coming. I turn on the TV to see the radar and fold laundry.  When I am finished Megan puts her things away and I put the rest away. As the storm rolls through Megan and I snuggle on the couch and play tap black. Fun! I end up watching a show at 2.  By the time it is over the weather has cleared and I sent Megan to take a shower.  While she is in there I update the checkbook, enter some things into our Everyday budget and text with Chuck. After her shower Megan watches a cartoon and I look at a magazine until it is time to start dinner. Chuck walks in the door at 5 and I pulled dinner out of the oven 10 minutes later.  When dinner is cleaned up Chuck and Megan spend some time together while I sit outside and work on lesson plans. I come inside around 7.  We have family devotions, Megan has a snack and then goes to her room for some quiet time at 8. When she goes to her room Chuck turns on a movie. A cowboy movie with Tom Sellick should be good. We put Megan to bed at 9 and then continue our movie. Before 10 we are snug as a bug in bed.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

There is lots happening around here. My dad had hip replacement surgery on Wednesday. He is doing well and should be released from the hospital tomorrow. All of us will be relieved when he is home.Funny conversation with Megan about Grandpa having surgery.Me:  Grandpa will be a new man.Megan: I don't want Grandpa to be a new man I like the old Grandpa.Guess I phrased that wrong. Corrected myself to explain he would be walking like a new man. Good to know she likes Grandpa the way he is. :) I am also knee deep making lesson plans. The plan is have the first nine weeks complete by our start date. It looks like it will be August 7th. Besides planning school we have been on the go squeezing in as much summer fun as we can. Traditional school starts in two weeks so that means we have one week to make summer memories with my nieces. The week before school they generally like to stay home and relax.

{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #11", "date": "Tuesday, July 11, 2017", "text": "I was half way through my project when I realized I hadn't taken one picture... opps! The first picture is a small glimpse of the door I took when I updated the decor in the laundry area. The laundry is in the garage and at the end of the laundry area is a door that leads out to the back porch. It is the original 1953 door so it's rough. It also never had trim so when the laundry area was updated Chuck put trim around the door. It has sat in it's sad state of unfinished wood trim since September and the door hadn't had a fresh coat of paint since we moved in 16 years ago!I washed the door and then gave the door jam, trim and backside of the door two coats of fresh white paint. Once the paint was dry a new blind was added and then I whipped up a valance using the same fabric that I used to hide a storage shelf and for the sink skirt. It is amazing what a little bit of elbow grease and fresh coat of paint and do to improve the look of something. Even an old beat up door from 1953! I also gave the window sills and trim a fresh coat of paint before new blinds were added.While the paint brush was out the door for the attic stairs was painted. It was one of those things we didn't think about painting when the new steps were installed.Nothing glamorous but it does feel good to mark these things off of the list.

There are times that staycations are the best! One of the things on our list was to have an evening fire. Between rain and some hot nights we were finally able to have our fire Saturday night. It was a wonderful night for it. The humidity was non existent and the temperatures were mild. It actually felt a little cool later in the evening. While Chuck got the fire going I watched Megan chase the first fireflies of the night. When the fire was nice and hot we roasted some hot dogs to pass the time of dark fell. A hot dog over an open fire is best way to eat them! We waited patiently for dark before the marshmallows were brought out. My favorite smores is to use chocolate chip cookies in place of the graham cracker.

{"title": "Joy in the Everyday Chapter 7", "date": "Thursday, July 06, 2017", "text": "Chapter 1       Chapter 5Chapter 2       Chapter 6Chapter 3Chapter 4Chapter 7Maggie woke up to the sound of rain and the smell of coffee.  Waking to the smell of coffee normally made her smile, this morning it caused her stomach to turn. She reminded herself that she could do all things through Christ before she threw back the covers and dressed for the day.When she entered the kitchen George was leaning against the counter sipping coffee.  As he gazed out the window it was apparent he was deep in thought. Maggie had noticed that when he was deep in thought he bit his bottom lip.\"Good mornin' Maggie.  Are you feeling better this morning?\" George said as he smiled her way.\"Not one hundred percent, but better. Thank you for asking.\" Maggie said as she pull out eggs and milk and sat them on the table. George looked at Maggie until she lowered her eyes.  \"I will head out for chores.  Not much is on my schedule with the rain.  Please let me know if I can do anything to help you today.\" George sat his cup on the counter as he headed out the door.Maggie gave a sigh of relief when George went out the door. Regardless of the circumstances she was George's wife.  He had been nothing but kind and thoughtful to her.  She needed to pull herself together. She took a deep breath and then mixed up pancake batter. The days seemed to blend together with the continued rainfall.  It seemed fitting that the gray weather matched Maggies' mood.George noticed that although Maggie went through the motions she was off. Funny how after only a few days as man and wife he missed her carefree spirit and quick smile.  He was beginning to worry. Not only about Maggie's health but he was also concerned for the yearly crop.Thursday evening Jake came bouncing down the lane.  It was a sight watching him dodge left then right to miss the ruts brought on by the rain. Even with her mood Maggie couldn't help but smile at the site.\"Howdy! Thought I'd pop in on my way home to see if you'd built an Ark yet?\" Jake smiled as he spoke.\"Not yet, but it looks like I might need to start\"  George replied as Maggie handed Jake coffee.\"What brings you out a night like this.\"\"I tried to make it to the church for the elders meeting.  I figured it would be cancelled and I was right.  The creek is well over the bridge.  Thought I'd stop in to spread the word.  No need in even trying for church Sunday if this keeps up.\"\"I figured as much.  Four days of hard, steady rain is going to cause a heap of problems.\"  George said somberly.\"Amen.\" Jake softly said \"Looks like the crop might mold and rot before it's dry enough to get in the field.\"This was a side of Jake she had never seen.  He gave his head a good shake and then turned to Maggie. \"Would you like the coffee cake Betty made.\"  She made an extra one for us and I don't reckon she'd be happy to see me eat two.\" Jake said as he laughed and patted his stomach.\"That would be nice. Refill?\"\"No, I'd better get home while the gettin' is good.  If this keeps up much longer it looks like we'll all be home bound for a bit.\"\"Thank Betty for the coffee cake.\"  Maggie said as she took it and Jake's coffee cup and headed inside.George and Jake chatted for a bit before she heard the truck head down the lane.George stood looking at the field until Maggie came out with a slice of coffee cake.\"Thank you. We couldn't have finer neighbors.\"Maggie whole heartily agreed. \"I enjoy their company.\"\"No coffee cake for you?\" George asked between bites.\"Not tonight.\"George stopped eating and looked at Maggie.  She was pale and dark circles had developed under her eyes.  He was concerned.\"When the water recedes maybe doc should come out.\"Maggie shook her head. \"Oh no! There is no need for that.  I'll wash up the dishes and head for bed.  I must need more rest.\"Maggie hurried to the sink while George stayed in the rocker.\"Lord, I'm concerned for many things at the moment.  My biggest concern is for my wife.  I'm not sure what ails her Lord.  Please help Maggie to feel better and give me peace in all circumstances.  Amen.\"As George said Amen he heard a sob through the kitchen window.George stepped next to Maggie and picked up a towel to dry the cups and dessert plate.  He could see Maggie discreetly wipe her eyes and work for composure. He put the last cup in the cabinet as Maggie dried out the sink.  He gently took her by the elbow and led her to the sofa.\"Maggie, I know something is not right with you.  If you need the doctor I will find a way to get him here. Please tell where you hurt, Maggie, so I can help you.\" George pleaded.Maggie turned her head and George gently turned it back.  Tears were flowing down Maggie's face.\"Maggie, please.\"\"It hurts here.\" Maggie said as she placed her hand over her heart.  George looked both confused and alarmed. \"Oh, George, how could you marry me when you were promised to another.\" Maggie chocked out.\"What?\" George said in disbelief.  Then the vision of Vivian speaking with Maggie came to mind.  If Maggie wasn't upset George might laugh at how absurd it all was.\"I think there has been a misunderstanding.  I have never been engaged to anyone but you.\"\"But Vivian.\" Maggie began.\"I have no idea what Vivian said.  What I do know is that I've never been involved with Vivian.\" George said firm but kind.\"She is so familiar with you.  She calls you Georgie and you call her Viv.\" Maggie said with sorrow.Now George laughed as Maggie frowned.  \"As a boy everyone called me George.  My own mother even stopped calling me by my boyhood name when I was ten.  Well, everyone except Vivian.\" George went on.  \"You see the Hughes had a son, Harry.  Harry and I were good friends.  I started calling Vivian Viv as a boy because it made her mad.  That's what a guy does to her friends little sister.\"  George paused and had a far off look for a moment.\"When Harry and I were about fifteen we started to drift apart.  I was busy on the farm and he wanted no part of working with me.  The Hughes didn't do dirty farm work.  Mrs. Hughes told Harry they were better then that.  He got mixed up with a crowd of older boys from the town north of here.  One night they were out drinking when Harry was thrown from the back of a wagon.  He hit his head on a tree and was instantly killed.\"\"I'm sorry George.\"  Maggie whispered as she reached for his hand.\"I think I'm a connection for Vivian to her brother.  As she got older she started to pay extra attention to serving me first at church pot lucks and then showed up here with baked goods.  I've tried ignoring her gestures and even came right out and told her I wasn't interested in her that way.  She laughed and well, continued to act like she always has.  I've learned to ignore her and accept that she is pushy and overbearing.  I'm sorry that I never thought of how she would treat you.\"\"I'm the one that is sorry.  I should have said something to you instead of letting it tear me up.  You see, my uncle, wasn't a man of integrity and I let my experience with him cloud my thoughts of you.  You have been nothing but kind and honorable since your first letter. I'm sorry for my lack of trust and unwillingness to speak with you.\" Maggie said with regret.\"I guess we both have plenty to learn about communication in marriage. How about we read scripture, pray together and remember that tomorrow is a new day.\"\"Sounds great.\" Maggie said as she stood to get the Bible for George."},

I couldn't get my act together and we decided it wasn't worth getting stressed out in order to make the start time. Instead I packed a picnic and we headed to the park. There was a beautiful trail for us to explore. It didn't last long as the mosquitoes were horrible!The next item on our list was to spend time with family. Chuck took the long way to my parents. I don't think the corn is knee high by 4th of July! It's been strange weather wise and this field tells the tale. The afternoon was spent floating away while listening to a patriotic mix of music. Super relaxing!It wouldn't be the 4th if you didn't grill out. After our dinner of hamburger and hot dogs it was time to do some fireworks. Pop its with some cousins are always fun.Sparklers are a must!The grand finale of day is the big booms in the sky. I love the ones that look like star dust floating to the ground. We had a great day celebrating this land that we love. Happy Independence Day!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

It involved a visit from a tech, a visit to the service center and in the end a change of providers. The good news is that we are back in business!*************************************************Saturday, July 1st Megan celebrated her 11th birthday. We have tried hard to raise her to experience life and enjoy the simple pleasures instead of having a desire for material possessions. When we asked what her birthday wish was she said to take a train ride. I made arrangements for us to ride the rails!We arrived at the station to get our tickets. There was time to kill so we went to check out the cute little town. They happened to be having their farmers market so we browsed, listed to music and enjoyed the sights. We were able to enjoy all of this with Grandma and Grandpa. (Chuck's mom and step dad.)Here it comes!There was an opportunity to visit the engine.All aboard! We are excited to begin our trip in a restored 1923 rail car.  We had great scenery along the way. The Whitewater River ran beside the tracks. Along the way we saw wooded areas, farms, old farm housespassed country roads, and saw field after field of corn. Megan thoroughly enjoyed pointing out the sights to us. She even saw her first bald eagle! Sadly I missed it. We had a really run conductor. He had the passengers sing Happy Birthday to Megan. She was less then thrilled to have the spotlight on herself. We arrived at our destination and had a couple of hours to explore. We were able to explore the canal lock, see the old grist mill. There were cute shops to visit and in no time it was time to head back. The ride back took about a hour and fifteen minutes. It was nice to rest and enjoy the view and breeze after exploring town. Good bye until next time! Happy Birthday, Megan! It's my pleasure to watch you grow into a beautiful young lady. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

{"title": "A Day in My Life #11", "date": "Monday, June 19, 2017", "text": "Monday, June 12th Summer means no alarm clock.  This morning I was up at 7:30.  I started the day in the Word. I then got on the computer to check e-mail and surf some blogs. I spend about forty-five minutes doing this. Megan wakes up while I am on the computer and I send her to get dressed while I shower. After my shower I sort laundry and get a load started.  We eat a simple breakfast of cereal.I then set Megan up with her task for the day. She loves to putter in the garage and Daddy said she needed to clean her stuff off of the workbench and put her little storage cart away. (Which is an old microwave cart.)I left Megan to complete her task and headed out the cut grass about 9:15.I finish close to 10:45 and hang out a load of laundry and start another. I take care of e-mailing a company about a defective handbag I recently purchased and chat with mom for a few.  I hang out the second load of laundry on the line and start the third and final load. Megan and I head out to get some lunch and then go shopping for some additional shorts for Megan. I am home at 2:30. I watch thirty minutes of TV and then tackle the laundry. I start by folding the items I had to dry since I ran out of room on the clothesline.  I then head out to take things off the line. It is super hot outside! This is in the shade....and this in the sun. Wow! Sure glad I cut grass early so my guy won't have to do it in the heat. Once inside Megan and I put the laundry away and then she sits down at the table to create. It's about 4 and I clean my new stove top with a special cleaner they provided to use before use. I then sit down and drink a big glass of ice water before I start dinner. I fire up the grill at 4:45 and throw on some burgers. Since it's so hot I decide to have no cook sides.Chuck comes home a little before five and once he changes he finishes up the grilling.  We sit down to eat about 5:10.  We all pitched in to tidy the kitchen. It's spic and span by 6.We head to the garage. Chuck helps Megan on a project and I folded the load of whites. Megan and my dad have a thing where they will call each other and say \"ice cream, ice cream\" which results in a trip to the ice cream shop. My dad called tonight and my parents came over to pick us up. Tonight she shared a banana split with my parents. We were home about 7:30 and needed to water. I took care of the flowers while Chuck turned on the sprinkler for the garden. We came inside at 8 and had devotions and then watched some TV. Megan went to her room at 8:30 and Chuck went out to turn off the sprinkler. Once inside we settle in to watch some recordings of the show Ransom. It was lights out for Megan at 9 and Chuck and I headed for bed after the 10 o'clock news.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Joy in the Everyday Chapter 6", "date": "Friday, June 16, 2017", "text": "Chapter 6When Maggie woke Sunday morning she didn’t smell coffee. Ittook her a minute to clear her head and she realized that George was stilllying next to her. She turned slightly to get a look at the clock that sat onthe table next to where George slept.  “What time is it Maggie?” George asked in a sleep filled voice.“Oh goodness, it is 7:30! What time is church?” Maggie askedwith a slight hint of alarm.  Rushingaround on her first morning of service wasn’t what Maggie had imagined. “We had better get at it. Service begins at 9 so we shouldleave about 8:40. I’ll take care of the chores while you dress and getbreakfast ready.”  George casuallyslipped on his overalls and headed out like he had all the time in the world.He turned back when he reached the door.  “There is a standing invitation for dinner atthe Peterson’s on Sunday. If you don’t mind I would like to keep up thattradition.” “Betty did mention that you usually take your Sunday dinnerwith them. I think that sounds fine.” Maggie felt some pressure subside as shewould not have to rush to have dinner ready after service. She hurried down thehall to start the coffee. She grabbed the oatmeal from the pantry and measuredit into a pan. She pulled the eggs out of the icebox and sat a skillet on thestove top. She then went to wash and dress. Maggie was thankful she had takenthe time to do the wash on Friday. She slipped into her brown skirt and whiteshirt. As she stepped out of the room she pulled her apron on and grabbed herstraw hat.George must have been feeling the rush also.  It usually took him forty-five minutes to dothe morning chores. It was a few minutes before 8 when she heard the click ofthe door. “I’ll take a quick bath and should be ready to eat in 10 minutes.”George said as he walked through the kitchen and down the hall.Maggie smiled. He usually took fifteen minutes in theevening so he was feeling the need to rush also. The oatmeal was keeping warmand Maggie had just finished frying the eggs when George entered. He sat hissuit coat over the back of a kitchen chair, laid their Bibles next to Maggie’shat then slid into his seat. Maggie sat the platter of eggs on the table andmoved to the icebox to bring out the cream. That made her smile.  There has been cream available since Georgefound out that is how she preferred her coffee. The last dish was put away just in time to leave. George puton his suit jacket as Maggie went to check that her hat was situatedproperly.  Maggie was starting to feelthe butterflies. It might have been a good thing the morning was rushed as itkept the butterflies away until now. Maggie remembered Pastor Dan stated that the church was twomiles from the farm. She didn’t recall seeing it on the drive in. Notsurprising since it was dark and she was exhausted. As George rounded a curvethey crossed a bridge and the church came into view.It wasn’t large. It was a white building with four long,narrow windows on each side, The front of building had threesteps leading up to the door. It looked to be double doors. Maggie wasn’t certainsince the door was propped open. Directly above the door was a steeple with apartially enclosed bell and a cross on the top. The church looked charming. There were several vehicles parked outside along with some horse and buggies in the bag. A few peoplewere standing around talking.  Word musthave already spread that George had a new wife since most of the people in thechurch yard turned to stare when George pulled in to park. Maggie silentlyprayed “Lord, please give me the strength to face this.” George stepped aroundto open her door as Betty and Jake parked next to them. “Lord, thank you forBetty.” Maggie said under her breath.“Good morning, sweet girl. George. It’s fine day to be here.Maggie has George introduced you yet?” George replied, “No ma’am. We arrived just before you did.”“I see, well, there is not time like the present. Shall wego in?”Jake and Betty headed in with George and Maggie following.Betty and Jake greeted each person as they walked toward the steps. Maggie couldfeel that George was as nervous as she was.“Morning, Amy and Andy, I would like you meet, Maggie, mywife.  Maggie this is Amy and Andy Moore.They live two mile up the road from us to the south.” Amy smiled and that relieved some of Maggie’s butterflies.“Pleased to meet you, Maggie, I look forward to getting to know you. These areour children Sam, Susie, David and this is Miranda, but we call herRandi.:”  Randi gave Maggie the widestsmile at the mention of her name. They made small talk until Maggie saw a young man remove therope tied next to the door and pull it to ring the bell three times. “We hadbest find our seat.” George said. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Kraft. I’ll be at Jake’sto discuss harvest on Friday. See you then George.” Andy tipped his hat as hetook his wife’s arm and escorted her into church. George did the same stoppingnow and then to introduce Maggie. All eyes were on George and Maggie as they made their way upthe isle. George whispered “up on the left, fourth pew back, next to Jake andBetty.” Maggie was grateful to slide into the pew. George satstiffly next to her and Maggie was relieved when Betty took her hand and leanedover to whisper, “Relax, you’re doing fine.”“Good Morning. It’s my honor to be here serving you thismorning. I’m grateful that the Lord saw fit to give us a nice breeze on thisfine, hot August morning.” Pastor Dan smiled.“Amen” was heard from many in the congregation. That causedmost people to wiggle a little in the pew and smile or chuckle softly. “I have a few announcements. There will a  meeting of theelders on Thursday at 7 p.m.  BettyPeterson will provide coffee cake for the meeting. Now, Jake, there will nosampling on the drive over.” Pastor Dan said with a smile. That brought a laugh while Jake looked hurt that he would beaccused of such a thing. “Congratulations are in order for George Kraft and his newbride, Maggie. They were married in a private ceremony on Wednesday. I’m surewe’ll all go out of our way to make Mrs. Kraft feel welcome. “ Pastor Danlooked at Maggie and smiled.“Now Tom, if you will please lead us in singing praisestating with hymn 256.” The singing started with Maggie’s favorite hymn, How Great Art Thou. As Maggie lifted hervoice she could feel all the tension of the morning release. It felt good to bein church. Actually sitting in church  by a man who truly believed and wasn’tthere to improve his social standing. George notice Maggie as soon as she began to sing. It wasn’ta surprise that she had a smooth, sweet soprano voice. He peeked out of thecorner of his eye and could see that she didn’t need the hymnal since wassinging with her eyes closed. There seemed to be a peace within her thatpleased George. He lifted his voice in praise with his church family, but allhe could hear was Maggie. Betty noticed also. She smiled as she saw Maggie relax andrejoice in song. When George joined in the sound of Maggie’s sweet voice andthe deep baritone of George gave Betty goose bumps. Yes, Betty thought, thesetwo are going to be good for each other in so many ways.The service passed quickly. Maggie enjoyed the sermon.Pastor Dan had a good mix of humor and seriousness. He spoke the truth withgentleness that left one wanting to hear more. She would enjoy her Sundaymorning services. The congregation stood as Pastor Dan said the closing prayer“and all God’s people say”“Amen” rang out from the congregation.  There was chatter all around. Many stopped to meet Maggieand congratulate George. Betty leaned toward Maggie “We are heading home so Ican get the meal done. No rush. You and George take as long as you need. Thereare plenty of people who want to meet you, sweet girl.” Betty winked as Jake ledthe way out.George and Maggie were almost to the truck when Tom calledfor George. “If you’ll excuse me Maggie I’ll be right back.” George said withan apologetic voice.“No need to hurry, George. I will wait for you by thetruck.”George turned to walk over to Tom. Tom tended to be a talkerand George hoped he wouldn’t leave Maggie alone for long.A lady stepped from the front of the truck and approachedMaggie. She was young, had blond hair cut into the new short bob style withbouncy curls. She was dressed in a pale yellow dress that drew the eye to herslender curves and made her blue eyes stand out. It was noticeable that shetook great pride in her appearance.“Well, well, I see that the rumors were true. I’m Vivian.”Maggie’s expression didn’t change like Vivian expected. It was like she had noidea who Vivian was. “Vivian Hughes.” Still no recognition. “I’m Maggie. Maggie Kraft, pleased to meet you, Vivian.”Maggie said with a genuine smile. Vivian’s eyes narrowed as she plastered on a smile. Maggiehad dealt with girls like Vivian all of her life. They had just met and Maggiehad no idea why Vivian would behave this way.  Vivian used her best syrupy voice as she spoke. “Imagine mysurprise when I returned home and found out that the man I was to marry had upand married someone else.”Maggie could feel her face pale much to Vivian’s delight. Ohno! How could George have married her when he was an engaged man! Vivian tookadvantage of Maggie’s discomfort to look her over from head to toe and back upagain. “The only thing that came to mind is that George had to marry you.”  George cringed when he saw Vivian walk up to Maggie.  As he watched her face go from ashen to brightred he knew he had to get over there. “Tom, I really to see to the wife.” “Sure, sure I remember what it’s like to be newly married.”Tom said as he slapped George on the back. He then turned and started to talkto the person closet to him.George walked up and took Maggie by the elbow. “Viv” Georgesaid with little emotion.“Hello Georgie.” Vivian cooed. “I have been getting to knowyour wife.” She said in a nasty tonewith the biggest smile plastered on her face. “Congratulations.” Vivian turnedand walked over to her Daddy’s car.  They rode to thePeterson’s in silence. Neither one said a word about Vivian. George opened thedoor for Maggie and she went straight to the back door.  “Betty it smells delicious. What can I do to help?” Maggiesaid without the normal smile in her voice. Everything is ready. While I slice the chicken you can dishup the sides. Maggie placed whipped potatoes, milk gravy, green beans and hotfrom the oven rolls on the table. Betty added sliced chicken and carrots thathad been roasted along side the chicken. On the table was a butter dish,pickled beets, and a pitcher of tea. Jake said grace and then the boys dug in. You would havethought Jake hadn’t eaten in days! He packed the food away. It was all wonderfulalthough Maggie didn’t eat much. There was no concern about her lack ofconversation since Jake and Betty were present. Even in her present mood Maggiecouldn’t help but be entertained by the chatter and Jake's hearty laugh. The dishes were done and Betty had packed up leftovers forMaggie to take home for supper. As the ladies went to the porch with apple pieBetty couldn’t keep quiet any longer.“Sweet girl I noticed that you didn’t eat much and seemawful quiet. Did you not enjoy the sermon?” Betty asked with concern.“Oh yes, I enjoyed it a great deal. It seems like a finechurch and the sermon was good. I had a headache come on after service.” Maggieleaned her head back against the chair back. “You should have said something. I will be right back withsome headache powder.”“There is no need. I am sure that a good night’s sleep willtake care of it.”“Nonsense” Betty said as she started to rise. “There is noneed for to suffer when it can be helped.” She was gone before Maggie could protest further.As Betty stepped back out on the porch the skies opened upand a gentle shower started to fall.“No wonder your head was a aching” Jake said. “Looks like youmight have your own weather alert there George.” Jake laughed as if he had saidthe funniest thing ever. Then Jake looked at George and became serious. “I do hopethis rain is short lived. Harvest is around the corner and we need them fielddry.\"George nodded as he was thinking the same thing.  He decided he should take Maggie home. Betty thought that was a good idea. “George, do you have anyof the Goody’s Headache Powder?”“I believe so.” George said with a nod. Betty wouldn’t let Maggie clean up dessert. “I won’t hear ofit.” Betty declared.“Honestly Betty I am fine to help.”“Sweet girl, I said sit right there and I mean it. I will beright back as soon as I gather up your supper food. George there is no reasonwhy you can’t make sandwiches out of the chicken I’m sending home. That andsome pickled beets should do you.“  Bettycontinued on as she headed to the kitchen. Once the door shut all that washeard was her muffled voice. Once home George insisted that he put the food away. Maggiedidn’t protest. She went to change and lie down for a little bit. George camein to change into his work clothes. It concerned him to see Maggie not feelingwell. It had come on fast and he hoped she was right that a good night’s sleepwould make her feel better."},

Happily accepted some free grocery coupons.Rain!You might wonder how rain is thrifty. Well. I use the rain water to water my flowers thus saving money since I don't have to pay for the water.Purchased a new stove. Not something we wanted to do. After a couple of repairs our 16 year old stove finally died. We'll save money now that we won't need to eat our meals out and over time it will pay for itself. Temperatures in the 90's called for the doors to remain closed. I hate it as I am a sun loving, natural light girl. You do what you must to keep the air conditioner from running additional cycles. Shopped the clearance rack for Megan. Using a percentage off coupon plus some store reward money I was able to purchase two skirts for $2.78.So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days.

{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #10", "date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2017", "text": "Welcome to the back porch edition. It was time to tackle a little cleaning. I pulled almost everything off. Things were sprayed and wiped down. Then it was time to put things back in place. I speak often about my back porch so I will give you a little tour. This is the area to the left of the door that leads to the kitchen. I sit in this spot in the late afternoon when I want some sun or in the evening when I need a more light for reading. A great place for a meal, games or to complete a craft. This is the area where the most time is spent. It is under the kitchen window and is completely covered. If I am not cooking, cleaning, gardening or working on a project this is my go to spot. The fan keeps the air moving so the bugs can't land and there is always a cooling breeze. :)These are the views I have while sitting under the window. This potting bench sits next to the rockers. It holds gardening tools, toys and such. This is the before picture. The faux tool box was made by Chuck as a Christmas gift for me one year. The intent was to use it as a flower box. I sat it here until I could get it painted and like how neat it made some odds and ends look by keeping them contained. As part of cleaning up the porch I finally tackled the tool box and gave it a coat of paint. I keep jars that I use as frost covers and don't have to worry about them being knocked off and broken.I'm happy to have gotten rid of the dirt, dust and the spiders with their nasty little webs. Shudder!The far end of the porch was left uncovered. When Megan was younger it was a great place for water play. These mini storage sheds hold outside toys, camping chairs and are used to store cushions and outside decor in the winter months. They were tackled also I was able to clear outgrown toys and items I used when I provided in home childcare. It feels wonderful to have tackled this space. I hope you enjoyed taking a peek at my favorite outdoor space. What projects have you tackled in the last week? May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Joy in the Everyday: Chapter 5", "date": "Friday, June 09, 2017", "text": "Chapter 1Chapter 2Chapter 3Chapter 4Chapter 5Maggie awoke to the smell ofcoffee. She couldn’t believe she had overslept again! She hurried to dress andafter a quick stop to the water closet she hurried down the hall. George wasleaning against the kitchen counter with a mug in hand watching the sunrise. Hewas quite striking! He had short dark hair with just a bit of wave to it. Hewas lean and the t-shirt he was wearing today allowed Maggie to see what thehard work of farming had done for his muscles. He was wearing overalls which accentuated his height. Maggie guessedthat he was close to six foot, but she with her short statue of five foot shewas never a good judge of height. Most everyone just seemed tall!“Good morning, George.  I am sorry to have overslept again. Onceagain you’ve had to make your own coffee.” Maggie sighed. “Good mornin’ to you Maggie. Idon’t recall us having a conversation about a set wake up time. I tend to be anearly riser and I have no issue with starting the coffee when I wake up. Iactually don’t mind if you sleep in a little. The quite gives me time to clearmy head and think about my plans for the day.”Maggie could feel the tensionleaving.  The last thing she wanted wasfor George to be upset and to tell her she was a disappointment. Being aconstant disappointment to someone was draining. George filled another mug and satit on the table along with his. He pulled the sugar bowl forward. “I noticedyesterday that you take sugar in your coffee. I missed how much, one teaspoonor two?”Maggie took a seat as she said one.“I also like a splash of cream.”“Really, I didn’t notice you useany yesterday.”“I didn’t see any in the icebox anddidn’t feel it was important to ask. I don’t care for milk in my coffee and Ican certainly do without cream.” Maggie smiled slightly.“I see no reason for you to gowithout. We’ll need to take a walk to the barn soon so I can introduce you toBetsy and Daisy Mae. They will provide you with all the cream you need. Iusually keep enough milk for my needs and sell the cream and extra milk. Onceyou get settled I will show you how to separate the milk and then you can keepall you need for the household. I need to be off for chores. I should be backin about thirty minutes.”“George, should I gather the eggs?”“I will take care of it. Once youget settled I will take you to the coop also. I have one mean rooster. I wouldlike to show you how to handle Ralph.”“I’ll have breakfast when youreturn.”George headed out the door andMaggie got busy. She set the oven, put some lard on to melt and then diced acouple potatoes. While the potatoes were cooking she mixed up some biscuitdough. She allowed it to sit for a few while she stirred the potatoes andcrumbled some sausage from yesterday to make gravy. Another quick stir of thepotatoes and she quickly rolled and cut the biscuits. Once they were into theoven she stirred the potatoes and added flour to finish the gravy. The biscuits and potatoes were inthe warming drawer. The gravy was on low keeping warm and the table was set.Maggie had made dishwater and was finishing some dishes when George entered.He sat the eggs on the counter andsmiled at the scene in his kitchen. This scene was an answer to his prayers.“I’ll wash and be back in a few minutes.”That gave Maggie time to dish everythingup and have it on the table when George came back. He took her hand and saidgrace. He was savoring this meal. It surebeat the bachelor meals he was use to preparing. The only exceptions to thosewere the meals he shared with the Petersons and the church potlucks.“Maggie this is superb. Thebiscuits are the best I have ever had. Light, fluffy and they remind me ofBetty’s, only better. Please don’t tell her I said so!”“Thank you. I spent many hours inthe kitchen learning from the family cook. I image that most biscuit recipes are similar. I appreciate thecompliment.” It was rare for someone to appreciate anything she did.  Maggie sent up praise that she had been sentto George. “Did Betty tell you that biscuitsand gravy is my favorite?” George said between mouthfuls. “No one shared that with me. Iguess I got lucky.” Maggie made a mental note to make this often.“I know I did.” George said with asmile. Maggie blushed.“I won’t be in for dinner today. Ihate to leave on your first full day alone but I told Jake last week I would beover to look over the harvest equipment. I’m sure he would understand if Ididn’t make it over today.”“There is no need for that. I got agood look at the garden yesterday and I thought I could spend some time outthere before it gets too hot.”“Oh, the garden” George said withreservation. “I’m not even sure why I planted one. I certainly don’t have timeto maintain it proper like. It seems to always be a weed patch. Not to worry,Betty always shares her bounty with me. Considering you weren’t here tomaintain a garden of your own what Betty doesn’t provide I will be sure topurchase for you.” George was embarrassed that the weed patch of a garden wouldbe her first task. He was also delighted to see that she wasn’t afraid of work. “No need to worry. I will clean itup the best I can and see what I am able to salvage. I’m sure next year thegarden will be more productive.”“I need to run. Jake is a man thatlikes to keep a schedule.” George reached for his hat as he headed for thedoor. “Again I apologize that you have to deal with the mess of the garden. Iwill try to return this afternoon, if not, I will see you for supper. Thanksfor the meal.”“Your welcome, George. Have a niceday and please don’t concern yourself about the garden.”Maggie read from Matthew while shefinished her coffee. When she was finished she gave thanks for the fresh startand for continued safety. She rose and set the mug into the soapy water.  Once the dishes were complete and the kitchenin order she went to make the bed. On her way out of the room she spied thelittle room with all of the cabinets. She couldn’t resist peeking inside.Imagine her surprise when she saw it was a pantry! There were barrels of flour,sugar, and home canned goods. Maggie smiled to think of all the things shecould do with this bounty.  She spiedsome canned ground beef and took that out to the kitchen. She had an idea for ameal that wouldn’t heat the kitchen up too much.She set the jar on the counter andslipped out the back door. She noticed that George had sat some bushel basketson the porch before he left. She silently thanked him for histhoughtfulness.  Once to the garden shesighed deeply wondering where to even begin.She decided to start at the endwith the tomato plants. They were scrawny things that looked half dead.Thankfully they were loaded with ripe tomatoes. She decided to pick them all,ready or not, as the vines wouldn’t last much longer.  To her surprise she ended up with threebushels of red tomatoes and almost a half bushel of green.  She had just pulled and piled up the last ofthe tomato vines when she thought she heard something.“My, my, aren’t you beingproductive this morning” Betty said with a smile in her voice. “Hello Betty. I didn’t hear you coming.”“I could tell. Busy at work, busyin thought.” “Yes, I was thinking of what I willdo with the tomatoes. I am thinking some for stew and maybe a batch of sauce. Idon’t think I will get much else from the garden.”“Not likely. I told George to stopplanting after his parents moved, but sometimes men are hardheaded! I alwaysput up enough for both of our homes. So don’t fret about this year as I willhave plenty to share.”“I appreciate that, Betty. Wouldyou mind helping me move the tomatoes to the shade of the porch?” Maggie saidas she used her apron to wipe her brow.“No, I don’t mind at all.  It looks like you could use a cold drink.”“I think you might be right. I’llbring out some tea once this is done and we can visit for a few minutes.”“Perfect.” Betty said as shereached for one side of the basket. “George told me you had planned towork in that so called garden so I thought I would drop by and give you a hand.I seem to be caught up with the garden and housework. It’s nice to have thingsin order before the harvest begins. I guess we should get back at it. What doyou plan to do next?”Maggie was thankful for the helpand especially for the company. It looks like there are only beans and carrotsleft in the garden. I thought I would tackle the beans next. I took a peek atthem and it looks like they are over grown so I will pick them to dry theseeds.”“How about I head to cellar andbring up the jars? I could wash them while you start on the beans.”“Thank you, Betty that would behelpful. I had wondered where I'd find the jars.“ Maggie replied.Both ladies got busy and beforelong Betty joined Maggie in the garden. “Lands sake girl you need to paceyourself before you get heat stroke! I didn’t expect to come out and find mostof the beans picked and pulled. “ Betty chided. Maggie smiled and kept working.Once the beans were picked the ladies moved back to the porch for another glassof tea and to shell the beans. Maggie found a large metal bowl and smiled eachtime the beans made a ding when they hit the bowl. Betty chatted away and itmade the time pass in a pleasant manner. Betty reminded her of Miss Sissy ismany ways. “If I'm not putting my nose where itdoesn’t belong, may I ask if you and Jake have children.” Maggie softly asked.Betty got a far off look in hereyes and Maggie regretted asking this question. Betty smiled slightly and said“Yes, Jake and I were blessed with a beautiful daughter. Her name is JoElla andshe the light of our lives.”“I look forward to meeting her.”“I don’t reckon that will happen.You see JoElla didn’t want to live in a small community and marry a farmer. Mygirl had dreams. She left for the east when she was eighteen. She was headedfor New York and eventually ended up in Virginia. She has a joband lives in a big house. We get a letter once a year. Usually close toChristmas.” Betty sighed deeply. “I feel like a part of me left when she did,but she is happy, and life is what it is.” For all of her jolliness I couldsee that deep down she was filled with some sadness. I knew what losing someoneyou loved could do to you.  I reachedover and squeezed Betty’s hand.  She gave her head a good shake andreturned right back into the Betty that I was growing to love.  She chatted and I laughed until she rose.“It’s been a nice visit but I must go. The boys will be ready for a meal.  As skinny as he is that Jake likes to eat. Helikes his schedule and turns into a grouchy old bear when he’s hungry.” We said our farewell and I watchedBetty disappear over the hill. I finished the beans and then dug the carrots.Not as many as I had hoped for but I was thankful for what I did find. Isurveyed the garden and all that was left was a big heap of twisted, dying vines.I wasn’t sure where to put them and really needed to get out of the sun so Ileft them. After the sun beating down on methe house felt cool. I sat down and ate a cheese sandwich and two boiled eggs.The heat had taken quite a bit out of me and I knew I needed to stay out of theson.I returned to the porch and got abowl full of tomatoes. I then dug around in the pantry until I found the spicesI needed. Once the sauce was simmering I set about to roll out some noodles. Ihad seen a drying rack in the little room and I went to retrieve it. I wiped itdown and then laid the noodles over it to dry. Now that supper was under control Istared water to boil and began working on the tomatoes. I would skin and seedthe first two bushel and put then into the ice box to be canned the nextmorning.  The last bushel I would makeinto sauce and process. The afternoon was quick to passby.  The tomatoes were in the ice boxwaiting for tomorrow along with some chocolate pudding for after dinner. Thedrying rack was put away and the noodles were swimming in a large pot of water.I had just stepped back into the kitchen from freshening up when I saw Georgewalking over the hill. I watched as he stopped at the topof the hill and took in the garden. He shook his head, smiled and I could tellthat he was smiling. I knew I had about forty-five minutes until he would beready for supper. I popped open the jar of ground beef and dumped it into thesauce.  Once at a restaurant I had seen spaghettibolognese served.  I hoped it wasn’toverly fancy for a farmer!I started the dish water; Georgebrought over the dishes and then picked up a towel to dry. Tonight I didn’t sayanything as I wondered if this would be a standard practice. George spokefirst. “That was one fine meal. I havenever had anything like it and I enjoyed it. Where did you learn to make that?”“I am happy you enjoyed it.  My friend, Sarah is Italian and I learned tomake the sauce from her grandmother. They usually use the sauce for a dishcalled lasagna. It is wonderful with the sauce, flat pasta and melted cheese.What I made tonight I once saw served in a restaurant I was dining in.” Maggiewas relieved it wasn’t overly fancy to George. It was an easy meal that shewould be happy to make again.“I left all the debris on thegarden. I wasn’t sure where to put it.”“I noticed it on my way home. Ifyou like we could take a walk and I will show you where it goes.” George statedhopefully.“I would like that. Let me tidy thekitchen and I will be ready.”As Maggie stepped out onto theporch as George was coming from beside the barn with a wheel barrow.  He stopped by the garden and began piling thedebris onto it. Maggie joined him to help out. Once finished she walked besideGeorge as they headed behind the barn. There was a huge pile that Georgecalled the burn pile. He explained that this is where to put yard debris andthat late each fall he would burn down the pile.George walked back to the barn and leanedthe wheel barrow against it. He then walked and showed Maggie different thingsaround the farm. He referred to things as ours and theirs which made Maggiesmile. After a bit of walking George turned toward the house. “I don’t know about you, but I amtired this evening. Mind if we sit on the porch a spell? We can pray and enjoythe evening cool before we head in.” George asked with a bit ofhesitation.  He wanted to spend time withMaggie but didn’t want to seem like he was pushing it. “That is a splendid idea!” Maggiesmiled at George as she spoke.After they prayed together they satin comfortable silence until Maggie brought out the chocolate pudding.“This is a pleasant surprise. Anice, cool treat to end the day.” George said as he dug into his pudding.Maggie was happy to please George.  They sat in silence as the night sound beganuntil Maggie saw George nodding off. Shesmiled as she woke him and suggested they head for bed."},

No matter how much we want it to, time won't slow down. All we can do is buckle up and enjoy the ride. Here are a a few of the thrifty things that took place in the past week.  My parents cleaned out a bunch of stuff. Old pool loungers, broken umbrellas and such. Chuck happily took it all to sell for scrap. It's a win, win for everyone. They get rid of their junk and we make a few pennies.We keep running out of drinking cups. Over time a few had cracked or mysteriously disappeared. :) Chuck gave me a gift card with $5 on it from a return he made a long time ago. I used it to purchase some cups. I ended up spending $1.68 out of pocket for 8 glasses.Used grocery rewards to save 10 cents off each gallon of gas.Attended a pitch in birthday party for Chuck's grandmother and a couple of her siblings. I took inexpensive dishes using mainly items from my pantry. One was beans and hot dogs.The package of hot dogs was purchased on sale for $0.88 and I used three cans of beans that were purchased when they were $0.50 a can. All of the seasoning came from the pantry.The head of cabbage was $0.89 at Aldi and I used two carrots from a pound bag in the frig.  I paid $.88 for the bag. I already had the mayo, ground mustard, salt, sugar and vinegar in the pantry.I also took green beans with potatoes. I used six quarts of home canned green beans and pulled five potatoes from the pantry.  I feel like I contributed a good amount of food without spending a fortune.So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days. I find it's much harder to stretch my pennies into nickles. *smile*  I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

I read and enjoy the sunny, beautiful day while Megan swims. I love the smell and look of a freshly mowed lawn. Making yummy food for a pitch-in.Celebrating the 89th birthday of Chuck's grandma. She is sitting in the center surrounded by her siblings. A family member posted this on FB about the day.\"The house at xxxx.xxxxxx ave ... was not just a house Sat., June the 3rd, but a place that my family came together to share stories, laugh and watch children play. We celebrated our aunt, our uncles and my mothers birthday that day, but most of all we celebrated Family and the house and yard was filled with love for all to share\"I couldn't have said it better. I am blessed to have married into such a loving, kind family.Doesn't everyone hang out upside down while waiting in car taking pictures? Silly girl! Garden planting... take 2. Critters destroyed almost all of the first garden.Generally it's fine until the green beans start coming up. Not this year. I saw entire tomato plants, cucumber and pepper plants disappear. The fence was put up before it was planting and lets home take 2 is much more successful, Spending a evening on the back porch shelling peas. Super relaxing!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Thrifty Thursday #2", "date": "Friday, June 02, 2017", "text": "For whatever reason this didn't post on Thursday. I guess you could say I am a day late and a dollar short! ha It has been a beautiful week! The weather has been wonderful with temperatures dipping into the 50's at night and then climbing into the 80's during the day. This is my favorite type of weather. Perfect! That means the windows have been thrown open. A few things have broken around here. We heard a terrible noise in the garage. I admit it scared me and startled Chuck. He thought for a moments and knew it was the garage door spring. I went to get the floor cleaner out from under the kitchen sink and noticed water. I cleaned it up and there was more water after dinner. Chuck took a look and saw that the garbage disposal was leaking from the bottom. A quick internet search and it was determined that a seal was bad. It advised that it was more cost effective to replace the unit as if one seal has gone bad the other won't be far behind. Garbage disposals aren't cheap! Chuck used a gift card he had gotten for his birthday to cover almost half of the expense. Super thankful for a guy that is handy and isn't afraid to jump in and tackle these projects. I can't begin to tell you the money we have saved, over the years, by doing things ourselves. YouTube is a great source for learning how to do these things. I mentioned that over the weekend we put a new liner in my paren'ts pool. The cost to have this professionaly done was $2500. My parents, my family and my sisters' family were able to tackle this for the cost of the liner and a load of sand that my dad picked up himself.  I admit it was a real pain to complete but it's done and we saved my parents quite a bit of money. The bonus is that Megan will get a ton of enjoyment out of it!So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days. I find it's much harder to stretch my pennies into nickles. *smile*  I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

I'm trying to add a little more deep cleaning each day. Tuesday is kitchen day and I washed the items that are kept on the counters and windows. My hope to cut down on the amount of deep cleaning in the Spring and Fall. I find that keeping home is ever changing and some things work better then others. As the seasons of life change so must the homekeeping rhythm.Just because they made me happy. :) My evening view as I enjoy some time to relax and read.One of the things I enjoy this time of year is the ability to iron outdoors. If you have never tried it I encourage you to do so. Super relaxing! Some fresh spinach from the garden. Some of it was used to make a smoothie. It was a recipe using spinach, coconut milk, almond butter, honey and blueberries. It was from a well known doctor television show and was suppose to be a detox for acid reflux. I haven't said much, if anything, but I have a major reflux issue.Anyway, a direct quote from Megan about the smoothie.... \"If I have to drink this my tongue will fall off!\"  Bwahaha!! I happen to agree and needless to say it won't be made again.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

He lost some really good friends. Thankful for those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. ********************************************************We had a busy weekend. The big project was helping my parents put a new liner in their pool. It is filling up nicely and I know a little girl who can't wait to swim. Monday we were able to spend a good portion at home. Do you see how my garden is doing?If you are wondering what garden, so am I. Chuck usually puts a fence up around it and hasn't been able to do it with all of rain we have been receiving. Sadly some critters have been eating my plants! I am down to four tomato plants, one pepper, two zucchini and green beans that are just breaking ground. I guess I will need to replant. Ugh!I spent some time pulling out the garden pretties. I enjoy adding the little bit of personality. The bathroom closet was emptied and I moved some shelves. I was able to get some additional items stored and now have a neat, tidy space. This week brings a new month which means I will be doing my monthly grocery shopping.I hope to do some cleaning and to decorate with a little red, white and blue. We'll see how much gets done with a shorter week and I am still trying to get into my summer groove. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Joy in the Everyday: Chapter 4", "date": "Friday, May 26, 2017", "text": "Chapter 1Chapter 2Chapter 3Chapter 4As we entered the house Betty was pulling a pitcher of teaout of the ice box. “I thought we might need this on a warm, August afternoon.Thankfully we were blessed with a slight cool down this week.”“Harvest is starting soon so I know it won’t last for long.”Jake said as he took a long drink of the tea. “Little lady you are going to be thrown into the fire soon. I imaginethe ladies will be waging their tongues about how brave and crazy you are toget married right before harvest.”  Jakepaused for another drink. “I assume you grew up on a farm and know all aboutharvest?”Maggie cringed. What have I gotten myself into she thought?“I did not grow up on a farm. When my mother married my father she became afarmer’s wife. My paternal grandparents owned landed and my parents and I livedthere until my parents passed away. I was eight when they went home to theLord. I then lived with my mother’s parents and uncle. I did spendsummers at the farm until Granny and Pop passed on.”  All eyes were on her as she spoke, especiallyGeorge. “I hope that I catch on fast enough that I won’t be an embarrassment toGeorge.”“Sweet girl, all of the new brides have to learn a thing ortwo, even those of us that grew up on a farm. I will take you right under mywing and teach you everything you need to know. Yes ma’am Betty will take careof you.”“Ought oh, there is nothing more my Betty likes then aproject. Now let’s cut that cake!” Jake said with a wide grin. As I cut the cake George handed out the plates. I cut asmall slice for myself and could barely touch it. I noticed George didn’t eatmuch of his either. Thankfully Betty and Jake were here to carry on the conversationwith Pastor Dan. Betty has what my Granny referred to as the gift of gab.Thinking of Granny made me smile. “It is almost 4:30 so I should be getting back down thelane. I have a few sermons to get ahead on. I like to work ahead so I can helpout with harvest. I might be a preacher, but I love the land as much as youfarmers.  I also know you all have choresto take care of “ Pastor Dan stood and stretched. Maggie said “If you wait a minute I will wrap up a slice of cake for youtake home.” Betty smiled and nodded her head as Maggie began to slice the cakefor Pastor Dan. “That will be mighty nice. Since the missus passed on Idon’t have as many treats as I use to. Now the ladies of the church take goodcare of me, but some of the ladies make a sweet treat better then others.  Now Betty, that is for your ears only!” Dansaid as he winked at Maggie. “I brought over a roast for Maggie to slice for sandwichesthis evening. A bride shouldn’t have to stand over a stove on her wedding day.If the George and Maggie don’t mind there is plenty to share with you.”“I believe that is an excellent idea Betty!” Maggie said asshe placed a large chunk of cake on a plate. Maggie and Betty were busy cutting hearty slices of roastbeef and making sandwiches. Maggie insisted that they go ahead and cut enoughfor Betty and Jake to take home for a meal also. Pastor Dan left with a basket of two roast beef sandwiches,a jar of potato salad, pickled beets and of course the cake. He must have beenhappy as they heard him whistle as he walked down the lane. “Alright Betty, this old man needs to get home. Chores awaitus and now that I've seen the dinner menu I am ready to get them done.”  Jake let out his jolly laugh as he walked outto the back porch with George. Betty and I got busy setting the kitchen to right. Shepacked her things into a basket while I cut some cake for her to take homealso. She started to do the cake dished. “No Betty, leave those. I will take careof them with the supper dishes. You have done more then enough for me today. Ican’t tell you how much I appreciate it. “ “Sweet girl, I am happy to see our George married off. To asweet girl to boot! I have been watching you today and I like what I see. I amserious about helping you with what you need to learn.  Next week it will be quiet around here aswomen are busy putting up the kitchen garden and the men are gearing up forharvest. If things go as planned the following week harvest will begin at myhouse. I would like you to come over with George and help me out. That way youcan see what it takes to feed the harvest crew and what the boys do.”Maggie swallowed hard. “How many men come?”“Now don’t you worry it is usually six including our two boys.  Usually a couple of the wives come to help.Not all of them though. I will be there to see you through this. You will befine.” Betty said as she walked out the door.  I stood at the window looking out as George, Betty and Jakelooked to be in deep conversation.“George that is one fine girl you married today. Did younotice how she was quick to offer cake to the pastor and jumped right in thepack up a meal? That speaks volumes about the heart of a person. I can’t waitto get know that sweet girl better.” Betty linked her arm through Jake’s andthey started off for home.  George had noticed all of that and more. He was also lookingforward to getting to know his wife.  As George was wavinggood-bye I realized that the table cloth was still here. I stepped out the doorand yelled. “Wait! Betty you forgot your table cloth.” As I walked out Bettyyelled back that it was her gift to me. “Your mother-in-law, George’s mom, madethat and gave it to me the last birthday she spent with me. I have been savingit for George and you.”“Oh Betty!”  I said asI rushed over to give her a hug.“It was nothing now we must scoot. Jake likes to keep hisevening schedule.”As Jake led Betty away he called over his shoulder toGeorge, “I bet you will be happy to not sleep on a lumpy couch tonight.” Heturned and I could hear his jolly laugh. “I’ll be inside.” George stated.“I am going to get a little air and then I will be in.”  I hadn’t given much thought to the sleepingarrangement. Oh boy!When I started to step inside George was standing at thetable fingering the crochet border on the table cloth. I stepped to the tableand also touch it. “It is beautiful. I am honored to have something that yourmother made. I will cherish it.”George weakly smiled. “I hope that I will cherish you asmuch. I need to change and tend to the evening chores. Will you have thesandwiches ready when I come in?”The thought of being cherished by George made me feel funnyon the inside. “Yes George, I will have supper ready. “As George walked out the door to the barn he stated “Theevening chores take about half an hour. Then I like to take a quick bath. “I was putting the plate of sandwiches on the table whenGeorge returned from his bath. “I love farming, but not necessarily smellinglike a cow all night.”I laughed out loud at this comment which make George smile.  As we finished up our meal I noticed that George didn’ttouch the pickled beets. I didn’t either as they are not my favorite. MaybeGeorge was still full from the afternoon cake. As I ran the dish water Georgebrought the dishes over and set them on the counter. “Would you like for me todry?” “That isn’t necessary.”  “I don’t mind.” George picked up the towel and dried as Iwashed the dishes. When the dishes were complete he retired to the living roomwhile I finished up in the kitchen. I put the dried dishes away, wiped down the table andcounters before I pulled out the broom. As I was doing this, George pretendedto read the paper. I could tell he wasn’t reading as I caught him sneaking apeek at me when he thought I wasn’t looking. It made me smile and feel allnervous on the inside.“George, do you like evening coffee?”“Only when the weather is cool, I don’t think I will haveany tonight.”Maggie searched for a few things for breakfast and then alsoretired to the living room. The chair was comfortable and Maggie was happy for theottoman. It felt good to put her feet up. She would need to find something todo in the evenings as they sat. Tonight she was tired and glad for the rest. “Maggie, do you mind if I read from aloud from my Bible.”“I would like that.” George began reading from Psalm 100. As he finished “Be thankful to Him, and bless His name.  For the Lord isgood; His mercy is everlasting. And His truth endures to all generations.”George sat in silence for a moment. “I feel like I have plenty to be thankfulfor today. “Maggie smiled, feeling the sameway.  After a long, comfortable silence,George cleared his throat. “My parents” George said “use to pray together eachevening. They had a great marriage. I believe it was because their faith wasstrong. Would you mind if we made it our habit to also pray together eachevening?”“I would be delighted! “ Georgecame over to sit on the ottoman. He took Maggie’s hands and together theyprayed. George prayed for their life together, for them to build a strongmarriage and friendship, for the Lord to be center of their lives. . He prayedfor the farm, neighbors and for the community that was now Maggie’s. Shecouldn’t be happier that this was the man the Lord has chosen to be herhusband. George went back to his paper andMaggie sat deep in thought. She must have dozed off as George woke her.“Maggie. I think you should go to bed.” “I am tired. I think that is agreat idea. Good night, George.”Maggie washed up and changed. Onceshe was in bed she was wide awake and uncertain. She laid there for what seemedlike forever before she heard George enter. He undressed and then climbed intobed. Maggie held her breath. George was lying on his back and Maggie had herback to him. She knew he could probably feel her tremble.  “Maggie?”“Yes.”“I know that we don’t know eachother well and uh, uh, I want you to know that I think we need time to get toknow each other. “Maggie could feel herself relax.“I would never make you do anythingthat you aren’t comfortable doing. I meant what I said in my prayer aboutwanting a strong marriage and friendship. I, uh, just wanted you to know. Goodnight, Maggie.”“Good night, George. I hope yousleep well.”"},

Megan ended seven years at her little Christian school.  We participated in our final balloon launch and said good bye to good friends and great teacher. We will begin the fall as a homeschool family to a 6th grader. It was certainly bittersweet but we are excited for a new adventure!I sent in a final batch of cupcakes to celebrate summer birthdays. My crew made it back from camp in one piece. A welcome home sign was waiting for Megan. Of course two of her favorite stuffed animals needed to hold the sign. Remember in this post when I spoke about getting a picture asking if Mr. Frog could come home. One certainly did! While the van was being unpacked Mr. Frog (a different one from the original picture) was there. Chuck thinks he might have been in his shoe from the creek walk.  Yikes!I can happily report he was let go at the back of our property and hasn't been spotted since.

{"title": "Joy in the Everyday: Chapter 3", "date": "Friday, May 19, 2017", "text": "Chapter 1Chapter 2Chapter 3Maggie quickly dressed and stared into the mirror. It washard to believe she was looking at the same girl that boarded a train four days ago. Betty was right my hair did look nice. Did I dare? I reached into thelittle elastic compartment on the lid of my suitcase and pulled out a lipstick.My thoughts instantly went to Sarah, my childhood friend, who gave me strengthand peace in the mist of a miserable childhood. Oh, how I missed her! She tucked this into my hand as she hugged me andwhispered that I should wear it when I married George. I am not a make upwearing girl and had immediately stuffed it into my suitcase. I opened it andsaw that it was a light, soft pink color. I was here for a fresh start, so Itook a deep breath and put some on.  At that moment Betty tapped on the door and walked in. “My,that dress looks nice on you.” Betty stared for a moment and then said, “I likethe lipstick. It is subtle and nice. Now if you will turn around I will finishyour hair.” Betty pulled the hair back off of my face and tied it backwith a pink ribbon. This caused the curly waves to become fuller in the backand some of it cascaded over my shoulders. I would need to ask Betty more aboutthose rags she used in my hair. Betty stood back and smiled. “I do believe you're ready.Pastor Dan would like to come speak with you before the ceremony. Are you readyfor him to come in?” I nodded my answer.When Betty left, Isat on the edge of the bed waiting for the pastor to come in. I looked out thewindow and saw Pastor Dan and George under the maple tree in prayer. That sceneimmediately gave me peace. When they were finished Pastor Dan smiled andslapped George on the back.  A momentlater there was a knock on the door. “Come in” I softly replied. “Hello, MissMcPherson, it's a pleasure to meet you. I am Doug Daniel. Most people call mePastor Dan or plain ol’Dan.  If Georgedidn’t point out the church it’s the little white building about two miles fromthe main road on the right.  Since I madethe introduction of George to you I know how your courtship was through letters and thecircumstances surrounding it. Now I am not here to judge, I am here to makesure you are ready for marriage. Marriage is a life long commitment and I want to be sure you understandthe commitment that you are making to not only George, but before God.”Maggie had been looking at her hands folded in her lap whilePastor Dan spoke. She looked up with a weak smile and said, “I am thankful foryour willingness to help me and for the introduction to George. I would bepleased if you would call me Maggie.” Pastor Dan nodded.  “MayI ask how old you are?”“I am twenty as of last week.”Pastor Dan smiled. “You have no concerns about marrying aman that is seven years older then yourself?”“No, I find security in the fact that George is mature andsettled.  He will be able to provide asafe and secure life for me.” “I grew up with Sissy and if she vouches for your characterthen that satisfies me. Tell me about Sissy.”“Miss Sissy was the cook when I moved in with mygrandparents after the passing of my parents.  Sissy is like a mother tome. It is at her side I learned how to cook, garden, sew and love the Lord. I love and miss her dearly.”“She always had a kind heart.” Pastor Dan said with a faraway look.  “Do you want to be married toGeorge this afternoon?”“Yes, I feel it is God’s will and marrying George is my desire” I squeaked out.“Good, good, then it is time for a wedding! I wish my Marthacould be here for this. She has been gone for three years now. She lovedweddings and would have loved to see George say I do. We both think of him as afine man.  I will send Betty in and wewill start when you are ready.” He smiled as he closed the door on the way out.Betty rushed in. “Sweet girl are you ready to marry ourGeorge?” I smiled and shook my head yes. “What are we waiting for; the boys arewaiting under the maple tree waiting for us.” Betty took my arm and away we went.Betty stepped out onto the back porch pulling me along. Itried to grab the screen door before it slammed shut. Too late! It hit the doorframe with a thud.  Betty’s back wentstraight which caused me to smile. The moment I looked up I saw that the menwere looking at us. George meet my eyes and it took me a second to get my feetmoving toward him.The slam of the door caused George to look over. He knewBetty had gone to get Maggie but he wasn’t prepared for what he saw. Her smilewarmed him like sunshine on a winter day and her hair. He had never seen morebeautiful hair. Many women had started to cut their hair shorter these days. Heknew that in the eyes of most Maggie would be considered ordinary. In the eyesof George, Maggie was stunning! Maggie walked toward George who stood under the maple tree that created a huge canopy of shade. Once under the tree Pastor Dan asked George and Maggieto face each other. I know that we said our vows and I remember saying “I will”as far as the rest of ceremony it seems like a blur. That is until the end. “Let me read Matthew 19:6. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. ” Pastor Dan smiled at us both. “I now present Mr. and Mrs. GeorgeKraft. George you may kiss your bride.” I started to feel panic and then Georgemoved slowly forward and ever so gently his lips brushed mine. I was now amarried woman and had experienced my first kiss! There was no time to ponderall of this as Betty threw her arms around us both and blubbered how happy shewas. That is all we needed for the tension to be released. George and I lookedat each other and had a nervous laugh.“Let’s celebrate! I do believe there is acake.” Jake stated as he took Betty by the arm and led her toward the backdoor. “Lands sake Jake is your stomach all you canthink about!” Betty scolded as she mopped her face with a hankie.  Jakereached over and planted a kiss on her forehead. “Woman you should know by nowthat’s the truth!” Then he turned and winked at us. “I do like to get this girlgoing!”We all laughed as we headed in to celebrate."},
{"title": "Thrifty Thursday", "date": "Thursday, May 18, 2017", "text": "On Monday I posted about my Mother's Day gift. What I didn't tell you is I was able to get my hosta plants for free!My mother-in-law had mentioned that she had been thinning out her hosta plants. I said I wish I had known since I needed some. She had more to thin and with a little digging labor we had free plants! This was a huge savings. I priced them when I was at the local hardware store getting flowers and they are selling for $7.98 a gallon. Once I had divided them and planted what we needed I was able to pass the remaining plants along to my mom. There is a nursery that has a yearly tomato sale. They sale itty bitty tomato plants for $0.10 each. They are now planted and ready to thrive. It might be a later harvest, but that is fine. I had a pot that had seen better days.  It started out as a pretty gray. After years of direct sun it was looking faded and quite frankly ugly. I purchased a can of spray paint for under $8. A little elbow grease and the pot has new life.The good news is there is plenty of spray paint left for another project.I have been using free water from the rain barrels to water flowers. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more these days. I find it's much harder to stretch my pennies into nickles. *smile*  I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

I know that it won't so I will enjoy setting on the porch as much as I can.Just because sometimes you need a little something sweet. Megan has been bringing in a flower now and then. I happily display the flowers and weeds alike on the window sill. :) The new addition to swing set has seen plenty of action.Megan and Chuck have gone to Bible camp. Sometimes I get sweet shots like this and others times....I get this with a mischievous gleam in her eye asking if Mr. Frog can come home. No way!It makes me happy to see laundry flapping in the breeze. There is nothing like the sweet smell of sleeping on line dried sheets! The garden is planted!  I'm now having dreams of tasting home grown veggies.

Once I put flower in the front window boxes I knew that giving the bushes a trim was a must.  I then cut grass and planted plenty of flowers.  I decided on pink and purple for the back porch planters.  The standard petunia went into the window boxes on the side of garage.  A couple of impatients for my beloved wagon. Sadly it will most likely be the last year as the bottom of the wagon is about to rust out. Perennials for the newly repaired flower bed. It will be nice to maintain and not have to continuously plant in here each year.  There was a patch of concrete that was cut out and it left an ugly, muddy area that I decided to fill in with flowers and mulch this year.  I'm sorry that I didn't do it sooner.  The last items tackled was the garden. It will need to be tilled once more and then I will plant.I am starting to feel like the outside is coming together. Caring for things and planting a flower or two does so much to make a home look lovely. What projects have you tackled in the last week? May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Mother's Day", "date": "Sunday, May 14, 2017", "text": "I put in my request for Mother's Day. What I really wanted was to  work on a landscape project. Chuck was on board with that. Friday Chuck was off and we tackled the clean up of the area I had requested to work on. Every thing was cleared out and Chuck repositioned some of the edging. That evening we took my parents out to dinner to celebrate early with my mom. Afterwards I was taken flower shopping. Yes!  I came home with the van full of summer time love! Being surrounded by blooming flowers in the summer months makes me happy. Chuck and Megan know that this is my love language!Saturday morning I was able to putter around planting until it was time to take my mother-in-law out for lunch.  Sadly Chuck's step dad couldn't join us as he was working on a now or never real estate deal. After an enjoyable meal we returned home to finish our project.I am super happy. Even Chuck commented on how this had been a neglected area for far too long. It's simple and once the hosta start to fill out it should look great. Sunday morning I was given cards and served breakfast. The morning didn't go quite as planned. The stem came off of my glasses. Chuck could not get it back on. I am to the point where I am wearing glasses full time. We switched gears and got ready and waited for the eyeglass store to open. Unfortunately they can not be repaired. They didn't have my frame in stock so it had to be ordered. Thankfully it shouldn't be long and in the meantime I will struggle along the best I can. The weather has been beautiful. I puttered in the yard some this afternoon and spent some lazy time on the back porch reading. Besides the minor glasses set back it was the slow, easy Mother's Day weekend I had requested. I hope you had wonderful Mother's Day!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Joy in the Everyday: Chapter 2", "date": "Friday, May 12, 2017", "text": "You'll find Chaper One here.Chapter 2Much to my relief Betty took over.  She started the dish water as George took hisleave. I stacked the dishes on the counter and then picked up the towel Bettyhad set out and began to dry.“I hear you and George had quite an adventure last night. Wewaited up for you until 9:30 and I was plumb worried. Jake sat in his chairdozing off and finally said my fretting wouldn’t change anything. The two ofyou were in the Lords hands and we needed to get ourselves up to bed.  When I heard rattling in the kitchen I expectedto come down and find you. Imagine my surprise when George told me he haddropped you off here and was bedding down on our couch for the night.” “Yes, it was certainly an adventure. My train was running anhour behind schedule and then on the way here there was a flat on the truck. Itwas almost 10:30 by the time George changed the tire and we were on the roadagain. He didn’t want us to wake you upwith my arrival so he stopped here to settle me in and then went to your place.I protested at first since it didn't seem proper. He said that no matter the time you would be up and fussing over me andhonestly we all needed to get some rest. I thought it best to submit to his wish.” They finished the dishes in silence. Betty knew the busy bodies would have a hay day if they found out Maggie had sleep here before marriage. No matter that George stayed at her place, they would certainly twist it all up to no good. This little piece of information would never be spoken of again. Betty knew George nor Maggie would mention it either. Once done Betty went to wipedown the counters and table top while Maggie finished putting the dishes away. “My Jake and I have been praying for you for a long time. “Betty declared.I wasn’t sure how to reply.  “I assume George mentioned our letter when wefirst exchanged them.” “Goodness no” Bettylaughed.  “We had never heard a peepabout you until Sunday. George usually has his Sunday meal with us. He was afidgeting mess all through service and when he was late for the meal I pressedhim about it. He finally stated how he was late due to asking the pastor tocome out and perform his wedding on Wednesday. I was speechless! Imagine me,Betty Peterson, speechless” she said with a hearty laugh.My expression must have said it all.  Betty took my hand and we moved to sit at thetable. “Although we were surprised by George’s announcement we couldn’t behappier. Jake and I have been praying for years for the good Lord to bring theright woman to join our George.  You, mydear, are an answer to our prayers.”Me? I’ve never been an answer to someone’s prayer. As Iwiped away a tear Betty pushed back from the table and declared that wasenough. She was up and heading toward the bedroom.“I must see what you brought to be married in. I imagine itwill need a hot iron after your journey.”Maggie was hesitant to show what she had brought. The brown skirtand white blouse she had traveled in was in need of washing. Today she waswearing a light blue dress with small white flowers. The only other dress wasoff white with pink flowers. That is the dress Maggie planned to be wed in. Betty looked around the room and spied a small suitcase. Ifyou could call it that as it was more of an overnight bag.  “Well, you do travel light. Which dress is fortoday?”As Maggie pointed to the off white dress she inwardly sighedwith relief. She didn’t want to explain why she had brought so little with her. Oh how she wanted to put the past torest.   “Good choice. I willpress this while you take a nice long bath.”While Betty pressed the dress she couldn’t help but wonderwhy Maggie didn’t bring more. Winter was around the corner and these cottondresses and a light blouse would never do. For a moment she wondered if shedidn’t intend to stay.  Betty was alwaysa good judge of character and she quickly dismissed the thought as she couldfeel Maggie wasn’t the type to take commitment lightly. The bath felt delightful. Maggie could feel herself relaxand some of the nervousness subsided.  Areally long bath would be wonderful but she knew her hair needed time to dry.Reluctantly she pulled the plug. As Maggie came out Betty was coming with her dress. “Thatwas good timing.  Thank you for pressingmy dress.”“My pleasure, I will make us a bite to eat. Why don’t youstay in your robe until after we eat. Come to the kitchen when you’reready.”  Maggie towel dried and brushed out her hair, she then joinedBetty in the kitchen.  Betty turned asshe entered and stared for a moment. “I do declare that is some long, thick,beautiful hair you have. Do you ever leave it down?” Maggie blushed. “Not in a long time. My uncle, well, he saidit was straight, stringy, the color of dirt and didn’t think it was fit towear down. I have worn it up for many years.” “Men, what do they know about a womans hair? I have an idea. Let’s eat and thenwe will get right to it. I hope you don’t mind eating the soup we had fordinner last night. I made the boys ham sandwiches to go along with it. Ithought you might like to eat lighter so I brought only the soup and thought Imight butter some of the bread I brought over yesterday.” Betty reached out andpatted my back as she turned from setting the bread on the table.  “Leftover soup is fine. A light meal is perfect.” Maggiesaid with a faint smile. After saying grace Betty carried on the conversation while she ate and Maggiepicked at her soup. Once they were finished Betty set the dishes in the dishwater and turned around with a basket of rags. Surely Betty wasn’t planning forthem to clean when she would be getting ready in a few hours!  “Sit down, Maggie, and I will fix your hair.” I sat down and Betty ripped the rags into strips and rolledmy hair around them until it touched my head. She then tied each of them. Shechatted the entire time and then declared the deed done. She scooted me out theback door and took a chair and set it in the sun. “Now sit here so your hairwill dry faster. I will be right back with another chair so you can prop yourfeet up. Now don’t get use to this fancy treatment as you will be married to a farmerjust like me. There is plenty of work for a farm wife” she said with a smile. I was happy for the time alone as I needed to gather mythoughts and pray.  A dreadful encounter,three exchanged letters and thirty days had turned my life upside down. I knewthis is what had to be done.  I couldfeel that this was God’s will for my life. I closed my eyes and let the warmthof the sun and the love of the Son wash over me. I must have dozed off for a minute. The next thing I knowBetty is telling me it's time get ready. She begins to unroll my hair. I amamazed to see that my straight, brown hair has turned into a mass of waves. “Sweet girl, this isturning out better then I imagined! George won’t know what hit him when he seesyou. Now I know it's the heart that makes a person beautiful but this prettyhair won’t hurt either” Betty chuckled. I smiled.  Beautifulis a word that I wouldn’t use to describe myself. Hearing Betty go on and onmade me want to believe that I am beautiful and worthy. For the first time in avery long time I had hope. As I stepped inside I was surprised to see all that Bettyhad accomplished. There was a pretty table cloth on the kitchen table. It waswhite with a pink crochet border. Each corner had two pink embroidered roses.There was also a little cake with flowers. Pink flowers that looked almostexactly like the flowers on the dress I would be wearing.  A dish of nuts and candies were also on thetable. I was filled with joy that Betty had taken the time to make this dayspecial. I gave her a big hug.“Now we don’t have time for that. You run along and put onyour dress. I will be there in a minute to finish up your hair. Hurry now! Isee that our boys are walking over the hill and the pastor is coming up thelane.”   I can't say thank you enough for your encouraging words on Chapter One.  My hope is to add a new chapter each Friday. Of course, that is depending on the time I have to put into writing. As you all know my family is my top priority. :) Again, thank you for your kind words."},
{"title": "Joy in the Everyday: Chapter 1 ", "date": "Friday, May 05, 2017", "text": "Hello there! One day last summer I picked up a notebook and started writing. I have always had a dream of writing a book. Now, I don't think anything will come of it as writing a complete book much less publishing it can be a challenge. It came to mind last week and I have been contemplating sharing it on my little space on the web. So, without further ado this is the beginning.... Chapter 1 Margaret slipped out from beneath the warm covers andthought how wonderful it felt to sleep in a comfortable bed. Those days on thetrain had really worn on her. Pushing thoughts of the past away she quicklydressed and pulled her hair up. She prayed that she would have the strength toface this day and that what she was about to do was God’s will for her life. Onelast look in the mirror and she grabbed her apron before working her way to thekitchen.  Although it was still dark, dawn was coming and there wasenough light to take in her surroundings. She noticed a room to the right witha small bed, dresser and desk. Taking in the white curtains with the eyeletlace she thought how pretty.  She turnedto move down the small hall and found there was another room on the left. Onewall was filled with cabinets and there was a small writing nook and what shehoped was a sewing area. Not a large room, but pleasant with the large window.Oh, how Maggie loved for the sunshine to flood a home!Directly across from the little room was the water closet.She was still amazed that this little house, in the middle of nowhere, had awater closet! She had thoughts of slipping in there to wash the rest of thedust off. No time for that now so she made her way to the kitchen to preparebreakfast.Walking though a cozy, comfortable living room she made herway to the kitchen. Well, it certainly wasn’t the kitchen she had at home.Home, now where did that come from? Nothing about the place she lived beforereally felt like a home. Shaking those thoughts away, Maggie, took in thekitchen. It was painted a pretty shade of yellow and she wassurprised to see the details. A cook top, sink with running water and even anicebox were in sight. Although a small space there were upper and lowercabinets and workable counter space. A nice table sat in the kitchen and therewas a china cabinet in the corner. Before she could take in more there was aclick of the door and there he stood. He sat a basket containing eggs on thecounter and they sized each other up for a moment. Maggie was still in shock that all of this had happened soquickly. Here she stood in an unfamiliar kitchen, in a new state, with astrange man that would soon be her husband.  After what seemed like an entirety of silenceMaggie found her manners. “Good Morning, George. I see that coffee is already made,I apologize that I wasn’t up earlier.” George couldn’t help but stare. Margaret wasn’t at all whathe had expected. She was much shorter and a little plumper then he hadimagined. He wasn’t put off in the least when he picked her up yesterdayevening.  A little surprised is all. Hefound her smile nice and even if they hadn’t spoken much on the ride in itwasn’t an uncomfortable silence.  “Mornin’ Margaret,” It felt strange to callher by her formal name, but she had called him by his given name. Since theywere to be married in a few short hours there was no sense in being formal. “Noneed to apologize. I figured you would be tired from the trip and would needsome extra rest. Honestly, I am up a little earlier then normal.” George smiledand then added “It might be nerves.”Maggie couldn’t help but to feel at ease with thisadmission. She smiled. “I might be a little nervous myself.” After a nervouschuckle she added.” Margaret is my given name after my paternal grandmother. Myuncle insisted I use my formal name, but my parents called me Maggie.”“Maggie it will be then!” George said with a smile.  Maggie, yes Maggie! That name just seemed tofit. “I don’t know about you, but I could use a little something to settle mystomach this morning. I could make us some toast and maybe scramble an egg?”After the initial shock of a man offering to cook Maggiemanaged to say “I think I can manage to make scrambled eggs and toast. I willjust look around a little and then I should be fine.”“Then I won’t be underfoot. I will go have some quiet timewith the Lord while you get familiar with your kitchen. Let me know if you needanything”Wow, my kitchen, quiet time with the Lord. Who was this man?George spoke of the Lord in the three letters they had exchanged. I wasn’t surewhat to think of that. Uncle Gregory had taken us to church each Sunday and satus up front so we could be seen. Sunday service seemed to be the only timeUncle Gregory spent with the Lord. Maggie wondered if even then. Maggie this isyour new life stop thinking about your past. You have breakfast to make andthen you will be getting married!George said grace and then dug into his scrambled eggs,toast and sausage patties. He thanked Maggie for the meal and as he was risingthey heard someone on the back porch. “That is probably the neighbor, BettyPeterson.” Before Maggie could respond there was a sharp knock on the door.As it opened a tall, slender lady with silver hair breezed in. “Good Morning,George. I know that the wedding isn’t until three, but I couldn’t wait to meetyour bride to be and offer my assistance.” She then turned to Maggie and kepttalking without missing a beat. “Oh, good, I see you found the bread andsausage I dropped off yesterday. I know that our George keeps a nice supply ofstaples but he isn’t very good about planning for the day to day. I have beentelling my Jake for years that George needs a good woman to look after him.”Betty paused for a moment. “Oh, goodness, where are my manners! I am Betty.Betty Peterson and I am your closest neighbor. I live just over the hill to thewest.”“I am pleased to meet you Mrs. Peterson. I am Maggie McPherson.”“Goodness, we are going to be close so I insist that youcall me Betty. Now George, I imagine that you have things to do and I know thatMaggie and I have a heap of things to do. Now run along. Your suit is pressedand waiting for you at my place. I left sandwiches for you and Jake for lunchand I won’t see you in here any earlier then two -thirty. Now scoot!”There was no doubt that Mrs. Peterson, Betty, was a force tobe reckoned with and I immediately liked her. Okay, friends, I know that it is rough. I want you honest opinion. Is this something you enjoyed? Something you would like to be continued? Like I said I want honest feedback."},

What can I say except life happens!Today is a rainy day. I peeked out a few minutes ago and there is over an 1 1/2 inch of rain so far. It sounds like it will be here for a bit as the forecast is calling for over 3 inches of rain by Saturday morning. Add that to what we received last weekend and we are looking at a soggy mess!While running errands last Saturday we went by some fields that had been planted. It has me wondering if the farmers will have plant again. Not good! The school year is winding down and with that comes a season of busy. An afternoon was spent watching the puppet plays the kids created. They were very interesting! Especially the teams of boys who all had at least one fight scene in their plays. :) Laughter is good for a body and we certainly laughed that afternoon! A morning of bowling and then an evening at the school carnival. We manned the duck pond. It was an easy task compared to years past when our post involved tossing balls and stacking cans multiple times. Whew! Arranging her board for the science fair. Judging is Friday. This is the last big project of the year. Chuck took an old microwave apart and Megan has been having a blast with these magnets that were inside. They are stong little things! I thought the years of playing on the swing set was about done. Megan has shown a renewed interest and even asked if she could add a small climbing wall. I know that the time of play is numbered and I will not rush it to end. Today Chuck and I are celebrating 16 years of marriage!I am grateful to call this guy mine!Between rain showers I have been spending as much time as I can outside. The wet, warm spring has caused the weeds to sprout up. I am having trouble keeping up with them! My hope to have them tackled within the next week. Hopefully Mother Nature will cooperate with me! If you don't see me around for the next few weeks know that I am either busy with a school activity or outside working in the flower beds and hopefully the garden soon!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

There were a total of 33 families that traveled with us and then we ended up splitting up and each group went to their region. Hard to believe it has been 10 years!We (and when I say we I mean Chuck!) helped my parents dig a french drain. I did some baking for a school fundraiser. Megan had her spring concert this week. I may have teared up toward the end knowing this would be the last program for her. There was a nice afternoon rain. I never tire of sitting on the back porch smelling fresh rain. My dad has a tradition of sitting on the front porch with a pocket knife and an apple. The kids, big and small, love when he does this. I don't think the squirrel minds when he does this either. As part of a fundraiser Megan was able to ride in the Chicken Limo to have lunch at Chick-fil-A. They are treated like royalty when they do this. Chuck has to work on Saturday. :) Megan and I plan to spend the day working on her science fair poster and I hope to get some organizing done.

I don't know about you but that calls me to be outside.  This planter is in our backyard. Not far from the back porch.    As you can tell it had seen better days! It should have been take care of a long time ago but never made it to the top of list. It was one of those things that when there was room in the budget there wasn't time and when there was time there wasn't room in the budget. We knew that this would be a top project this year and had put monies aside for it. Landscape timbers were on sale and that pushed this to the top of the list. Chuck spent an evening pulling out the old timbers. Once the rebuilding started it was a family affair!I love how patient Chuck is with letting Megan get right in the mix and letting her help. :)There were a couple of stubborn nails that would not go in and keep bending. Megan cut them flush and no one will ever know we had an issue. Here it is!Awww... so much better! When there are several dry days in the forecast I will stain it the same color as our fence and in about a month we will be past the frost day and I will plant. I can't wait to see this area in bloom!This metal stake was also in that flower bed. The sun had really faded the colors so I gave it a make over. Some leftover spray paint, a little craft paint and it is good as new with no money spent. Megan keeps telling me how much she likes it and what a good job I did. That makes my heart happy!When I get the finishing touches on this little area I will be sure to share a picture with you. In the mean time I need to hustle this morning. My dishwasher broke and I have a stack of dishes on the counter waiting to be dried and put away. What projects have you tackled in the last week?

Seeing new life pop up every where makes this my favorite season for a variety of reasons. I finally got all of the warm weather clothes washed, ironed and put away. It seems that one day we are close to 70* and then it is close to freezing. Typical for around here. That makes it good to be prepared. They say April showers bring May flowers. We have had our share of showers and a thunderstorm or two thrown in. It's one of my simple pleasures to sit on the back porch and listen to the rain hit the metal roof and smell the freshness. It makes my heart happy!The grocery shopping for the month was finished up this week. Lots of freshness in these jars. It significantly cut down on waste and trips to the grocery keeping it this way.

{"title": "Taco Tuesday Tortillas", "date": "Tuesday, March 28, 2017", "text": "Recently Terri shared about making tortillas. Making these has been on my mental list of things to do for a very long time. Since my friend, Brianna, talked about making them on FB several years ago. What can I say except it sometimes takes me a while to get my act together. *smile*Having Terri post about the ease and the taste, along with a tasty looking picture, is all I needed to finally push these to the top of the list.First you mix the dry ingredients together. 3 cups all purpose flour, 1 t baking powder, 1 t salt.  Then you add 1/3 cup oil and 1 cup water. Mix until ball forms (scraping sides often). Once ball is formed mixed an additional minute.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface (light is the key as I had too much flour). *smile* Then divide into 16 equal pieces. I used my handy dandy scale but you can certainly eyeball this.  Roll into balls and flatten slightly. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Roll out to make a 6 to 7 inch circle. This dough was easy to roll out. I worried as I have issues getting noodle dough to roll thin enough. Cook over medium heat about 30 seconds on each side. You may need to adjust your heat after the first one. Fresh tortilla shells ready for taco Tuesday. Yum!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #10", "date": "Monday, March 27, 2017", "text": "Thursday, March 23rdChuck's alarm went off at 4:30 this morning. Generally I sleep right through it. This morning I was wide awake. I tried to go back to sleep and ended up resting until 5:30. I hopped onto the computer to take care of some things. I entered receipts into Quicken. Update our everydollar budget, check out blogs and file. It seemed like I was doing this forever. I headed to the kitchen a little before 7 and whipped up some muffins. While they were baking I started to empty the dishwasher. I was distracted by the sunrise. I wasn't out long as it was only 30*.  BrrrI finished putting the dishes away and checked the menu. I pulled some chicken out of the freezer and by this time the muffins were done. It is now getting close to 8. I wake Megan up and then hit the shower. After I shower we sit down to eat and for some scripture reading. When breakfast is finished Megan goes to take a shower. I fold and put away the laundry left from the day before. A load of towels is thrown into the washer and housework is started. Megan is sent to make her bed and tidy her room. I make my bed and then do a quick tidy of the house. Once that is done it is time to clean the bathroom.When that is complete I vacuum the house and then we take a break until lunch. Lunch is served about 11:45. Leftover pizza and peas. After lunch we sit down to play some games. Trouble and multiple hands of Go Fish. I fold towels and Megan says Feet Feet is open. She will sometimes give me a \"pedicure\" which consist of rubbing lotion on my feet and sometimes she will paint my nails. A girl would be crazy to say no to a little pampering!I watch TV and get on the computer for a few. Megan heads to her room to play. By 3 it has warmed up and we headed out for a walk/bike ride. When we return I plant some pansies. When that is finished I go in to marinade the chicken. When I am finished I bring a book out to read while Megan plays. It is still a little cool when you aren't moving. I walk to the garden and take a peek under the frost cover. It is now almost 4:30. Megan hasn't had a snack and asked to make something. She makes a fruit kabob. Megan watches a cartoon and I continue to read until it is time to start dinner. I get dinner going about 5:30. Chuck is suppose to be home at 6, but is running a little late.Chuck is home about 6:20 and we sit down for dinner.  He is on mandatory overtime and has been going in at 5:30 and trying to be home for dinner at 6.  Dinner is cleaned up by 7. We watch Wheel of Fortune and then play on the Wii. At 8 we have devotions and Megan goes to her room to settle down. At 9 it is lights out for Megan and we are right behind her. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

I prettied them up to make them even more special. The best sink cleaner. Ever. I love how she will say your sink is dirtry, would you like me to clean it. You'd be crazy to say no to that! Leftover breakfast muffins.

He's had OT on every check this year and in the last four weeks he has worked close to an additional 20 hours each week!  The extra money is nice, but my guy could use some rest.A quick trip will be made the grocery store to stock up on a sale item and then we are heading over to my parents to plant potatoes.  Oh, what an exciting life we lead!  Enjoy your weekend. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Handmade vs Kitchen Aid", "date": "Thursday, March 23, 2017", "text": "Megan loves to make butter. I will often find heavy whipping cream added to my shopping list. :) I bought some recently and Megan was delighted to make butter. She got a jar and got busy. While she was shaking, shaking and shaking some more I decided to make some myself.I poured the rest of the whipping cream into the Kitchen Aid and let it do its thing.It took the mixer longer before the whipped cream turned back into a liquid. Megan finished her butter well before the mixer. Once we poured them out we noticed that butter made in the mixer was firmer. Had Megan continued to mix the butter in jar longer it might have become firmer also. We'll have to test that another time.I have heard many times \"I can't do that. I don't have the right equipment.\"  Our grandmother and great-grandmothers made most things from scratch without fancy gadets. We can do it too! Don't let the fact that you don't have a noodle maker or a fancy Kitchen Aid mixer stop you from trying. Sure those things might make it easier, but anything worth having is worth the work it takes to get it. Roll up your sleeves and try. You'll never know what you might be able to do if you never make an attempt. Okay, that's my pep talk for the day! *smile*Megan tired the buttermilk for the first time. She stated they are \"both equally disgusting!\" That made me laugh and laugh. Our conclusion is that making butter either way will work just fine. It is certainly a little more labor intensive to make it in a jar.Regardless of the method chosen you will end up with the same result... delicious tasting butter!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #7", "date": "Tuesday, March 21, 2017", "text": "Cleaning the oven has been on my list for far too long. The day had come to tackle that beast. No pictures before I ran the cleaning cycle. No way, no how, was I going to air that little bit of dirty laundry. *smile* This is the door after the cleaning cycle ran. I began my cleaning with the door. It has been bad for a long time. Even with regular cleaning it wasn't clean inside of the glass. After almost 16 years of constant use it needed more then the normal self clean and wipe down. It was really hard to get good pictures. Can you see the yuck on the door glass? This is after I had cleaned it. We looked at some sites about cleaning between the glass and Chuck thought we could handle it. The first thing to do was to take off the door. It wasn't hard. In fact this made cleaning the inside of the oven so much easier. I said I felt like Hansel and Gretel with my head stuck in the oven while cleaning! A couple of screws were removed and the front of the door came off. There are four pieces of glass: the front door, a piece that you can remove and then a double pane that is the inside of the door. After the glass was clean everything was re-assembled. Look how well the glass cleaned up. I am very happy with the results. Now that we know how easy this easy we won't wait 15+ years to tackle this if the need arises.What projects have you tackled in the last week? Tune in next Tuesday to see what homemaking debt I tackle. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Cooking without an Oven ", "date": "Monday, March 20, 2017", "text": "It seems like it's going to be one of those years where things break. I could get upset and pout and say \"Why does this keep happening to us?\" Nope, I'm just going to keep rolling on with this great life I've been given.After blowing the budget on eating out I had been great at cooking and even sticking to my menu. Enter a Friday evening. I was prepared. I hit the grocery store that morning and was meeting up in the afternoon with my parents and aunt. I knew the day was going to slip away so I planned ahead and whipped up a homemade pizza to pop into the oven.All was going well until I keep checking it and the cheese was barely melted. In a little longer and still it wasn't done. That is when I called in Chuck and we realized that even though the oven was heating it wasn't heating to the set temperature.By this time it's almost 7pm. We are all hungry and I might have been getting to the point of grumpy. We hopped into the van and headed out for Chick-fil-A. Now I love myself some Chickie Lay! It was delicious and we enjoyed ourselves. Although I wasn't happy that once again we were blowing the budget.Saturday Chuck did some trouble shooting. Our stove is almost 16 years old so we knew it wouldn't be smart to put a ton of money into it. After some other large expenses (hello septic!) we didn't want to buy a new stove! Thankfully Chuck tinkered around and found that it could be repaired with a part that is under $30. Yes, we'll take that!He called to make sure the appliance part store had the part and headed out to get it. He arrive there at 1:15. Can you guess what time they closed? If you said 1 o'clock you are the winner!!I was able to pick the part up Monday. Due to all of his overtime, Chuck didn't have time to get to this right away. The menu had already been made for the week and I didn't feel like changing it. The solution/challenge was for me to figure out how to stick to my menu without an oven.Sunday beef stew and homemade bread was on the menu.  Since the stove top works there wasn't a problem making the stew. Now the bread was another issue. I did a little research and decided to try making bread in the slow cooker.Sadly, I don't recommend this recipe. I found it to be heavy. I do love the idea and it is something I might play with in the future.  We'll see. Tuesday lasagna, salad and garlic bread was on the menu. Hmm... now this could be a problem.  I had never made lasagna in the slow cooker, but why not?This is where I got the idea, although I didn't use her recipe.  I used my own recipe. I sprayed the crock pot with cooking spray and it made clean up super easy.  She suggested you cook it 5-6 hours. I found that it was ready at 5 hours.I imagine I will use the oven to bake it most often. The reason for that is that when you bake it you remove it from the oven and allow it to set before you cut and serve. In the crock pot that wasn't possible so it fell apart when I plated it. The taste was great.  The ease was great. I can see myself doing this in the summer.  I won't have to heat up the house by turning on the oven and I can throw it all together before we head out for an afternoon of swimming. This is a keeper!As for the bread I pulled out my trusty griddle and grilled it. I would be fine without the bread, but when I mentioned that to hubby you would have thought I was suggesting something criminal. *smile*Cubed steak was on the menu for Thursday evening. I generally cook it slowly in the oven. Not happening this week. Can you guess how I cooked this. Yup, the slow cooker.Very, very good. Super tender and flavorful. Both Chuck and I agree that this will be the go to method for making cubed steak.I'm happy to report that the oven has been repaired and is back in service. However, it was good to challenge myself and to know that no matter the circumstances I can continue to serve a hot, hearty meal to my family.When life gives us a lemon lets not make a pucker face. Instead take that lemon and create lemonade, lemon custard, and lemon cake!May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "I'm Back", "date": "Friday, March 17, 2017", "text": "First off I do want to apologize that my blog had taken on a negative feel. That is not what I want for this space nor for my life.  Many of you have sent me encouraging comments and e-mail. I wasn't able to get back with many of you, but I do want you know that I read them all and it was extremely helpful to have your support. A break was just what the doctor ordered. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time away.I will let you in on a secret... I didn't give blogs up completely. No, just couldn't do it. I have been taking a peek here and there in the evenings. Besides peeking at some blogs I spent some time giving the blog a fresh look.I also cleaned up my blog roll. I removed blogs that weren't enhancing the joy in the journey. It was hard as some of them had been on my blog roll since the beginning. As many of you know, for some, blogging has changed and become more about business and making money then sharing. Now I am not saying having an ad to generate a little money or a review here and there isn't okay. I think you all have run across the little blog with humble beginnings that changes to the point that you can no longer recognize what first drew you there.As for my Facebook account. I wasn't one to post often but I couldn't stop looking at it. I didn't realize what an addiction it had become. Whenever I went to peek at blogs or do banking I always pulled up Facebook. Sure I enjoy seeing pictures of my friends lives and their kids. I also liked to keep up with my far away cousins. The bad thing is that it's so much more then that. It has become a place to post negative memes and non face to face contact allows many to behave in an unkind manner. Guess what I did?  I logged off and haven't been back on. It was hard at first, but now it's sooo freeing.I spent the first week of my break puttering around my home. I did a general tidy to establish good homemaking habits again. I am working on a new schedule to keep my home clean and tidy. We enjoy living in our home so I know it will never be picture perfect. At least not for long!I have been reading, resting and decompressing. Many times the verse \"Be still\" has floated though my mind.The curriculum for the next school year arrived. It was like Christmas morning opening those boxes! Things were sorted and moved so there would be a new area to keep our homeschool items. I am having a hard time keeping Megan out of it all!The second week was spent painting, cleaning and helping my niece and her husband move into their new home.I snuck over the day they were closing and left a planter and sign on their front porch.Megan has two weeks off of school for Spring Break. I can't wait to pick her up and start our break and to sleep in. Did I mention sleep in? I am not a natural morning person.I am thankful I listened when my mind, heart and body was screaming that I needed to retreat, regroup and rest.  Life will always have a trial of some sort and it has been good to take a deep breath and give thanks for how faithful God has been to us. I am feeling refreshed and ready to tackle whatever comes my way. I'm glad to be back and certainly thankful for all of your support. :)May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Chit Chat & Break Time", "date": "Saturday, March 04, 2017", "text": "Well, hello, I hope this finds you well. It is a beautiful Saturday here. Although chilly the sun is shinning. Chuck is working, Megan is with my parents going to my sisters' house and I am watching Love's Abiding Joy. A slight break before I tackle the kitchen.I peeked at the garden one day this week and am delighted to see things sprouting. The picture is spinach. This will be the first time I have ever grown it. Megan is excited as she likes to take the leaves and wrap things up inside like mini burittos. :) Our septic issue is finally resolved. This machine injected air into the lines and blew out all of yuck which was then sucked out of the lines. We came in under our $5000 budget and were told they would see us in two years. At that time they will pump the tank and make sure things are working properly.  We are certainly praising the outcome! This is the current state of the van. Yikes! Chuck rolled the window down and when he tried to roll it back up it made a terrible sound. It will no longer roll up. A new part has been ordered and I am praying that Chuck will be able to repair it before Monday morning. Megan is such a big help. Chuck cut some branches off of a dead tree. (The one that sent him to the ER with an eye abrasion.) Megan helped him load it into the truck for a guy at work.  Chuck is working a ton. He is leaving the house between 5-5:30 each morning and not returning until 5 or later. He has been pulling some Saturdays also.  Long days, stress from work and then you add on things such as the van window and my guy is feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders. When life is super busy or I feel stress I tend to become overwhelmed and I know it's time for me to back off and slow things down. School is something that has been causing me to feel overwhelmed. We aren't involved in the drama directly that caused two of the sixth grade girls to abruptly withdraw. It has effected Megan because she was close to them. She misses them terribly.  She climbed in bed with me the other night and asked if I would withdraw her from school. Sigh. Between reading for a book report, memorizing for the speech meet, working on the science fair and the normal homework plus the drama aspect it is about to do me in. I feel like we have very little time for family. It is work, work, work for school. I know school is important but don't feel it should take so much of our evenings and weekends.  We are all ready for this school year to end and new chapter to begin. I woke up this morning to a messy house, the knowledge that we had take out or dined out three times last week and knew that I needed to make some changes. I feel like things are out of focus.  First of all I need to guide Megan to handle the unpleasant things at school and to meet her deadlines. I also need to focus on my home. As a homemaker we shouldn't be eating dinner out three times a week.  Chuck deserves to come home to a tidy home and dinner on the table, especially since work is stressful for him. Step one is a break from blogging and other social media. I will miss my little spot on the web, but I know that those in my little home are my top priority. It could be one week,  two, or maybe longer.  Honestly as long as it takes to feel like things are back in focus and there is joy in the journey!"},

Maybe...  The deep clean of the bathroom was finished when I scrubbed the floor. Our great-grandmothers and grandmothers knew what they were doing when they hand scrubbed their floors. Mops and swiffers can't compare to the elbow grease of hand scrubbing. Dresser drawers and bedroom closets were cleaned out. There was a donate pile, throw out pile and mending pile. List were made of what Chuck and I need for the upcoming season. I won't know about Megan until the clothes from last year are pulled and out and tried on. The overall theme for the week was clean it out, move it out. Once finished everything to donate was loaded up and taken to the thrift store. It feels good to get stuff that no longer meets are needs out of here. As Laura says I am making a real estate investment by  removing excess from my home. What projects have you tackled in the last week?

The only thing I disliked about it was the boxes were cardboard and well they are just not pretty. After using them for a bit it was inevitable that yuck ended up in the bottoms. Since they were cardboard there was no way to clean them out. This had been on my need to do list for a long time. I changed out the cardboard boxes for plastic tubs. I labeled them so there will no mistake about what goes where. The great thing is that I can wash them out as needed. This is one of those projects that didn't take much time and made me wonder why I put it off for so long. Another project I have been working on is deep cleaning the bath. I removed all of the decor and washed it. While it was drying the walls were washed down and everything cleaned. I still need to tackle the floor. Once I was finished with the other task I gave it a good sweep and called it good. I plan to give it a good hand scrub. I also need to do a little painting. Washing didn't whiten the baseboard enough so I will add a fresh coat of paint. I hope to have it finished by the weekend. What projects have you tackled in the last week?

{"title": "A Wonderful Weedend", "date": "Monday, February 20, 2017", "text": "It's hard to believe the great temperatures we had this weekend. Temperatures in the 60's and 70's are a treat for February that we took full advantage of. I started laundry Saturday morning and it was wonderful to sleep on sun kissed sheets. I couldn't wait to play in the dirt.  Two of the raised beds were cleaned out and planted. Those early spring crops of peas, lettuce, spinach and carrots are now tucked away until spring is here to stay. Besides work there was time to play. While I puttered in the garden Chuck cleaned up this fallen branch and cut other branches off a tree that has died. After dinner and showers it was still 60* at 7pm. A trip to DQ was a nice treat. Sadly that didn't end our evening. When we cleaned up for dinner Chuck keep saying it felt like something was in his eye. I put drops in his eye and we flushed it out several times. No matter what we did it still hurt. He finally said he thought he should be seen. A trip to the ER determined there was nothing in his eye but he did have a cornea abrasion.  He was given meds and should be fine in a couple of days. He wore safety glasses while cutting on the tree and thinks he might have gotten some sawdust in his eye when he brushed it out of his hair before coming inside. That made for a late night. Sunday afternoon we did a little hiking.Everywhere I looked this weekend I found signs of spring. From the birds we heard migrating north to the flowers popping up. We capped this wonderful weekend off with a fire. I know winter isn't over but I certainly enjoyed this taste of spring.May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

The day began with heart shaped pancakes. Courtesy of Chuck who went into work a little bit late. I usually make sugar cookie cut outs. I was feeling a little lazy and didn't want to take the time to roll out the cookie dough. Instead I made heart shaped brownies. I made our traditional dinner of lasagna. I always think about our dear neighbor, Celia when I am making this. After her husband passed away I always made her a small dish of lasagna and sent over cookies. We certainly miss her!Before bed we played a game of Conversation Heart bingo. We show love in our home every day, but it is nice to pause and think about it and put a little effort into showing our love. May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Heartfelt Chat", "date": "Tuesday, February 14, 2017", "text": "\"Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.\" I have never watched Days of Our Lives but I have heard the beginning of it many times. It begins after our noon news and when I am watching I will catch the opening jingle. I have always pondered this line from the opening as it speaks the truth. Our lives are always moving forward. The season we are in will make that time seem faster or slower but just as the sand slowly drifts to the bottom, our lives are always steadily moving also. Anyone that had read my little space on the web for sometime knows that I like simple, steady and routine. As we know life can be anything but that. Change and sometimes turmoil has been all around us lately.My in-laws (Chuck's mom and step-dad) were basically forced out the church we use to attend alongside them. I have been encouraging her to see this as a blessing in disguise as they weren't happy, but wanted to fight for the good of their church home. The situation was impacting her health and although Chuck and I are sad it had to end this way we are grateful that they are out of this situation. That situation led to the end of a friendship. I contacted her yesterday just to chat. It was a text conversation and I could tell by her response that she was cold toward me. She then said she thought she would never hear from me again after what happened with my mother-in-law. What? The thing that happened was between my mother-in-Iaw and the leaders of that church. Not my friend, or myself.  I said that no matter what or where we might be we were all part of God's family. That ended that. I guess I am suppose to be upset with anyone at that church and it must be them against all who have left. It was awkward, sad and hurtful. Our relationship had been strained since we left that church. I can see that God put us together for a season and that season is over. Honestly, I am fine with it.  I have been open about how tight our finances have been since I had heart surgery. Our run in with the septic left me extremely stressed out. I broke down with Chuck and told him I didn't know what we were going to do as we couldn't rob Peter to pay Paul since Peter was broke too! He laughed at me. He took control of the situation and did some fancy figuring and found a way for us to be able to pay off almost all of our debt.  Things will still be tight. Just not strangling tight. That leads me to our decision about Megan and school. We had been weighing options. Praying about things. We asked Megan to take a week and pray about what she wanted. (Although the ultimate decision would be ours.) She talked to her friends, one of her teachers and came back at the end of week and said she was indecisive.  Chuck and I took an afternoon and went out for lunch. We had one of those conversation that really flow and you pour out your heart. We both agreed that financially we couldn't pay for private school any longer. Ultimately Chuck made the final decision and we are going to homeschool. I couldn't make the decision because I was so torn. As much I wanted to say yes I was held back by my fear. The fear that I will fail Megan. That fear is starting to subside. As my mom said if it doesn't work out then we can make a change the following school year. I am now feeling peace and excitement about our new journey. There will always be changes and struggles as the sand of life shifts. I am in a good place and feeling at peace with the decisions we have made and even with the turn of events that have been out of our control.  Through all moments God is faithful and I am extremely grateful. Now that I have probably shared more then you need to know I am off to start the day. I will have The Tuesday Tackle back next week. I couldn't seem to get my act together to tackle much of anything last week. ;) May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

Can you believe that I didn't take one picture of the kids? Yeah, me either. I haven't felt this relaxed in a long time. Sunday afternoon Megan finished up her class Valentine's. I made something simple since she didn't like the store bought versions. There is something about being in 5th grade that makes it an issue to give out cards that say something corny like \"I choo choo chose you.\" I finally put out a few touches for Valentine's day last week. Nothing like waiting until the last minute. ;)I used things that I already had. Not only did I not want to spend any additional money on decor, but I have to store any additional items. Storage is always an issue around here.  For Megan I have been adding a heart to her door each day from the 1st until the 14th listing something I love about her. This has been a big hit. She rushed to see each new heart. To make this easier I wrote them all out before the month began.

{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #4", "date": "Tuesday, February 07, 2017", "text": "Last week found me in the kitchen. I tackled the cabinets. I took everything out, wiped them out and made sure everything was in its place.  I started with the cabinet that holds our daily dishes. Once everything was out and the cabinet was wiped out I started putting things back in. The area on the left on the middle shelf holds the most used medicines for Megan. It had become cluttered with the family being sick. I put things that didn't fit into the plastic container away in the bath closet. Once the medicines were sorted it was just a matter of putting this cabinet back together. Then I moved on to the upper cabinets on the other side of the kitchen. Once again I took everything out and wiped off the shelves. There were some more meds that needed to be put back into their proper home. The middle, corner cabinet holds the toaster. Knocking the crumbs out before it is put back isn't enough. I will have to bring in the dust buster and clean that bottom shelf off weekly or more. We all know having crumbs could led to unwanted guest. I think I'll pass on that! Next I tackled the area I was dreading... under the sink and the cabinet that holds the trash can. All I can say about the cabinet that holds the trash can is yuck, yuck, yuck. I will certainly tackle that area more often. I only needed to wipe out the cabinet under the sink and straighten it out. I need to be diligent at making sure everyone is putting things back where they go under there. All of us are in there almost daily to take care of a cleaning task. After each cabinet was wiped out I also washed down the outside of the cabinets. Even though this is an area behind closed doors it made me feel so much better to have it taken care of. I ran out of time to take tackle the pantry so that will have to wait for another day.  What projects have you tackled in the last week? Tune in next Tuesday to see what homemaking debt I tackle. It is one of those items I have put off for far too long.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

She is also in charge of the children's departments. This is the first church we have tried that we have any interest in trying again. The entire family is ready to be settled into a church again. We'll show up again next week and see how it goes. I have been reading tons this year. Part of it, I feel, is an escape since life has been throwing hard things at us this year. I have added a section to the right of the books I have read. The one above is the last one I finished and it was excellent. It had me wanting to keep going so I could see what happened next. One minute I was rooting for one things and then seeing that how it turned out was really best. The author wrapped up the story but also left an opening for a sequel.  I really hope for a sequel! Of course, I do enjoy book series. I am continuing my cleaning and organizing. Boy, do I have a ton of homemaking debt to make up for! Just take it one step at a time, right?  For the most part my days have been filled with sunshine. No matter the temperature the sun is really good for me. I do tend to suffer from the winter blues and it certainly helps my disposition! I find that I am less productive when I am in a funk.  We are still praying about schooling for next year. We have asked Megan to pray about the two choices we think are best and let us know her opinion. As her parents we will make the best and final decision. We want Megan to feel comfortable with the choice so we are asking for her input.  It's time for me to stop with the chit chat. I have some things to wrap up before the daily grind begins again. I will be back on Tuesday. Have a wonderful week, my friends! May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "The Tuesday Tackle #3", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2017", "text": "Hello friends! Those of you who are following our septic saga we had our inspection yesterday. Good new is that it didn't completely fail. :) Long story short is that we have clogged lines. There is a possible fix for it by blasting the lines with water. We are in the wait and see stage as the technician has to go over things with his boss and make sure he is in agreement. We are praying that this is the answer since it will be the most economical route. We'll continue to take it one day at a time.Due to my mental state  ;) the last couple of weeks I didn't tackle as much as I wanted. Every little bit helps so I'm grateful for what was accomplished.  When you home is cozy many areas have to serve double and sometimes triple duty. The closet in our living room is one area that is multi purpose. Games are keep in here. A couple of new games were added at Christmas and a true home was never found for them. I can't tell you how many times I knocked the Payday game off of the shelf while getting out the vacuum.   The upper shelves hold craft items that Megan can use anytime. I could tell she has been in here lately since things were not put away exactly the way I would have liked. She is still learning. (Sorry about the blurry picture. I only took one and sadly this is it.) Everything in its place and all lined up makes for a pretty shelf. Much better.This is one of those projects that didn't take a lot of effort and made me wonder why I didn't do it sooner.  I had plans to tackle a couple of other areas. Chuck had asked for gift cards to the hardware store for Christmas. He had a plan to organize the garage and was itching to get it done. I spent time out there helping him out. The plan is to get rid of all of the cardboard boxes. We have noticed that if the garage is damp from a wet car that the boxes would soak up the moisture in the air. Yuck!It does look nice to look out and see a shelf of matching containers lined up. He now has a container for each item such as plumbing, electrical and such. The next step is to label the containers and move on to another shelf.  It was my pleasure to put my task on hold and give him a hand with this. Not only is the garage looking better and better, but I got to spend some quality time with my guy. Win, win!  What project have you tackled in the last week? Tune in next Tuesday to see what homemaking debt I tackle.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},
{"title": "Growing", "date": "Friday, January 27, 2017", "text": "First off I want to thank everyone for their kind words, encouragement and especially your prayers after my last post. I find most people in the blogging community to be caring, uplifting people. There are so many of you that I wish I could be friends with in real life. In most cases that won't happen and I am thankful for the online support. From the bottom of my heart thank you!As much I would like for life to be smooth sailing and full of blessings I know that is not to be. You see, life is intended to be a blessing and a challenge. There are many times when I am in the challenging mode I want to cry out and say \"why, why, why?\" Honestly, I know the answer. It is necessary for us to cling to Him and to live out our lives in faith and hope. If life is always perfect can you live out 1 Thessalonians 5:18? It says \"in everything give thanks.\" As hard as it might be that means in the good, bad and even the seasons of ugly. I have also been thinking about Philippians 4:13. \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" It doesn't say I can do all things myself, but through Christ. It can be easy to drift from clinging to Him in seasons of blessings. My panic is starting to settle down and my prayers are changing from, well honestly, from begging to submission. Our immediate concern at the moment is our septic. There will be a septic inspection on Monday. Our prayer is that instead of replacement it can be repaired. We are praying that it can all be done for $5000 or less. Even though that is what we feel we need to have happen, due to financial reasons, we are placing our hope and faith in the Lord.  I couldn't fall asleep last night and I spent quite a bit of time in prayer. I felt at peace when I fell asleep and I still do this morning.  God is faithful and there are many times I have seen Him meet our needs when I didn't think it was possible. I am trusting Him that no matter what the outcome is that He will meet our needs and see us through. Time and prayer has helped me to see that God is using the trials and tribulations to grow my faith. Philippians 4:7 tells of a peace, \"which passeth all understanding.\" I am feeling that peace and I am grateful. Thank you all again for your prayers and support!"},
{"title": "Weary", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2017", "text": "I have had some inquiries about my lack of posting. It was never my intent to take a break. Sometimes life just happens. One issue is that my laptop stopped working.  Chuck tried to repair it and it didn't work. He then spoke with an IT guy at work who gave another suggestion to try. He said that with what Chuck had already done if this didn't work then it was dead. Sadly, it is dead.  That means I have to use the desk top and by computer standards it is a dinosaur. It is a real pain to upload the pictures to blogger using it.  Quite frankly I am feeling weary. I understand life is meant to be a blessing and a challenge. I am feeling the challenges at the moment.  One thing that has made me weary is all of the politics. It seems every where I turn it is coming from all sides. My dad has a saying that your opinion ends where the other guys nose begins. I am ready for people to tone it down.  We are also having an issue with our septic system. Sewers are coming to our area and we were hoping we could hold off.  A phone call was made and we aren't on the sewer schedule yet and who knows how long it will be until we are. Our septic system is original to our home which was built in 1953. Unfortunately all signs point to a failing septic.   I am doing laundry at my parents and we are taking quick showers. We are doing all we can to prevent it from failing before we can get someone out here to check it out. If we need a new system it will be very expensive. We are in prayer asking for an answer that doesn't involve a new system and for the funds to pay for all of this.  I believe I may have mentioned that Megan's little school ends at 6th grade. We always knew we would need to make a decision about what would happen after that. An announcement that her current teacher, who teaches a 5th/6th grade combo class, is retiring at the end of the school year has changed things. The school is trying to make a decision based on enrollment and funds about whether they will have a 6th grade class next year. That prompted us to go ahead and make a decision about the direction of her future education. We have thought about another private, Christian school, public school, and homeschool as options. I made the mistake of putting a question about a neighboring school district stating that the district we are in isn't a good fit for Megan on FB. I opened myself up to some nasty things. I deleted the thread because it caused me to receive a couple of very hurtful private messages.  It is easy for people to judge your decisions and tell you what decisions are best for you. An example of this is my father-in-law (who we have never discussed this issue with) informed Chuck in a phone conversation last night that we need to put Megan in public school. That it is best for her to be put in situations that will cause her to have to deal with real world issues. He also stated that I need to get a full time job and that having children in care programs is good for them. Chuck was upset by the time they ended the conversation.  The thing is Megan is timid and has her own unique personality. Putting her in a group of 500 + kids isn't going to make her more social and outgoing. She shuts down when she feels overwhelmed. We see it at birthday parties and such.  Many act like we are taking this decision lightly. Certainly not. We did discuss it with Chuck's mom and step-dad while having dinner with them. They are supportive no matter what decision we make. One of the big issues is that I am a people pleaser. I have a strong dislike for conflict and I want people to be happy with me.  We are 97% sure of our decision for future schooling. I received a call from the school principal last Thursday about an incident at school. It involved a 6th grade student sending a text to a girl in class that mentioned \"69.\" Megan was not involved, but the principal did talk to all of the 5th/6th grade girls as a group to see if any other inappropriate comments had been made to the girls.  That ended with me having to have a difficult conversation with Megan.  As soon as I told her Mrs. W had called me and I asked her what she talked to the girls about she started crying. Hearing your little girl say she told us that a boy sent a \"sexual\" text to another girl in my class about ripped my heart out. Then we had to have a basic conversation about sex.  Certainly not a subject we intended to discuss at this point.  Now I have spilled more then I probably should have. I hadn't even told my mom about this and we talk about almost everything. It served as another reminder that even if you have your child in a Christian program it doesn't mean that everyone holds the same values that you do. It reinforced to us that we have to be diligent at being involved and aware of the things Megan is exposed to.   So friends, that is why I am feeling weary. As a \"friend\" pointed out in her private message to me I live in a bubble. At the moment I am fine with my \"bubble.\" I have enough to manage in my own world without the issues of the outside world in my face all the time. I am learning that what is important is that I obey God, my husband and stand by our convictions. I will never please everyone and as long I am pleasing God, Chuck and myself that is what I need to do. Others will always judge the things you do and someone will always be there to tell you they disagree with your decision. As Chuck's step-dad said \"you are adults and don't need approval from anyone for the decisions you make.\" Easier said then done for a people pleaser, but I am trying."},

After Christmas I wasn't feeling well and stacked the books I had received haphazardly in there. Along with a few other things that weren't in their proper place.   I took it a shelf at a time and pulled everything out. I had been stacking Megan's schoolwork in there. Yes, I know she has been in school for five months. Sigh. I took the time to sort it and put into a binder. As I was sorting the books I added some to my sell bag. I had already read a few of then that I had no interest in keeping. I also had been given a few that weren't my taste.  I moved a few things around.  Awww, so much better.  I know this closet is rough.  When we made into our office area we moved shelves and never took the time to patch holes from where they previously were. There is also some missing paint that come off when the shelves were moved around. This area is on my list for a mini makeover this year. At this point pretty isn't my goal. I am working on culling things and organizing. Pretty will come later.  Next on my list was this cabinet in the kitchen. Not everything had been put away after my trip to the grocery store and all of the Christmas goodies had been baked. Things were put into their proper place and a few things were tossed. Now I feel like I can take a breath when I open the cabinet door. No longer do I fear what might jump out at me! What project have you tackled in the last week?

You can feed the line through a drain and see what the problem is. This towel screams Wendi. Thankful for meat that is close to 63% off of the regular price.  Ahhh, the sun! After several days of gray skies and rain the sunshine lifts me up.  My birthday was celebrated Thursday. I am proud to say I am 46! I know many people that are at 39 and holding. Not me, I feel each year is gift many don't receive and I want to embrace it and enjoy it.  Birthday flowers.  A field trip to the downtown library. It is a beautiful building.  The best part for Megan was playing with the robots. Since her school is so small all the 4th, 5th and 6th graders each had their own to experiment with. Fun!Today I will finish up laundry and clean the shower. Tonight the in-laws are taking us out to dinner to celebrate my birthday. The rest of the weekend will most likely be spent home as ice is in the forecast for later tonight. Depending on who you listen to it could be over by Saturday afternoon or run into Sunday morning.

I also have little task that need to be completed that never seem to make it to the top of the list. I thought I would share with you what I have tackled each Tuesday. Some weeks it might be a huge task or multiple task, others it will be small. I am going to use this to motivate myself to get it done!I tend to be an all or nothing person.  I will put things off and wait for a big clean.  I love the feel of that deep clean. The problem is that the deep clean does take quite a bit of time and energy. Plus the in between stage isn't always pretty. My goal is to break this habit! As Laine would say I have some homemaking debt to take care of. :)Since I spruced up the laundry area the liner in the cabinets has been driving my crazy! For whatever reason the shelf liner did not stick well. It would pucker at the front edge and slide around. For some time I had been meaning to add a dot of hot glue to make this stay. I mentioned it to Chuck and he suggested I use double sided tape as it would be flat and the glue might make it bumpy and lumpy. (my interpretation of what he said anyway ;) ). Not very noticeable in a picture, but it so much better. I did a little decluttering while I was at it too. I no longer use fabric softener so I took that out and made minor adjustments. I also made a list of things I need to stock up on like the ingredients to make laundry soap.The next area was the computer desk. The computer is keep in a small closet in our third bedroom. The computer desk was a mess! My laptop is broken so I have been spending more time in here. I sat down to look at some blogs and balance the checkbook. I couldn't take it anymore and immediately tackled this area. I put things away, organized the bill box, threw out a few things and found a container (an old plastic pretzel container from Aldi)  to contain our Coke points. So much better! I have plans to tackle the other three shelves in the computer closet. You'll have to tune in next Tuesday to see me tame that mess.

Salad plus fruit, get it?\" Silly girl! The whole family is still not feeling 100%. Chuck missed two days of work this week. He rarely takes time off work for not feeling well. I am better but still not back to my normal self. Megan hasn't succumbed to it yet. She has been off and told me before bed last night that she thought she was getting a sore throat. Ought oh! On these cold, wintry days we have been snuggled in at home as much as possible.

{"title": "Chick-fil-A Cole Slaw", "date": "Wednesday, January 04, 2017", "text": "Since Chick-fil-A stopped serving their signature cole slaw they released the recipe due to popular demand. I decided to give it a try. 4 t vinegar1/4 c sugar1/4 t dry mustard1/4 t saltWisk together.Add 1 c mayo (when I worked there they used Kraft mayo)Pour over20 oz shredded cabbage1/4 cup shredded carrotMix well. After I diced my cabbage and cubed my carrots I put it into my mini food chopper. If you have ever eaten Chick-fil-A slaw then you know that it was finely chopped. You might notice this is a little heavy on carrots. Well, that is the beauty of homemade, you can make it however you want. I just happen to like a little bit more carrot in mine.  I know that I have mentioned that I worked at Chick-fil-A for six years in the late '80's - early '90's. At one point I worked mornings in the kitchen doing food prep. I can't tell you how many pounds of this cole slaw I have made.Having the cabbage and carrots prepped made this an easy side for dinner.  In case you are wondering how I got 20 oz of cabbage in a quart jar, well, I didn't. The recipe made a little much for my family of three. I cut the recipe in half. Another one of those perks of making it yourself. I am happy to say that it taste just like the real deal.  May your day be filled with joy in the journey!"},

As much as I adore Christmas I find it refreshing to put the décor away. Everything feels fresh, in its place and I can breath. That lasted until Wednesday after Christmas anyway. I have been knocked down with a bad cold. Most of my week was spent with a cup of tea, a good book and a box of tissue. Thankfully I had all of Christmas put away. I am feeling a little better although I still have a hoarse voice. The monthly menu is complete as is the shopping.  I was dragging when it was complete, but it is done. I had a couple of extra helpers with me so there are a few things here that I normally wouldn't buy. ;) There were some good sales so I stocked up on a few things. Many of these items will last us for more then a month. Such as the meat, packages of cookies and trash bags. I spent more then I wanted but I am okay with it as I have a stocked freezer of meat. This year I will track my grocery spending on my blog. I spent $275.95. $33.83 of this amount was on M&M's alone. (not all pictured above) I purchased enough 50% off bags to last us for a year. I use them in cookies in place of chocolate chips, in trail mix and keep a jar in the pantry to grab a few when someone needs a chocolate fix. It doesn't matter to us that they are red and green.  The rest of month the I will only purchase must have such as milk and fresh produce. Blueberries were .99 cents a quart. I grabbed several of those. I had read that keeping them in a glass jar extends the life of your produce. It said to store the fruit unwashed. I washed them as I have a little one that eats better when the healthy snacks require no prep. I interested to see if this helps as we had more food waste then I want to admit last year. ]Projects and goals have been set. We have the material or an existing gift card (yay Christmas gifts!) to cover many of our projects. I am sad to say we are still knee deep in debt. Sigh. Those medical bills have killed us.  I don't want that to sound too much like a grumble as I am blessed with a good man, great marriage, healthy child, nice home, steady income, and plenty of food. The budget will be tight again this year as we have set a big financial goal. My kitchen counter has looked like this for most of the week. :) Tomorrow we start the daily grind again as Chuck returns to work and Megan to school. I will miss the crafts, science experiments and most of all my people.  My friends, I must close. I have rolls rising that I must check on.

The games are being played, the new clothes have been washed and put away and until after the first of the year my little family will be together at home. Pure bliss, I tell you!I have been thinking about the passing year and the one to come for quite a while. I could sit here and tell you how tough 2016 has been, but I won't. Let's face it, we all have issues.  Some days, weeks, months and even years are better then others. As many of you know I am an avid reader. A couple of months ago I was reading a book and one of the characters asked when a quilt would be finished. The other lady laughed and her response was that it wasn't about the finished quilt, but each stitch taken while making the quilt.I have been thinking about that since I read that book. Honestly, it was on my mind so much that I had to pull the book out of my sell bag and look for that conversation again. There is so much talk now about slowing. I would love to slow life down and honestly I do my best to keep my life slow and simple. The truth of the matter is that life is always moving. If we spend too much time waiting for things to slow down, for the last ten pounds to come off, for a task to be done or things to be perfect then we won't find joy in journey. Instead of a word for the coming year I will have a phrase... joy in the journey. No matter how crazy or stressful it might seem I want to savor the moments and find joy in journey. Not to be in such a hurry to get to the end of a task. As a believer I know what the end of my journey will be and my goal is to find joy in that journey.I will be spending the remainder of this year enjoying my family.

There were 14 of us that had dinner at a steakhouse for my dads 67th year. We missed the Chistmas Eve church service and spent some time driving around looking at lights.  There is no place like home! I love pulling into the drive and seeing our lights shinning out.  Once Megan was asleep the rest of the gifts were brought out. Yes, that is a coconut you see. Megan will ask for one almost everytime she is at the grocery with me. I will say it isn't on the list or not in the budget. Now she finally has a coconut!  This was my gift. Surprised is an understatement! This has been on my want list for years. Although can't guarantee that my pictures will be better.  Sometimes it is the operator and not the equipment. ;) We joined Chuck's dad for lunch and to celebrate his birthday. Yes, my dad has a birthday Christmas Eve and my father-in-law Christmas Day. How crazy is that! Then it was off to my parents to celebrate with my family.  I know that some will read this and think it is crazy to do all of this in two days. I will admit that in the past I have struggled with it. A wise person told me to embrace it because life is short and as time passes love ones pass on and these times will be missed.

It was quite eventful with a child passing out and another child not feeling well. Part of the issue was the fact that it was HOT! Besides that it is one of my favorite field trips. The joy that I see in faces of those at the nursing home is wonderful! Friday there was a half day of school scheduled. I ended up spending the entire time there. Breakfast was served to Megans' class. Another mom and I made pancakes (plain, chocolate chip and blueberry) to order. Then I joined the class for chapel.  Each class sang a carol, the Christmas story was shared and I really felt ready for Christmas by the time chapel ended. Then it was party time! Games were played and then it was time for the gift exchange. This is the second year that Megan has had Mrs. A and we love her! So, so sad that she is retiring at the end of the year.  Saturday Megan and I spent the day at my parents along with my sister and nieces for our annual cookie day. It is always a good day. We bake, laugh, watch Christmas movies and ended the evening with pizza. The cookie trays are packaged and ready for Chuck to share at work Monday.  There was ice Saturday night and I can't say I was upset when Chuck said we were staying home Sunday morning. I was ready for time at home and some rest. We had a lazy morning, puttered around doing a little bit of picking up and listened to Christmas music. After dinner games were played and we watched a baking show that was recorded. Of course we had to enjoy a treat from cookie day while watching TV.

I suggested we make it to go on top of her gift for the class gift exchange.  Megan and I have been working on these ornaments. These will also be for her classmates. I made tags to go on the string of the ornaments. I don't usually make ornaments for classmates. This year is different for a variety of reasons. Many of the kids that Megan has been in school with since she was in preschool are leaving her school at the end of the school year. Middle school is good time to leave and transition into public school. Also we aren't sure where Megan will be next year. I thought that this would be a great way for them to remember their time with Megan.I had a grand vision of how I wanted to package these. Then reality set in when I realized the ornaments were to big for the bags. I used what I had on hand and put it all into a zipper bag. This will help with dropping them into backbags.

Who could blame her! I was cracking up as she rode her bike around. I do believe this is a first around here! I couldn't let her have all of the fun so I put on my boots and joined in the fun. We created this snowgirl and then she helped me finish up my work. I had shoveled the driveway earlier and had planned to shovel a path from the back door to the trash can. Megan was having so much fun that she shoveled the entire section of the porch that isn't covered. :) By this point my face was cold so I called for time to return inside.

Gingerbread houses were decorated and A Charlie Brown Christmas watched. Saturday I was up early. Before 5 am early. Yikes! I whipped up a coffee cake and then I started my first batch of caramel corn. I worked in the kitchen until after lunch and ended up with three batches of caramel corn and three batches of caramels. Most of this was sent with my parents as my dad had requested I make caramel corn to take into church Sunday morning. Doesn't everyone have a husband that grills out using a head lamp? lolSunday there were flurries off and on. In the afternoon Chuck brought his childhood Legos out from the attic. This is such a treat for Megan! While they built a crane I did some crafting. A comforting meal of beef pot pie was enjoyed. The weekend was filled with Christmas music, family, good food and time at home.

Nothing gets you in the the Christmas spirit like hearing a group of children sing about the baby in a manger. Christmas cards were mailed. The in-laws invited all four of their grandkids over for a sleepover. We took advantage of this time to shop and wrap gifts. I am happy to say I am done! Well, with the exception of a couple of things that were delivered this week that need to be wrapped. An afternoon at the circus. I hadn't been since I was a kid and had forgotten how fun it is.It feels like winter has arrived here. We've had cold temperatures and even a dusting of snow this week. It makes me want to curl up with a good book or watch a movie and stay cozy at home. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #8", "date": "Wednesday, December 07, 2016", "text": "Tuesday, November 29thThe alarm went off at 6 and that was the start of another day. I saw Chuck off to work and then hit the shower. Megan was up about 7 and then we did the morning rush and were out the door about 7:45. The car line was already moving when I pulled in so I whipped in and back out. I was home by 8. The first thing I did was start some dip. I don't eat it but Megan and Chuck like it when I serve tacos. Then I switched the load of laundry I washed the night before into the dryer. While I was in the garage I grabbed something out of the freezer for dinner.  By now it is almost 8:30 and I sit down for a bowl of cereal and some quiet time. It is almost time for my monthly grocery haul. I spend some time looking at coupons. The Laundry is dry so I pull it out and fold it. When that is complete I pull the turkey carcass out of the freezer and start making stock. While it is boiling away I make the menu for December and work on my grocery list. The dip is done. I portion it out in muffin tins and put it into the freezer. The laundry is put away and I do a little bit of ironing. I pull off the stock and strain it a few times then into the frig it goes. I will skim fat off the next day and use it to make a large batch of turkey and rice soup. I generally let it simmer longer but was in hurry to get the bones and such out into the trash. Not five minutes after I ran it out the trash truck came. Whew!By now it is almost 11:30. I tidy the kitchen and then step outside. It is a beautiful day! I am hot and ready for a break by now. The 50* temperature feels great. I rest and make a call to my mom. After we chat I head in to make lunch. Nothing fancy just a cup of noodle soup. After lunch I take advantage of the nice day and spray paint some pieces for a craft. I then head inside and spend some time looking at blogs until I need to leave. At 2 I freshen up and then head out the door to pick up Megan about 2:20. While waiting in car line I read, text with Chuck and listen to Christmas music. We are home at 3:30. Megan has a snack while working on homework. I putter around making her lunch and putting away clean dishes. I get a late start making dinner. It is a good thing as I get a call 15 minutes before Chuck is suppose to get home telling me he will be late. Not five minutes away from work he went to stop for a turning car and his brake pedal went to the floor. He barely stopped in time. Thankfully he had plenty of space between himself and the car in front of him. He had limped it to an auto parts store and was going to try and fix it.  I stop making dinner and wait to hear from him. When I hear from him it is not good news. The broken brake line is a steel line and he can't fix it. I look up tow truck companies for him. I make something for Megan to eat and call Chuck to tell him to call me on my cell as we are heading to my parents. I figure it would be better for Megan to have some down time at their house then to spend the evening in the van.   I receive a call at 6:15 to pick him up at the auto shop at 6:45. It is almost 7 before we leave the auto shop. We hit the drive thru and then it is off to pick up Megan and borrow a truck. We are more then ready to be home. Finally home a little after 8. I package up the dip I made this morning and then empty Chuck's work bag. After putting his dishes into the dishwasher I set it to go and then dig something up for his lunch on Wednesday.  We sit down and watch thirty minutes of TV. We all need a little time to chill out. At 9:15 it's lights out and the whole house is in bed. What an evening!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Afterall we are entering the most wonderful time of the year!We started the day off with our traditional breakfast of Rudolph pancakes. Then the fun began. The tree was up and then we fluffed out all of the branches. I spent lots of time stringing on the lights. I used at least 14 strands of lights. I think lights make the tree. Then it was time to pull out the ornaments. I love this as it is a trip down memory lane. Ornaments that bring back special memories of vacations, highlights such as Chuck's time in the service and of course treasures made my little hands. Once the star is on then it is complete! We were watching the lighting ceremony for what our city boast as \"the world's largest Christmas tree\" and I looked over and saw this. There is nothing like seeing Christmas through the eyes of a child.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

{"title": "Playing Catch Up ", "date": "Sunday, November 20, 2016", "text": "Last week I felt like I was barely home. That has me feeling like I am playing catch up. I was busy running errands and taking my mom (who doesn't drive) out for a little shopping. Then we had an unexpected meeting called at Megan's school on Tuesday evening. Sadly her teacher is retiring. This leaves things uncertain as she teaches a combined 5th/6th grade class. It is a small school and they are looking at enrollment numbers for next year to determine what to do. It takes a special teacher to be able to run a combined class. It really stinks as we are in limbo as to what will happen next year. We are pretty sure we know what plan B will be if her school doesn't offer 6th grade. Wednesday I planned to stay home. I had dropped Megan off and had just finished breakfast when I received a call for a doctors office. Chuck's step dad was having a minor procedure to remove some skin cancer from his nose and my mother-in-law started to feel ill. Long story short I had to take her to the ER for elevated blood pressure and tightness in her chest. Thankfully they didn't find any issue. I think it is stress as she was worried about Mike and has been under stress at work with working on a new budget. We all know how hard it is to create a budget when there isn't enough money. ;) That evening we meet Chuck at the mechanic. He dropped off his truck and then we went to borrow a vehicle from my brother-in-law. We grabbed something to eat at Cracker Barrel and then dropped in to see my in-laws. Chuck didn't come to the ER and wanted to see his mom. Thursday I was again with my parents for most of the day. I honestly can't remember what we had to do that day. That evening we meet Chuck at my parents so he could drop off the borrowed vehicle. Then we went to pick up his truck. It was a killer paying for the repair. Thankful for the emergency fund and for getting multiple quotes. The original quote from the place that diagnosed the issue was $350 more then what we paid for the repair. Dinner was quick and then it was out the door again for a fundraiser. They are raising money to reduce the cost of going to camp in the Spring. I was so happy to see Friday come. It was a normal day. Whew! Saturday Chuck worked and Megan and I worked on getting our home in order. I spent some time deep cleaning the kitchen. Things always look worse before they look better when you are deep cleaning. Yup, those are Christmas lights. Chuck ended up helping me finish things up and suggested we go ahead and put them up. I turned them on to grab this picture but will leave them off until after Thanksgiving. Cleaning the kitchen is one thing off of my list. Tomorrow I plan to clean the bathroom, living room and sampoo carpets. I am looking forward to a few days of quiet and playing catch up is on my agenda. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I thank you for the extended days of a summer feel. It has been my pleasure to sit out in the warmth and watch the leaves circle to the ground. The smell and the crisp crunch is distinctive to your month.  As the trees become bare it is a joy to peek at the hidden treasure. I see the squirrels have been busy with fluffing their nest for the cold to come.  The early sunset makes the time of light all that more precious.  Your cool mornings and moments of frost and freeze let me know that the time is fleeting. Dear November, thank you for your wonderful gift this year. With love,Wendi My friends, what a gift it has been. Today it will be 72* here. All of that will end as we settle in for the evening. A cold front is moving in and tomorrow the forecast is for a high of 42* with a wintry mix. The child in me wants to stomp my feet and say \"no, no, no!\" The adult in me knows that the extended warmth in November has truly been a gift. A gift that I am grateful for. It has been some kind of week around here. We'll catch up on all the happenings next week. For today I plan to spend time soaking up as much of the beauty and warmth as I can.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I have seen behavior from people from both political sides that left me upset with my fellow Americans.My grandmother had a saying about troublesome things \"the more you stir the pot, the more it stinks.\" I am sad to say that although well intended, I might have stirred the pot a little. I know better.Unfortunately I am unable to step away from social media completely. I know that I mentioned working for a realtor. I am doing marketing for him and part of that job is maintaining his social media accounts.I plan to step away as much as I can and focus on what is important to me. I will be spending time in prayer, taking care of my home and loving my family. Some might say I am burying my head in the sand and quite frankly I am okay with that. My little world makes me happy!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Speaking of my little world, lets see what has been happening around here.I have been taking luke warm to cold showers for the latter part of the week. That is a killer as I like a hot shower. I like to say very warm, but my family says no it's hot! ;) Anyway, we limped along until the weekend when Chuck had more time to look into it.We have hard water in our area due to a large amount of lime. The sediment had built up and burnt out the heating elements and some other part that I can't remember the name of. So, once again we have blown up the budget for the month. Sigh. Who needs gas and food anyway? Kidding, we have plenty of food and money for gas. It is just one more thing that makes us feel like we can't get ahead.I am thankful that hubby is handy and was able to figure out the issue. It was a real pain and took him most of the weekend. We robbed Peter to pay Paul so to speak and were able to cover this expense without dipping into our emergency fund. Good thing as we will have to dip into it next week. That is a story to share for another day. It's all good though. Life happens, and you just keep having faith because it always works out.I puttered around while Chuck worked. My sister works at a local hospital. Drug reps are always providing them with meals. (hmm, and we wonder why our health cost are so high!) She called and asked if we wanted some gravy. Sure! Apparently at the end of the day they throw away all of the leftovers. She couldn't see that happening since these containers had never been opened. I divided it down into 2 cup servings. Three bags went into the freezer and I served some for breakfast today.I thought Chuck deserved a treat after a frustrating weekend. This is a treat I generally reserve for Christmas. Making it now gave me a chance to think about the ingredients I need to stock up on before I make it as gifts.Most of the leaves have finally fallen. We went out and did a quick mow. The grass needed cut in the front yard and this gave me an opportunity to cut up leaves in the back. Chuck will probably cut one more time to mulch the rest of leaves. We have started seeing frost this weekend so that will speed up the rate of falling leaves. I am always sad when the lawn mower is put away for the season. It is one chore that I don't mind and it makes the change of season seem final once it ends.Megan I spent some more time crafting. We are making ornaments for her to give to her classmates and for the grandparents. Once complete I will post a picture.I did some light cleaning and plan to do some deep cleaning this week. I am trying to get things in order before the Christmas decorations come out. I plan to spend a day at my parents. I will deep clean at least their living room. Mom is doing really well but still has to watch moving her left arm and has weight restrictions.Speaking of Christmas decor.... Chuck and his assistant brought up all of the Christmas containers. He took advantage of the decent weather. It really stinks if he has to drag it all up in the snow!Enough chit chat for today. I still need to make the weekly menu, pack lunches and Megan is asking to watch Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!Oh, and be kind with your comments.

This week has been full.Monday my mom had her surgery. Thankfully her cancer was caught early. She received radiation during the surgery and will be on a cancer killing drug for the rest of her life. There is no mention of chemo for which we are grateful. She had chemo with her last round of breast cancer and it is some mean stuff!  I had lunch with my parents Wednesday and she is doing extremly well. In fact, she is planning for me to take her out for a little shopping on Friday morning.  I generally wear my hear up in a bun. The exception for this is if I am going somewhere besides the grocery store.  I take the lazy route and use hot rollers. It beats standing with a curling iron for a half hour. We voted after Megan was dropped off at school. Then it was off for a field trip. We enjoyed election day 1889 style at former President Benjamin Harrison's home. It was a fun, educational trip. (For my local friends I will tell you there is a statue of naked person in the entry. Of course, that is all the kids could talk about. Ugh! Surprising it was there as President Harrison had a strong Prebyterian faith. So strong that he resisted his wife's request for a ballroom on the top floor for year since he didn't dance.)Megan has been under the weather. She ran a low grade fever and missed school. I washed all of the bedding and throw blankets. I even hung the pillows on the line to air them out. I want those germs out of here!We worked on school work at home. Finally she was feeling better. She asked for crafting and Christmas music. A girl after my own heart! I have been planning so we took all of our meals at home. Simple meals, but better on the budget then eating out.  Throw in 13 hours of work for me and yes, it has been a busy week! Things are slowing down.  I will call mom in a few and see if she needs anything done. Then there is laundry to catch up on and I need to pay bills. Yay, for ordinary things!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

She is currently making a turkey.You know what is said about the never ending job of laundry... a blessing to have an abundance of things to wear and a blessing to have loved ones to wear them. :) Oh yes, it has begun!

I guess you could call this Indian Summer although I don't really feel that we have had Fall yet. A few cool days here and there, but it is November 2nd and we haven't had a frost yet!Today is suppose to be close to 80* again. I am loving it! It makes it hard to be inside. My home is need of some TLC so I am forcing myself to stay in and do laundry. I will also to a quick pick up. I know these days are fleeting. I will have plenty of time for deep cleaning when the cooler weather makes an appearance. Time has been spent getting the outside of our little home ready for the cold days that we know will come. The first thing we did was clear out all of the flower beds. Chuck used the blower to blow leaves out from behind the lilacs and away from the fence line. Then we mowed. We still need to mow every week. Especially when the leaves really start to fall.Once that was done we added $20 worth of mulch to the front landscape. The area where the lilies has been cut back really needed it. Chuck pulled out the power washer and gave the house a good rinse.Boy did it need it! I came behind him and washed the windows I could reach. I didn't want to look out all winter and see water spots! There are a few more to go. Climbing more then once step on the ladder is out for me with my bum foot. Chuck will tackle those remaining over the weekend.  The only thing left in the flower beds are the the mums.  While the work took place Megan was busy playing.  She is great about entertaining herself. Since she was little I never let her say she was bored. I told her only boring people get bored as there is always, always something you could be doing. After a few times through the years of hearing there was nothing to I would suggest a few things and if she keep saying no to my suggestions I finally said well then go clean this or that. It was funny how all of a sudden she found something to do! It hasn't been all work around here. There was time spent riding bikes,and we have made several visits to see different family members. If you are looking for me I will be outside soaking in the warmth, sunshine and beautiful scenery the change of season brings. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

After two weeks of sleeping until I awoke it was jarring to hear the alarm. I saw Chuck off and then hit the shower at 6:30. I woke Megan up at 7. I do believe she wasn't happy about the wake up call either!She came to kitchen for breakfast and I packed her water bottle and snack for the day. While she finished eating I went to get ready. I still needed to dry my hair. I threw in a load of laundry and we walked out the door at 7:45.  When I returned home at 8 the laundry was almost complete. I waited a few minutes and then took care of the laundry.  Now it is time to get something to eat.  I ate, had my quiet time and got on the computer for a few. By 9 I am ready to start my project for the day.  This door jam has never been painted.  It was this way when we moved in. Fifteen years later and I am finally getting to it!  Prep work takes a while. I taped it off and gave it a coat of primer. By now it 9:40 and I go back to the laundry.  I fold the load I washed this morning and then put the first coat of paint on the door jam. I then put away all of the laundry. I had worked on some over the weekend and never got around to putting it away.  Then I tackle the ironing.  I work on this until 11. The only laundry left is the items that are air dry only. They are still on the clothesline.  I put the final coat of paint on the door jam. By this time it 11:30 and my foot is telling me to get off of it! I listen and put my foot up for a while. I look at a new magazine and watch some TV.  Our laundry is in the garage and last week I stepped down the wrong way while going out and hurt my foot. I hope in another week I am back to normal. My parents stop by a little after noon to drop off some steel recycle for Chuck. When they leave I make some lunch.  Hm mm... veggie beef soup. I finish lunch about 12:30 and then take the time to pull the tape off of the door jam. Yay! it is done! It is now 1 and I head in to do the job I have been putting off for a week.  I spend 20 minutes inputting receipts and then go to tidy the kitchen.     Much better.  I turn on the dishwasher at 1:45 and call it done. I almost forgot to pull the buns for dinner out of the freezer. Whew! It is almost 2. I slip out to bring in the clothes from the line and then I freshen up before I head out for car line at 2:20. This is view while I wait for Megan. The trees lost quite a few leaves in the two weeks of break. While waiting I read, listen to Dave Ramsey and Chuck and I text some. I love our afternoon texting chats! Once home at 3:20 it is snack time and then homework time. A new book is started for an upcoming book report. While Megan is reading I empty the dishwasher. At 4:30 we stop homework and head outside for some fresh air. Megan hits around a ball while I am in and out getting dinner started. Chuck is home at 5 and finishes up the grilling. We sit down for dinner about 5:15. When dinner is over Chuck helps Megan with a few math problems. At 6:15 we head outside. Megan is playing with a homemade boomerang. Yikes! I watch her and start reading her book report book. That way I will know what is going on if she needs help. Chuck works on replacing the gates that he rebuilt. We stay out until 7. It is starting to get chilly before we head in. Once inside it is into night clothes and then we have family devotions.When we are finished we have our first hot chocolate of the season. Yum!As I type this Chuck is reading and Megan is sitting on the floor with pink paper and scissors creating. At 8 Megan will go to her room to read. Lights will be out for her at 9. Chuck and I plan to watch a television program and will head to bed about 10.Another great day in the life I am grateful to call mine!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I thought I would share what I do with those pictures. I shared that I use Picasa to edit them. I also use Picasa to create a collage. There is a feature that allows you write text on your collage. Here is our finished card. I know that many of you know our last name, but I felt better blurring it out. :)  To print out an actual photo card can run from $0.45 - $1.50.  I print these out as a 4x6 photo. I found this deal and was able to order 99 for a total of $6.41 ($5.99 total + tax). Making each of our photo cards just  $0.06!You can purchase envelopes to mail them out or if you send out a family letter you could fold it around the photo and address the backside of the letter. Receiving them is one of my favorite things about Christmas! I realize that many don't send out Christmas greetings as it can be costly. I hope this helps someone send out some inexpensive Christmas joy!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

We had lunch out one day, went to the pumpkin patch and had lazy afternoons playing games. Chuck is still trying to get his outside projects completed before winter. The frames for the gates have been stained and will be finished this weekend. What seems like a simple project has been a complete pain! After staining he realized they would not work and had to take them apart and rework them. Better to do it right!The evenings are starting to get darker earlier. That means we are back to playing games in the evening. Games on the Wii are always fun!The weather has been unseasonably warm. I think the rain and warmth might have confused my clematis as it is greening up and blooming again!This view makes for a more enjoyable afternoon walk. Megan built this puppet stage out of scrap wood.

In fact the above pictures aren't even the ones we are putting on our Christmas card. :)Several years ago we decided that we couldn't afford the cost of professional pictures. Not only that but we weren't always thrilled with the end result. We experimented taking our own. We use my point and click Cannon and a tripod. I decide what we are wearing and where the pictures will be taken. Chuck then sets up the tripod, positions the camera and sets the timer. Once done we both pick out our favorite family picture and one of Megan. We then vote on which one we will use. A perk of an odd number family is that we never have a tie! Here are some pictures from the past.  2015These pictures were taken against our backyard shed.2014We used pictures from our beach vacation this year. 2013This background was created against our fence! Chuck clamped our bed quilt to the top of the fence and then we put a table cloth on the ground. We pulled out an existing Christmas decoration and a bench to create our backdrop. When you look at the picture above you can see that it is not Christmas card ready. I edit the photos in Picasa 3.  (This can be downloaded at no charge.) It allows me to crop, straighten, and to adjust lighting and such.If, like us, the cost of professional pictures makes you cringe I encourage you give taking your own pictures a shot. I am certainly not a professional photographer, but it works!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I wouldn't want someone to put it directly on the grill. Oh how dangerous that could be with the grease and the open flame!Chuck and his dad replaced the center of Megan's window. The seal had broken and moisture had gotten in the middle of the two panes of glass. It resulted in yuck growing. Originally we were told by the hardware store that our window was not under warranty. When we ordered the replacement window we received a call from the manufactuer asking for some numbers off of the window. It was under warranty and the replacement window was free!! Helping Daddy build new gates. A rare Sunday afternoon date! We shared a small pizza at our favorite pizza place and enjoyed great conversation. :)I am currently waiting for Chuck to return from a doctors appointment (routine) with Megan who was at a sleep over last night.

I guess I needed the sleep.I was surprised Megan hadn't come in. I found her snuggled in bed watching How Its Made on YouTube. (Don't worry there are only certain things she allowed to watch and she knows what those shows are.) I hopped in the shower and then started laundry. Megan and I had a treat for breakfast. I had forgotten how terrible it makes me feel when I have sugar for breakfast. Ugh. Before we headed to my parents Megan and I sat outback enjoying the beautiful morning. She was snapping pictures of us. There are some doozies!We arrived at my parents about 11. They have been working on digging a trench for drainage and Megan wanted to help. While Megan helped out I enjoyed this beautiful view while reading and chatting with my parents. About noon mom and I headed out to bring in lunch and then it was right back to work. My niece, Katie, stopped by which delighted Megan. They have always had a special bond. Katie and Megan made plans for dinner and by now it is 3. I need to head home and tell Megan she must come home for a shower before dinner. She looks like she has had a dust bath!Once home Megan takes a shower and I fold laundry. Katie comes to pick Megan us a little after 4 and they head out to O'Charleys. I look at some blogs and step out to water flowers. They are still hanging on even though I can tell the change of season is affecting them.  Chuck and I chat before he heads home. When I tell him it is just the two of us for dinner Chuck offers to he bring home a burger and fries. Yes, please! It is a treat as Megan doesn't like burgers.We finish up dinner about 5:45. By this time Megan is back home and she rides her bike as Chuck and I take a walk. I certainly need to exercise after my awful eating today!  We are back home by 6:25 and go into the back yard for a little bit. We spend some time swinging. Chuck then goes to work on a project. He is building a couple of gates to replace some that are sagging. While he is working on that I have some quiet time. By 7:30 we are inside for family devotions. We then play a game together.It is now 8:20 and Megan is in her room creating. Lights are out for Megan at 9. Chuck and I are going to watch some TV and I will also check out some blogs. By 10 we'll be in bed also.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Love Your Life...", "date": "Sunday, October 09, 2016", "text": "Anyone who has read my Day in the Life of Me post know that when I am waiting to pick up Megan I listen to Dave Ramsey. Lately he has been promoting his daughters book. The title has made me pause and really think.Love Your Life... Not Theirs. Doesn't that title just speak to you? Now, I can't say anything about the book itself because I haven't read it. I do love life, my life, but...  oh yes, there is a big but coming!Do you sometimes read a blog and think but my life would be better if I had a home that is as beautiful, large and tidy as her home. Do you sometimes look at FB and think but I want to go on a vacation like that!Do you sometimes sit in church and think I am not enough but if I had that many friends coming up to speak to me, invite me out to lunch or over for an afternoon I would feel like enough. Do you ever look at a magazine and think but if only I were beautiful and thin like these women my live would be better.Do you leave a friends home and sigh and think but what if my life were as good as hers?If you say you have never felt any of these things I am not sure I would believe you. We are human and it is hard not to envy what other people have. I can honestly say I have felt all of these things and more!When you stop and think about each of these things you can see that they are generally not true. That beautiful vacation you wish was yours cost them thousands of dollars that was put on a credit card.That person who looks like the queen of social at church is fake and gossips about the people around her when they are not there.Those beautiful, thin women on the magazine covers aren't as beautiful as they seem. If we went to the hairdresser, make-up artist and then used a photo edit program we could get a picture like that also. Well, maybe! ;)Let me tell you a story. I have a long time friend, L. (Don't worry she doesn't know I have a blog!) We have been friends since 5th grade. For a long time I was jealous of the life she had. She was married, living in a nice house, had a baby, didn't work outside of her home and never had to worry about money. Her husband was a hard worker, very handy and both of them were loved by lots of people. I spent many hours socializing at their home with them and with others. Her life seemed perfect! There lies the problem... no one has a \"perfect\" life.She called me one day and told me that she was leaving her husband. She told we what a controlling man he was. How unhappy she had been for a long time. I was heartbroken. For their broken marriage. For their two children. I was also broken for the shattered image that I had of their \"perfect\" life.  They divorced and I continued to pray for them. L told me about a year after their divorce that they were getting married again. I was rejoicing! Sadly the marriage didn't even last a year. It is easy to see the life of someone else and let it make you envious and discontent with what God has given you. My point is that if we are always looking on the other side of the fence or for the greener grass we will miss what is right in front of us. Now, there is nothing wrong with gleaning ideas from blogs, magazines, social media and friends unless it causes you to lose sight of your life. So let's start this week off with an attitude of loving our lives... not theirs!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

{"title": "Monthly Shopping", "date": "Tuesday, October 04, 2016", "text": "When I speak about my monthly grocery shopping I always get some questions. I thought I would give you a peek into what I have done this month. The first thing I do is make a monthly menu. I base this off of what is in our pantry, the season we are in and the sales flyers for the time I will be doing my shopping. This month I went to Meijer, Kroger, Sams and Wal-Mart. I know that some don't have the time or patience for more then one store. I work hard to stretch my dollar so shopping multiple stores works for me. I generally go to Wal-Mart for the items that I don't find on sale. I didn't have a good experience there this month. The cashier had to call over a customer service person and she was nasty about the issue.  I have never had an issue like this before. I am so put off by her attitude and lack of professionalism that I will go to another Wal-Mart or no Wal-Mart at all.  Sams is where I go for most of my meat. I am picky about beef and we like theirs the best. I spent a total of $278.67. That is more then I normally spend a month. I bought some convenience foods such as a large bag of pre-made chicken patties and grilled chicken chunks at Sams and some snack foods. I don't think I have mentioned this but after almost 13 years of remission we found out several weeks ago that my mom once again has breast cancer. At the time of my shopping I wasn't sure what was going to happen. I wanted to have some quick things for meals so we wouldn't be tempted to eat out or grab expensive snacks from vending machines. It looks like she will have surgery on November 7th. Praise the Lord that it looks like she won't need chemo!I also stocked up on some things that were on sale. I ended up with 11 boxes of cereal. That will last us for several months. One question I often get is how do I keep things from going bad. Well, I break things down and use my freezer. I purchase enough lunch meat for the month and then break it down into sizes we will eat before it goes bad. Megan loves pepperoni and often takes it in her lunch. I buy enough to have 1/4 lb for each week of the month. I found a great deal on ham. It wasn't on my list, but I didn't have any in the freezer so I couldn't pass it up. This $19 ham will yield at least 7 meals for us. Depending on what is left over I might get an additional meal or two from this. I already served one portion for dinner and it was delicious!The ground beef I purchased will last us for a couple of months. From about 11 lbs I was able to make 2 meatloaves, a batch of meatballs which will be 2 meals, 3 hamburger patties, 7 packages of ground beef for chili, tacos, spaghetti sauce, or hamburger helper (I don't use much meat in some of these dishes. So far no one has complained about the lack of meatw) and a bag of cooked ground beef. I use this for pizza toppings. I use my monthly menu to make my weekly menu. The week I am showing had a few busy days so there were a couple of quick, easy meals. Once I make the meal I then check it off of the monthly menu. August I made all of the meals I had planned. If I don't make a meal then it is pushed until the next month. You'll notice that I didn't purchase any milk on my large monthly trip. I didn't need it at that time. Through out the month I will pop in the store for milk, bread and fresh produce. There are months when my large shopping trip is light and then I will watch the weekly sale flyer in order to stock my pantry with those items. No matter how good the deals are this month I won't be purchasing anything except milk, and fresh produce. It does take some planning to do this and my shopping takes a full day or two mornings to complete. I like that I don't have to worry about running to store every week. Especially in the winter when I tend to be more of homebody then normal. It also saves me money as I enjoy grocery shopping. It would be easy for me to go each week and fill the cart up. :) I know this isn't for everyone, but it works for me!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Joy in the Ordinary", "date": "Monday, October 03, 2016", "text": "Look around, really look around and you will find joy... joy in the everyday... joy in the ordinary things.Prayer at the poll last week. It makes my heart happy to see young people praying together and giving  praise! I have been working on my mending box. Yikes! There were a couple of pair of jeans that were beyond repair. I cut them up to use for patches and crafting. The weather has turned cool which means Megan has been fighting the change of season crud. The poor girl had it all come out in a rash on her face. Thankfully it is almost gone. A day of rain and a thunderstorm was soothing. The kitchen freezer made a horrible sound one evening. We emptied it and then Chuck got busy. There was ice build up on the fan. It was cleared and the fan couldn't start back up. After tinkering with it for a few we were back in business. I was certainly praying as Chuck was working on this as a new refrigerator is not in the budget! It seems like we have had the new windows for the garage forever. Chuck took time this week to install the new windows. Megan has grown a ton over the summer. There were three shirts that carried over from last year. That meant a trip to the outlet mall. I can find pants, skirts and sometimes dresses at the consignment shop. Not a fan of the shirts I have been finding there so I knew I would have to purchase new. The whole family got a new pair of tennis shoes. Chuck and I can generally wear the same pair for several years. This happened to be the year we both needed new shoes. We have entered new territory as Megan is wearing the same size shoe that I am! I was ready to move on to the women's section when I stumbled across a larger size in the children's section. I can't believe how big she has gotten!This morning I am working on laundry and getting ready to run a few errands. I want to get it all done today so I can spend some time at home this week.  I am ready for some down time!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Laundry Makeover", "date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2016", "text": "Gutting the garage meant that I got to makeover the laundry area. I had a hard time finding a before shot. Lets take a little tour. I did some sewing and made a skirt to hide the ugly plumbing and dryer vent hose. Above the sink there is a shelf that I prettied up with a curtain. It hides vases, plant food and mosquito spray. A shelf was added above the washer and dryer. I already had this container for my laundry soap. It is a container I got years ago on clearance. I hid the word \"snack\" with a label I printed on card stock.  I found these printouts on Pinterest. Originally I planned to frame them. I didn't want to spend money on frames so I went to plan B. I had wood leftover from the shelf. I cut it and used Modge Podge to glue them onto the wood. I spent $0 on these by using material that was leftover or I had on hand. I had Chuck cut some leftover fence boards to create a box for dryer sheets. The shelf was finished off with a container of clothes pins. This area is not pretty but it sure is functional. Chuck built this several years ago for the recycling. It is super convenient since it is right outside the kitchen door.  Behind it is where the iron and ironing board is stored.  I use this bar to hang clothing that needs ironed. As you can tell we still have some work to do in the garage. Trim needs to be sanded and painted. Along with a few other minor things. I mentioned earlier this week that Chuck had built a ladder for this makeover. He hung it from the ceiling and I am able to use it to hang clothing as I take them out of the dryer. It is my favorite thing!I tuck the drying rack beside the sink and hang my clothes pin bag and normally empty hangers above the sink. Next to it is a sign I created is an old thermometer. It means alot to us as it belonged to our beloved neighbor, Bill. It was inside of the shed that he gave to Chuck before he passed away.  I painted the frame for the cross stitch. It is something I made many years ago. I debated on putting it back up. For now it works. I love how bright and welcoming this area has become. It would be easy to say it is just a corner in the garage so it doesn't matter. You ladies know the laundry is place we spend much of our time. There is no reason that beauty can't meet function, even if it is just a garage laundry area. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #5", "date": "Sunday, September 25, 2016", "text": "Monday, September 19thMy alarm went off at 6 am. I saw Chuck off, took a look at the checkbook, took a shower and then woke Megan up at 7. While Megan ate I packed her snack and finished getting ready. We hit the road at 7:30 since the weather wasn't clear. It was a fun drive! Oh, and don't worry I wasn't snapping pictures while driving. I was completely stopped. :)I made a quick stop on the way home. I picked up some fresh items for the week plus a treat. Once home I prep everything and tidy the kitchen. By now it is 8:45 and I sit down for a bowl of Honey Nut Cherrios and my quiet time. When I am finished I read some blogs and then work on some post. By now it is 10:30. I go to make the beds and realize that the nose bleed Megan had the night before got on her quilt. I start a load of laundry and then start on the chore of the day. Monday is my day to clean the living room. Once done I decide to clean the living room and hallway carpet. I finish at 11:45, throw the laundry into the dryer and head out to take a break and get some fresh air. I enjoy watching the birds fly from the feeder to the bird bath. By now it is about noon. I head back inside to start dinner. Can you guess what is on the menu?  Once dinner is simmering I make a lunch of leftovers. After lunch I catch the last of the noon news to check the weather and then fold the laundry. Megan's quilt had come unstiched. I had purchased the thread to repair it and now was a good time to take care of it. Manufacturers don't leave much extra material when they make things. My mom was with me when I purchased the thread and she suggested I use some heat and bond the help with this repair. I am glad she did as it was difficult to stretch the material to get it back together. Not perfect, but better then falling apart. Since the iron is out I do the little bit of ironing I have from laundry I completed over the weekend. While I work on this my sister calls and we chat until almost 2. I quickly put the clothes and ironing things away so I can freshen up. I head out for the pick up line at 2:20. I read, text with Chuck and listen to Dave Ramsey. There is construction on the way home so we are delayed and don't make it home until 3:35. About 10 minutes later then normal. I go out to water flowers and Megan works on her homework. She has three math problems she struggles with. She is frustrated and I tell her to take a break and we will get back to it after dinner. She is off to her room and I finish getting dinner ready. Chuck walks in the door at 5. While he changes I put dinner on the table. We are done eating about 5:30. While I clean up Daddy helps Megan with her math. They finish up and Megan goes to take a shower. While she is in the shower I sweep and mop the kitchen and Chuck goes out to work on a project. I am done with the kitchen a little after 6 and head out to read while he works and the floor dries. Chuck has created a mini ladder to use in my laundry room makeover. Once Megan is out of the shower she sits outside chatting with me before she goes into the garage to \"work\" while Chuck puts his tools away.At 7:15 Chuck and Megan come in from the garage and I make Megan a snack.  When snack is finished we have family devotions, watch some TV and Megan heads to her room to wind down at 8:30. Lights are out for Megan at 9 and Chuck and I go sit on the back porch and talk. We are back in at 9:15 because of the mosquitos. We watch TV, surf the net and then head for bed at 9:45."},
{"title": "Joy in the Ordinary", "date": "Thursday, September 22, 2016", "text": "Look around, really look around and you will find joy... joy in the everyday... joy in the ordinary things. I have been enjoying what I call hot tea/sweet tea weather. I love the cool mornings and warm afternoons. This is my favorite type of weather.  I keep telling Chuck it won't be much longer before his girl is to big for piggy back rides. Her legs will drag the ground before long! I know that this time of playing is fleeting. I will enjoy every moment of it while it last. Although Chuck's dad says then you have grandkids and get to play once more! As you can tell he is certainly a big kid at heart. :) Monday was a rough morning drive! I keep hearing there is an old wives tale that the number of morning fog predicts the number of snowfalls. If that is true it looks like we might have a white winter! There have been several foggy mornings this summer. A favorite snack.I only indulge in these once a year from the apple orchard. That is definately a good thing!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Getting It Done", "date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2016", "text": "We have been spending our weekends getting some things accomplished. Labor Day weekend was the beginning of less humid days and we have been taking advantage of them.My first project was weeding. I finally finished the driveway!I then moved on to the front flower beds and the one behind the house. Not only did I weed but I also cut many things such as peonies and spent hostas down for the season.Chuck worked on changing the brakes on his ride.The big project has been the fence.140 ft complete!There is bout 60 feet left to go. It has been pressure washed and if the weather cooperates it should be stained Saturday. Chuck will be one happy man to mark this task off of the list!I have been feeling the need to create. I am thankful for a husband that supports this part of me and is willing to help out. I am in the process of making a sign. Daddy and his partner cut the boards and put it together once I had the pieces sanded.Creating signs for the laundry area.  I need to do some sewing and we are working on another project for this area. I hope to have it finished this week and be able to show you it off next week.These tables are done! They are sitting in the garage curing. We will deliver them to Josh and Alison this weekend. I can't wait to get them out of the garage!There was a water mishap in the bathroom and ended up in the hall. Yikes!Oh what a mess it was! It resulted in new carpet pad and days of drying out carpet. Thankfully Chuck's cousin use to install carpet. We were able to borrow his tools to put the carpeting back. Before that happened I mentioned that the woodwork could use a good clean. Chuck took care of that and mentioned that it really needed another coat of paint. Since the carpet was out it as a good time to tackle this.Once the trim was done Chuck determined that he needed to remove two doors to get the carpet seamed correctly. Since the doors were off it was a good time to give them another coat of paint also. It became a one thing leads to another project! Two doors to go but that will wait for a little bit.As you can tell we have busy around here. It feels good to get some things done!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #4", "date": "Monday, September 19, 2016", "text": "Tuesday, September 13th  My alarm went off at 6am and another day began. I had gone to bed the night before with a headache and still had a slight one this morning. I wished it were Saturday so I could continue to sleep. I got up and moving since that is what adults must do. I saw Chuck off and then hit the shower. I woke Megan up at 7. She came in for breakfast and I was heating up her lunch. Once her lunch was together I went to finish getting ready. While she was putting her shoes on I threw sheets into the washer. We hit the road a little before 7:45. I noticed that is wasn't quite 60* when I got into the van. Such a refreshing morning. I was home at 8:05. The first thing I did was take care of the checking account.I marked the items that had recently cleared and checked that my balance matched with the banks. I then looked at the menu to see what I needed to set out for dinner. The washer is done and I hang the sheets on the line. I feel like I am moving in slow motion this morning. It is 8:45 and I am just making myself something to eat. A bagel with peanut butter and a cup of hot tea. After I eat I have my quiet time. I just started reading through Matthew. I heard a good sermon recently that touched on living a Christ like life and he recommended reading the first four chapters of the New Testament. His point was that you can't live a Christ like life it you don't know how Jesus behaved while walking on earth. I was ready to start a new book so that is my current plan. I read blogs and relax. Thankfully my headache is now gone. It is 9:45 and it is time to get busy. I set up the end table I am making over. I wipe them down and then begin to prime them. I work on the tables until noon. I check the sheets and they are now dry. I go in to make the beds. I lay the sheets on our bed to sort them out. When I shake them to find a pillow case a moth flies out. I almost had heart failure! Once I take care of that I finish making the beds. It is 12:20 and lunch time. I eat the egg salad I had made the day before. I finish up at 12:40 and think about the chore of the day.It is cleaning the kitchen. Honestly I am tired and really don't want to do it. Instead the do a quick tidy of the kitchen, living room and do a swish and wipe in the bathroom. I am trying to remember if the swish and wipe phrase is from Laine or The Fly Lady. I can't remember. The kitchen will be moved to tomorrow. Since there is 50% chance of thunderstorms I will more then likely be inside anyway. I decide to watch some TV and work on a blog post. At 1:50 I go into the kitchen to marinate the chicken for dinner. At 2 I freshen up and get ready to leave. I head out the pick up Megan at 2:20. I read, text with Chuck a little and listen to Dave Ramsey.At 3:25 Megan and I arrive home. She gets a snack and begins her homework. While she is doing that I quickly clean out the frig.The trash runs Wednesday so the day before is a good time to see if anything needs thrown out. Plus it needed it as the top shelf was a disaster!Megan is finishing up homework by reading a chapter of their latest book.  I can think of a better way to read then hovering between two chairs!After homework is done she ask if she can us the computer to work on a report. She is doing a report on the Gettysburg Address just for fun. While she is working on that I set the table, mix up some brownies and start the grill. Chuck walks in the door at 5 and I put dinner on the table.After dinner Megan is on duty for taking care of the dishes and loading the dishwasher. Once the kitchen is tidy I head out to put the first coat of paint on the tables. Megan is throwing pop its. Chuck works on straightening out the garage. He takes some things to the shed. I finish the tables at 7. Megan is put in for a quick shower and Chuck surprises me by pulling the van into the garage. This makes me happy! :)While Megan is finishing her shower I pack her lunch. It is now after 7:30. We have family devotions and then dessert. This makes everyone happy as I don't bake sweet treats often. It is now 8. Chuck and Megan are watching TV and I head out to read. I am not out long before the mosquitoes become annoying.Megan is in bed at 9 and as I type this Chuck is nodding off.  It is now 9:20 and it looks like we'll be in bed close to 9:30.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Slow Breakfast", "date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2016", "text": "Chuck had gone out to fry bacon on the grill. He came back in and told me how nice it was. I looked at the thermometer and saw that it was 63* at 8:15. Nice for sure! I decided to take advantage of the coolness. While he fried the bacon I set the outside table. I used the pendant straws I had gotten from Target's Dollar Spot. When Megan saw them she said \"Hey, this has my name on it!\" :)It was pleasant to sit in the cool air, laugh, talk and enjoy a slow breakfast. In the hustle and bustle I don't always take the time to make things beautiful for my family. This reminded me that time goes by super fast and slowing down to enjoy and appreciate the ones I love the most is what is important. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #3", "date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2016", "text": "Monday, September 12thMy alarm went off at 6 this morning. I hit snooze until 6:30. I got up a few minutes after Chuck came in say good-bye. I hit the shower and then woke Megan up at 7. Once she was dressed she came out for breakfast. I threw an ice pack into her lunch box and headed off to finish getting ready.I had separated laundry before I went to bed Sunday and had thrown a load into the washer. I hit the start button as we walked out about 7:40. It was a tough drive in as we were headed east and the sun was super bright.  I was back home at 8:05. I switched the laundry. I tossed the finished load onto the living room floor and headed into the kitchen. I started a dozen eggs boiling and then made breakfast.  I took my breakfast and Bible outside. A beautiful morning with the temperatures in the low 60's. By the time I came back in the eggs were ready. While they cool I get dinner started. My sister calls and we chat while I am making the sauce.  Lasagna went into the garage refrigerator and the eggs were peeled. I put some away for Megan to snack on and used the rest to make lunch. It is now 9:30.I quickly tidy the kitchen and then head off the make beds and tidy the bedrooms. I return to the laundry that I left on the living room floor and fold and put it away. I then go and switch another load of laundry. Chuck and I text for a few minutes.  I then turn on a sermon and start working on the chore for the day. Today it is cleaning the living room. It isn't bad so I have a goal  to have it complete before the 30 minute sermon is over. I dust, put a few things away and vacuum. I am done just about the same time as the sermon. It is 10:30 and I am ready for a break! I rest and read some blogs. I do this for about 10 minutes and then I hear the dryer buzz. After this load is folded and put away load three goes into the dryer and start the last load of the day. Now I am ready to start my fun project. I sand end tables that I will make over for my niece. I work on them until almost noon. I am finished and ready to clean then off for paint. I realize that I don't have any tack cloth so I make a run to the hardware store. I return home about 12:30 and am more then ready for lunch. I eat egg salad that I made this morning. I rest for a few and realize it is 1 o'clock. I only have an hour before I need to get ready to leave. I switch laundry and then start my ironing. I get done at 2:05. I hurry to freshen up and then quickly fold a load of jeans before I have to run out the door. Chuck and I text some, I listen to Dave Ramsey and read. These are my choices for today. We return home at 3:25. Megan has snack (I said say cheese and this is what I got!) and works on learning her Bible verse. While she is doing this I get the last of the laundry folded and put away. I give Megan a practice spelling test so we know what words we need work on. Then it is time to head outside and play. I need to head back in and unload the dishwasher and get dinner in the oven. Megan follows me in and is being silly. She attaches her stuffed animal to a stick with fishing line. She asked me to record her with her tablet so she can make a movie. Chuck walks in the door at 5. He changes his clothes and I get dinner on the table. When dinner is cleaned up it a little after 5:30. Megan is playing and we head out to cut grass. Chuck uses the push mower and weed eater. I am on the rider. We finish a little before 7. Megan gets a snack and we rest and watch TV until almost 8. Now it is time for family devotions. Light are out for Megan at 9. I am drinking a glass of water, taking a couple tylenol and then I am heading to bed. I do believe I will have a slower day tomorrow.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The sun is shinning bright but no one is going to complain about that!This little gem hides the KitchenAid mixer. I regularly need a reminder to count my blessing instead of grumbling about the things I can't change. This is going to come down. I thought it was a vinyl cling. Instead it is a floor/wall removable sticker. I am afraid I won't be able to get it off. A fall themed hand towel will take its place. Lets go into the living room. We can chat while you look around. This little guy holds the pumpkin Megan grew. Boy is she proud of it! There is talk about growing a milk fed pumpkin next year. (Anyone thinking of the book Farmer Boy?) Something about entering the fair might have been mentioned also. Not sure about that but I am certainly not going to discourage her enthusiasm. The scent of fall. Yum! Yum!We need to add a trip to the apple orchard to our list very soon.  We might have to make that happen next weekend. The apples don't last long around here.It has been nice having a visitor. The weather is suppose to be pleasant this week. Next time we'll have to sit on the back porch and enjoy the beauty of the changing leaves. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Who can resist a little puddle jumping fun!After weeks of seeing changing leaves on ground I finally caught a glimpse of it in the neighbors tree.The excitement is building as this beauty gets more orange every day.Megan and I have been picking up pine cones. Free craft material straight from our own yard. :)I have been waiting what seems like forever to hold my friends first book. We certainly speak the same language. I love slow and simple!While weeding I found a nest of baby bunnies. The weed patch will remain as we enjoy peeking at these little guys.Although it is still hot, like unbearable 90* hot, these guys have been busy. I think we can all feel that fall is near. I keep finding my flower pots distrubed as they are hiding their nuts.A goodie Megan build at a hardware store workshop and decorated several years ago. It makes me smile everytime I see it. My baby is growing up way to fast!!After a lull we are getting these little guys again. Yum!Plans for this weekend include a minor home project. The rains are bringing in some cooler weather so I hope to open the windows, listen to rain fall and I will be fluffing the nest and decorating for fall.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #2", "date": "Monday, September 05, 2016", "text": "Tuesday, August 30thChuck woke me up at 6:30 when he was out of the shower. It was then my turn. I was able to get ready from start to finish since he was home to wake up Megan and get her moving. He is in an off site location for a class this week. He doesn't have to be at class until 8.Megan was finishing up breakfast and Chuck was heading out the door at 7:15.  Megan was in slow mode this morning. It was almost 7:50 before we headed out. Car line was already moving when we pulled in.I got home about 8:05. The first thing I did was start a load of laundry. I grabbed something from the freezer to thaw on my way back into the house. I made myself something to eat and had my quiet time. I made the beds and then grabbed my shopping list and coupons. I picked up my mom and we were at the store by 9. They are in the process of updating the outside and have recently re-arranged the store.  Every store in the area has now changed their layout. Blah!I was home about 10:20 and then put the groceries away. This is the first stop for my monthly, September, shopping. I will make a Sams run and then purchase things from the sales flyers. I started dinner and sliced the french bread loaf to place into the freezer. That way I can grab slices as needed through out the month. I washed out a couple of bread bags and hung them out to dry. I use them to double and triple bag bread that I put into the freezer. I finished dinner and then made sure the kitchen was tidy. I remembered the laundry and put it into the dryer. It is now a little after 12 and it is lunch time. Left over beef stew and a glass of water. I received a call from the dentist. I had a 11:30 appointment. Oops! I apoligized and rescheduled for next week. I took some down time. I sat outside and then came in to look at some blogs and check e-mail. I had an e-mail from Megan's school asking for additional donations for the bake sale tomorrow. I pulled out the ingredients to make chocolate chip bar cookies.  I went ahead and mixed the dry ingredients to help speed things up later. I chat with my sister while the laundry is folded and put away. I still need to do a little ironing. That will have to wait until tomorrow. By the time I put the laundry away I need to get moving.  It is after 2 so I freshen up and then head for the pick up line.  I spend my time reading and listening to Dave Ramsey. We leave school about 3:15 and head to my parents. We are only there a few minutes. I stopped by to pick something up. Once home Megan tackles her homework and I mix up the cookie dough. It is now 4:15 and Chuck calls to say he done for the day and headed home. I place dinner in the oven along with the pan cookies. He his home before dinner is ready. I am giving Megan a spelling test when he walks in. He checks her spelling while I finish dinner. We sit down to dinner a little before 5. After dinner Megan plays in the living room. A blanket becomes her house. I love when kids use their imaginations!The pan cookies are now cool. Chuck and I cut and wrap them. We debate running out to the hardware store. Megan doesn't want to since she is playing. Chuck has a slight headache so we decide to stay in. Megan plays and Chuck and I chat. We turn on the TV about 6:30 and watch a show Chuck had recorded. Shaq was the guest on Running Wild with Bear Gryllis. I didn't know much about Shaq until this show. He is pretty funny. When it is off we head outside. We watch a storm try to roll in. We hear the rumble of thunder and see the darkening sky. It passes us by without a drop of rain. Megan is in the yard throwing her Frisbee. Chuck goes and and they throw it back and forth for a few. About 8 we head in as the mosquitos are starting to bite. We have family devotions and then Megan goes to her room. She is looking up jokes to use as an opener for a report she has to give at school next Friday. Lights are out for her at 9. Now Chuck is watching TV and it is now almost 9:30. I am heading in to make sure the kitchen is tidy and then will be heading for bed. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Day in My Life #1", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2016", "text": "I was overwhelmed by all of the positive email I received about this post so by popular request I will try to document one day a week. We'll see, as I have to think to stop and document the things that I am doing. :)🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼Wednesday, August 24th Chuck woke me up to say good-bye a little after 5am. He was heading in for a little overtime. I wasn't able to go back to sleep and got up just before 5:30am. I got on the computer for a little bit and then hit the shower. When I woke Megan up she asked for eggs. While she got dressed I put sheets in the washer and started breakfast. After breakfast she was off to put on her shoes and to brush her teeth and hair. I got her lunch and snack ready for the day. She took a sandwich so all I had to do was put an ice pack in her lunch box and add a banana to her backpack for snack.  We hit the road about 7:40. When I came home I put the sheets in the dryer. I had hoped to put them on the line, but it sprinkled on the drive home. The forecast I looked at the night before didn't call for rain, but it sure looked like rain. I went with the safe route. I then added towels to the washer. I had my quiet time. I am currently reading through Ephesians. I then headed out to weed the driveway. It seems to be a never ending job!When I heard the dryer buzz I went to make the beds. I returned to weeding until about 10. I then switched the towels into the dryer and went to start dinner. I put beef chunks in the crock pot to use to make beef and noodles. I then decided to run out for a minute. I went to pick up some mums. I know many of you might wonder what I am doing buying mums when I have mentioned that our budget is tight. The thing is we live on a budget and do budget for things such as this. My total was under $10.00. I consider that doable since this will be my only purchase to add touches of fall. It also helps to make my home a haven. I find that when I feel that this space is my haven I am more content to be home. As we all know staying home is one of the best ways to save money and stay on the budget. By now it about 10:45. I noticed that the basket of shop towels was getting full on my way in so I threw them into the washer. Now it was time to tackle todays big chore. My least favorite of all... cleaning the bathroom!It needs a deep, deep clean. Today I opted for a quick clean. Good thing I did as I had a call from my mom, Chuck, texted back and forth with my sister and had a UPS delivery. It is now 11:45. I grab the towels from the dryer and put the shop towels in the dryer. I hang up the daily bath towels and then fold and put away the rest. Lunch is leftovers. Chili and a glass of water.I eat outside and the weather feels weird so I go in to try and catch the weather. I just miss it! Oh well, I decide to take a break and look a few blogs. I recently found this blog. She spent a year living like the 1940's. Including making meals using rations. Not something I would want to do, but it is interesting to read. She lives a very simple, old fashioned life and I enjoy peeking at the things she is doing. It is now about 12:35. I head out to water flowers. I use water from the rain barrel to complete this task. I had planted pansies in this pot. It sits on the front porch. The heat had killed them and all that was left was an empty, ugly bucket. I planted one of the mums in it. While out my neighbor, Ron, was out walking his dog. We chat for a few minutes and then I head back inside. It is now after 1pm. I watch some TV while I fold the shop towels. When I go to put them away I really want to organize the drawer. It is Chuck's space so I resist! I spend some time working on a blog post until 2 pm. Now it is time to get ready to pick up Megan. I freshen up, run out to get the mail and bring in the trash can. It is now about 2:20 and time to leave for carpool. While waiting for Megan I read some of Laine's Letters, listen to Dave Ramsey and Chuck and I text each other for a bit.We walk in the door about 3:25 and storm sirens start to go off. I turn on the TV and see that there is a tornado warning. I keep watching and see there has been a tornado touchdown about 60 miles north of us.At this point the weather is still north of us. I put Megan in for a quick shower and set things out to finish dinner. Once out of the shower Megan tackles her homework. She finishes some math and we go over her Bible verse.I have keep the TV on and keep popping in the check out the latest. By this time the storm is over the city. I step onto the back porch to see what is happening in my backyard. When I come back in I hear a report that a possible tormado is on the ground. The news mentions the location and says it is heading toward X.  I pause the TV to rewind to confirm that I heard X correctly. Yup, they just listed Chuck's employers name. The phone rings and it is Chuck telling me that he has been trying to contact me for a while, but they are having trouble getting calls out. No surprise with the weather. He tells me that he won't be leaving work on time as they are on lock down and he is in a secure area.I keep watching the news, praying and waiting for another phone call. He finally calls and says they have the all clear and he is heading home.  Praise the Lord! I get dinner finished up and keep it warm as it is taking Chuck a long time to make it home. He calls saying he has had to make several detours due to flooding and is almost home.He arrives home a little after 6 and I am beyond happy to see him!  He calls his mom to let her know he is home and we sit down for dinner about 6:15.By the time dinner is finished and cleaned up it is a little after 7pm. Megan is watching some TV and Chuck and I head to the back porch to chat. The skies are clear by this time and it has left the air humid. We hear a weather warning come on the TV so we head back in. This time it for a flood warning.It is now 7:30. Chuck receives a call from his dad. While they chat I help Megan tidy her room. When Chuck is off the phone we have family devotions. It is 8:15 and Megan goes to her room to draw. Chuck is watching TV and after I finish this post I plan to read.Bedtime for Megan is 9pm and Chuck and I will be going shortly. Tomorrow Chuck will be going in early again for overtime. Besides that the evening was taxing and we are both ready for sleep.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Meal Time: Ravioli", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2016", "text": "It doesn't get much better then serving a home cooked meal. The whole family got in on our first attempt at making ravioli. Six cups of flour, 1 tsp salt, 4 eggs, 1 cup of water. Make a well and gradually add the flour to the liquid. Eventually you will need to get your hands dirty. :)Then you either roll it or run it through a noodle maker. This job was handled by Chuck with some help from his assistance  Using a pizza cutter we cut out the pieces to fill. You can use any filling you desire. This time I made a mixture of ground beef, an egg, grated cheese and a little bit of tomato sauce. Run water around the edge so the dough will stick to each other. Then crimp the dough so the pieces stay together. Place in salted, boiling water for 10-15 minutes. Then place in sauce and simmer. Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Yum!Two things I learned while making this. One is to roll your dough thin. These were a little thicker then they should have been. Number two is to make your squares small. I didn't think about how much the dough would expand and we had large ravioli. Regardless it was delicious and we all agree it is something we will make again.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!*Note: The recipe is for a double batch. I made ravioli until the filling was gone and then froze the rest for a later meal."},

It brought Megan hours of entertainment. I have been watching this guy fatten up. So much for squirrels not liking this seed!Fourth, fifth and six graders took a field trip to the state museum. Treats for the school bake sale. Megan is spending much of her spare time working on embroidery. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Monday, Monday", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2016", "text": "Since I like to peek into the days of others I thought I would share Monday with you. The alarm went off at 6am and I was not ready to start the day. I hit snooze and then Chuck came in and asked if this sleepy head was going to get up. Yes, yes, I am getting up. I saw Chuck off and then hit the shower. By now it is almost 7 and it was time to get Megan up. She was awake when I went in, but not ready to start the day. Once she was up and moving I was off to finish packing her lunch box. She took a hot item so I need to heat that up and put it in the thermos. Next was breakfast and then out the door. We were running a little behind and left about 7:45. After dropping her off I made a stop at the post office and then it was home where I started laundry.  The morning was cool. Actually in the 60's. All of the windows were open to air out the house. I made the beds and then did a quick tidy. Monday is my day to clean the living room. Last week I did a deep clean. I had pulled out furniture to vacuum, washed nic nacks and used the duster to wipe down the walls. Since I had cleaned so deep I skipped that chore today. I can always do a quick dust later in the week if need be. The pleasant temperature were begging me to be outside. I headed out to weed the driveway. Chuck had sprayed it and I wanted to get the dead weeds up. We could use another load of gravel, but that won't happen this year. My laundry is in the garage so I opened the garage door so I could tell when the laundry needed switched.  I dried using a mix of the clothesline and the dryer. I needed to open a new box of dryer sheets. I cut them in half and then dated the box. That helps to know how long they last and how many I should keep on hand. After each load I took the time to fold and put away. It was such a nice day that I took each load onto the back porch to fold.This is my view as I was folding laundry. By this time it about 10:30 and I stopped weeding and headed in to start dinner prep. Chicken pot pie was on the menu. I pulled a couple of chicken breast out of the freezer and put them on to boil. While they were cooking I prepped the veggies. I tended laundry as needed while doing this. When everything was in the pot cooking I did a quick tidy of the kitchen.  Don't look to closely at the kitchen as Tuesday is kitchen cleaning day. After the kitchen was in order it was about 12:15 and I decided it was break time. I made lunch and headed outside. After lunch I enjoyed some quiet time and checked e-mails and looked at a few blogs. I realized it was about 12:50 and knew I needed to get back at it. I had gotten all of the laundry washed, folded and put away. All that was left to do now was to iron a few things. The only left was a lonely pair of tennis shoes that weren't quite dry. It felt good to have all of the laundry complete. I know tomorrow I will be back at it washing sheets. I am okay with that. Laundry means I have love ones around and we have plenty to wear. Both are a blessing.I had been stopping in the kitchen from time to time to check on dinner. It is done! I placed it into a bowl to save until it was time to create the pie. After breakfast, cooking the pie filling and lunch my dish washing servant was full and ready for action. It is 1:45 and I went out to retrieve the mail and then took a look at the garden. Not much to look at as it is almost finished. I then took the time to freshen up. I combed my hair, washed my face and put on fresh make-up. I took some time to reflect on how happy I am to be able to be the keeper of our home. Many women long to be able to stay home and many don't appreciate that they are able to be home. I have been in both places. Thankfully my heart changed and I see what a blessing it is to not only be able to stay home, but to serve my family with a joyful heart. It is not always easy. As long time readers know the debt associated with my heart surgery has been a real struggle for us this year. We recently contemplated me returning to work. I love, love, love staying home so this was weighing heavily on me.  We weighed the pros and cons of different situations. We decided that if we were paying for before and after child care then it wasn't worth it. We also factored in clothing cost and such. One evening we thought Megan was asleep and she wasn't. She overheard us talking about me returning to work. She came out and the tears were flowing. I reassured her that her needs would still be meet and that taking care of her and Daddy were my top priority. We knew I needed something to work with Megan's school schedule. Not easy! I thought I had found something. It was a childcare position that was 8-2. It would be tight getting there in the morning, but I thought I could make it work. I went in, but the position was filled. They did have a 2:30-6 position. I couldn't take that and still care for my family.The lack of jobs that meet what I needed and the closing of the door for the childcare job left us feeling that maybe the Lord was leading me not to return to work. Even fast food and drugstore jobs are not super flexible with scheduling. We have decided that I will not return to work and we will just keep going. Now it is about 2:20 and it was time to hop in the van and head for car line. I checked the temperature before I left and the air was about to cut on. I closed the windows before I left. I always get there early. For one I like to have some quiet time to read. Secondly, I like to get out of the parking lot before the area public schools let out and it gets crazy out. If I don't time it right I have to go through two round abouts with the high school drivers. Scary at times! We are home about 3:25 and then it is snack and homework time. Tonight it was light. A couple of math problems to finish, Bible verse to practice and then we went over spelling words. Before 4pm we were done!I started to unload the dishwasher while Megan finished her math. When she was done she helped me. We went outside and threw the Frisbee around for a few minutes. I then sat on the back porch reading while Megan played. Soon it was time to go in and finish dinner. I rolled out the crust and then made the pot pies in ramekins. I made a large batch of pot pie filling and had two bags for the freezer. This will come in handy on a day I have to be out of my home or when I am not feeling well. Chuck arrives home at 5pm and dinner is served. (He is ready for dinner when he arrives home.)After dinner it was back outside for Megan. She played ball until the kitchen was tidy and it was time to leave. We went to my parents to drop a couple of things off and came home with a bucket of tomatoes. This will be the last of them as my parents garden is about done also. I won't complain as we have had an amazing harvest this year. Once home the windows were opened back up. Megan watched some TV and then we played a game of UNO. Family devotions are done, Megan is tucked in bed and it is now a little after 9pm. Chuck is watching some TV, I am getting ready to read and then we will be off to bed shortly. I really enjoyed today. The weather was great, I went about my task in an unrushed fashion and felt truly blessed to be keeper of the home. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Wonderful Weekend", "date": "Monday, August 22, 2016", "text": "The forecast for Saturday was for more rain. We planned ahead so we could get some things done in the garage. Megan set the mood for Saturday by declaring it \"Be Happy Day.\"A happy day it was! We didn't leave home all day. The day started by hanging a cabinet, my craft paper roll and the saw horses. Here is where the planning comes in. Friday night Chuck pulled all of the things that go into the garage from the barn and put it on the back porch. We loaded it all into the garage just before the rain began. The the fun of sorting, purging and organizing began. We found a few treasures along the way.An old typewriter and a blast from the past picture. Taken the summer of 2000 when Chuck and I had been dating for not quite a year. Awww... to be that young and thin again!We made progress!Sunday was a beautiful day. Megan was out with her grandparents for the day. They spent the day at a state park.Chuck and I spent the afternoon cutting grass, running to store for fresh fruit and enjoying the company of one another sitting on the back porch. A mix of work and pleasure... my favorite kind of weekend!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Frugal Friday #9", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2016", "text": "Cut down old closet doors to use as shelves in the garage. Gratefully received a box of books from my mother-in-law. Saved some yogurt that was getting close to its expiration date.  I piped it onto a cooking sheet that had been in the freezer. I then put it into the freezer overnight.  The next morning I put the yogurt back into the original container and popped them into the freezer. A refreshing, healthy treat. All meals were eaten at home. I pulled out the next season clothing for Megan. By just sorting the container I have two paper boxes to look through to see what can be taken to the consignment shop. I also have a large pile of clothing for her to try on. That will give me a list of items we need to purchase and additional items to add to the consignment box. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more as I see prices of just about everything increase. I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

This is from Saturday and Sunday. Since then it has rained each day and looks like it will until Monday. We needed rain, but geez.❤ My girl ❤May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Bake Sale", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2016", "text": "Remember those cupcakes I showed you last week? Well, it is okay if you don't since I will show you again. I made them for a bake sale. Each Wednesday Megan's school has a fundraiser call Bakery Day. Parents send in  24 treats and they sell them after lunch to raise money. One of the joys of private school is they are always trying to raise money.  :) Anyway, I am on the schedule for twice this month. I thought I would show you a new way to use a piping bag. First you lay out a piece of plastic wrap and plop your frosting in the middle. Wrap it up to form a log of sorts. This is probably the most important step. Wrap it in plastic wrap again. I will show you why it is important in a minute. ;)Now you pick up the ends and lightly twist. When you are done it should look like this.I practiced doing this the weekend before and had a slight mishap.Oh yes, this happened! While twisting the frosting came out. Like an explosion! Not only was it on me, but also the table, floor and Megan's favorite dinosaur. Yes, I am laughing. Really, what else can you do! That is the reason you wrap it twice. ;)Now you feed one of the twisted ends through your piping bag. Pull it until you see the frosting and then cut the excess plastic wrap off. When you are finished or need to change colors you simply use the top twist and pull it out. You can go here for better instructions. I sometimes get tired of clicking to do somewhere else to find out information so I showed you how I did it. I sprinked jimmies on the top and then was ready to wrap them.  I usually put them in cookie bags and tie them off with some ribbon and a spoon. These are a little time consuming so I generally only make them twice. One Bakery Day and then again for the bake sale after the Christmas program. The rest of the time it they get cookies. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Right?Chuck took a vacation day this week. We ran a couple of errands and then stopped for lunch. We ordered the daily special of a burger and bottomless fries for $6.00.  We ordered water to drink and then used the remainder of a gift card Chuck recieved from work. We dined for no money out of pocket. We were sent home with some ice cream cups from a birthday party we attended. A perfect treat for the humid weather we are having. Not tons of things to report this week. I spent most of my time at home. I have been busy baking for a school bake sale, canning and doing normal homemaking task. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money.

Not only do I love the fresh air, but I enjoy hearing the birds sing and the flap of the flag. Laundry is all caught up and put away. Ignore my broken down laundry basket. This basket isn't even six months old and is broken already. Sigh. I find it extremely disappointing that things aren't made better.An afternoon snack. Megan found a dinosaur sandwich cutter while we were grocery shopping with my mom. She asked for it and when I said not that day she asked me to put it on her Christmas list (Megan rarely ask for us to buy her something while out). My mom put it her cart to purchase for Megan and she is delighted with it. My ride is back home again. It had an ignition issue. It just happened to be part of a recall so there was no charge.  Yay! We actually came out ahead, even with the towing fee,  as we only had one key fob since we purchased the van used. The new ignition automaticly came with two since that is what is provided with a new vehicle. The key fob runs about $200. It was be wonderful to have an extra in case of loss or breakage. I am so happy, but my dad might be even happier as he doesn't have to drive carpool for me. :)May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "My Weekend", "date": "Sunday, August 07, 2016", "text": "One of the things I love about weekends is the slower pace and of course having my family home with me. Saturday started with a nice breakfast.Although we are headed right back into hot and humid days we did get a break this weekend. It was wonderful to step out into the cooler morning and soak in some sunshine. I took advantage of it to hang out a load of laundry. When it is super humid it takes a long time for the clothing to dry if at all. I took the time to shred and put some zucchini into the freezer. This will be used for bread, muffins, coffee cake and don't tell my family but it might end up a pot of veggie soup. Not everything this weekend was positive. My van would not start with the key. It would start with the remote start, but would not move from park. Chuck tried many things and sadly it had to be towed to the dealer. We are praying it is a quick and inexpensive fix. There were also birthdays to celebrate this weekend. My niece, Katie, turned 21! We went out for a big family dinner. One of boys I used to babysit turned 7!  Sunday afternoon we went to visit Chuck's grandmother. We took over some garden goodies to share. Chuck has an aunt that never married. She lived on her own out of state for most of her adult life. She retired and moved back in with her mom about three years ago. It was an answered prayer as Grandma has had some issues with her balance and was going to need some help. She gets along well for 88 years young.While there Chuck trimmed some tree branches that were hanging over the sidewalk and Grandma and Aunt Brenda showed me their embroidery.  Oh my! They do beautiful work. The block above is will be added to her growing stack to be made into a quilt. They found some iron on transfer books at a thrift store for $0.25 and purchased the entire stack. I looked through them and brought a few home with me. I am going to try my hand at making a fall themed table runner. It was a lovely visit and there is so much wisdom and knowledge to be learned from older generations if you listen and ask the right questions. We came home and sat out enjoying the beauty of the day before making a simple meal. Chuck has a catered lunch at work tomorrow so this is no need for leftovers for his lunch. We enjoyed a meal of bacon, eggs and pancakes. The kitchen is tidy from dinner and ready to start the week. Chuck has his bag laying over the chair and his items on the table (umbrella, keys, wallet, work badge etc), Megan's breakfast dish and vitamins are set out for her (Chuck takes something to eat at work since he leaves early and isn't ready to eat yet). Lunches, breakfasts, snacks, water bottles and such are in the refrigerator. Tomorrow Megan is taking a leftover casserole for lunch so her thermos is out on the counter for tomorrow.Megan is fresh from her shower. She laid her clothes out for tomorrow morning and joined us for our evening Bible time. As I type this, evening is settling in. Megan is in bed reading for a few minutes longer. Chuck is watching some of the Olympics and I am getting ready to catch up on a few blogs and then retire for the night. I am grateful for a weekend that was full of wonderful things. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Whew! The early morning are something both Megan and I need to get use to again. The one nice thing is that I am getting back into a nice routine. I love routine!My mom and I are still working at preserving.  Mainly tomatoes as we have been picking gallons of them each day. I ran across a great deal on blueberries so into the freezer they went. I am finding more and more of the changing maple leaves. I have mixed feelings about this.  Back to school means I need to plan more. The afternoon/evening hours are busy as it is homework and then straight to preparing dinner. I have been trying to get into the habit of pulling out non perishable items I need to complete dinner before I leave to pick up Megan. My parents are building a small shed. Megan has loved helping out. She carried out 2x4's and laid them out to help frame a wall.  Amazing what you find when you take the time to completely download your camera. :) Two weeks ago Nascar was in town and we made a quick stop to check out some cars. I need to run and take care of one of those ordinary task as I just heard the buzzer on the dryer.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Out My Backdoor", "date": "Wednesday, August 03, 2016", "text": "Most evenings Chuck and I slip out the backdoor for some fresh air once Megan is in bed. Last night when I went out it was still to hot for the back porch so I headed for the swing set. I sat on the swing and this was my view. The picture doesn't do it justice. The sky was full of the most beautiful shades pink, white, gray and blue. Seeing God's beauty always makes me pause and sigh with contentment. As we were chatting I looked down and saw this. I couldn't believe my eyes! I can't believe the leaves are changing color already. I don't usually see this until September. Makes me wonder if we will see an early fall. Nothing would surprise me as the weather has been different this year. The summer mornings have had tons of dew and many mornings with light fog. Not our typical summer morning. We are still in what are called the dog days of summer with hot and humid days. Did I mention humid?  Seeing this has motivated me to make my fall cleaning list. I think I will start it next week so when the humidity lifts I can concentrate on outside chores. I am an outside girl so this humid weather is causing me to be indoors to much!Fall is coming, but I don't want it to come too quickly. As ready as I am for the humidity to wain I want to enjoy each and every day left of summer! Anyone else seeing signs of fall? May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

August means a return to routine around here. Megan went back to school last Thursday. Fifth grade! She returned to her small, Christian school and has the same teacher she had in third grade. She is a great teacher!A new month means it is time to get things together.Shopping for the month is almost complete. I will go out tomorrow to finish up. There were a few things the store was out of so I will go to another one. Now, don't judge the list! I keep a well stocked pantry so my shopping trips never look normal. The monthly menu is also made. I picked off the items for this weeks menu. I noticed that I am heavy on green beans as a side dish this week. I must have had a taste for them when I made the master menu.Not to worry as I have a variety of veggies from the garden and in the pantry so I can mix and match. The monthy budget is complete. We are still using Every Dollar and it is working well for us. Summer caused us to loosen the financial reins. We will be tightening up the budget so we can continue to tackle what feels like never ending medical debt. I keep reminding myself we will get there. The garden is still producing well. I need to pick green beans again and am picking tomatoes, cucumbers and zucchini almost daily. It is once again hot and the rains have slowed down so we have started to water.I packed up some empty jars to take over to my moms (for putting up tomatoes). If I think about all of the jars representing canned goods I would have purchased at the store this past year it makes it all worth it. Plus it just taste better!I hope to get some projects complete. Some thirft side table need to be painted for my niece. The storage in the garage also needs finished. The last shelf is in the works. I am beyond ready to see things neat and organized in here. Ready or not August is here. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Frugal Friday #7", "date": "Friday, July 29, 2016", "text": "I received a grocery coupon for $5.00 off your next purchase. I used it to purchase a gallon of milk, loaf of bread and a package of bacon. I spent $1.07 out of pocket. It made an easy BLT dinner on a hot evening. My sister needed a new refrigerator due to a temperature control issue that had already been repaired once. They decided not to put any additional money into a 14 year old frig. That benefited us as we have the same model. Chuck picked it up and striped parts off of it. We now have a working ice maker for no money out of pocket! Eventually the frig will be taken to the scrap yard earning a few dollars. We were given three free sandwich cards as a thank you for some volunteer work. Thanks to the cards and planning carefully we were able to enjoy a frugal dinner. We each used our sandwich card then added a large waffle fry to share, a small shake for Chuck and Megan and I shared an iced tea. We were able to eat a meal out for under $6.For entertainment we spent many afternoons cooling off in the pool. Since the pool is in my parents' backyard the only cost was gas. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more as I see prices of just about everything increase. I find it encouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Letting Go & Moving On", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2016", "text": "You know that since we left our previous church I have struggled. Friends, I don't think you know just how much I have struggled. I have been carrying a burden of bitterness and resentment. This had consumed me and held me hostage for far to long. I was hurt by the treatment of other. Unloving and unkind behavior really hurts.It had taken me far to long to realize that by holding on to this I was only hurting me. Those that caused me to feel this way are carrying on with life, but I was stuck. I had let the hurt and frustration fester and wasn't handling it the correct way. I finally said \"No More!\" I finally did what I should have done from the beginning. I took it to the Lord. I don't know how many times while teaching Sunday School we talked with the kids about looking to God's Word for answers. I began by looking up verses on bitterness. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; Hebrews 12:14-15Then I moved on to verses about forgiveness. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. John 20:23I was holding on so tight to my bitterness, resentment and hurt that I wasn't able to let go. While I was thinking about things and replaying them I was retaining the hurt and letting bitterness take root. No amends or words are needed from others. I need to forgive and let go of the bitterness and move on. For no other reason then I need it and it is the right thing to do. I won't say that this has been easy.  I went back to that church recently to take my mother-in-law out for lunch. (she works in the office) I thought it might stir up some old feeling, but it didn't. There were some ladies there that I made a little small talk with and you know what? I can feel that the burden toward many at this church is lifting. Oh, how great it is! May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

To say it has been one of best summers in a long time would be an understatement.I know that summer is technically still in full swing, but due to a balanced school calendar it is winding down for us. Megan starts school Thursday. *gulp*  Am I ready? Nope. Honestly, I am never ready as I enjoy time with my girl.School supplies have been purchased and sorted. Some in storage and others in bags ready for the big day.We had some plans to make the most of our remaining time. Some things happened and other didn't. One of the reasons is because it has been hot! As I type this is the current temperature.Yup, still 94* and it is now after 7 pm. That has led us to spending a bunch of our time cooling off.  We braved the heat at the beginning the heat wave to take in a baseball game. Chuck received six tickets from work and we were able to take his dad and a couple of cousins. There have also been an outing on paddle boats and several sleepover.We have been enjoying lots of fresh foods. Some from the produce stand and most from our garden.  The garden is growing like crazy! So much so that I am now giving green beans away. I picked over six pounds of cucumbers one day. I took them to my moms and we made sweet pickle relish for the first time. A project or two is under way. I won't tell you how many years painting the rain barrel cover has been on the list. ;) We know that a tighter routine is on the horizon, but for the moment we are choosing to savor our last days. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It was great to see them!Chuck is working on staining the remainder of our fence. We are hoping for some dry days around the weekends to get this completed. A day spent at the zoo with cousins. Megan was given a balloon that had an LED light inside.

This is what I was able to harvest this evening. A little over 8 lbs of zucchini. There are some cucumbers almost ready and tons of blooms. It is crazy how well things are doing.  Last year I planted 6 cucumber plants and only got a handful and this year I planted 4 plants and they are going wild.  I am hopeful that I will get enough for some pickle relish.  If you I don't make it back here this week you will know I am busy in the garden and kitchen.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I put desiccant packets in to prevent moisture. The cost of ingredients have increased to make this. I will note when I start using this and how long it last. I need to calculate the cost and see if it would be more cost effective to purchase detergent on sale. I saw this trick from Wendy at My Abundant Life. She diluted her hair products with water and then uses a pump to control the amount used. I purchased the pump bottles of product when there was a promotion to get a gift card in return for the purchase. I emptied half of the product into an empty bottle and then added water to the remaining. (I marked a line on the bottle for half to take the guess work out.) Gave it a good shake and it was ready to go. Here is a tip for those hard to see through bottles. Shine a flashlight through the bottle and you can see how much is in there. I haven't noticed any difference in the effectiveness of these. Using the pump does mean I am using less. I keep wanting to give the shampoo another pump. I had gotten use to having a lot of shampoo bubbles. I have resisted and can see no difference in my hair. This is a win, win by stretching the product with water and by the control of the amount used. Yay! I am slowly. Very slowly getting my mending/altering done. Almost all of Megan's pants/skirts that don't have an adjustable waist band need to be taken in. A 10 year old with a size 7 waist is hard to buy for!  I can't imagine the cost if I had to take things to an alteration shop. Chuck has been working on pressure washing the fence in order to stain it. We had hopes of starting it this weekend, but the rain said otherwise. ;) We had plans to purchase the stain in stages as needed. When we went to purchase the first batch of stain we saw that the store was running a 4th of July promotion that would give us a $40 rebate on each 5 gallons purchased. We made the decision to go ahead and purchase 10 gallons. We saved $111.58 by using Chuck's Veterans discount and the rebate.I added to my pantry. Mom gave me a rain check to purchase these beans for $0.33 a can! I added a case (24) for $7.92. Awesome as the best price I had seen was $0.50 a can.  I am not sure how I missed the sale, but I am sure glad that she caught it. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more as I see prices of just about everything increase.

I might have gotten spoiled by the yummy breakfasts we made together. I found these straws at Target. Aren't they the cutest?!Megan hopped up on the counter grabbed the tablet and then proclaimed \"yup, it is suppose to be raining!\" After a blah few day I woke up early so I could have some quiet time. Quiet time with Megan about and quiet time with her asleep are quite different. I have been struggling since we left our church. I ended up having a good cry Saturday evening which allowed me to release my bottled up emotions to Chuck. I am in a better place after we had a long chat.  We have gone to a small Baptist church. There are just under 50 people which feels different. Originally we thought we wanted a little larger church, but now we aren't so sure.    I like it as the people are friendly and the pastor is expressive while giving his sermon. I think he might be a little too expressive for Chuck. He didn't grow up in a good environment so excitement sometimes takes him back to his dad and his constant yelling. Personally I like a little fire in the delivery of a sermon. So the search continues. The garden is doing really well. Cherry tomatoes and green beans are now being harvested and it won't be long before other things are ready.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

There were homemade cookies made with red, white and blue M&M's to enjoy.The plan was to go to a parade and then have a picnic. The parade was cancelled and we knew the park would be too wet for a picnic. Megan was disappointed. (I admit I was also.) The picnic was moved to the living room floor! Chuck turned on some patriotic music and we enjoyed our picnic.   Chuck picked up a couple fireworks for the backyard.   Fireworks were not cancelled, but we decided not to go as it was starting to rain again. We were able to see fireworks thanks to someone near us setting them off. Megan declared this wonderful as she was able to stand on our sidewalk and enjoy them with her pajamas on!It may not have been the day we planned, but it was still a great day! May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The plan was to take a ride in this. Sadly the balloon ended up being grounded due to the wind. I think we were more disappointed then Megan. The balloon is inside of a 1800's living history museum so we were still able to have fun. Along the way there were activities kids could participate in for a small fee. Megan was able to make a bracelet out of a copper pipe, create a pinch pot out of clay, dip a candle and make a turtle by doing silver casting. She enjoyed all of these things. Of course, you could skip these things and still have fun! We usually do without complaint. ;) It was a beautiful 80* day with a nice breeze. It made for an enjoyable day to walk the paths. All of the hands on activities make this a really fun place. Once we were headed back home we gave Megan a choice of two places for dinner. She choose to have steak for dinner. The evening ended at the in-law for presents and cake. What a fun day we had celebrating Megan! There have been so many changes in Megan this last year. She is leaving little girl behind and becoming more and more of a young lady. Not only in her looks, but in her actions. I love her gentle heart and quick wit. I am looking forward to watching her grow this next year.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It just happened to be on a day with a forecast high of 95*! We might have been a little worried. Everyone stayed inside the church until just before the wedding. We took our seats and were pleasantly surprised by a nice breeze. Alison made a beautiful bride. She and Josh are high school sweethearts and have been patiently waiting for this day. Before Josh proposed he spoke with my brother-in-law and agreed not to be married until Alison graduated from college. She graduated in May with her RN. She has had a very exciting couple of months!I might have tagged behind the photographer to capture these shots. Megan was super excited to be in the wedding. The photographer snapped a few shots off of her camera with her phone and sent them to Alison.

It had an elastic waist and instead of messing with the professional hem I shortened it from the top and re-attached the elastic. I went to the grocery store. You might wonder how that can be frugal since a trip to the store can about break the bank! Well, first off I used funds that we made from a garage sale a few weeks ago. Secondly, having things on hand mean we won't run out to pick up a few things and leave with a cart full. I keep a well stocked pantry and hope to make this last until mid July. Saved electricity by letting mother nature do the drying. I don't usually dry bath towels on the line, but this load had a sour smell. A little sunshine and fresh air took care of it. It pays to be on the clean up crew at events.

We were able to get tickets for Sunday afternoon.   We heard the story of Yannely who is from the Dominican Republic.  When her father found out her mother was expecting he asked that she be aborted. Her mother refused and her father abandoned them.. She lived in poverty with her mother. Can you imagine this as your kitchen?  She was introduced to Compassion International where she had a sponsor and was able to attend a Compassion school. She needed her fathers last name to graduate. She found him and he turned from her. Her mother went to the officials and begged for them to let her graduate. Yannely said it was hard on her to have her father abandond her not once, but twice. Through her time with Compassion she came to know that she had a heavenly Father and that gave her comfort. Her mother was able to convince the officials to allow her to graduate. She went on to college and fulfilled her dream of becoming a doctor. She now works at a free clinic in the city where she grew up. If you have the opportunity to visit I highly recommend it. It is wonderful for children to see things from a hands on view. This experience was both heartbreaking and encouraging. I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak.

She called to say she had extras after making the dress and asked what the wedding flowers were. I love the daisies she made!Megan made the J+A sign. She had the idea one evening while Chuck was cutting up a limb. She found the scrap wood and told us what she wanted. I helped her stain the wood and get the spacing down when gluing it together. I am impressed with her creativity!I keep the centerpieces simple. The buckets are from the Target Dollar Spot and I bought garden daisies so they could be reused. All of the buckets had a part of 1 Corinthians 13: 4-13 written on them.I found a fun game on Pinterest called The Price is Right. Everyone has to guess the retail price for each of the items and the one with the most wins. We had tons of fun with this game. It was really hard since we have frugal friends and family and we all keep wanting to write down the sale price. When I was calling out the retail price people were calling out the rock bottom sale price and telling Alison not to pay more then that for the item. :) It is by far my favorite shower game EVER.

I can gladly say home is my happy place! Especially when my family is here. :)We planned to give our home a little attention and tackle a project. Painting this porch post was on the list. I will give you hint and say it wasn't used for a porch. ;) I will post what we did with it tomorrow. We didn't add new mulch last year and the flower beds were in desperate need. The seasonal flowers have been planted and the mulch spread out. We could use some more, but it is much better. That will be a project for another day. We did some work in the garden. Megan planted the last of the seeds.  Corn and cantaloupe. We feel like we had a productive weekend. It wasn't all work though. Our new back porch table was put together. We have some very pesky squirrels who love to rip into our chair cushions and take away the stuffing for their nest. We tried to keep them up but it was hard when we were working outside and using the chairs mutliple times a day. Just leaving them out for an afternoon sometimes resulted in those those little devils ripping into one. After 15 years of replacing a cushion or two each year we decided to purchase a set that did not require cushions. In the long run it should save us money and frustration. We broke in our new furniture by dining al fresco several times. It was a warm weekend so I made sure to stop and rest multiple times. I enjoyed a nice view while reading in the shade. The weekend ended with a fire. Where I was queen of the burning marshmallow! This doesn't normally happen to me, but almost every one I touched caught on fire. Oh well, we got a good chuckle out of it. As sad as I was to see this weekend come to a close I am once again reminded that my heart truly is always home. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "May Madness", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2016", "text": "May has been a hopping month! The schedule is full, full, full. We started off by celebrating our 15th anniversary on the 4th. Megan was rewarded for being a top fund raiser. She received a ride in the Chicken Limo to have lunch at Chick-Fil-A.Some of her best friends went with her which made it even more fun!Spring concert. The fourth, fifth and sixth graders went on a field trip to the Indiana State Capital. A few days were spent at camp. The highlight of the trip for Megan was catching her first fish!!I got to see my boys! (the ones I watched for years) Eli had his pre-K graduation. Hard to believe he will be in kindergarten!Megan took first place in the science fair. She received 100% from both judges.The last day of school was celebrated with awards and then the annual balloon launch.Spring has been crazy. It has been cooler then normal and we have had an abundance of rain. Finally it warmed and dried up so we have been squeezing home things between the busy. The garden was planted this week. All of the garage things we were storing on the back porch were put away and things were removed so it could be cleaned and arranged for summer.Chuck also celebrated his 45th birthday on Monday. This week alone we have something on the schedule for each evening. Throw in a curve ball of my uncle passing away that added an even later Wednesday evening out as Chuck helped my dad pick up something from my uncles home. Chuck asked for one thing for his birthday... a weekend at home. I made this coupon for him.He plans to redeem it this long holiday weekend. I do believe it will be a gift to the whole family!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Let's Catch Up", "date": "Sunday, April 24, 2016", "text": "Hello! I hope that everyone is enjoying Spring. The weather is warming up and the outside is calling my name. I can hardly wait to start working in the garden and planting flowers. Still a little early here since our frost day is mid May.Things have been hopping around here. I hosted a bridal shower for my niece, Alison. It was wonderful! Once I get all of the pictures sorted out I will share.Megan ended up spending a couple of days home from school. She was having sinus issues and ended up with terrible headaches. Thankfully the worse of it was only a couple of days. She spend most of her time resting on the couch with an ice pack and cool wash cloth. We made the most of our time when her headache was mild. She was quite spoiled by her afternoon tea and toast! I can't begin to tell you how many episodes we watched of this.In the mist of the crazy we have made a really hard decision. We are leaving our church. :( It has been a long time coming. We tried some other churches a couple of years ago, but didn't leave. Our church was in a transition period then with the pastor leaving and we had hope for change. We stuck it out and the new pastor has been there for a year now. There have been changes, but not in the way we had hoped. We have watched family after family leave. We have watched the budget shortfall continue to grow. We have watched some of the leaders of the church lead, do and say things that we don't think are Christ like.Church should be a place of unity, love and refuge. Of course, you will feel convicted and squirm a little in your seat from time to time. We haven't been leaving feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the week ahead. Instead we leave discouraged by the things happening around us and quite frankly it has been a struggle for me to get up and go.We have a commitment to teach Sunday School through the first Sunday of June. We have already asked not to be put on the new teaching schedule and will let the appropriate people know we are leaving that last Sunday. (I know that might seem rude, but if you knew the circumstances of what was said when a family recently left you would understand why we are not giving proper notice until we are ready to walk out the door.)I am not sure if peace is the correct word to use when describing how we feel about leaving. We did not make this decision lightly. We feel that we did all that we could according to Matthew 18:15-16. We had a meeting with our pastor to express our concerns and to get a clear understanding of were the church is headed. We also spoke a couple of elders. We are sad and heartbroken that it has come to this, but we know it is the right thing for us.We have no idea where we are going once we leave this church. We are praying for direction as we search for a new church home.My guy has been working tons.  He is on mandatory overtime through the first week of May. He has been logging many hours. This week he clocked out with 70 hours!In the middle of long work hours and hard decisions life has happened. There is a new baby on our street and a meal was delivered.Thursday night we attended Megan's spring choir concert and Friday we volunteered at the school carnival.Only 4 1/2 weeks of school left! They will be full weeks as there is a science fair, camp to attend, testing week and field day. Not that I want to wish my life away, but I am ready for summer break. I have been grabbing slow anywhere I can. Megan has been bringing me fists full of love.Before we retire each evening Chuck and I have been sitting on the back porch. Sometimes we talk, sometimes we pray and other times we hold hands and soak in the joy of the ending day. Some seasons of life are hard, some seasons of life are busy, but through it all life is good!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I am hosting a bridal shower for my niece on Saturday. I need to wrap things up for that, attend to finishing up a project or two, along with the normal daily grind.

Enough variety that I didn't have to cook one evening. Free and easy... I like it!  What is a girl to do when she doesn't have a little house to play with? Well, create your own with popsicle sticks! Spending the morning doing dinner prep makes dinner time run smooth. We made a bunch of cookies. A double batch actually. Some to eat, plenty to share and some to put into the freezer for another time. Science fair experiment in progress. A selfie I found from my silly girl! May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Working Weekend", "date": "Monday, April 04, 2016", "text": "Chuck was off on Friday and we spent a lot of time working this weekend. We were beat last night. So much so that the entire house was in bed by 9! I knew that this was coming so on Thursday I made sure all of the laundry was done. I had a few things hanging around that had stains so I tackled those while I was at it. There is end in sight for our never ending garage project. Friday the painting was completed. I put two coats on the walls myself. Whew! I am not as young and energetic as I use to be! Thankfully it is done. Saturday Chuck had his dad come over and they put the garage door opener back up and then we put the cabinets back up in the laundry area. It took all three of us to get them up. What do you think of the blue? It is not a color that I would normally pick. I love it in this space.  When we returned from church yesterday I put things back into the cabinets. If time permits Chuck will help to put the doors on this week. Then the laundry will take a back seat as shelving is added the garage and things are sorted and put back into their place. I hope that doesn't take long as I am itching to get the laundry put back together and prettied up.  Once that happens I will be back with pictures. Now it is time for me to get moving. Megan is returning to school after a two week break. After I drop her off I am off the the grocery store and then I have tons of things that need done. Working in the garage means the inside of my home has been negelected! I am also going to try to pick up sticks so the grass can be cut. The temperatures might not say spring, but grass cutting and a long project list does!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Tidy Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, March 29, 2016", "text": "Sunday night I made a comment about how our home went from neat Sunday morning to disaster Sunday evening when we were barely home. Chuck just laughed. Please tell me that I am not the only one that experiences that!? Monday took me away from home running errands and then we went out for dinner so not much was accomplished. After a slow start to the morning I told Megan it was time to get up and moving. A day to tidy things was in order!I made Megan her list and then I started on the kitchen and moved on from there. It always amazes me how something as simple as making the bed will make a room seem put together. Megan's room is another story. This is the before and she has worked on it. She even marked tidy room off of his list. Not quite to my standards so we will be going in there together. The only way she will learn tidy is if I continue to teach her. Picking up and running the vacuum make such a huge difference in the feel of a home. Honestly it doesn't take long to do this. Now that things are fairly tidy I am moving on to other task. Laundry is in the works with a load in the dryer and the last one in the washer. The menu for the week has been made. Better late then never, right? Working on the budget is on the agenda also. I hope to get many things accomplished today as I will be out tomorrow morning taking my dad to an appointment. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

All I had to do Sunday morning was put the green beans into the crockpot to heat. Sunday morning we woke up to beautiful blue skies and sunshine. Can you beleive how tall Megan is? It won't be long before she outgrows me!After church we hurried home to change and grab a few things before we headed over to my mother-in-law's. The older cousins hid the eggs and they made the younger ones really hunt for them!We enjoyed the company of extended family along with two families from our church. There was great food, wonderful fellowship and lots of laughter. A wonderful day to celebrate our risen King!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Busy Days", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2016", "text": "It has been a delightful week having Megan home. Chuck took off a couple of days to get some things done. It wasn't all work as we also spent some time out and about. We took Megan the farm store to see the baby chicks. She would love to have a few. I will admit that they are super cute and the idea of fresh eggs is tempting. The thought of the responsibility that comes with it such as cleaning out the coop and the start up cost keep me from saying yes. Grandma was taken out for lunch. There has been lots of home time. Cooking together.There is always plenty of housework to be done. Of course there has been time to play.Megan wrote a heartfelt note to the family of a local fallen officer. We had no idea she was doing this. She came out and asked Chuck to mail this for her. Oh my, how happy this made my heart. It is moments like this that let you know that you are on the right track with parenting.  Chuck was able to get his project to the point of paint. We primed the ceiling the night before he returned to work and I primed the walls the next morning. The next time I tackle the ceiling I think I might need a hat! Thankfully I was able to scrub it all out as Megan and I had plans to get our hair trimmed today. Home and family make me a happy woman. I am happy to say that I have enjoyed an abundance of both this week. Tomorrow will be another busy day. A trip to a clothing store, the grocery store  and then I need to get started on some things for Easter. There are eggs to dye, food to prepare, and then I need to take time to slow down and prepare my heart. We hope that Chuck makes it home in time to attend the Good Friday service at church. I hope you all enjoy your time with family and especially Sunday service worshiping our risen Savior. Happy Easter!  “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. John 19:30"},

When I woke up this morning it was in the 30's, but will be climbing to the high 50's by this afternoon. Typical spring! Things are greening up, blooming, and the birds are singing. Oh, how my heart rejoices!I am busy sprucing up the place. A huge load of stuff was taken out of here this weekend. It was taken to my parents attic. The plan is to have a huge yard sale the end of May/first of June. After my kitchen project a few areas have been neglected so I am catching up on some things.Megan is on spring break for the next two weeks. We have nothing planned. There will be plenty of slow time at home. Yes! Chuck is also off today and tomorrow. He is hopeful to get a project to the point of painting. I am looking forward to sleeping in, spending time with my two favorite people and puttering around my home.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Kitchen Refresh", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2016", "text": "I am finally ready to show you my kitchen refresh! This will be a picture heavy post. You might want to get nice and comfy. I will say that I had a really hard time getting some of these pictures. I could not get the lighting right. So, lets just pretend they all look really professional! ;)Here it is finished.This is the before picture. After I painted the walls I knew that cabinets would have to be next. That is the bad thing about painted cabinets they tend to show wear a little easier. An easy, yet, time consuming fix. Painting the cabinets had been on my radar for well over a year. It never seemed to make it to the top of the to do list. I have had my eye on cabinets that had bead board in the center. New cabinets are certainly not in my budget! Last year I had purchased some wallpaper with the look of bead board. Once the doors were prepped I added the paper to the center. My dad has suggested that we run a bead of caulk around the edge to prevent the corners from coming loose. Chuck agreed that was a good idea. My amazing hubby spent an evening taking care of that for me. It really finished them off. Unless you touch them you can not tell that the cabinet doors weren't purchased this way. I painted them antique white. For two reasons.  Number one I had the paint left over from painting the end tables and number two my appliances are the color called bisque . Basically off white. I am delighted with how they turned out!Now that all of the hard stuff was out of the way the fun began. I had some things that I had been saving. The thought was that I would use them if we ever moved and I had a larger kitchen. It is not super likely that we will move. I decide that this is where I have been planted and I need to make this a place that I love. An afternoon was spent digging out my treasures and cleaning them up. I started with the corner cabinet.I used an old milk cooler my father-in-law has given me. It says \"Loaned by Banquet Ice Cream and Milk Company.\"  I did purchase the milk bottles to go along with it. There is a pottery pitcher peeking out in the back. I added two half gallon jars. One belonged to Chuck's great-grandmother, Dora, and the other one to his step grandmother, Barbara. I also added a jug that we found when we were chasing roots on the old family farm after my grandfather, Pop, passed away. My mom told me that this jug was used to hold homemade root beer. I remember homemade root beer at Mom and Pops!This shelf is above the refrigerator.  Chuck went to pick up some steel recycle from my cousin and ended up coming home with a box of vintage Blue Mason jars. He does speak my love language! I repurposed a wooden tray that Chuck had made years ago to hold pots of herbs in the kitchen window. Now I know they won't come tumbling off of the shelf! When Grandma Barbara passed away last year we were able to go through her apartment and take whatever we wanted. I ended up taking a wooden cheese box and an ice pick.I love that the box is stamped with the price!I spruced up the top of cabinets. Getting rid of some things, moving things around and borrowing from other areas of my home. Above the sink I added a new valance, an old scale from my father-in-law, the chicken wire basket that the plants are in is something for my niece's bridal shower. When I purchased it I this is mind with it for after the shower.My favorite thing is the addition of the scale! This is one of the things I was saving for a larger kitchen. I am extremely happy that I decided to go ahead and use it. It makes me smile every time I see it. It is also handy for holding fruit and freeing up counter space!The soda crate is something that my mom gave me several years ago. I am not sure, but I assume it came from her parents. Her parents grew up on farms during the Great Depression and were newly married during WWII. They always had the neatest stuff because they never threw anything away!Again the finished product. You all know I do things on a budget, so here is the break down for the kitchen refresh:Wall Paint            = Free  (used leftover paints to mix a new color)Cabinet Paint       = Free (used paint leftover from another project)Window Valance = $11Decor                  = $20Total                       $31If I add the wallpaper that was purchased a year ago it would bring the total of this refresh to $61.The thing I like most about this space is that is filled with things that have meaning to me. I am loving this space!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I have now moved to my kitchen cabinets.  Can you tell what has been added? There is some caulking to do and then they will be ready for a fresh coat of paint. A friend sent me a text the other day asking if I was done painting. I replied no that I was moving on to the cabinets if it didn't kill me. Her response was hard work never killed anyone. True, but it sure does make a girl sleep well at night!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "One Thing Leads to Another", "date": "Monday, March 07, 2016", "text": "I woke up and hit the floor running. Megan was up and almost ready for school. While she finished eating and getting her shoes on I threw in a load of laundry. I came home and took care of a few morning task. Then I grabbed my list and was gungho to get things things done. I started in one corner and as I was taking things down to wash I noticed the long time pen mark on the wall. Several years ago (about 3 years to be exact) Megan left a pen on the table and Abraham (one of the little guys I use to babysit) found it and marked on the wall. The wall had been scrubbed and even a magic eraser was used. It faded, but it didn't take it all off. I know, stubborn stuff!Anyway, that is were one things leads to another. Since I was going to the trouble of taking everything down I decided to go ahead and paint the kitchen. I really didn't want to spend any money on this project. I was chatting with my mom and she said she had almost a gallon of paint left over from a project. Off I went to pick it up. It wasn't exactly the color I was looking for so I got creative. I raided my painting cabinet and that is where the fun began.I mixed a little of this and a little of that and came up with the perfect color. Pictures don't show the color well. The kitchen was a mustard shade of yellow. (below color on the left) I wanted to lighten it up a bit so I mixed a color that reminds me of sunshine. I guess you could also describe it as a lemonade color, but I like sunshine the best. :)I am going area by area. Cleaning, painting and then putting things back. I am moving things around and searching what I have to make things look fresh. I hadn't planned to spend any money on this, but I did end up purchasing a valance. Here is a sneak peek of the fabric.The walls are completely painted! I am still working on sorting a few areas. The scope of this project will certainly slow down the spring cleaning. In the end the delay will be well worth it. Once I have it done I will be sure to give you a tour.

Of course large porches would be a must!Look at the windmill! I adore them.  It is nice to dream a little. Soon it is time to head back to reality.

The new menu has been made.  The budget is complete. We did receive some disappointing news budget wise on Friday. Chuck found out that there will be no pay increases this year. Ugh! I guess we shouldn't be overly surprised as his company closed a facility in Virginia and California toward the end of 2015. Oh well, I will be grateful he has a job!We have tried using the envelope system. I find that it doesn't always work. I don't like to carry a large amount of cash with me and keep forgetting to grab the envelope before I leave. We have come up with a solution. The money for gas is put on a gift card and then groceries and eating out funds will be left in the bank. I will carry a note card (thanks for the idea Laine!) with the amount available for eating out and groceries. I will adjust the amount as it is spent. It is time to do some Spring cleaning! I used a Hallmark program on the computer to create a blank list for this purpose. Sure a piece of notebook paper would work just fine, but I do like pretty things!The first room to tackle will be the kitchen. I have been feeling a little bit of discontent around here.

I have been looking for things to decorate a bridal shower. I found one of the items I was looking for, but at $15.99 each x 5 items I am on to plan B. While there Megan and I did pick up something fun.I have been searching gratitude since that is where I feel my attitude has been lacking. I used my fun item as a starting place to make something to point me toward a grateful heart. As I have been searching scriputre about gratitude this is what spoke to me. Be grateful for God's love.Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!For His mercy endures forever. 1 Chronicles 16:36.Be grateful in every situation.In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 1 Thessalonians 5:18Be grateful For God's gifts. Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! 2 Corinthians 9:15Grateful for God's deliverance over my life.I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. Romans 7:25Be grateful I can go to Him in prayer and He hears my petitions. Be anxious for nothing, but In everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. Philippians 4:6We had a beautiful, slow weekend. Plenty of time spent at home, dinner with family, a little creating and enjoyed a wonderful sermon given by a friend of ours.

Once we were finished and retrieved Megan from my in-laws it was already dinner time. We ended up eating out with a gift card and just like that the weekend was over.That seems to be the theme for this week... busy, busy, busy!  I spent a morning out with friends enjoying breakfast. Fun! I really need to do that more. A day out shopping with my mom and then lunch with my parents. A high school friend called and said she was in the area and stopped by for the afternoon.The rest of the week the calendar is full so I spent some time in the kitchen this morning. Stuffed shells for tonight, dinner at Chick-fil-A tomorrow for a fundraiser and then pulled pork in the crock pot ready to be heated up for Friday. I am trying hard to prevent us from grabbing something on these busy days.All this week has been spirit week at school. Each day has a different theme. Megan came out after bed last night and reminded me that today was Disney day. Bad mom moment as I knew about this, but forgot. Oops! I got creative and this is what I came up with. Nothing like a little late night crafting!Saying \"cheese\" with my favorite guy!I am sad to say my tulilps are gone. They sure were beautiful while they lasted.I received some fun mail. I haven't participated in a swap in a long time. Thanks Chrissy for the book!As most of you know I am a homebody! I also like things to be slow and simple.  Whew! It has been anything but that for the last week or so. I am looking forward to the weekend. We have nothing planned once school ends Friday and I am delighted. I won't be posting anymore this week.

A habit I am trying to break. My parents have been building some storage in their garage. Megan found the scrap pile and has happily been creating. Snow with more in the forecast for the week. Megan said she thought we needed a new groundhog since she forecast 6 weeks til Spring and it doesn't feel like Spring! Caused me to chuckle. Spring will be here before we know it. My servants have been working hard for me. I am thankful for them as five loads were completed yesterday. Can you imagine heating water and using a scrubbing board or running each piece though a wringer. No thank you! Chuck reached over and I took his hand. Megan then ran over and joined us. :) I had the camera near as I had just finished empting the card. So glad I did as this made my heart happy! It seems that beef stew is just as bad as a pot of soup when it comes to not being able to make just a small batch. Or is it just me!?May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Showing A Little Love", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2016", "text": "I enjoy showing my family a little extra love on Valentine's Day. Sunday is already a busy day with church so I set the table the night before.I pulled out an existing table cloth and went from there.  I cut a piece of scrapbook paper to fit my cake stand. Then set the table using some Valentine plates I had purchased several years ago for the kids. I added ribbon around the jugs (recycled coffee containers) and then some paper straws the I found at Target a previous year.Chuck went to pick Megan up from a friends house Friday evening and came home with my favorite flowers. I divided the bouquet into two Mason jars for the table. Love!We don't go all out with gifts for this holiday. I picked  up a balloon last week while at the grocery store and filled a gift bag with an inexpensive craft, a tube of sweet tarts and a compass that we forgot to give to her at Christmas. Oops! (She is obsessed with asking what direction we are going while in the van.) I know it was a hit since I found it tucked in her boot while sitting in church!Since Sunday breakfast needs to be quick I served scrambled eggs and canned cinnamon rolls. To spice them up a bit I added red food coloring to the icing and thinned it down some. Then sprinkles were added. Simple, but effective!The rest of day flew by. We stopped for pizza for lunch, came home and I took a nap. Then we went to visit the in laws and my parents. A day that was certainly filled with those I love!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Frugal Friday #4", "date": "Friday, February 12, 2016", "text": "It has been quite chilly this week. That has made me rather lazy. All I have wanted to do is snuggle under a blanket and read. That certainly isn't blog worthy! Let's get started on the ways I saved this week.Megans' Valentine Party is this afternoon. She used valentines that I purchased several years ago on clearance. Normally $3.00 and I purchased them for $0.30. I am not sure there are enough left for next year so I will have to keep my eye on the clearance rack.I needed a dozen cookies to bring for the class party. Instead of purchasing cookies I whipped up a batch. Cookies made at home are certainly less expensive then store bought. Funny note on the cookies. As most of you know Megan attends a small, wonderful Christian school. On the form that came home asking parents to bring in treats it had in parentheses for some items \"store bought not neccessary.\" I found that funny since so many schools (especially public) won't let you bring in homemade treats and in some cases no food treats at all. (Yes, I understand food allergies.)One of the little guys I use to watch was a little under the weather so I was asked to watch him. It brought in a little extra cash to use toward our debt.  It also made my heart happy when he ran into my arms!Once dinner is complete I generally pack Chuck his lunch container before we eat. This ensures he has lunch which is a huge savings! He walked out without his lunch one day and didn't have a back up (he tries to keep a can of soup in his desk) and spent over $6 for a sandwich, chips and a drink. I can't imagine spending that everyday!       I used $20 of my grocery money to stock up my pantry. These were on sale for $1.25 a bag and are nomally $2.05 a bag. I ended up with 16 bags. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts is cetainly true. We have seen the \"fruit\" of our frugal habits as we were able to pay off some of my medical debt this month. I find it ecouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

{"title": "Frugal Friday #3", "date": "Friday, February 05, 2016", "text": "I started the week off with a shopping trip. I withdrew cash for our monthly groceries and hit the store. I ended up going to three different stores. While at Kroger there was an employee walking around with a cart load of bread. It was nearing the expiration date and each customer received one item for free! (I ended up with two as my mom was with me and didn't want hers.) I also scored some cooking spray from the markdown isle for $0.99 a can. I had just purchased a can on my WalMart trip for $1.99! Those will go into the pantry for later use.I prayed on my way out that morning that my money would stretch and I would make good shopping decisions. I was happy to see that I had almost half of my grocery budget left!While making cornbread to go with our chili I had just a little bit left in the milk jug. You know just enough to irriate the next person if you put it back into the frig. ;) I didn't want to waste it so I opened the new jug and added the remaining milk. I know this a minor thing, but it falls into \"waste not, want not.\"I use to go and have my eyebrows done at the salon. It is one of the things I have given up so we can pay debt down. I started using tweezers and I wasn't a big fan of solely doing it that way. My solution was to purchase this kit.Around here it cost between $6-7  to have your brows professionally done. I was able to purchase this for a little over $5. I should be able to use this kit for months saving a ton of money.So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more as I see prices of just about everything increase. I find it ecouraging to hear about other frugal adventures.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "A Special Treat", "date": "Wednesday, February 03, 2016", "text": "As many of you know I recently found Laine's Letters. Oh my, what a treasure they are! Although many of them are preserved there are many missing. As I had been picking and choosing letters to read I found that many of the archives didn't contain the letter. Oh, how sad!I had a fear that over time more of her letters might disappear so I knew I had to do something about that. Last Friday I mentioned that I had been working on a project that was taking quite a bit of time. Well, here it is...I copied the letters that are still available into word and titled them.I added page numbers so I could make a table of contents. I wanted to be able to find a letter that addressed a particular subject or had a theme pertaining to a certain scripture.I took it to an office store to have it printed and coil bound. There were so many pages that they had to divide it into two parts!Besides the fact that I was concerned about losing the letters on the web I also enjoy reading things in hard copy. There a heap of wisdom in these letters that I can see myself looking up verses, making notes and some day passing it along to Megan. There is so much to glean that I foresee that this is going to help me in my quest to thrive!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It is such a joy for the sun to be shinning through the window while I am making dinner. This weekend we had a taste of spring. When the themometer hits 63* at the end of January you must take advantage of it. I washed bedding and hung it on the line. Line dried sheets in January... squeal! That is a smell that just can't be bottled. A few touches were added for Valentine's Day. After Megan tidied her room Chuck went to check it out. He came out dressed like an old west bandit. Megan and I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Of course I had to grab the camera and chase him down the hall.I love this man!

{"title": "It's a New Month", "date": "Monday, February 01, 2016", "text": "I don't know about you, but I find it hard to believe that it is February already. January usually seems to drag on. Not this year! Part of it could be that it has been a mild winter in Central Indiana. Other thing might be that I have been getting out and about this month. My parents are great about calling about once a week and inviting me along while they run an errand or two. I think that along with the weather has keep the winter blues away.So how did you do last month? Not too bad around here.I have closed out the January budget. Thanks to receiving our state tax refund it wasn't quite as tight as we initially thought. It gave us a little (just a little) bit of wiggle room. I took a hard look to see where I need to tighten things. The grocery budget and eating out top the list. Surprise! Surprise! We did pretty good on eating on, but we need to do better. I might have to pass up some of those good deals to stock my pantry. Sticking to my grocery budget is a must! I also need to find a way to drop the electric bill. I don't know why, but it has been a lot higher the last two months. Winter shouldn't make a big difference since we have gas heat. Something to work on!I am not quite ready for February. I don't have the new budget made. I worked on it some yesterday. I wasn't feeling my best yesterday as something I ate Saturday gave me terrible heart burn. I felt miserable all of yesterday.  Thankfully, it is better today. Anyway, I will get the budget finished today so Chuck and I can go over it tonight. Do you and your husband handle your finances together? If not, I encourage you to do so. I use to handle everything. Then I got to the point where it was too much for me. For a variety of reasons such as a tight budget and loose spending. Now I make the budget and Chuck and I sit down and go over it and he basically approves it. We will then sit down a couple of times a month to make sure we are still on the same page. It has done wonders to relieve the pressure I was feeling and we are certainly now on the same financial page.I keep my budget in Excel, but am trying something different this month. Has anyone used the every dollar budget? I keep hearing about it on Dave Ramsey and thought to try it out. When I mentioned it to Chuck he said he was going to mention it to me. Great minds think alike!I did manage to get the menu ready for the month. Now I need to finish the grocery list and hit the store one day this week. I went the entire month without drinking any of my beloved Diet Coke!I won't say it has been easy. There have been times when I really wanted on. I did have a couple glasses of Sprite this month. Not a habit I want to get into though. I don't want to trade one habit for another!Ready or not February is here so lets get working on looking well to ways of our household!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Thankfully I am in the finishing stages. Anyway, here we go. I cashed in my Walmart Savings Catcher money to do some shopping.Everything I bought on my shopping trip this week was sale items. I didn't get a picture, but I was able to get a few things to stock the pantry. After baking dinner the oven was opened to release the heat back into the house. Thus keeping the heat from cutting on just a little longer. Use caution when doing this. You know your children and if this would be a safety concern. My ride has spent lots of time here. I am still running on a tank of gas that was put in almost two weeks ago.We had a few not so frugal things this week also. Like take out picked up on Chucks' way home from work on a night I had a terrible headache. We both regretted it and agreed that next time he would just come home and whip up some sandwiches or Hamburger Helper. I also made a splurge purchase and bought a Valentine type shirt for Megan while at the store. Yes, it is cute, but certainly not a need. Live and learn, right?So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money. The old adage that every penny counts seems to apply more and more as I see prices of just about everything increase.

I thought about using a SOS pad on it, but I am not sure it would really help. For one thing it has/had ;) a non stick finish and I wondered if it would start to flake. Plus baked on baking spray is one tough thing to remove after it has been baked on repeatedly. I have new pans. Two to be exact. They were gifted to me at Christmas from my mom.I will be honest and admit I debated about letting this go. I know... yuck! Why is it when we know something is no longer good for us or meets our needs is it so hard to let it go? Trust me when I say this applies to much more in my life then a muffin pan! I can feel my heart changing this year. As this is happening I feel the need to let some things go. Not an easy thing to do, but I can see that it is neccessary if my heart is to truly change.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

We stayed up way too late after the movie talking. It was super nice.There was no school on Monday so Megan made herself a cozy are where she played, rested  and watched some YouTube shows.I looked out the window and saw a bunch of birds resting in the neighbors tree. Is this a sign that the birds are moving back in? I know that it is to soon for thoughts of spring, but a girl can hope! I surprised Megan with a breakfast tray that I served in the living room. When she first saw it her smile was priceless!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Keeping Home with Gratitude", "date": "Monday, January 25, 2016", "text": "When you are home every day it would be easy to lose sight of all the wonderful things that have blessed you. Take my counter top for example. The glue came loose in one area and the loose area caught on something and broke. I could easily grumble about this. It has been on the list of things to take care of for some time.It doesn't bother me in the least. Each time I wipe the counters or walk out to the garage and notice this I am grateful.Grateful that I no longer have the blue counters under these.Grateful that I counter space.Grateful that I have a handy husband that will eventually fix this.Sure there are those that live in magazine perfect homes but for most of us we live in an imperfect place. Now I am not saying there aren't days that I don't dream for that perfect place. After all I am human! Dreams are great, but if you let them become wants and must haves then you are setting yourself up for discontent.In reality, I am grateful for a home full of family, love and life. Sometimes life gets messy and counters break. That is okay because things happen when you actually live in your home.Instead of picking things apart and grumbling about it I am choosing to show gratitude!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Frugal Friday #1", "date": "Friday, January 22, 2016", "text": "When I go to the grocery store I always look in the clearance meat section. I found some reduced pork chops and was able to put three meals worth into the freezer. This was a great week for me as I also found some reduced ground beef another day. I stayed home as often as possible this week. I drove carpool each day (we live close to Megans' school), went out with my parents one day (my dad drove), went to Bible study on Wednesday evening and took the van for an oil change.  I searched for a coupon before the van went in.  I saved $15 off the regular price. As of this morning the gas tank was almost full. Yes! (Generally, Chuck fills the gas tank in the van on the way home from church on Sunday.)I knew that we were not going to eat all of the leftovers so I pulled them out to put into the freezer. I had leftover roast that I cut up that will show up on the menu next week as hot beef sandwiches. There were a bit of rice and chicken stew left. I placed those into container and will pull them out of the freezer for a quick lunch for myself. I also divided up the rest of the spaghetti sauce I made on Sunday and now have two meals worth in the freezer. While out with my parents we stopped by the store. I needed potatoes and they were $4.99 for 10 lbs. I decided to pass and then Mom mentioned that they were on special for $1.99 at another store. Dad graciously took us there to get potatoes. Chuck took a look at the carpet cleaner and was able to get it working! He spent about five minutes on it and said it was something minor. I am thankful for a man that is willing to care for our things. So there you go. I hope this encourages you to do things to save money.

{"title": "Homemade Noodles", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2016", "text": "Oh, my friends, if you haven't tried to do this then you must! Super, super easy. Let me share with you how easy it is.The recipe:2 eggs, beaten1 t salt4 T milkMixed together.4 cups sifted flour1 t baking powderMixed together.Add the wet into the dry and mix until it forms a ball.Making dough into noodles:Divide the dough into 4 sections. Dust with flour and roll out each section. Roll, roll and roll some more. Then you are ready to cut noodles.Several years ago I was gifted an attachment for my Kitchen Aid that makes a variety of cuts for noodles.This gadet is fun, but not neccessary. Honesty, it is pricey and this cheap, um, I mean frugal girl would never spend that amount of money on it.So, if you don't have one of these all you need is a pizza cutter.You cut the noodles any way you want. I found that when I was hand cutting my noodles they were much wider then the ones I put through the noodle cutter. Either way they are both tasty.Generally I make my noodles in the morning and then lay them out on a dish towel and cover with a dish towel to dry a little bit. You don't have to do this, but I find that it helps dinner time to not be so frantic if I do a thing or two before hand. Drop into boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes. I have used these to make beef & noodles and chicken & noodles.If you end up with more noodles then you need, No problem! You can put them into a freezer bag and then added them frozen to your next dish.My next thing is to use the dough to make ravioli. I will you know how that works out if and when I tackle that. My advice for cooking for scratch is to just get in the kitchen and try. I have had a few disastered, but most of the time my family is very happy. Megan has already asked when we will be making noodles again!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

My carpet needs a good clean so I dug this out. Unfortunately I could not get it to work. It was not releasing any of the cleaning solution. Ugh! I will ask Chuck to take a look at it and get back to it another day.  Oh well, at least I tried. So much bettter!I even made a list of some things that I need/want to do in this room. Now that I have finished this I will move on to finishing some laundry and tidy the rest of my home.

{"title": "An Afternoon Well Spent", "date": "Monday, January 18, 2016", "text": "Sunday we oversleep. Well, maybe I should say I oversleep. I woke up well after nine and couldn't believe it. I walked into the kitchen and Chuck was unloading the dishwasher. When I asked why he didn't wake me up he said he thought I needed the sleep. I had gone to bed with a bad headache so I probabley did. He is a sweet man and I am thankful for him. There would be no church for us as we wouldn't have time to shower, eat and make it on time. We took our time getting ready and then headed out for a quick trip to Sams. There was some reduced for quick sale meat so we stocked up. We purchased two packages of ground beef and a package of strip steaks. Once home I spent the afternoon taking care of things in the kitchen. After a lunch of homemade pizza I got busy. I had some bread I had been saving and knew I would need bread crumbs so that was first on my list. Then Chuck helped me to wrap the meat. I ended up with 14 packages of ground beef, four strip steaks, three hamburger patties and a meatloaf for the freezer. I will share that I ended up with so many packages of hamburger because I only use 1/2 lb at a time. It is a way to stretch the budget and Chuck doesn't notice the reduced amount of meat. The strip streaks are a treat as we don't buy many because they are expensive. If I don't need leftovers for Chuck to take for lunch each steak should feed all three of us. I used some of the ground beef to make meatballs. Part of this double batch of spaghetti sauce will be for dinner one night and then the rest will go in the freezer. We should get three meals from this. I also made a batch of bread dough. I made rolls for dinner and then froze the rest. Now I can pull them out to thaw and rise and have fresh rolls in a jiffy! I know they don't look pretty, but I hope they will look better as I practice more. As this was going on dinner was cooking away in the oven. I feel like it was a few hours well spent!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Sure the celebration looks different as we age, but life is certainly something to celebrate.It was a very low key event. It snowed in the morning and was extremely windy.Chuck took Megan off to school and then returned home as he took a vacation day to spend with me. He returned home with a treat of Chick-fil-A sweet tea.I certainly didn't expect this since the roads were not in the best shape. Surprises, even small, are nice!Chuck baked a cake (using a mix from the pantry) and then said he would need to go to the store for frosting. Since our budget is tight (and I went over on my grocery budget this week!) I said I would take care of it.It is the first time I had made any kind other then white buttercream. It was fun! Not exactly a keeper as it was more of a chocolate fudge and we prefer milk chocolate. If you don't get in the kitchen and try then you will never know what you are capable of doing!For dinner steaks were grilled, I baked some potatoes and threw together a salad.Enjoyed while wearing my very own birthday hat! Then it was present time!I had given Chuck the Kohl's cash I earned with some purchases from Christmas along with money earned from my reward card.  The only cash spent was for the food grade bucket and the candy that Megan insisted he buy. I am happy with everything especially the bucket.He even got the great sealing, easy open gamma lid for it. He knows me so well! (FYI:  our local Lowes carries these buckets and you can also get them from Amazon.) According to one little girl no birthday is complete with out cake. :)Another birthday is on the books.

One of the things I am doing is making time with the Lord my #1 priority. My plan is to use my morning time to read through the Bible in a year. Not sure if I will make it 100%, but I am going to give it my best shot. I had fallen out of the habit of making a to do list every day. I am back at it and it really helps me to get things accomplished. There is something about marking items off of a list that motivates me. I had fallen behind on laundry with my surgery and Christmas. I am happy to say that is now caught up. I have a strong dislike for piles of dirty laundry. Doing load after load of laundry made me realize how low I was on my laundry supplies. I now have a full bottle of stain remover and a new batch of laundry soap. I have been staying home as much as possible. Not only do I save money by not being anywhere to spend, but I also get a lot of things done. I did go out one afternoon when my parents called to see if I wanted to go with them to the mall while they made a return. Mom needed to stop by Sams while they were out and I was able to stock up my flour supply. It is divided up and in the freezer. In a month I will move it to a food safe five gallon bucket. I have been consistantly following my menu. I am all ready to go for the week. Since my heart surgery my energy has doubled! I still have some things to work out so I feel 100%. I have been amazed by the difference it has made.

That means it is time to have your plans in place.I worked on a menu for the month.I don't follow this by date. I use it to choose what I want to put on my weekly menu.Once I made my monthly menu I went through my pantry to see what items I don't have and made my grocery list that way. Generally depending on funds I will either do a large monthly shopping trip or do it bi-weekly.This month I was able to do a large shopping trip. We are set for the month other then a quick trip in for milk and fresh produce.My least favorite thing to plan is the budget. We sat down and worked it out the day after Christmas. We knew that this year would be lean, but I think the reality of seeing it on paper was a little sobering for us both. Now we will revisit it weekly to adjust anything and hopefully stick to it. :)Once that was done we cleaned out the filing cabinet and put a large pile of stuff through the shredder. When we added the cabinets to our third bedroom we moved the computer into the closet. Some time was spent hanging up buletin boards and making the space a little more orgainized. Not pretty, but it is functional.Yes, those are my books. Many I keep and read over and over. I was forunate to receive many hand me downs from my mother-in-law and quite a few for Christmas. Yes!This is the verse we choose to focus on when it comes to our finances.Little by little we will conquer the medical debt and little by little we will build our savings back up.The last thing we planned was projects. We both made a list of the top five things we want to see done this year. It was fun to compare our list.The list have been combined and we are working toward finishing the first item on the list.

{"title": "It's A New Year!", "date": "Friday, January 01, 2016", "text": "Happy 2016! I can't tell you how happy I am to leave 2015 and start fresh. As many of you know the end of 2015 was hard. Besides my health issue something happened that left me feeling hurt, unappreciated and quite frankly a little mad. That chapter has closed and it is time to move forward. I am working on forgiving and letting it go.Although some of the hard things will carry over to this year I am looking to move forward. I have been thinking about what I want for this year and I know that what I want and what I need is to thrive. I feel like most of last year I have been surviving and really that is no way to live. This is the year to thrive and not just survive!Change has already stated to take place and there are still more to come. Financial changes, lifestyle changes, health changes and spritual changes. Both Chuck and I are ready for some positive changes.Here's to a great 2016!"},
{"title": "Popping In!", "date": "Wednesday, December 09, 2015", "text": "Well Hello! It has been a while. First I want to let you know that my heart surgery was a success. I am so thankful for that! I am still recovering, but that is going well. I am tired. Very tired. I know that as the days go by that my energy will increase. Thanks to everyone who lifted me up in prayer!One of the things about having restrictions and being tired is that you have time. Time to think, time to read and time to get antsy. ;) This week of little lifting and no housework has not been easy. There are so many things that I have been tempted to get up and do. I have been a good girl and have let things go. Housework will always be there. Chuck has been a true blessing. He has been working some mandatory overtime this week making his work days 12 hours. He has still come home and made sure that dinner is taken care of (thanks to our wonderful church family many times dinner is heating up a meal that has been provided!) and then cleaned up. Plus a million other things that have to be done that I am not able to do this week. He has always appreciated me, but I think he might have a new appreciation after all of this. In my time on the net I have been introduced to Laine's Letters. I have heard about her on different blogs, but never had the time to really see what the fuss was all about. I have been reading her achieves and all I can say is OH MY! I have read this, the second entry dated January 4, 2002, close to twenty times. It speaks to me. You can find all of her letters here. I plan to go through them all as I find so much encouragement and many practical things to glean from them. I could really use some encouragement now. This year, 2015, has been a rough year. I haven't always been a nice lady this year. Quite frankly I haven't felt well since Christmas of 2014. Add to that a heart issue and surgery all in less then two months. The news that my babysitting gig is ending at the end of the year. (The family moved, but had told me the boys would finish out the school year at their existing school, which is Megan's school. I was expecting to have the boys in my care until the end of summer.) Then there is the mountain of medical bills that are rolling in. It is all enough to drive a person batty! Even though I know that 2016 is going to be a lean year for us, I am looking forward to it. More then anything I am looking forward to feeling well again. Speaking of feeling well, I am about to close so that I can go take a little nap. Yes, I know that it is not even 10 this morning. ;) I really hope that you haven't found this entry depressing. Really, I am not depressed about all of this. Maybe a little discouraged, but I know that God is faithful. I will get stronger day by day and if my I still don't feel 100% after I recover then I will continue to make changes until I feel well. As for my worries over medical bill. That is what it is. I am grateful that I was able to have the surgery. I could feel my heart beating differently as soon as I was awake.  We will work out the financial aspect. I have found that things always work out. This will be my last entry for the year. I plan to rest and enjoy my family this Christmas season. I will be back in 2016 and will have plenty to catch up on. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. Luke 2:11Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas!"},

Not that I don't have plenty to post about, but I just feel the need to be quiet. Sometimes life can get out of control, especially during the season we are entering.No need to worry that things are out of control around here. Anything but that. We are working to wrap up our garage project. Putting the flower beds and such in order for the winter. Writing list for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Planning a big shopping trip next Friday to purchase Christmas gifts. Cleaning my home from top to bottom. Keeping up with school activities.Oh yeah, and a little heart surgery is planned for me on December 4th. ;) Lord willing my issue with the random, crazy heart beat will be fixed. If you think about it I could use some prayers for a problem free procedure, quick recovery and also that I will not be overly anxious.So for now I am going to do the things I love most... take care of my family and home, enjoy life to the fullest and relish this season of quiet."},

It has certainly slowed down the progress in purging and organizing this space. As most of you know I keep a well stocked pantry. I buy things that we use often when they are on sale and stock up. I also do some canning. I now have a nice space to store these items. I had canning items and such stored on a shelf in the garage and was able to make space for them as well. I am happy because things will be cleaner and Chuck is happy because he will have more space in the garage. Win, win for both of us. I like that things are behind closed doors which makes the room look tidy. Now as my energy returns I have more cleaning, organizing, and purging to do in here.

After 25 minutes of rest and it not slowing down I decided to go in. A little medicine and it was back to a normal rhythm. A scary, strange experience. I was told to think of a beating heart like a circuit board. The circuit goes up and down and beats normal.  I got stuck in a spot on the circuit and instead of going up and down I was going in a loop. Causing an extremely fast heartbeat. I will make an appointment with a cardiologist this week and see what he has to say. Serious, yes, but so thankful that it wasn't worse. Megan has been trying to build a card house.

I will be honest and say that I go through seasons where I enjoy my time more or less in the kitchen. I imagine that is true with everything.We like monkey bread, but I don't make it often. Not only is it not healthy, but I always seem to have trouble getting it done in the middle. I have tried all of the tricks like cooking it longer at a lower temperature etc. It just seemed to be hit or miss for me.  I tried it a new to me way over the weekend... monkey bread muffins.It turned out perfect! Chuck and Megan both said they like it better this way.  I also like that I can have breakfast on the table faster as the cooking time is much less for the muffins. Win, win for everyone.We eat pork chops often as they are one of Megan's favorites. My preferred way to make them is to add salt, pepper and grill. I have heard people mention that they thought grilled chops were dry. Here is my secret... use a spray bottle with water and spritz them as you cook.  As much as like them this way I wanted to try something different. Enter brown sugar glazed pork chops.Oh my! These were good and simple to make. Brush the chops with olive oil, salt and pepper. Then coat with brown sugar. (about 2 TBS per 2 pork chops) They have just a hint of sweetness. They were a hit all around and will be added to the menu rotation.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I have been busy sanding and adding poly to it.It looks great!  A few more coats to go. I wish I could say the project would be done, but I still need to do the chairs.

I use to work for this restaurant and each batch of lemonade made was 12 quarts. You could always tell when it was poured in the dispenser if it had been whisked well while making.

She did really well and the officer even asked if she had shot a gun before. I love that my girl wasn't afraid to do this. The 4-H buildings are probably my favorite area. I am always amazed by how creative everyone is.Scattered throughout the exhibits is hands on activities. Here Megan was stamping leather to make a necklace.Finally we made it to the animals. This made one little girl very happy!You have to eat at least one bad for you thing while at the fair.My second favorite area is where the old time things are displayed. This is an example of a 1940's electric kitchen. Oh, how far we have come!Chuck could have spent hours here watching the old machinery work.

Abe is in first grade and the decision was made for Eli to go to full day Pre-K four.I can't say I was shocked by this decision. I did think I would have one more year of E being in half day preschool. I can see that this could be a good thing for Eli though. I will still be picking them up along with Megan for after school care.This means a financial hit for us. We discussed me returning to work. Chuck is adamant that he doesn't want that to happen. Me being home gives him peace of mind that Megan is taken care of. He doesn't have that worry about what happens to Megan on holidays, snow days and during illness. I also don't think he minds the laundry being done and dinner on the table. ;) Honestly, home is where my heart is and I was willing to go to work for the good of my family, but my heart would not be in it. We are in the process of tightening the purse strings and tweaking our budget.The plus side is that I will have some time to tackle a few projects. There is some painting I would like to do and our home could use a good purge and clean. I might have an as needed babysitting job for one of the teachers.

Yes, I know there is plenty left, but for us we now have more of a routine and have to make sure we get to bed on time.We packed as many fun things as we could into the last week of summer vacation.Including going out for a big family dinner. My second oldest niece turned twenty!Megan said, \"Does this make me look smart?\" Silly girl!The neighbor girl was down and they played here all afternoon.She tied this sleeping bag around her waist so she could have her bunny with her while she unloaded the dishwasher.

As always I want my changes to meet my very small budget. One of the changes I have been pondering is my table center piece. Meet my new creation.I knew I wanted a glass plate for the top. I picked this up for $0.99 at a thrift store.It exceeded my expectation with the basket weave pattern.I painted an inexpensive flower pot.I used the fantastic E6000 glue to attach the two together. Wallah, a new cake stand is born!It has already been put to good use.A summertime tradition of \"Virginia Cake\" awaited my family.This was an easy project that will allow me to change out the center piece to fit the season or my mood. ;)May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Restoration ", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2015", "text": "Sunday morning found us dragging our feet. We all sleep in later then normal. (Especially Chuck who is an early riser.) Then we just didn't seem to be motivated. After a little back and forth we decided to play hookie from church. Not because we didn't want to worship. Far from that. I think we were both emotionally tired. We love our Sunday service, but lets face it, sometimes it is work. You have to dress nice, put on a happy face, make small talk and wrangle your child. For this intovert it is not always easy.We decided to hit the road, run through the drive thru for a late breakfast and have a quiet time of worship.He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul; He leads in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Psalm 23:2-2Our intent was to stop by a stream and have our breakfast and some quiet time. That didn't work out as the bugs were so bad. Bug spray wasn't enough to fight them off with all of the rain we have had. We ended up eating in the van and then hitting the road for a drive.We passed corn fields, pastures and farms. Each passing mile we could feel the cares of the world lifting away.Create in me a clean heart. O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirt from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me by Your generous Spirit. Psalm 51:10-12We then came to a place to stop. No one was around and it was peaceful and quiet. We were able to be still, and hear ourselves think.Be still, and know that I am God... Psalm 46:10 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11:28After soaking in the beauty of our surroundings Chuck began to read scripture to us.For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the mist of them. Matthew 18:20We prayed together. Pouring out our worries and singing His praises. Oh, what a joy it was!It just so happened that spot we were lead to was the shelter area of an older, beautiful church. I am extremely grateful for a Savior who is faithful and always, always meets my needs. Thank you, Lord, for this time of restoration!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

In a few minutes my ride will be here and I will be heading to the hospital where my dad will be undergoing surgery. Praying things go smoothly and the recovery is quick. Anyway, on to more pleasant things. ;) One thing that Chuck and Megan enjoy is cheese sauce when it is taco night. When I make a batch or we open a jar of queso it tends to go bad before it is used up. My solution is to freeze the leftover. I put a serving size into a muffin tin and freeze. Once frozen they pop out then are stored in a freezer bag.I am able to pull out what is needed and then microwave it.  This not only cuts down on waste, but is a good way to control portions. Due to some changes we need to make every penny count. One way to stretch the budget is to reduce waste in the kitchen.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I thought I would see what they would do and boy am I glad I let them go! My garden aka the weed patch. :) I feels good to have sunshine and dry skys.

With all the moisture in the ground it is nearly impossible. That means that I have needed to find some things to do inside. We made these shirts last week just in time for the 4th.

The sky is blue, the clouds are fluffy, the sun is shinning, birds are sings and there is a gentle breeze.The littles and I made a quick trip to the grocery store early this morning. I like to get out when the traffic is light and the store isn't full of crazy. Just a quick trip for fresh fruit, milk, lunchmeat and such. Then Megan was dropped off at my parents. She has plans to go swim with her cousins. While we were there Abe lost his first tooth! I so wanted him to lose it while at home, but it wasn't meant to be.Then it was home. After the groceries were put away two little boys were begging to go out and play catch. I have tons of things to do, but who could say no to outside on such a beautiful day.:) While they played I sat on the back porch soaking in the beauty and listening to a sermon. Although we were at church yesterday we missed the sermon as we were serving in the childrens department. After a wonderful morning it was time to get busy. We ventured inside for lunch. While the boys rested I worked on some task. When the boys were finished resting we joined Megan at the pool. We returned home and soon after the boys headed home for the day. Megan and I picked up, walked through the garden and waited for Chuck to return home. When dinner was complete it was time to make another trip to the hardware store. We are now in the drywall phrase of the garage. Woot! Woot!Flowers were watered and Megan played in the yard for a little bit. Then it was time to head in for the night. Once everyone settled in for a little bit it was time to gather for devotions and then to read from our chapter book.As I was sitting on the porch after a full day all I could think is that life is really, really good. Not perfect by any means, but I am thankful that there is enough joy to make life enjoyable.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Our garage project is coming along slowly, but surely. We were out and about more then normal with trips to the hardware store. I admit that lead to us eating out more then normal for the week. Project or no project is time to reign in the spending and get back at our normal, frugal, way of living.It has been very warm here. That means that turning on the oven is not a good thing. As we all know that adds extra heat to our homes. I had some bananas that needed had to be used. I mixed up the dry ingredients and got everything ready the night before. That way it could go in the oven first thing in the morning.While I was puttering around in the kitchen I threw some oatmeal in the crock pot.A healthy, low cost breakfast was waiting when the little were ready to eat.I also completed my menu for the week. Most of the things on my menu can be prepared on the grill. I love making meals on the grill!The to do list is ready so I can get things done!There is something about making items off a list that keeps me motivated.A long over due thank you note was slipped in the mail.A sweet friend mailed me a surprise package. Now that makes you feel loved and appreciated!Now it is time for me to go and get some things marked off my list!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Watermelon Memory", "date": "Tuesday, June 09, 2015", "text": "As I was slicing watermelon I was thinking of our dear neighbor Bill. He was close to 80 when we moved in and he was quite the character. He went to glory severval years ago and left a huge impact on us. He enjoyed sitting out on his back porch. If you caught him at the right moment he would tell us stories of years past.  One of the stories he told was about his childhood during the Great Depression. His family left Indiana to visit family in Kansas. He said that the entire time they were there all they ate was watermelon and fried chicken. He said that they would pick the melon straight from the field and dig in. As a little boy he thought it was the greatest thing ever! He didn't realize until he was much older that they ate watermelon and fried chicken because that is all there was. It is hard for me imagine times being so hard that you eat the same thing over and over for days and days. As a little boys it was a great adventure for Bill. He had all he needed; a full belly and the love and security of family. It serves as another example of how the simple things really are the things that matter. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I have been working on a project which resulted in my counter looking like this.It was driving my crazy while I painted another cabinet.Thankfully it is now complete and everything is back in its place.Besides my project and the everyday stuff there has been fun. The pool is open at my parents and Megan is spending a big portion of her day there. The boys and I usually stop by for a dip after nap time.The minion goggles crack me up!We made silly putty one afternoon. (2 T cornstarch and 1 1/2 T dishsoap)Using wax paper was a must as it was a little stickier after sitting for a moment.The big thing happening around here is ripping out the garage.The ceiling in the garage had been sagging. Once Chuck ripped it out he found the cause. The person who installed the pull down ladder to the attic cut the support beam to put it in. Chuck was not happy especially when he saw that if they had moved the stair over four inches they wouldn't have needed to cut the support beam. This is going to be an expensive, time consuming project. Thankfully we have been saving for this for a while.Notice the extra place setting?  That has been the new norm as Chuck's dad has been helping with the garage. His only request is that I feed him. I think I can handle that!If I don't see Megan floating around it usually means she has found a quiet place to read. :)The boys will be on vacation again next week as their mom is taking a week break between jobs. The unexpected week off caused Chuck to change his vacation. He changed a later vacation week to this so we would have another week together without the boys. I told him I am looking for tons of progress in the garage! ;)  He laughed and said he is also.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

She has been asking for quite a while and we told her that we would have one sometime this week. She had been not always patiently waiting for this to happen.  We keep looking at the clouds wondering if it would or wouldn't rain. Finally I said lets just go for it. We felt a few rain drops here and there and thankfully that was it. I didn't have graham crackers for the the s'mores so I substituted chocolate chip cookies. Sometimes in making do you find a great alternative. I loved this!Although I am not a fan of pictures of myself you might start to see a few more. I am who I am and if I hide behind the camera my future family members may wonder if I actually enjoyed and took part in the life I was given. The answer to that is a definate yes! I may not be happy with my picture, but I am certainly happy with my life. One happy little girl! The late night wore her out. As I type this at almost 8:30 she is still sound asleep.

I remembered something that I had seen on Pinterest and thought I could make it happen. (I thought I had pinned it, but I didn't. I tried to find the original, but you know sometimes looking for something on Pinterest is like going down a rabbit hole.) Since it feels like we live at the home improvent store I was able to pick up paint sticks without making an extra trip out, Chuck cut them for me and then I sprayed them with white paint.I hot glued them together and then created a banner. The letters are stickers that I picked up on clearance for a dollar. I lined the tray on my stove with scarpbook papers and used an old milk bottle with button flowers to complete it. I am feeling the need for simple at the moment and this fits that need perfectly. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Above you can see Betsy Ross and Clara Barton.Finally school has ended. I think I might be more excited then Megan.  There were awards and then the annual balloon launch.  Each student writes a Bible verse on the card attached to their balloon in the hope that it will spread the gospel. I have this last area to paint on the back porch.  It will be the second coat and then the painting is complete.  The roof was installed this week.  We about killed ourselves getting the second coat on the rafters the night before the roof installation. I plan to paint this afternoon and then spend the weekend getting everything clean and tidy. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am looking forward to marking this project off of my list.Next week Chuck is on vacation and the boys will be taking their family vacation also.

The crew came and removed the old roof and realized that they had the wrong material. The correct roofing should be in this week so this is a rush project. The first coat was finished Thurday evening. Just in time as it rained Friday and there are showers in the forecast through Monday. Oh how I wish we could paint this weekend, but it is what it is.

I did some weeding and thinned some plants, Megan played and once again we ate dinner outside. There is something about eating on the back porch that makes dinner slow and more enjoyable.Most of Sunday was spent on the go. Here we are Sunday morning ready to roll. Chuck's work partner retired last week and we attended a wonderful luncheon to honor him. I know Chuck is going to miss working with Gary. Once home we readied that last two raised beds. Peas were planted in one and the other is waitng for some strawberry plants to be added. I am once again working on painting the inside of my kitchen cabinets. Megan put the last coat on the shelves and I hope to get the cabinet put back together tomorrow and start the next one. It is certainly a time consuming project, but the results are fabulous.The big garden was tilled!

When it was cut down Megan asked for a slice of the trunk.It sat around on the back porch floor all of last summer. Quite frankly it annoyed me as it always seemed to be in the way. This spring it has been put to good use. It now has a place of honor in the middle of the outside table.It covers the hole for the umbrella. (Which we don't need since we have a covered porch.) It gives this plain jane flower pot a little pop.It helps to hold down the table cloth on windy days.It serves a trivit for hot dishesIt serves as base for a game of tag.It serves a steering wheel for little imaginations.Who knew that the annoying chunk of wood from last year would bring so much pleasure this year.

{"title": "Crisping the Greens", "date": "Tuesday, April 28, 2015", "text": "I recently learned there is a better way to make a crisp salad. You take your greens of choice (don't judge my choice it was slim picking Sunday afternoon at W*l-Mart) and soak them for a couple of minutes in luke warm water. I have always used cold water but apparently the warm water opens the pours in the lettuce.Drain and then add to a bowl of ice water for a minute or two.Next you drain and dry your lettuce well. I received a salad spinner for Christmas, but dish towels or paper towels work just as well.I then put it into jars and now I have crisp greens waiting for lunch.Now I know the secret as to why the restaurant salads always tasted more crisp and fresh then my salad at home.

We both had been thinking the same thing...  sometimes you just need to say no. When you are on the go constantly nothing gets accomplished at home. It was decided that we would cancel our Saturday plans and it would be a say no kind of day.That doesn't mean that we sat on the couch all day and did nothing.  We were plenty busy.Busy at home.Busy at a slow pace.Busy doing things that needed attention at home.Busy doing things that were important to us.Busy doing things for us and not the world.Busy doing things that caused us to feel renewed and not drained.Sometimes you just need to say no and go with slow.

I don't know anyone that doesn't judge themselves according to others. Or sometimes sigh and think that life must be better for the person next to them.It is easy to look at others and see their worth. I know many times I judge myself harshly and can't see my own worth. It's a huge struggle for me. I am thankful for a husband that gently reminds me from time to time that I am my worse critic. :)I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

I received notice that there was a field trip to a one room schoolhouse with costumes. Yes! Just the encouragement needed to make a 1800's outfit. Thanks to my wonderful mom this became a reality. Saying Megan was delighted is an understatement. Lunch was packed in a cute pail and it was time to hit the road.This desk is original to the schoolhouse. It was the only one they could salvage. The cool thing is that it is mixed in with the reproductions and is still in use today.  They used pen and ink for all of their school work. Can you guess the state?Here a little history of the pledge. The above version was used from 1892-1922. In 1923 my flag was changed to the flag and United Sates was added. It wasn't until 1954 that under God was added. Interesting! Everyone made a batch of homemade butter to enjoy on crackers.This has been declared the best field trip ever!

I didn't put them back on the wall when I updated her room but hung on to them. I wanted to keep them but I wasn't sure what to do with them. I saw this picture on another blog and was inspired.I painted the letters with leftover purple paint.I purchased some scrapbook paper that just happened to be on clearance. Yes!Using spray adhesive I mounted the scrapbook letters to the wood and then used an exacto knife to trim them to size. I painted a piece of wood from Chuck's scrap bucket using the same gray as the room walls. This is the piece to mount the letters onto. They were attached using hot glue.This sits on the back of her desk. I love the way it turned out!This was a frugal makeover as other then time it cost under $2.00. Bonus is that I have enough scrapbook paper leftover for another craft project already in the works.

I have a loving husband, the daughter I prayed so long for, a nice place to live, food, clothing. You get the picture.I have been tired, had a lack of energy and feel like life has been passing me by. There have been request for outings, request for meals for new babies and I have let it all pass me by. I hate that I couldn't step up, but I didn't feel like I could not take on one more thing. Sigh.Fast forward to Friday... I wasn't sure I could do it. You know, fake it till you make it. I was drained. I had a headache, four kids to care for and an outing planned. I felt like crying, but instead I prayed. I called out to my Savior and layed it all out.Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light. Matthew 11:28-30 I am thankful that He not only listens to my cries but answers them.As I write this it is almost three. I am watching the baby sleep and the big kids playing. I felt like crying again.  This time tears of thankfulness. My Lord has taken my burden, my weariness, and given me a day filled with delight.I was brave and not only took the kids to a Silly Safari program but also inside Chick-fil-A for lunch. The kids were well behaved, funny and loving. They told me mutliply times they love me and someone gave me a heartfelt compliment. I am still weary but I feel like my spirit is being renewed. But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint. Isaiah 40:31I am thankful. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I wish I had known about this little gem a long time ago!I used a 1 lb bag of rice, 6 cups of water, 2 cups of chicken broth (optional as you could use water only), 1/2 cup diced carrots (again optional). Throw it all into the slower cooker and cook 2 hours for white and 4 hours for brown rice. Unfortunately I let mine cook a little bit too long. Oops! It is still good, just changed the texture a little. I served it as a side with grilled chicken and green beans. Then I divided up the rest and put it into the freezer. I foresee adding cream of chicken, maybe broccoli and cheese. Really the possibilities are endless.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Out With The Old", "date": "Thursday, March 19, 2015", "text": "It has turned out to be an expensive week around my home. The grill, washer and dryer have been replaced. Whew!  Chuck also introduced me to a new acronym: BER = Beyond Economical Repair.:)We have never had a new grill. We had one from a garage sale and then Chuck took a broken grill my parents had replaced and was able to repair it. Last year it needed new burners due to one side cooking really hot. The ignitor also didn't work so we would light it with a lighter. No biggie as it still met our needs. Over the weekend the grill would not start. Chuck thought the tank was empty. No not it. New tank and he still couldn't get it to light. That is when he introduced me to BER. We purchased an inexpensive grill... well inexpensive as far as grills are concerned. That was meant to be our big purchase, but unfortunately it was not. A couple of weeks ago the washer threw the breaker. When I turned it back on the washer would not start. It was making the same humming sound when Chuck tried to start it. He left it and came in for dinner. When he returned it started. It worked but there were times when it did not spin well. I would just run the cycle again. We decided to run it until it died. Fast forward to this week and the dryer stopped working. It had been purchased used and we have had it for several years. Again Chuck said it was BER. Since the washer was on its last leg it was decided that a new set would be purchased. We did upgrade to an HE model. It wasn't much more then the traditional washer with an agitator. The savings on electricity and water should make up the difference. I have washed three loads and so far I am pleased. All of this has meant that I have eaten several of these. (Not bags, just eggs! ;))Although we are not happy about all we have spent we are grateful. Grateful that we had the cash to pay for these. Grateful that Chuck could use his Veteran status to save on the purchase. We are looking forward to using these items for many, many years to come. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Megan's \"New\" Room", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2015", "text": "Welcome to Megan's \"new\" room!It is painted a wonderful shade of gray. Depending on the light it tends to look lavender or a twinge of blue. I would share the color name, but I wasn't pleased with my first choice and mixed some black and white in until I acheived my desired color. Before we step inside lets take a look at the before and after.I am going to admit that once I started painting over the pink stripes I might have gotten a little teary eyed. :)  I painted the room and added a border that matched the crib set while we were waiting for Megan. Gulp... almost eight years ago! It was time for a change. As you know we do things around here on a tight budget. I had been planning this for the last year. Buying a couple things here and there plus adding things to her Christmas list. Enough talk... lets go take a peek!The bedding and the cork M are items that were on the Christmas list. Our home is not large and I wanted things to feel light and airy. I went for something light and fresh for the window treatment. I also like the fact that as Megan grows these are netural enough that they will grow with her. This is my favorite grouping.I have sang You Are My Sunshine since Megan was a baby. It is something that she will still request. As soon as I saw this print on FB I knew I had to print it!This is also a favorite. This frame held a picture of ladybugs that previously hung on Megan's wall. I removed the print and added a chalkboard. Megan wrote out the Bible verse she is memorizing for the week. The desk is the only new piece of furniture. It is something that we wanted to add for a long time. It is one of the things Megan loves most about her room.The bulletin board was previously in her room. I painted it and then covered the cork with wrapping paper and glued on a ribbon to cover the edge of the wrapping paper. The shelf above the desk was cleared off and many items did not return. Again going for simple. One end holds shells collected from our vacation to the beach and a boat the Megan made from a kit.When our neighbor passed away Celia left Megan a piece of rose quarts and a small bird. Things that she would play with while visiting. These pictures were from her nursery. The colors went well and the flowers and butterflies are more little girl then baby.  This is one of the new items.The dresser is the original $5 dresser that was purchased at a garage sell. A fresh coat of paint was added.  The print above the dresser was printed from Pinterest and put in an existing frame and the Pray picture is something that was made in Sunday School. This lamp is new. I added some color to the white shade by using the same wrapping paper and ribbon used on the bulletin board. This was made by a high school friend of mine when Megan was a baby. A couple days after the room was finished I went in to kiss Megan goodnight. In her sleepy slumber she whispered \"I am pleased with my room.\" Aww... I am so happy for you Megan!I hope you enjoyed the tour. Have a great week!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

By the afternoon the sun was shining and the day was warming up.Other then a few patches of snow the feeling of Spring is in the air.It has been such a nice day that everyone wants to be out enjoying it. I know that Spring takes it sweet time coming to life around here. I am thankful for this beautiful day!This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.Psalm 118:34May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Time To Catch Up!", "date": "Saturday, March 07, 2015", "text": "You may remember at the beginning of the year I talked about change. One of those changes had to do with our finances.  Other then cutting back one of the best ways to cut debt and increase your savings is to increase your income. I recently added a little one to my daytime crew.The \"plan\" was to keep things the same and add a new little one in the fall. When I received a call about this little one I couldn't say no. I am still trying to get a new routine in order. Megan loves having her around and I love watching her hold Elizabeth and talk to her. So sweet! It seemed that the snow was falling all around us the winter until recently. Thankfully we haven't had feet upon feet of snow. Just enough to get out and have some fun!Now that we have had our fun let the warm up begin. :)Megan's room has taken much longer then anticipated. Her dresser was painted the great purple last week. Now we are hanging things on the wall and sorting through the bins of stuff that was taken out. I keep telling Megan that less is more. She recently said \"less stuff = less stress.\" Maybe she is getting it. A girl can hope anyway!Megan has been under the weather a little. Nothing major. She ran a low grade fever and stayed home one day. By the afternoon the fever was gone but I could tell by her actions and the look of her face that she wasn't feeling 100% for days. Thankfully yesterday she was acting like her old self. We were invited to go through Grandma Barbara's apartment. The clock is one of the treasures that came home with us.I have always liked it as it reminds me of a grandfather clock. It chimes at the top and half hour which I find soothing.Mike (Chuck's stepdad) told me the story of this clock. It was made by a neighbor of his parents in the 1950's and given as a gift to his family. You can't tell from the picture but the finial on the top leans slightly to one side from where it was carved. I think that adds character to the piece. We brought home some household items such as facial tissue and canned goods along with a few other treasures. I will share those another day. Not many items came home as we are truly trying to live less is more.Chuck has to work today and tomorrow after church. Megan isn't very happy, but the overtime will help us to reach those financial goals. Megan still has money left on a JoAnn gift card from Christmas so I plan to surprise her with a trip to her favorite store this morning. That should take the sting out of Daddy being gone so much this weekend.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

They were part of the craft for sunday school. Megan filled a cute faux milk jar with these cute M&M's for me.Here is is where the fail (sort of) comes in .  I made these muffins. As you can tell they look nothing like the muffins I originally made. I still can't figure out what I did wrong. The hope was that they would taste better then they looked. Nope. Chuck, bless his heart, said they aren't that bad. Yeah right! I had to choke down my bite. Chuck saved the day by pulling out the waffle maker and getting busy. In the end all was well. :)Megan received an apron that I had gotten for free with a gift card that I received in the mail and then we put money in her bag. Can you tell she was excited!?  She is a frugal girl and had just used the last of an Amaz*n gift card she received for her birthday. (Back in July) She had been asking how she could add more to her account (really our account) so at the last minute we decided to do this for her. I am so glad we did as her reaction was great!It is nice to take the time to make my family feel a little extra love. My hope is that they feel the love I have for them everyday. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I started a new inhaler last week for my bronchitis and it has helped tremendously. I still have a cough, but it is better. My energy level is returning. Thank goodness!We were invited to a homeschool skating party. Megan hit the rink with no problem. I even completed a lap or two. Wow! it has been a long time since I have been on skates!We are trying hard to eat better.The Game of Life was a Christmas gift for Megan.

What a difference these make! Things were literally falling off of this shelf. (Sorry I forgot the before picture.) I didn't get rid of anything and am amazed at the amount of space in there. I keep going back to take a peek! :)Putting all of the pudding and gelatin in a container made a huge difference. Before they were all stacked and I can't tell you how many times they were knocked over. The top shelf stayed the same. The jars were wiped down and filled up. I am delighted with how this turned out. It just might be my one of my favorite organizing projects!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I was the only one up bright and early. I opened the front blinds to the dark world and then went into the kitchen to start breakfast. I am not a morning person naturally, but when I am up and moving I love the early morning.Megan joined me while I was mixing up a coffee cake. I was happy to see she was feeling refreshed also. She was upset Friday when I told her we weren't going to dinner with friends. Then we had to tell her it was due to the passing of Grandma Barbara. Friday evening she was tired and grumpy. Death is a lot for a child to process. Really it is sometimes a lot for an adult to process.Then it was time to putter around the house. Chuck worked on Megan's room.A couple load of laundry were done.In between loads I started working on my kitchen cabinets again.While all of this was going on Megan happily played in the living room.From time to time I sat down and played along with her.At the end of the day we felt like it was a productive day. The ceiling is almost installed, laundry was complete and I had a project or two well under way.The kitchen was tidy after dinner, family devotions were done, and we were ready to play a game and have some wind down time.A productive, relaxing kind of day. Aww... Saturday... just the kind of day we needed!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Laundry Recipes", "date": "Friday, January 23, 2015", "text": "After this post I had several request for my recipes. Laundry Soap - this is my original recipe.  Since then I have found that Zote works better for me then Fels Naptha.  I will sometimes add a color safe bleach to this in the summer. We are gardener and have an active 8 year old so there is more dirt and grass stains in the summer.Stain Remover - the original recipe calls for baking soda. I found that it clogged they line in the sprayer so I have opted to leave it out. It still works well for me.I couldn't find the link for the fabric softener.  It is 8 cups of warm water, 3 cups of white vinegar and 2 cups of hair conditioner.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Grandma Barbara (Chuck's step-grandmother) had a heart attack Tuesday afternoon. The left side of her heart is dead and the right side has severe blockage. She doesn't want surgery, which is good, because at 91 the doctors said it wasn't likely she would survive. She is moving into hospise care and they are trying to manage her pain. She is a strong women who was still active and living on her own. It is difficult to see her suffer. We are praying that her pain can be controlled and they she will not linger and suffer. So like I said a chocolate kind of week.Monday afternoon I helped Megan make a blanket for her favorite stuffed dinosaur.The sun was shinning the first part of the week. It certainly lifts my spirit when the sun is shinning. I have been working on projects for Megan's room. I am in love with this color. It looks a little more blue in the picture then it is. It is more of a turquoise color in real life.Megan had a it hurts to swallow kind of sore throat last week. My dad picked up her school work and we had school at home in our pajamas. I could get use to that!  I received new dished for Christmas and then another set from my parents for my birthday. I loved my other dishes, but they weren't holding up well with young children. So many bowls had been broken or chipped that was becoming a problem. It is back to good ol'Corelle!I think the dainty design is super pretty.Sometimes life is rough.

Sleeping in was such a wonderful gift!Then my little men showed up with a sweet tea and some homemade magnets.I was then given notes that Megan had written along with a package.When I opened the necklace I cried. It is an extremely personal gift. Each night when we put Megan to bed I tell her I love her. Somewhere along the line she started to giggle when I say this and reply with a \"I love you more.\" I will always cherish this gift.If that wasn't more then enough the love didn't stop there. Chuck made me a flower planter that looks like an old toolbox. Have I mentioned that I love homemade gifts!The evening ended with dinner out with the in-laws. I might have been a little spoiled yesterday and I sure felt love. I am grateful and realize that I am blessed beyond measure!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The only thing that has been marked off of the list is putting away the Christmas decor.  I ended up not feeling well the evening of Christmas and we seem to keep passing it around.  Nothing major... sore throats, coughs, stuffy nose... just the normal winter yuck.  For me that means that it has settled into a lingering cough.  I have barely left home.  In fact we haven't been to church in two weeks and I am not sure if we will make it tomorrow. The plus side is that I don't feel bad; I just sound like I do. Megan loves to fix things.  She had her chance the other evening.  We went to turn on the dishwasher and nothing happened. Thankfully there was only a wire that had come loose.  Chuck fixed it and then Megan put the dishwasher back together.  I love having a handy family!The kids are still having fun playing with new toys. It has been very cold this week.  One morning I took Megan to school and the van was reading -4. Brrr! That means I have been making stick to your ribs comfort food.Megan has always been helpful, but she is really showing initative lately.  She gently pushed me aside one evening and said she would load the dishwasher.  No problem! I had great plans for getting things accomplished and blogging more.  Well, you can see that didn't go according to plan!  I am hoping for a week with less of the winter yuck and more energy to get some things done.  No worries... life is always good!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

As much as I love Christmas I am always happy, and maybe a little bit relieved, when my little home is put back together.  After the tree is put away it always looks simple and fresh.  Just what this girl likes!  So what is happening in the New Year?  Well.... we have some huge financial goals. I won't go into them, but we have made step one toward those goals.  Do you know what the black and gray box is?Why yes, that is an old fashioned TV antenna.  I have been gently talking to Chuck about how much we are paying for cable and planting the thought that we should cut the cable.  We received a new bill and it had increased by almost $50/month.  I called to try and get it lowered and they were only willing to lower it by $5.  Chuck was in the kitchen while I was having this conversation and he said cancel it.  He didn't have to tell me twice! Honestly, we get more channels then I thought we would.  I am not missing cable one bit! Once we start reaping the financial benefit I know we won't miss it. I am starting the New Year with a drawer full of new dish towels.See, it really doesn't take much to make me happy! :)  My old ones were fraying on the sides and driving me crazy.  So I put towels on everyones list and thankfully that is the one item they all got me.For the last couple of months there has been an ongoing conversation of what we want to see for 2015.  I think the word that sums up what we want most for this year is change.  We will be working on financial change, eating change (saying good bye to lots of processed foods),  and spritual change (digging deeper into God's word), and of course there will be plenty of home changes as we work through our list of projects. I am looking forward to seeing what the new year brings!On another note if you looking for an encouraging blog may I point you to this one.  I do not personally know Cari, but we have many mutual friends and we attend the same church as her parents. I have been reading her blog for a long, long time.  I stumbled across this blog and started reading not long before they lost their daughter.  Her faith has been tested many, many times.  Most recently with the loss of her husband.  So tune in and be ready to cry, smile, and be encouraged and uplifted.  She has shared some pretty heavy stuff, but because you can see that she not only talks the talk, but walks the walk, you are able to see past the hard stuff and focus on what an awesome God we have.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

We started out Christmas Eve at Grandma and Grandpa's (Chuck's mom and step-dad).We were then off for a big family dinner to celebrate my dad's birthday.  Then it was home to get ready for the big day.After we had our Christmas at home it was off to Mamaw and Papaw's (Chuck's dad and step-mom).  We were only able to stay for a couple of hours and then it was off for our last stop at my parents.  I know when some hear how much running we do at Christmas they cringe, but it was all good.  We received some wonderful gifts and when we were putting things away we were pleasantly surprised that we weren't as overwhelmed with stuff as in years past.  One of our favorite gifts was this DVD.  Megan may look like a girly girl but she is anything but one.  There is no princess, baby dolls or barbies for my girl so this series of movies is perfect for her.  We all loved it!  I did a little research and there are a total of five DVDS and about 35 books in series.  If you have a boy or a little girl who can run with the boys it is a great series.  The only thing that made me cringe a little bit was that the bad guy used the word \"stupid.\"  (Yes, we are one of those families and I don't mind if you roll your eyes at me!)Anyway,  I won't be posting anymore this week.  Megan is home all week and Chuck will be here until Friday.  We have a new budget to make and a list of projects to compile for the 2015,  a monthly menu, and some new toys that need to be broken in. :)Wishing everyone a blessed New Year and sweet memories for 2015!"},

{"title": "Lost for a Moment", "date": "Tuesday, December 23, 2014", "text": "In the middle of all of the hustle and bustle of the season I lost it.  Not once, but twice.  One afternoon I was overly tired, my back still aches from where I hurt it while exercising, a friend is having a tough time, and I was weary and quick frankly wore out.So I did what any reasonable woman does and I sat in the middle of the living room one afternoon and cried.  I then prayed and you know what? I felt better.  Amazing what a good cry and heartfelt prayer will do for you. After that I spent the rest of the afternoon and evening sitting with the heating pad.  I also went to bed at 8 o'clock at least three night after that messy afternoon. I sent out a text regarding my friend asking someone if they thought she would be offended if I bought some presents for the grandkids she is raising.  It turned out even better then me buying presents.  A group of us are going to bless the socks off of her!  There will be presents for the boys and gift cards for our friend.  I am surrounded by a group of wonderful, caring people.  You know what... we are not only blessing this family, but more then that I am blessed!Then I lost it again.  That overwhelmed, stressed out feeling seems to creep up on me.  I was looking at the list of cookie baking and party preparations for Megan's school.  A day out of my home caroling and one of the little guys I watch not feeling well.  I went to Chuck and poured my heart out.I realized that I was mad that I stressed out by all the things that are suppose to wonderful.  I cried that I felt like buying cookies for school but I didn't want to.  That this is the last third grade Christmas party that I will get to bake for.  As I cried and poured out my heart my wonderful husband did what he does best.  He listened and encouraged me.  In his warm embrace and the quiet of the evening I heard the little voice that said \"be still.\"My little girl is growing up fast and there are day when it all seems to be passing in a blur.  It was in the moment of still that I decided I was going to do the things that are important.  To embrace the things that really matter and not let the moments that mean so much pass me by.  Time passing is really a good thing.  That after all is God's plan.  For children to grow up, for minutes to turn into hours and hours to turn into days.So as I write this a sick little boy is laying on the couch watching Little Bear, his little brother is working a puzzle, sugar cooking dough is chilling, the dishwasher is humming, Megan is at school, Chuck is at work and I am feeling great.  I will soldier on only doing the things that really matter and in those moments of struggle I will \"be still.\"I am still overwhelmed but now it is by God's grace, mercy, love and the thought of the child born to bring us hope.

The pictures doesn't do it justice.  It looked like something you would see in a movie. One of the items on our must see list was a complete bust.  We had driven about 20 minutes south of where we live and what was suppose to be a display synchronized to music didn't even exist.  Chuck took us down some country roads maneuvering us back to an area that was more populated and we ran across this gem.I was in awe of the nativity in the loft of this barn.  There is usually one thing through the season that moves me and this was it.  Wonderful!I am a person that likes routine. That is why I feel that traditions are so important. Some find it boring, but I find that tradition invokes memories.  We had a fun night making memories!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Menus have been planned for the rest of the year.  I am trying to keep the urge to eat out on those busy days at bay.  I finally had time to make turkey rice soup.  Hmmm... that is one of my favorite things about having leftover turkey.There is nothing like the smell of bread rising and baking.  Chuck likes it when I use homemade bread to make grilled cheese.  Megan and I spent several afternoons creating.   She has been making Christmas cards and I have been making some handmade gifts.  Megan still enjoys helping in the kitchen.  French toast is the newest thing she learned to make.  As much as I try to keep things slow and simple it seems that days are moving along quickly.

Honestly, the wheels weren't turning and I knew I wanted something simple. I saw some 8x10 canvas on sale and an idea was born.I used leftover paint to cover the canvas and then picked out a Bible verse to add.  This family is super busy and on the go constantly.  I thought the reminder to be still would be great for them.  I used scrapbook alphabet stickers that I had on hand to add the verse.I picked out four colors of craft paint and let the boys have at it.  Once they were done I took a brush and smoothed out their masterpieces. The stickers were removed and ta-da.  One quick, easy, meaningful, homemade gift is complete.

Mom knew that I needed new tables and got them for me. I disliked the high gloss finish, but they had good bones, and met our needs.  I liked that they are solid wood.  It is really hard to find solid wood furniture unless you want to pay big bucks.  While we shopped for a new sofa and chairs all we saw was pressed wood junk. They were in pretty good condition until they arrived here.  Many years ago I watched my niece and nephew and while making lunch one day I turned around and saw that my niece had taken a toy fork and scratched the table top.  Although I wasn't happy I knew that a makeover for these were on the to do list.  I never imagined it would take so long for these to make it to the top of the list.  That is just the way life goes.  I spent several days sanding off the hidious varnish.  Chuck took the tops off so I could easily stain them.  I used four coats of cherry stain and then two coats of a satin varnish.  The table bottoms were primed.  The weather changed so I had to move the rest of the process into the garage.  Boo!  Two coats of antique white was applied. I then rubbed on some of the cherry stain to tone down the antique white paint.  It makes a very subtle change that really doesn't show up in the picture.All done!  I love how light and fresh they look.   Now for the price break down...Tables...           FreeStain...              Free (left over from a previous project)Paint...              Free (left over from a previous project)Sandpaper...   $3.27New Knobs...  $5.90\"New\" tables for $9.17.  Not bad!  I plan to let them sit in the garage until this weekend.  I am going to clean the living room carpets before I bring them back in.  I can't wait to get them back into my home!

Life is full of hills and valleys.  Without those ups and downs we wouldn't grow as a person, as a family and certainly not closer to God. Life is fragile and it is those moments that we realize how important it is to live in the moment. Things are fine with my little family, but someone we care about is struggling.  We are loving, supporting and more importantly praying for this person.

Remember when we made applesauce?  There were all of those peels and cores left that didn't need to go to waste.  You know the saying \"waste not, want not.\" All that great stuff that most people just toss away went into a pot with some water.  It cooked down and made a wonderful liquid.Then it was run through a sieve and all of that wonderful flavor was squeezed out of the peels and cores.Many times, and I do mean many times the juice was squeezed through cheese cloth.  It is at this point that you can continue on to make jelly or save it for later.  After the work of making applesauce this goodie was saved for later.  You may can this, freeze this or just refrigerate if you plan to use it shortly.Notice the difference shades of the juice?  The jar on the left was made from mostly peels.  The jar on the right was cores, peels and some really small apples that were cut up and tossed in.  Making your jelly this way won't result in a light, clear jelly, but it still taste great.  Knowing that you used things up is worth the darker jelly. When you are ready to make jelly you measure out your juice into a stock pan.  ( I used 5 cups apple juice and 2 cups pear.) I always make sure that I have everything ready.  In this case my jars, lids, rings and sugar pre-measured.Turn your burner on high and add the pectin. Stir to disolve and bring to a rolling boil.  (Be sure that it is still a rolling boil when stirred.)  Then add the sugar.Bring back to a rolling boil and boil for one minute.Ladle into jars. Process in a water bath canner for five minutes. Twelve beautiful jar of Apple-Pear Jelly.  You can find all of the information you need for making jelly and jam inside of the Sure Gel box.  May you day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

We went on a fun field trip to a popcorn store. I learned some new things and tasted flavors like dill pickle and biscuits and gravy.  I think I will stick with more traditional flavors. :)As always there are things to be done at home. I am trying hard for my kitchen to look like this all the time.  It is so easy for the counters and table to get cluttered with lunch boxes, mail and school papers.  It doesn't bring me pleasure when I have to clear clutter before I begin a task.

I placed these in a jar to be used this weekend.  Here are a few ideas of how to use these:  over pancakes, waffles or french toast.  As a topping for ice cream or simmered over pork chops when they are just about done.  I might add some chopped pecans to the chops also!

{"title": "Fork in the Road", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2014", "text": "Chuck and I feel like we have come to a fork in the road.  We have both felt like it might be moving to this point for a while.  Our church is most certainly having some difficulties.  Some conflict of what some members want and the direction the elders are taking the church.  In transition because our pastor has decided to leave. (Which we feel might be a good thing.)  We have watched family after family leave for the last two years and it seems that no one cares or seemed to be interested in hearing their reasons for leaving and willing to make any change.Chuck and I are not conflict people and don't enjoy being surrounded by controversy. We have been going about our business and trying to stay out of all of this.  It is difficult when it is all around you and you feel negative energy.Leaving church yesterday Chuck said this may have been the last straw.  Instead of leaving feeling recharged for the week we left with a very upset child.  She was sobbing.  That is heartbreaking for a parent.  Not to go into to many details but Mr. Bandy told the class that it was his last Sunday to teach.  I had a long heart to heart talk with him after church and it is a difficult decision he has made to leave.  As sad I am that he and his wife will no longer be teaching Megan I understand the direction they feel led to go.I told Megan that sometimes God will put people in your life for a season.  That maybe God used Mrs. Bandy to help Megan transition to attending church and being away from us.  (For those of you who have read for a while know that Megan has always dealt with major separation issues.) Mr.Bandy has had a major impact on Megan's spiritial growth. I believe God used him to lead Megan to point where she has daily quiet time and has developed a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I will forever be grateful for the impact they have had in our lives!I am sure you can imagine that are hearts are heavy for so many reasons.  Here we are at this fork in the road trying to decide if we stay with our church or if we chose the fork that takes us down a different path.On my drive to take Megan to school this morning I was greeted by this site.The sun was rising, the clouds were rolling through and it seemed the world was bathed in sunshine.  Or should I say SONshine!I returned home with my restless heart settled.  No, the decision of which fork to take has not been answered but I feel like my heart is at peace. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Philippians 4:7I have been reminded that no matter which direction we go, which fork we chose, God will be with us. I feel like God used His beauty to sooth me and let me know that no matter what it will be okay.  We will continue to pray about our direction and seek His council.  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace. Numbers 6:26 May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I quickly put some things in the refrigerator and freezer and I was off.  When I returned home I went to put the things away correctly and found this.  Apparently there was a leak in the new milk jug.  The strange things is that I never noticed it while at the store.  In the time I was gone a good chunk of milk drained.  I started clearing things out and and had to keep going further down in the frig.  All the way to the bottom.  Sigh. Thankfully Chuck had arrived home from work by this time and pulled out all the shelves and drawers so I could wash them.  Deep cleaning the frig was on my list I just hadn't planned to do it at that moment.  It is now clean, organized and full of yummy food for the month.  I am thankful for that!While cleaning this out Chuck thought he was funny and keep telling me not to cry over spilled milk.  Saturday when we got into the van and there was a horrible odor I think we both wanted to cry over spilled milk!  Neither one of us thought about the milk jug leaking while in the back of the van.  We sprinkled baking soda in the back as we were leaving.  It soaked up more liquid then we were able to feel.  We vacuumed it out, used the carpet shampooer to clean the carpet, have put down straight vinegar and it still smells.  More baking soda has been sprinkled in the back and now we will wait and see.  If you have any tips for getting rid of the sour milk smell please share!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Chuck looked up a different route and off we went.  While on the road our alternative route had a detour and again we were on an alternative route.  The route took us off the beaten path and it was such a pleasant drive. We drove by field after field of corn, soybeans and even tobacco.  Seeing tobacco in Indiana is not a usual sight.  Of course all of those fields meant that we drove by many farms.  Can you see the Mail Pouch painted on the barn?  We also passed many small towns.  Some were larger then others and many were just a sign with no town in sight.  The one little place that really caught our eye is Vernon, IN.  We drove though this railroad tunnel to get into town.  I looked it up and found out that this is called the Vernon Tunnel and was built in 1838 for the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad (M&I RR).  We could tell from the homes and downtown buildings that this town was old and had been cared for though the years.  It was the county seat.  I love the clock tower on the county courthouse.  We were able to tell how rural this county was by the small population of around 700 in the country seat. This building is the old blacksmith!  It isn't often that you find that building still standing in town.  We thoroughly enjoyed our drive off the beaten path!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I threw out a few things and then moved some things from the cabinet above the washer and the over flow pantry in the spare room closet.  A much better use of this space.  I have a corner cabinet in the kitchen that has some storage space on the bottom.  This place had become a pit!  I wiped it out and then put a few items in the give away box.  All of the plastic ware that Megan takes in her lunch (we tried sending real silverware but a few pieces never made it home) was placed in a small cardboard container and then everything I choose to keep was put back in orderly.   Ahhhh, much better!  Now I have caught the organizing bug and hope to continue cleaning and organizing behind the cabinet doors.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

That gives me two morning free.  After eight years of always having a little one by my side it feels strange.  The good thing is that I have three uninterrupted hours to get things done.Tuesday morning I was marking things off the list right and left.  It felt so good.  I did a quick tidy of the kitchen and then started on a meal that I was taking to friends that evening.  I made the same thing for our dinner and had everything ready to go in the oven or be taken out the frig by 10 am.  Nice!I wrapped some pork chops that were on managers special.  I had just enough freezer paper for these.  I have been trying hard to keep up on the laundry and only needed to do one load today to catch it up.  I had a little ironing to do and I tackled that while Eli took a short nap.  The bulk of my free time was spent painting.  It makes me happy to see my stack of primed boards growing!As much as I miss the chatter and busyness little ones bring it is nice to get things accomplished.  I am looking forward to some productive Tuesday and Thursday mornings. May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Usually for a treat or meal that we shared with her.   We had watched her health decline that last few years and then in the last 6 months she was to the point that she could barely hold up her head and walk.  I received a morning call almost a week ago that she needed some assistance.  She had gotten herself to the kitchen and was unable to move from the kitchen table.  I helped her to the couch and it was decided that evening that she needed full time care. Thankfully home health was able to come in so she didn't have to leave her home.  That was her wish....On Tuesday of last week we were told that she was worse.  We went over that evening and were able to spend some quality time with her. She passed away the next evening and this is what I wrote on my Facebook page.... Yesterday Chuck and I were honored and humbled to spend some time talking and praying at the bedside of our 82 year old neighbor, Celia. One of the things we talked about was that she was going to meet sweet Jesus soon. Well, this evening she entered the gates of heaven. I am saddened that I won't have the comfort of looking out the window and knowing she is there or sitting on her back porch chatting. My heart is rejoicing that she is healed, whole and sitting at the feet of Jesus! We'll miss you, Celia, but look forward to seeing you again one day. She was like family and had a special bond with Megan.  As sad as we are we know that this is God's plan... life, death, hardship and joy... through it all life keeps moving on...

You can take a tour of the home but we opted not to because a nasty thunderstorm was rolling in and we were anxious to get back down that curvy road.  The nice man running the Walton\"s Mountain Country Store said we could walk up and take some pictures. The museum is located in a former school.  The actual school that Earl Hamner, Jr attended. Once we entered we were greeted by the nicest lady.  She sent us on our way and we started by looking at all the memorabilia that lined the walls.  There were pictures of the Hamner family along with the actor who played them.  Newspaper clipping, class picture of those who attended the school and all kinds of goodies related to the Walton show were everywhere.   Then we moved on to the good stuff.  Different rooms in the school were set up like a room from the Walton's home. I can envision the family sitting around this room listening to the radio on a winter evening.  I see Grandma and Olivia mending, John and Grandpa relaxing after a day at the mill, John Boy reading a book and the kids playing a board game.  Swoon!Of course my favorite room was the kitchen.  There was so much detail to take in.  It would be a dream come true to touch and feel the things displayed and have seat at the table. You couldn't visit without stopping by Ike's to check the mail!There was a room with several models of the home, general store and Baldwin sisters place.   Our last stop before we outran the storm was Schuyler Baptist Church.  What a cute a little church!  The mountain views were just as I imagined.

I had a little fender bender. :(  I was stopped waiting to turn left and someone clipped me.  She didn't even stop!  In the scheme of things this minor.  No one was hurt and we have insurance.  Just a hassle.  Who needs fancy toys when you have a bag of marbles and a little imagination. My days are filled with the simple joys of everyday life and I couldn't be happier!  I hope your are enjoying the June days as much as I am.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Clothesline Prayers", "date": "Monday, June 09, 2014", "text": "Several years ago I participated in a themed swap.  I believe the theme of the swap was clean.  Anyway, one of things I received from Mary Ann was a small bag of clothes pins.  She included a note that said I should write the names of family members on them so that I would remember to pray for them as I was hanging out laundry. Years later and I am still doing this.  Not only for family members but anyone that needs prayer.  A classmate of Megan's that is going in the mission field for two years, a classmate that has returned home to Burma, our church and so on. Not all of the pins have names.  There are times when I don't pull any name out of the bag and then other times the line is full of names. I will admit that I am good about praying when I receive a request but not always great about continuing to pray for that need.  This is a great way for me pray for those that are asking for prayer and for those that I care about. Prayer is such an important part of being a Christian and a great way to encourage and uplift one another.  I would love to hear how you keep your prayer life for others fresh and active.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Yeah!  We have enjoyed all of our meal since then out here.  This is one of my favorite things about summer.  Besides yard work there was also laundry.  Chuck and his helper cleaned out my van.  I now have ordered to keep it that way until we leave for vacation.  :)Megan planted the last of her garden.  All she wanted this year was a pumpkin and watermelon plant.  Easy enough!Through the yard work, fun, and food of this great weekend I have never forgotten the reason behind it all.  Without the sacrifice of so many we wouldn't have the great things that many of us take for granted.  Thank you to all who have served and especially those service members and their families that have made the ultimate sacrifice.  Happy Memorial Day!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

This sight just makes me happy. :)Of course there is the everyday stuff to do.  I don't know why the laundry won't wash itself! The best part of my busy days is caring for the littles that you all know keep me very busy!By the time evening comes I have been one tired girl.  I have barely made it to 9 pm each evening.  It is a good kind of tired.  The forecast is for possible rain.  I think I might be ready for a rain day. :)May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The top item on the list was laundry.I was able to get all the laundry washed, ironed, folded and put away.  Whew!  I have another load on the line as I write this.  It feels so good to be back on top of the laundry.  It really doesn't take long for it to get out of control. We are finally having spring like weather and it seems that things are growing and changing overnight.  There was been many afternoons spent outside and my sweet girl is bringing a fistful of beauty each day.Sickness and a weekend spent at the funeral home meant the menu went out the window.  We dined on canned soup and take out far too many times.  My weekly menu is up and I have been sticking to it.I have to share a Megan story.  In the mist of all that was going on I walked into Megan's room last week and found that her fish, Little Dragon, was floating.  Oh my!  Just what we needed.  Anyway, while brushing Megan's hair after her shower last night she told me that she had a dream the night before.  She had received a letter from Aunt Wanda and Aunt Wanda told her that she was taking care of Little Dragon.  Little Dragon was living in a stained glassed fish bowl (Wanda made stained glassed things as a hobby) and stayed on her dresser.  She also said that all of Little Dragon's supplies were keep neatly in a dresser drawer.  I had to smile at that as Wanda was a meticulous person.  I fought back tears as Megan told me this but I it also warmed my heart.   I have only left home once this week.  It was for a quick trip though the car line.  I like to be home and it has felt so good.My dad stopped by and tilled my garden.  That makes me super happy.  Now if it would only start to warm up.  I am ready to play in the dirt and get some things planted.I have to say that blogging friends are some of best!  I received a package this week from Kathy.  Does she know me or what?!  Everything is super cute and I just love the chalkboard lids.  Thanks Kathy!Having a slow week at home is just what I needed!  May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},

I knew that the doors would need to be primed and then painted.  It would have been faster and easier for me to do it myself.  Often the easy way isn't the best way.  Sometimes seeing the consequence is the best way for a lesson to be learned.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Mama and Daddy had to list their occupation, say why they wanted to adopt a baby from China and what my education would be. They said I could have as much education as I wanted. Let's see if Daddy is still saying that if I ask him to pay for my masters!After that it was off to the notary office. The man there asked Mama and Daddy to say their names. Then daddy said my name. He then asked if Mama and Daddy were satisfied with me. He asked if Mama and Daddy would ever abuse or adbanoned me. They said never.

{"title": "Tip Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, April 01, 2014", "text": "Good Morning!  I have missed blogging and am trying to get back at it.  Now, I won't guarantee anything because as you know caring for my family is my number one priority.  Anyway, I am going to try to be more regular.  Now on to the tips!Chuck has this handy paint mixer that attaches to the drill.  It is awesome for paint that isn't straight from the store and has been sitting for a while.   If you have a full gallon and happen to go a little fast it will sometimes splatter.  The solution is to place the paint in a paper bag.  Then if it happens to splatter you don't have a huge mess to clean up.   ---------- ♥ ---------- This winter we had an abundance of pine branches fall.  As soon as it warmed up a little Megan was out to play.  Of course she played with the branches and ended up with pine sap on her fleece jacket.    I tried several things to get this sticky mess and nothing worked.  So I did a little research and found several sources that said to try rubbing alcohol.    A little elbow grease with a scrub brush and I couldn't see it anymore.  Yes!  I rinsed off the alcohol and then threw it in with a load of laundry.    As you can tell it worked wonderful!  This is a great thing to know as my girl loves to play outside and especially creating with sticks.   ---------- ♥ ---------- I place many of my staples in Mason jars.  The flax seed came in a bag and it seems to always be in the way.  I also found that with so many containers of different sizes they didn't always stack well and make the most use of my limited space.      I have a love for Mason jars and now not only does my pantry look pretty but it is also organized and neat.   ---------- ♥ ---------- Another tip to go along with storing things in jars in labeling.  I will write things on the underside of the lid.  For my yeast I put the measurement to equal a packet since most recipe list packets and not actual measurements.   On jars that hold cooking mixes I will put cooking instructions.    May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Yikes!  Then it was time to settle down for the evening.  Megan took a shower and then we popped some corn and enjoyed a movie.   Before bed we have been reading a loud the Little House books and I ordered this since we finished Little House on the Prairie  Then it was off to bed for Megan.  I started a coffee cake for Sunday morning and then it wasn't long before I was off to bed myself.  I know daylight savings time only changes by an hour but it really messes me up.  I knew I would need to get to bed so I would be fresh for church.  I hope you enjoyed a coming along for a little peek into my Saturday.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I then go and read or play with the boys before I set the timer and do a decluttering task.  At the moment I am working in the office on my craft area.  It is hard to share this picture!  Is it just me or do you also seem to make a bigger mess as you sort and straighten things out?!  At the end of 15 minutes is hard for me to walk away from a mess like this,  I do.  The knowledge that if I keep at this 15 minutes here and there I will have a tidy, clutter free work space soon. All of this is becoming a habit.  I put 15 minutes on my list to declutter and to do \"behind the gate.\" I am already seeing an improvement not only in how tidy my home is but also in my time management.  I find that I have time to get my homekeeping done and still have time for fun things.   May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It was slow, relaxing and caused me to soak up the meaning of Christmas.  We didn't miss the hustle and bustle one bit.  I was actually living in the moment! (More to come about that another day.)Megan treated her grandparents a recital of \"The First Noel.\"   Megan ended up with a cough and stuffy nose the week before Christmas.  The day of her school party she told me that if it wasn't party day she would stay home.  Not something she does often since she loves school.  I let her go to school and could tell she wasn't feeling well when I arrived for the afternoon party.  She started running fever that evening.   She sleep with a stack of pillows to help her breath and must have been cold since she had on her earmuffs. :)  Thankfully she bounced back in a few days and was able to visit Santa.   Many of our evenings have been spent playing games.   The one activity that we did was a gingerbread house.    Christmas Eve our first stop was at Grandma & Grandpa's house (Chuck's mom and step-dad).   We then joined family for a nice meal at Olive Garden to celebrate my dad's birthday.  Megan was up at 5:30 Christmas morning.  I knew there was no way she would go back to sleep so we rolled with it.  I am so glad that we did.  We were able to watch the sunrise and it was breathtaking! Chuck sure surprised me.  This is my gift.    I had mentioned liking this several years ago.  It is a little pricy and I never expected to own one.  After my surprise wore off and it hit me Chuck looked at me smiled and said \"I had a coupon.\"  So now I love it even more! :) The hit of Christmas morning was Battleship.  This has been played often.   After a quiet morning at home we were off for two more stops first was Chuck's dad and stepmoms and then later to my parents.   You can go ahead and shake your head at the amount of gifts.  I do every year!  Every year we tell Chuck's dad that is too much.  As you can tell he doesn't listen.  Even Megan said something about them.  She pulled me aside and said \"don't you think the amount of presents are a little much?\"   Thankfully she understands the true gift we are receiving at Christmas.  Chuck has been off all week so we have spent time doing a little organizing as things are put away, reading, playing games and tomorrow morning we will put the décor away.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

My parents neighborhood fared much worse.  There were several trees blocking the street. Two homes on their street ended up with trees falling on the roof. I am thankful that the city made this decision based on weather data and didn't let public opposition keep them from making this change.  Just an hour our so early and it might have been a bad thing for some little kids.

I reused an apple bag from our picnic and added a tag that says \"Enjoy!\"Megan ran them over and she was delighted.  She called me the next afternoon and said she ate a warm muffin with her afternoon coffee and saved the second one for breakfast the next morning.  A simple gesture that I will make sure to repeat often. A warm afternoon while Megan was on fall break I made a snack for her to share with the neighbor girl who was over playing.  I am sure that I saw this on another site but for the life of me I can't remember where.  Anyway, I sliced apples, added caramel dip, melted chocolate, marshmallows and sprinkles.

{"title": "Photo Shoot", "date": "Monday, October 28, 2013", "text": "Each year we have family pictures taken for our Christmas cards.  It can get really expensive.  Especially since we usually have a minimum to spend in order to get the disk.  We need the disk in order to use the photos on photo cards.  I was inspired when Monica posted about taking photos in front of an old truck at an auto shop.  I looked at a few ideas of Pinterest and then started brainstorming.  Here is what I came up with.   I love, love, love the way it turned out!  It is so.... well... me.  :)I gathered a quilt, table cloth, bench that was in our shed, a bucket from my grandparents farm and some garland out of the Christmas decorating tote.  Using some stakes and a piece of scrap wood Chuck created this tripod for garland to wrapped around.  There is a small pile of sticks from the last time we cut grass and some were gathered to create a star topper for the tree.  Then the fun began and we started snapping away.  We borrowed my mother-in- laws camera (her camera is better then mine) used a tripod with the camera timer. You can find the bunting letters here.As you can tell not all of the pictures were great, but we were able to capture a few good ones.  I used things we had on hand to make my backdrop and then we wore clothing we already had.  Instead of printing out pre-made photo cards I created a collage using Picasa and then uploaded it to Snapfish.  I have a credit for 4x6 photos that I earned using my Coke rewards.  All that had to be paid was shipping for a whopping $1.25!  This is something that we will certainly be doing again.  I don't want to give everything away for those who receive Christmas cards from me.  Once they have been mailed out I will share the collage I made.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

{"title": "2 Chicken Breast = 5+ Meals", "date": "Thursday, October 10, 2013", "text": "Well I did it!  I stretched two chicken breast much further then I originally thought I could.  I was able to get five meals out of them.  I will say up front that the meat was stretched... really, really stretched. So, here I go with a picture heavy post.I started out by boiling the chicken.  I added salt, pepper and a little bouillon to make a nice stock. I then diced the chicken into chunks and divided them into thirds.    One of the thirds was divided in half and then diced into smaller pieces.  The stock was then divided into two pans.I needed diced carrots to add to one of the stock pans.  While I was doing this I diced carrots for another meal.  No sense in making a mess peeling and slicing later in the week.  While one pot of stock cooked my diced carrots the other one was used to make dinner.  Meal #1:  Chicken and Noodles with a side of green beans.  I could have made this meal more cost effective by making my noodles.  I had a bag in the freezer so I used them.  Normally I would have used half a bag but wanted left overs so I used the entire bag.  I ended day one with a small container of finely diced chicken (not pictured), a container of diced chicken and raw sliced carrots, a container with stock, finely diced chicken and cooked carrots and a large container of left over chicken and noodles.  Meal #2:  Chicken and Rice Soup, homemade cornbread with honey butter. This is by far my favorite kind of soup and the honey butter could be dangerous!  Meal #3:  Chicken Pot PieIf you use an egg wash be sure to save the left over!  I put it in the frig to add to scrambled eggs the next morning. After I filled the ramekins I had some of the pot pie sauce left. (sorry no picture, it was blurry) Be sure to save that also!Meal #4:  Chicken/Egg Salad with crackers and a side saladMeal #5:  Chicken Noodle Soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.  This is where all the left overs come into play.  I added the chicken and noodles to a large pan then added some chicken broth.  The sauce from the pot pie was mixed in and then I added water to get the desired consistency.After all of this I still have leftovers!Some stock for the freezer and then soup for lunches.  I imagine most of the liquid from the chicken and rice will be absorbed.  I might be able to use it as side with some grilled chicken.  Hmm, something to ponder. I had so much fun doing this!  I know you might think that is strange, but it caused me to spend time in the kitchen (which I enjoy) and to be a little bit creative.   If push came to shove I could do this every week and make it work.   I told Chuck what I was doing at dinner during meal #1 and all he said was that he noticed there wasn't as much chicken in the dish as normal.  :)  He was a good sport and did not complain one time.  He is a meat and potato kind of guy so to avoid a revolt I will serve more then chicken and won't stretch the meat quite as far next week! :)May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Reducing the Budget", "date": "Monday, October 07, 2013", "text": "Over the weekend Chuck and I had a serious conversation about how the government shut down could impact Chuck's job.  We decided that we needed to tighten things up and reduce the amount coming out of our budget.  Of course there are some things that are set and can not be reduced.  The mortgage payment and piano lessons to name a couple.  (Yes, I know piano could be eliminated, but at this time we want to make the sacrifice for it.)  The grocery budget is one area that I am working to reduce.  I am going to be watching the sale ads closely.  I could have done without these items, but the prices were really good.  I used $9.60 of my grocery budget and this what I came home with.The spaghetti sauce was $0.99 each if you bought four.  I had one coupon that took $0.40 off of that.  The oatmeal was also $0.99 each if you bought six.  These are all items we use on a regular basis.  I will especially use the oatmeal as the weather get cooler.  I really like waking up to crock pot oatmeal on a cold, snowy winter morning.  Keeping a stockpile of items bought at rock bottom prices is one way I can reduce the grocery budget. Another way is to stretch the groceries that we already have.  One of the most expensive items is meat.  This week I am going to see how far I can stretch two chicken breast.Later this week I will show how many meals I was able to get out of them.  If time permits I will share some other things this week that we are doing to reduce spending.  Any ideas?  Please feel free to share them!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The only thing left in the garden is tomatoes.  Then it was time to head out to pick up Megan and run a quick errand to pick up my glasses.  I have been waiting not so patiently for these.  I broke my other pair and my back up has a big scratch across one of the lenses.  Not fun!After dinner my parents called and asked us out for ice cream.  A nice way to wrap the day up.I love the boys dearly but it was really nice to go about my task without helping little hands.  A nice break for sure!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

There were some errands we needed to run and decided it was a perfect day to jump in the van and get them all done.  Hop in and enjoy the ride! The first stop was our favorite place for eggs.  Four dozen in the cooler.  I hope these stretch farther then the week and a half the last batch lasted.  Not only do I enjoy eggs for breakfast I like chicken and egg salad for lunch. Oh yeah and I can't forget the baking.    Did I mention it was a beautiful day!?    The next stop was the bookstore.   My dear mother-in-law asked if I could pick up some books for us to read if she gave me a gift card.  Why yes, I would be happy to!    Me in a book store is like a kid in a candy store.  :) This little girl was happy as she picked up some tabs to make it easier to navigate during her quiet time.    Then it was through the drive thru for a prescription.    We then zipped across the street to pick up a few sale items.    While shopping my father-in-law called.  Would we like to come by for lunch.  Sure!  We live very close to this store and dropped off our goodies and then hopped on the interstate.     My father-in-law lives on the other side of town.  It was worth the drive.  We enjoyed a nice lunch outside and then Megan wanted to go out in the woods. Before she left she grabbed a stick and she and papaw made a fishing pole.    \"Fishing\" at the pond.  We could really tell the lack of rain as the pond is down about five feet.  I thought her fishing was so stinkin' cute!    On the way out the woods we saw a turtle.  Papaw talks about the turtles all the time but this is the first time that one of the grandkids got to see one.  Neat!  A couple of hours later we were back on the road.  We stopped at my parents to drop something off and Megan ended up staying there for dinner and Chuck and I left to do our big grocery shopping.    Megan was all smiles when she returned home.  She was into Grammi's scraps and created a vest and headband.  She was super proud of her creation.    Then it was time to unload.   Enough to last through November.  I am sure you can imagine there were a ton of bags.   Once everything was put away I sat on the back porch enjoying my tea and watching night fall.  Sure it was a long, busy day but also a productive one.  Now other then a quick trip for milk or fresh produce I can stay home for several weeks and enjoy a good book or two!  So tell me do like to hit the road and get it all done at once?  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Capturing the Moment", "date": "Wednesday, September 18, 2013", "text": "We are blessed to attend a wonderful Bible based church.  There is a family there that really has a heart for children.  In fact they bought several acres years ago and have been building a youth ministry.  Their daughter is close to Megan's age so she is in the same class with her at church.  This couple volunteer to teach the class Megan is in at least three Sundays a month.  They are wonderful!One of the things that they encourage is quiet time.  Each week they have a quiet time sheet that the children can pick up.  Megan mentioned it a couple of times and I said she should pick one up if she wanted.  A couple of weeks passed and she brought one home.Each evening we go into Megan's room and as a family read from a Bible bedtime story book.  After the story it has questions so it encourages us to discuss what we just read.  Anyway, after reading Megan prays and then she gets 15 minutes of quiet time.  Sometimes she would draw and other times she would read.  We are flexible about what she does as long as she stays in bed and is quiet.  After bringing home the sheet from church she started to have true quiet time.  Be still my heart!Fast forward to the end of the week and we are back at church.  When we took Megan to her class we told Mike and Pam about Megan's quiet time.  After church Pam came looking for me to tell me that Megan was such an encouragement to the class.  That they mentioned that someone had completed quiet time for a week and they mentioned Megan's name.  She said she was all smiles.  They have an offering time were the children offer something they will do that week to honor God.  Pam said that most of the children followed Megan's example and said they were going to have quiet time this week!  Megan is continuing to have quiet time each evening and makes it a priority. The thing that warms my heart is that no one made her do this.  With a little bit of encouragement she took the initiative to do this herself.  It brings tears to my eyes when I think about how God is working in her little heart.  We are super proud of her!"},

This day the light had to stay on as it was a dark, gray morning.

{"title": "When Things Don't Go As Planned...", "date": "Tuesday, September 10, 2013", "text": "I was having one of those days.  I was overly tired as we stayed out late the night before with our home group.  Once home I couldn't fall asleep and then I was wide awake early the next morning.  It was decided that it would be a great night for delivery.  The pizza was ordered and I knew I needed a little pick me up.  Instead of grabbing some paper plates and rushing through dinner I decided to go the extra mile.A quilt was thrown over the outside table and real plates were brought out.  Candles were lit, flowers were moved to the table.   The pizza was even transferred to a pizza pan instead of the box.  I was ready to have a nice relaxing meal with my family.  To come away from it feeling a bit refreshed.Then the bee arrived.  It arrived and decided to stay.  Megan was about ready to freak out!  She ended up jumping up and running inside.  The flyswatter was brought out and we tried to get that little guy.  No luck!  After a few minutes of looking like crazy people swatting at a bee I blew out the candles and we retreated inside.  I will admit at this moment I was low.  The peace, beauty and refreshment I so desired was not to be.  I sat at the kitchen table on the verse of tears. (Remember I have been having one of those days.)  I looked at Megan and then thought.... Is this a test?  She is watching me, learning from me by how I react.  I really wanted to cry and say how unfair it was.  I just wanted a little peace.  A little beauty.  A little recharge.  I didn't say any of those things.   Do I want Megan to mask or hide her emotions?  Of course not.  I do, however, want her to handle her emotions.  Not to stamp her foot like a spoiled brat when things don't go as planned.  There are always going to be things, many things, that fall short of our expectations.  I took a deep breath, said a prayer or two and put a smile on my face.  I picked up the pizza pan and offered my family another slice.  What could have been tears and complete disappointment for me turned out just fine.  We laughed... we teased... we enjoyed pizza pie and I grew.    Faith is often strengthened right at the place of disappointment. ~ Rodney McBride  May you day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It is a wonderful feeling to walk into this space and know that everything is tidy and orderly.  It feels so much lighter and I know that it will make things easier for Megan to keep things tidy.  She has already been warned that if she is still have issues with keeping her things put away I will be returning to do another purge. I don't know about you all but there is something about cleaning in the fall that is very appealing.  More so then in the spring.  Maybe it has something to do all the time I know that will be spent inside.  Nothing beats a clean, organized space to cozy up in!  I am looking forward to lightening the load in the rest of my home.May you day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

{"title": "School Work Binders", "date": "Tuesday, August 06, 2013", "text": "I have thought about closing my blog.  Blogging isn't what it use to be.  So much of it is about picture perfect homes, numbers and a lot of advertising.  Many of these things set the average person up for failure and discontent.  Not to mention the many who leave unkind comments.  Really, it you don't like what you see or read then don't come back to that blog!  I have also gleaned some great inspiration and made some wonderful connections.  I haven't been taking the time like I use to for blogging.  This on again off again thought has been there for some time.  As I was working on making the binder covers for some school organization I couldn't find a picture.  I ended up searching my blog for it.  It led me back to 2010 and as I was scanning that time and remembering how little Megan was and all that  had happened it hit me that for that reason alone I need to keep going.  Journaling bits and pieces of our life this way is really priceless. So now onto the reason I was looking for pictures...   I admit that right now I am a mess!  I have been running on empty for what seems like forever.  I know that I have mentioned that our summer was busy and hectic.  I am now in the mode to take control of the mess and get things together!I started with Megan's school work.  My mom gave me this organizer right before preschool.  It is super cute!  This is only Pre-K 4 and Kindergarten.  I knew that it wasn't going to work.  By the time 2nd grade ends it would be so full that it would be a disaster waiting to happen.  I would not be happy if everything ended up in a pile on the floor.A former co-worker of mine posted on Facebook about how she stored school work for her kids.  I loved it and decided to give it a try.She used the school picture of her children, but I decided to use the photo that I taken on the first day of school for the cover.  Now that it is done the only thing I would do different is to add the school year. I used page protectors for all of Megan's work and began with preschool items. I put artwork, select worksheets, short stories, awards, report card and even ribbons for field day in the binders.  My mom suggested I add a copy of immunization records for that year.   Which might be helpful in the future.  When I applied for my marriage certificate I had to show that I had a certain shot.  The doctors office was no longer in business and I didn't know where to go for my records.  My mom had keep all of my childhood immunization records and fortunately the county accepted it as proof.  You just never know when you might need that record. At the end of the book I created collages for all of the field trips, classroom parties and any other special activity. I have one binder down and two to go.  Megan enjoys looking at the completed binder.  I love that everything will be neat and tidy.  I also like the idea of having a place to put the special items that are coming home for this year. May your day filled with joy and contentment!"},

A trip to the grocery store about broke the bank, but I am grateful for a stocked frig and pantry.  We have new neighbors with a little girl about Megan's age.  She comes by to play often.   I am not sure if it is a good thing or not.  I have great memories playing with the kids on my street so I am trying to keep that in mind.  :)  This is the best year for impatiens.  I can't stop admiring the beauty of these.    Megan commented on a bird that keep flying into the grape arbor.  Further investigation revealed a nest.  I hope this bird doesn't think it has pulled up to a smorgasbord!  We attended an over the top party for one of Megan's friends.  This jump was one of the many activities.  I enjoying sitting out and watching these bathing beauties in the evening.  A trip to the Children's Museum with cousins from Iowa.  One of our many family gatherings this summer.  Megan caught a frog!  Things have been busy.  Hectic really.  I am trying to savor the moments.  I have missed posting and hope to make it a back to regular posting soon.  May your day filled with joy and contentment!"},

Cherry tomatoes are right outside the back door.  Most of the times Megan eats these right off the vine!  This is the last of the green beans as they were pulled last week.  I plan to replace them with peas.  There are literally over 100 pints and quarts of these pretty things waiting to be devoured.  We have home canned green beans with almost all of our dinners.

After lunch Megan went to swim with her cousin and the boys took naps.  I feel like I have been doubly blessed today.  Sweet memories making the cake and sweet memories enjoying it.  The heat and humidity are gone and it is a pleasant 75*.  Cool enough to actually enjoy a mug tea with my cake.  Awww... bliss!May your day filled with joy and contentment!"},

As we started down the ramp to the parking garage we realized that we still had the cargo carrier on the van.  There was no where to go but in.   We watched the over head bar swing as we entered.  Thankfully we were able to pull over once we entered.  Good thing since the ceiling was about a foot shorter a few feet away!  The guys were able to remove it, cram it into the back of van (good think the seats fold down!) and then put it back on just before we exited.  I tell you never a dull moment!  One of those things that will be remembered and laughed about for years to come.  If you visit the Cincinnati area I recommend you make a stop at the aquarium.  Plan to make a day of it as this area has many things to offer.  There is a wonderful open mall area from the parking garage to the aquarium.  It all borders the Ohio River.  You are able to walk down the Riverwalk and enjoy the water views.  The evening before there has been storms and several issues of water.  The river was up and the current swift.  Just beautiful!    May your day filled with joy and contentment!"},

For Megan this was a little boring. There is also an area that scared her.  It is a display showing the world without God.  Just things that we shield her from and I think it shocked her a little.  Our church recently started using Answers in Genesis in the children's department.

Yes!  Then there were games and free food.  I made an \"All American\" meal for dinner.   I had fun making these red, white and blue drinks.  Fill 1/3 of the way with Cran-Apple juice,  then add ice to the top.  Pour in Sprite.  Make sure to pour it over an ice cube (the prevents it from mixing)  and then add blue Gatorade.  Easy!Temperature wise this was one of mildest 4th in a while.  We enjoyed our \"All American\" meal on the back porch.  Can I say how wonderfully supportive my husband is... instead of getting frustrated as I fussed with setting the table he helped out... he is great about supporting my need to make things pretty.  Thanks Chuck!Our menu consisted of hot dogs, homemade fries, baked beans, watermelon and cookies.  (There was suppose to corn on cob but I didn't remember it until it was too late.)  Then it was off for fireworks!  I have had the privilege of visiting other countries and although I know our country is far from perfect I can't imagine living anywhere but here.  May God Bless America!May your day filled with joy and contentment!"},

I thought I had pinned it but apparently not.  Anyway it is super easy!  You mix equal parts of cornstarch and shaving cream to make a dough.  Very messy!  I then added some blue and green food coloring to create Megan's favorite color.  The texture of this dough was awesome.  The kids loved it!  I might add that the little ones made a very big mess.  I was okay with that as I was able to fold two loads of laundry and the floor needed mopped anyway.  Activity two was cornstarch painting.  Mix cornstarch, water and food coloring.  I love this stuff!  As the water evaporates you are left the dried cornstarch.  Clean up is easy as all you do is hose it off.  I think activity three might have been the biggest hit.  I used the remaining can of shaving cream and put it into the water table.  Then the real fun began!To quote Abe \"it was fun because it was messy!\"  At the end of day imaginations were used, everyone had a blast and I have no toys to store.

The sunshine and warm weather beckon the kids and I outside.  All of the outside time has left me scrambling for dinner a few times. Even with menu planning on way too many occasions I was caught at 4:30 or so without dinner started.  The temptation to run out and grab a quick burger is not something that can happen often.  As we all know it is a killer on the budget!My solution is to do something I am calling summer cooking.  On Monday I look at my monthly menu and decide what we are eating Monday - Friday.  I then use nap time on Monday to prepare the main events for the week. Here is a peek at this week.Monday:  Grilled Pork ChopsGrilling is something we will be doing more often to prevent heating up the house.  Chuck has a pitch in later this week.  He is taking in a sausage cheese dip.  While I was already using the grill I went ahead and browned the sausage.  I not only use the grill for grilling in the summer I will also use it with a cast iron skillet for general cooking.  Tuesday:  SpaghettiOne for this week and one for the freezer.  It is a great time saver to pull it out to thaw and heat up. Wednesday:  Hamburgers Again using the grill.Thursday:  Roasted Chicken  I purchased this from Sams.  As I was cutting the meat off the bone I put the small bits in a container to turn into chicken salad.  That will make a quick, cool lunch. Friday:  Meatloaf Baked late in the evening or early in the morning.  I will slice it before re-heating.   Each day before we headout for afternoon play I will get my side dishes ready to go.  My hope is that by doing this I can avoid some stress in the early evening.  It gets crazy with Chuck coming home and the kids leaving.   The great thing is that if plans change I can move a menu item to the weekend or throw it in the freezer for later use.   May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I used Picasa (it's free) to make a collage, frame the photos, add a background and boys names on the pictures.  Then I gathered my supplies.  Cut a piece of freezer paper to 8x11.  You will then print your picture onto the freezer paper.  (print the picture onto the shiny side.)  Add heat and bond onto the backside of the picture.  Trim the heat and bond if needed.  Then remove the backing and iron the picture onto the bag.  While I was doing this the boys were playing and I was asking them what they loved most about Mommy.  I picked their best answer and added it to the back of the bag with fabric makers.  I then traced their hands.  Eli drew in his and Abe wrote his name.  For a last minute project I think this turned out great!  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The type of weather that makes me throw the windows open and go about my task with more joy then normal. My dad showed up the other day with a sack of fresh green beans.  Just because... that is the way my parents are. ♥They have me longing for produce fresh from my own garden.  Yum!  I have slowly started to purchase my flowers.  I spent some time in the morning planting.  Of course there is always a never ending list of household chores to be done.  Tuesday is the day I dust and vacuum the living room.  It is also the day I wash sheets.  It doesn't get much better then line dried sheets!  A simple pleasure I never tire of.  Caring for the boys takes up the biggest part of my time.  They are active little guys. :) Saturday Chuck and I celebrated our 12th anniversary.  We went to a charming little town not far from us and browsed some little shops.  I came home with some berry and star twigs that I used to fill up a crock.     Mondays laundry leads to Tuesdays ironing.  I enjoy ironing especially when I can do it on the back porch.   I can smell the lilac bushes as sit outside and type this.  Hmmm... I couldn't resist cutting some to fill a vase.  Dinner was shared outside.  Something I hope we can do often this summer.  Chuck and Megan walk up and dump the compost bucket most evenings.  It makes my heart smile when I see them walking and talking together.Then I was off for a women's ministry planning meeting.  Not something I am usually a part of.  They have some concern about women with young families not joining in and I had an idea to connect them.     In case you are wondering my idea was to do an online Bible study for those who can't make the commitment to be out their homes on Tuesday mornings or Wednesday evenings.  Either a Good Morning Girls study or the same study that was being done on Tuesday mornings.  That way women of the church were still able to connect with each other.  My pastors wife loved the idea.  I was asked to head it up but I am not sure I can make that commitment at this time.  We'll see!   All in a day...  She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.  Proverbs 31:27 May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

(At this point I would also add a can of beans if it were just for me. Chuck doesn't like beans so they stay out. )I hope you can see by the picture the difference in color.  Cooking this down thickens it just a little and helps the flavors to blend.  I then turn this down to a simmer, add another quart of water and more chili powder.   I am generally to this point about lunch time.  For the rest of the afternoon I let it simmer and add additional water if needed.  The longer this simmers the better the flavor.  An hour before dinner I will bring this back to a boil and add 2 cups of elbow macaroni.  It is very important that you stir often to keep the noodles from sticking!  Once tender I sometimes need to add a little more water and chili powder (I never measure this.  I season to taste.)  It really depends on how much liquid you like in your chili.  I then keep it warm until serving.I like to serve this with warm cornbread.Enjoy!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I recently saw this idea and the wheels began to turn.  For my husband this is very scary! :)This picture is from Pinterest.  This is my version. This is what I started with.  I can't believe I am even showing this.  I would clean this drawer out then it would almost always end up just like this within a couple of months.    The first thing I did was pull everything out.  (Ignore my felt poinsettias.  The one thing I missed when putting Christmas away.)    I then measured and cut out a piece of brown paper.  I put it into the drawer to make sure that I had measured correctly.    Once I knew I had the paper the correct size I started to play with arrangement.     Once I had things where I wanted them I drew lines to know where the dividers would go.  This is the part where I failed to take any pictures.  Instead of cereal boxes I used cardboard.  Chuck happens to work in the packaging and shipping department so I have an unlimited supply of scrap cardboard.   I cut cardboard to surround the entire drawer and then began to cut out the dividing pieces.  I wrapped them in scrapbook paper.  You could certainly leave them plain to be more cost effective.  I then put all of my dividers in and put the items back in the drawer before anything was glued.  Good thing since I decided to move the back where the thermometers went to the front.  I then just shifted everything back a little.  I also realized that it was going to be difficult to get the bottle opener out.  I added an additional piece of cardboard to that area to raise it up.  Once all of this was done the hot glue gun got a work out.    Now I know that some of you are thinking that there is no way this is everything that you saw on the counter.  You are right.  I am doing some rearranging and will be moving some things to another drawer.  I am actually so happy with the way this turned out that I am going to do all the drawers.  Once they are done I will do another update.   Please stop by and visit Tammy for some great ideas.   May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It wasn't a pretty thing!   On the back of the bottle I wrote the recipe so I won't have to look it up each time I need to make a batch.  I have high hopes for this.  The reviews were good and the price is great.  I will let you know the verdict soon.   **Update**  Megan wore this shirt to the Children's Museum right after Christmas.  I used Shout on this spot and another one toward the top.  I spot at the top came out but not on the bottom.  I didn't realize the bottom spots hadn't come out until after I had washed and dried it.  It seems it always works out that way.  I wasn't very happy considering this was the first time she has wore the shirt.  I put it aside to work on getting the stain out.  ﻿ Do you see the three spots in the corner?  They didn't show up very well in the picture, but believe me they were very noticable in person.  I sprayed them with the homemade stain remover and then let it sit while a load finished washing.  I sprayed some more on before putting it into the washer and washed as normal.    No spots... yes!!!  So now I know this stuff is going to work great..May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

The closet in the living was serving as a coat closet, storage for the vacuum and the upper shelves contained most of my craft items.    It has never worked the way I intended.  The upper shelves were always a mess.  Some of the organization wasn't working.  I would move one thing and then another would fall over.  Ugh.   ﻿ I decided to take everything out of here and make some changes.  Aww... so much better!   I decided to move my craft items to the spare room.  I was then able to use the three drawers under our coats for hats & gloves.   I purchased photo boxes (watching sales & using coupons I got them for $1.20 each) for storage and used them to store baby food jars on the top shelf.  The bottom shelf hold things for the kids: paint, craft items, educational things.    I mentioned that it would be nice to move all of our games in here.  Chuck said that he had some left over wire shelves in the shed and thought they would work.  Yes!  Once all of the games were brought in I had an empty side shelf that I used to store workbooks and coloring pages.   I am very pleased with this.  I love that I still have space on the upper shelves, but the best thing is that all of things I use with the kids is in one place.  I no longer have to run to another room to get things for our activities.  That makes it much easier to keep an eye on two active little boys! Now I need to hit the spare room.  It seems that when I start moving things around and organizing I usually end up with a bigger mess until I get it all together.  Please tell me I am not the only one with this problem. :)May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Now that is a great definition!  She goes on to say that \"clutter doesn’t have to be physical — you can have time clutter or mental clutter or even bad processes that qualify as clutter.\"  As I was reading this all I could think was Yes! Yes! Yes!I have so much clutter that it is certainly getting in the way of living with joy.  I don't mean just stuff either.  Although I do have plenty of that.  Chuck and I have been talking about this for a while.  We have decided to make some changes this year.  A great tag line for us this year is going to be \"I'm sorry we aren't able to do that.\"  Sure we love to be out and about and giving our time, but it seems that some of that had become clutter.  So, if it isn't going to enrich our lives, bring us joy, then it just might not make the list.   In the next few months not only will I be removing the physical clutter, but also paring down the clutter of living life.  I don't want to just desire to live a simple life full of joy and contentment I want to actually live that life.  Step one:  pray about it!Step two:  review the calendar.Step three:  start purging one room/area at a time.Step four:  don't be afraid to say \"I'm sorry we aren't able to do that!\"Step five:  find joy in the ordinary!As we move forward into 2013 I will be sharing more as this progresses.  I am going to start by doing some purging and organizing of my home.  I find that when I have too much stuff and am not organized that it really effect other areas.  Wishing you all the best in 2013!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

This is something that I am working.  Some of the time it is because I haven't planned ahead enough and before I know it is time and I am not ready. I have been planning and planning some more for Christmas.  One of the things I wanted to do was an activity a day.   Once I had my ideas I printed them off.I then printed off some cute numbers.  You can find them here.I used toilet paper rolls to put my activity slips in. I flattened the roll, slid the slip in and tried it off with twine.  I then attached the date number.  I am pleased with how they turned out.  Simple, which is exactly what I was going for.  Oh, and inexpensive too!To keep from falling into my old trap of not being prepared I have everything ready.  All of the activities are together and in a plastic bag labeled with the date and activity.  When I initially started planning I used one of my handy dandy calendar pages.  That way I was able to plan simple things for school nights.  In case you are curious this is the list:December   1 - Make countdown chainDecember   2 - Go to Hallmark to buy an ornamentDecember   3 - Make a wreath out of pom pomsDecember   4 - Make thank you cards while listening to Christmas musicDecember   5 - Make a nativity craftDecember   6 - Write a letter to SantaDecember   7 - Go see SantaDecember   8 - Eat popcorn and watch Charlie Brown's ChristmasDecember   9 - Decorate a gingerbread houseDecember 10 - Reindeer craft & watch RudolphDecember 11 - Write thank you notesDecember 12 - Read Christmas booksDecember 13 - Perform in a Christmas Program (for school)December 14 - Rent the Grinch Who Stole ChristmasDecember 15 - Bake cookies at Grammi's w/ cousinsDecember 16 - Wrap presentsDecember 17 - Paint ornamentsDecember 18 - Buy a new Christmas movieDecember 19 - Make pizza in the shape of a Christmas treeDecember 20 - Do melting snowman & watch FrostyDecember 21 - Make popcorn & drive around to look at lightsDecember 22 - Go shopping w/ Daddy for MamaDecember 23 - Go downtown to see the treeDecember 24 - Bake cookies for SantaBesides this we will also be doing an Advent reading each evening.  I made Ann's last year and we really enjoyed it.  We will be using it again this year.  Now I am not trying to rush the Christmas season!  I am just trying to make it so I can have a stress free holiday and really reflect on the meaning of the season.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Yes, I know it isn't even November yet!  I looked at the calendar for December and almost cried when saw how packed it is.  I made the decision that I was going to work ahead so that the busy schedule and all the other things that come with the month of December would not take away the wonder of the season. I saw this idea and thought it was something that the boys would enjoy.  We did it last week and they turned out better then I had imagined! You know how crazy a two and three year old can get when they are painting so  I made a template to keep things neat.  I cut out a circle in another piece of cardstock for where the leaves would go.  I placed it over the handprint tree trunk that way I could let the boys do it, but still control where the paint went.  Trust me if I hadn't done that there would be fingerprints everywhere!  I originally hadn't planned to make the leaves falling.  Since there was an oops with the paint falling leaves it was!I always have the boys make a handmade Christmas gift for their parents.  When I saw how wonderful these looked I knew what the boys would be giving this year.  To make it super frugal I could have gone thrifting for frames.  As things are busy right now I opted to buy frames that were on sale and then use an extra 15% off coupon.  I can't tell you how happy I am with the way these turned out.  I hope Jeff and Angel love them as much as I do!Please be sure to stop by and visit Tammy for more Pinterest inspired ideas.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I didn't have a coupon when I was there so I decided to wait to go back the next week.  Fast forward a couple of weeks and I finally made it back.  The bucket I wanted was no longer there.  Out of stock and I was told there would be no more.  They said their seasonal supply will be limited this year as they are trying to avoid a lot of unsold merchandise.  I get it, but still I was disappointed.  So, on to plan B.  I couldn't find a round container so I settled for this oval.  The price was right and with my coupon I hoped to make it work.  I had Chuck spray it with an off white paint.  One that I had for another project.  When that was done I painted the rim in my favorite brick red color.  I wasn't in love with it at this point so I lightly sanded where I had painted the rim.  My hope was to give it a old feel. This is one of those project where I wasn't like Wow I love it! when I was done.  Now my question to you is did I pass or fail at achieving my goal?  What do you think?  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

So much has happened in the last week that I don't even know where to begin.  The big news is that Chuck and I made the decision to be baptized last Sunday.   Our pastor came by last Saturday and we made the decision at that time.  We didn't tell anyone we were doing this.  On Sunday morning those who were going through baptism spoke and then Pastor Bryan said that he had been speaking with a couple other people about baptism, could we please come forward.  As we were leaving the isle I heard Chuck's mom say \"Awwww\" as she sucked in a huge breath.  It was amazing hearing my husband become emotional as he shared his heart.  To be able to share this experience with the one I love is indescribable.  Megan has been home for the past two weeks for fall break.  It feels like she has been home a long time.  I have mixed feelings about her returning to school tomorrow.  She loves it, but I really miss her.  One night while making pizza I went to help Megan spread the dough.  She asked how I could do it so well.  I told her it is experience and she would get better the more she did it.  She look at me and then said who are you... Chef Boyardee?  I laughed and then thought someone has been watching to much television!  We are experiencing some Indian Summer.  I am trying to take advantage of it.  I hope that the rain holds off so I can clean out the flower beds and complete some projects.  Chuck is off for the next two days.  I am looking forward to spending my days with him.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

As many of you know apples in the mid west have not done well due to a freeze, a hail storm and the drought.  The great thing about this orchard is that they have a cute country store that sells many local things.  Meat, pies, vegetables and fruit.  Since my grapevine didn't do well this year I picked up half a bushel of concord grapes. I didn't have time to make the jelly right away, but as you know grapes won't wait.  I juiced the grapes and then stored it until I had time to make the jelly.  You can store the juice in the refrigerator or can it.  It just depends on how long until you are ready to make your jelly. I think jelly is one of the easier things to make.  If you are new to home preserving this might be a good place to start.  If you would like to see how I make my jelly you can see the post from last year. If you are wondering I got 30 1/2 jars.  That should keep us going for a while!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Do you see apples on these trees?    Just a few here and there.  Due to freeze after the trees had blossomed and a hale storm they said that 1 out of every 10 apples is good.  Wow!  All of the good apples have been picked and the damaged ones left on the trees will be used for cider.  ﻿This is first time I have been to this orchard and the views were beautiful.  We were able to tour the kitchen.  The ladies were making apple and blueberry pies.  Sold by the slice or frozen to take home. That is a lot of pie dough to roll out!Did say that I enjoyed the scenery?!There was a small area with animals that was a hugh hit.  Although I was disappointed in this trip as we were not able to pick apples (and for a few other reason I won't go into) I had a special moment with Megan that made it all worth it.  I took her to the store to buy her a apple cider slush.  We went out and sat on a bench so she could drink it and she said isn't this nice and quiet.  She then went on to say that we don't get this very often.  I hope stores that memory of a little bit of peace and quiet quiet shared together because I know I sure will!

I did a previous post on shopping once a month.  The thing that is most important in doing most of your shopping once a month is menu planning.  I use to plan my meals once a week and found that I would be missing something or would get lazy and not make a plan.  Both of these things cost me money.  My solution is to make a monthly menu plan.  At the beginning of the month (or the week before) I will do a quick inventory of my pantry and freezer.  I then print out a blank menu for the month.  I sit down and plan a meal for each day of the month.  I make sure to mark the number of dinners that we budget to eat out that month.  (To be honest this is something that I am working.  It is easy to have those spontaneous meals out. )  Beside shopping once a month I have been trying to do some bulk shopping to stretch the budget.  The thing about this is that you have to have a little room in your budget as the initial purchase is a  more.  After the items are broken down the price is less per normal package.  I also keep a well stocked pantry and freezer.  I am a huge advocate of having a stockpile of food for hard times.  We never know when there will be a job loss or natural disaster.  Now that my menu is complete and my pantry and freezer are well stocked I am ready for the month.  I don't use my menu in any order.  The day or night before I will look at my menu and decide what to have.  As I make a meal I will mark it off.  I only plan dinner.  Lunch is usually leftovers or I wing it.  I will sometimes make a note at the bottom of the menu with some lunch ideas.  I know that some things will need to be eaten first.  Grapes and bananas are the first fruits eaten.  I also make sure to prep my fruits and veggies soon after the shopping trip.  I like to wash my lettuce and make salad stored in Mason jars.  It seems to last longer this way.  I also use my freezer to stretch things.  I sometimes will freeze fresh veggies until I am ready to use them.  I also make up meal bags.  One month I made soup.  I cooked extra meat and then bagged it and some fresh cut carrots to use in a pot pie later in the month.  I try to limit my trips to twice a month.  Once for my big shopping trip and then again mid-month for milk and fresh fruit and veggies if needed.  You'll notice I said try.  Some months I am better at this then others.  I do know that the months I plan well and stay out of the store the grocery budget is lower.  This is what is currently working for me.  As with anything it is constantly changing and being tweaked to meet the needs of my life.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment.***I had a question asked:  \"What is Find It, Fix It?\"  I thought I could answer it here in case someone else was wondering.  I reserve that for nights when I have a headache, am super tired or just don't feel like being in the kitchen.  Basically everyone is one their own.  You can eat whatever you want for dinner.  Megan loves this as it means she can have PB&J or her beloved noodles with Parmesan cheese!  This is also a great way clear the frig of leftovers.  I gleaned this idea from my sister and it is big hit with her kids also.***"},

I have a small notepad and then my spiral notebook.  In the back I have some magazines that I need to look through.  I wanted to see if there are any recipes I want to clip. I also worked on Megan's room today.  This is after a whirlwind weekend.  She loves boxes and as soon as one arrives she claims it.  Sometimes I wonder why we have toys! lolI threw out a bag of trash.  Is it just my daughter that can never part with a piece of paper?  Along with two boxes of things to give away.    Ahhh, much better!  Tomorrow I am going to run a couple of errands in the morning and then I will tackle my room and the bathroom.  I don't know about you, but I enjoy cleaning and organizing.  It is a wonderful feeling to go back into that space and see how neat and tidy everything is.  Maybe I am weird.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},
{"title": "A Little Crafting", "date": "Sunday, September 09, 2012", "text": "One Sunday after church the weather was fantastic.  It was the first day that you could feel fall in the air.   I knew that it was time for a little outdoor craft time.  I started these happy little flowers.  ﻿ Megan and I made our area look pretty by adding a table cloth and then bringing out our craft things.Megan was delighted to create with all of the scraps.To make these I used the inexpensive sheets of felt you can get at the craft store.  I used a lid from a yogurt container for the flower middle.I cut two circles at the same time so that the front and back of the flower would match.  For the flower petals I cut a piece into 1/2 inch pieces.I then glued the pieces to make a loop.The flower \"petals\" were then glued to one of the circles.The top was put on then pinned together.  I didn't make anymore progress that afternoon, but I can tell you that the afternoon was priceless!  Taking the time to share something I love with my Megan was great.  She had a blast!  It is in moments like this that she shares her hearts desire and we make precious memories.  In my spare time I stitched and stuffed these.  I used embroidery floss and handstitched to make thm look rustic.  I collected sticks that were inserted and hot glued for the stem.  At the moment they are in jars in this tote.  I think it is a little crowded so I will probably pull out a few to spread around as I decorate for fall this week.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},

{"title": "Saturday Breakfast", "date": "Sunday, September 02, 2012", "text": "All week we have been hearing that Issac would be moving into Indiana and the weekend would be wet.  After a very dry summer rain is certainly welcome!  I think rainy days are meant to be slow.  What better way to start a slow, rainy day then with a leisurely breakfast.  Before we headed to bed Friday evening I pulled the outside table to the middle of the back porch.  I wasn't sure how heavy it would be raining and wanted to be sure to have dry place to serve breakfast. When I woke up Saturday there was no rain.  So much for Mr. Weatherman's forecast!If you have been around for a while you know that I have a love for mason jars.  They are so cute and super practical!  Two things that make this girl happy. :)  When I saw this post I knew what I would be serving.  While these were baking Megan and I got busy making some freshly squeezed orange juice.  I like my orange juice really cold.  I usually add ice to it, but I don't like it when the ice melts and it gets watered down.  To remedy this I made some orange juice ice cubes the night before.  Problem solved!I have seen this idea on many blogs.  I thought it would be the icing on the cake along with the breakfast in a jar.Breakfast was rounded out with hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit.  We ended up sitting outside for a long time.  Enjoying the sound of the world waking up and the company and silliness of the ones I love most!  .  Please visit Tammy for some great Pintrest inspirations.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Jam Packed Fun!", "date": "Tuesday, August 28, 2012", "text": "Over the weekend we had not one, but two family reunions to attend.  Friday night we headed about an hour and a half away to start our first adventure.  My parents are responsible for my family reunion.  It was decided that this would be our last year to host the reunion.  It is lots of work and with Megan in school I am not able to go down as early as normal.  That puts more work on my parents.  As sad as it is to end this era I know that it is the best thing at the moment. My cousin brought this cute cake!  Although we go away for the reunion I think the thing we enjoy the most is our time spent at the inn.  There was time for Megan and her cousins to swim.A lovely sunset walk.  What a great way to erase the stress of everyday life!We always make time to do a little exploring.  The town where the inn is has an Amish community.  Right after we turned off the main road we were greeted by this sign.  We passed many buggies and wagons.We even saw the Amish schoolhouse.Sunday we hit the road again and headed two hour south for Chuck's reunion.  It is always held at a state park.  Grandma is on the end in the black pants.  They are a wonderful group and share some great stories of times past.  I could sit and listen to them all day.Some time was spent hiking.  This is cake rock and we try to take a picture of Megan here each year.This park is know for it's waterfalls.  This is the top of what is know as Little Clifty.  There is usually a steady stream of water falling over the edge of these rocks.  We have been getting some rain so seeing how dry this is really put the drought into perspective.  Wow!By the time we headed home Sunday evening Megan was a dirty, tired little girl. Hmmm... I wonder why? lolIt was a very long weekend, but lots of fun.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

You fill your greased muffin tins with pancake batter.  I usually use an ice cream scoop to get a consistent size.  Then you add your toppings.  I used sausage for most as I think Chuck would enjoy those most.  I also made some blueberry and chocolate chip pancake muffins.  They are quite delicious!These should freeze and re-heat beautifully!  Just what I need for those busy mornings.May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Corn... Finally!", "date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2012", "text": "I join you this afternoon in much better spirits.  A couple hours of rest was the perfect solution!With the drought corn has been very hard to come by.  My parents ran across some listed on Craigslist and we jumped on it.  We ended up getting 30 dozen for $40.00!  That was a fantastic price since most places were selling it for $5.00/dozen and had a limited supply.I shared 6 dozen with my mother-in-law and then got busy on the rest.  You could tell that the season had been rough as some ears weren't fully developed and there were some worms.  We knew this going in as the farmer told us that he didn't spray the corn a second time.  He didn't want to put any additional money into a crop that might fail.  I certainly understand that!Anyway, we did end up with plenty of corn.  I am truly grateful for it!  Mom and I worked together and ended up with 33 quart bags containing 3 cups each and then two dozen froze on the cob. Now I must run and give my kitchen some attention as the floor is super sticky. :)  Well worth it when I serve this yummy summer treat on a cold winter day!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Sigh.  I am tired.  Not only physically tired, but mentally tired.  I know we all have those times when everything in life seems overwhelming.  That makes me even more exhausted because I know compared to others I live a good life.  I have decided to take the afternoon off.  Well, as much as a mom can.  What better way to spend a quiet afternoon?!  I plan to snuggle under a cozy blanket, drink some warm, delicious tea and read.  When you are feeling down one the best things you can do is spend time with a friend.  My prayer is that this friend will help with my mental tiredness.  After a little time in the Word I plan to snuggle under my blanket for a little rest.  Ahhh.... just what the doctor ordered!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

{"title": "Homemade Instant Oatmeal", "date": "Tuesday, August 07, 2012", "text": "I have been researching and playing with making instant oatmeal.  I finally have a keeper recipe. For this you will need:1/2 cups quick cooking oats1/2 t cinnamon2 t dry milk1/8 t salt4 t brownI made a big batch.  I didn't keep track and can't tell you have many times I doubled, tripled and quadrupled this recipe. To make it you take 1/2 cup of mix and then add hot water.  Up to 1/2 cup of water depending on the consistency you like.  I use about a 1/3 cup of water.  Add any desired fruit.  For this bowl I used a teaspoon of dried blueberries.I have seen this stored in snack size bags.  I decided that I wasn't willing to add the extra cost for that convenience.  I decided to store it in a glass jar with a 1/2 cup scoop.  I include the scoop so that I don't have to take the time to dig one out each morning.In case you are wondering about price comparison I figured it out for you. :)  Of course this price will vary depending on how much your ingredients cost.  This batch cost $0.11 for each 1/2 cup serving.  A generic that is about 1/3 cup is $0.16 a serving.  Not a huge savings, but overtime it will add up.  Especially considering that some weeks my crew would go through two boxes!  I don't know about you but I see my grocery bill rising and I am not bringing home more groceries.  Sometimes even less then I use to.  I am going to see if I can lower the price even more by checking out some prices at Aldi.I would love to hear what convenience foods you are making from scratch to stretch your grocery budget.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},
{"title": "Hospitality", "date": "Monday, August 06, 2012", "text": "Hospitality is the relationship between guest and host, or the act or practice of being hospitable. Specifically, this includes the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers.  This is the definition according to Wikipedia.  There is nothing mentioned about a beautiful home, perfect setting or a table that is set for a Country Living Magazine spread.  Not that there is anything wrong with all of those things.  I like beautiful things and am really inspired by it.  I think that sometimes we see those magazine spreads or perfect blog post and feel like what we have to offer isn't enough.  I know that I have issues with that.  Lets face it not all of us, actually most of us, don't live in big, beautiful homes.  We live in modest, cozy places.  Life is sometimes busy and we don't have time to plan the perfect place setting.  I know that there are times that I let the comparison game start to make me feel like I don't measure up.  When that happens I am less likely to be hospitable.  Recently we had the opportunity to host a couple over.  It was spontaneous.  The week had been busy, the house was clean and I just didn't feel like going to lots of fuss that I would then need to clean up. We used our finest china.Served out of our best serving dishes.Served simple fare of BLT's, deviled eggs, veggies and a variety of pickles.  I used what I had on hand.  The lunch invite was extended at 10 and lunch was served at noon.   I didn't go to a lot of fuss and you know what... no one seemed to mind.  I understand how easy it is to get caught up in being perfect.  This afternoon served as a great reminder of what true hospitality is.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

One of the things that I am being intentional about is doing things.  It is easy to have a bunch of ideas, but what fun is that if you never use the ideas?!  When I saw that Tammy was hosting Pinned It, Made It Monday I knew this was the motivation I needed to actually use my ideas.The ironic thing about my first post to Pinned It, Made It is that I pinned this idea from Tammy's daughter Joy! :)Anyway,  I found the idea here.  One bar of Ivory Soap was placed on a piece of wax paper in the microwave.  The timer was set for three minutes, but it was stopped when the cloud stopped growing. Megan thought it was very cool, especially watching it grow.  It can be messy since your cloud will flake apart when played with.  I think next time we will make it right before bath time and then she can play with it in the tub.Be sure to stop by and visit Tammy for some more great ideas!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

It was actually cool enough Friday evening for a bonfire and fireworks.  I didn't take one picture while at the reunion.  I was too busy taking care of food and keeping an eye on Megan.  It was hot again Saturday and when things started to wind down I suggested we head back to our home. A group of us went bowling Saturday evening.  This was Megan's first time.  She is already asking when we can go again.  After church on Sunday we headed back to my father-in-law's for some more family time.  Here are the cousins watching their crazy dads having a ping pong tournament.  There were some crafts.Again the cart rides were a hit.  This is Chuck's cousin Melanie and her family.  They farm in Iowa and it had been three years since we had seen them.  We get along great and immediately clicked like we had seen each other last week.  We agreed that we don't want to go three years before getting together again.It has taken me all day to recover from our whirlwind weekend, but I am thankful for family!May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

I have been busy enjoying summer.  Tending to plants take up a good part of my evening.  I think this might be one of the best years for my annuals.  It isn't even July 1st and they are overflowing from their containers.  Makes me a happy girl! The garden is doing well.  Just ignore the weeds. :)  The green beans, cucumbers and zucchini are blooming.  There are even green tomatoes on the vine.  I am looking forward to all of the fresh goodies.  Lots of watering is going on as we are on day 16 of no rain.  It sounds like the farmers are starting to get a little nervous.  The lack of rain has meant plenty of days spent outside.  Playing in the backyard and visiting Grammi & Grandpa's for a swim.Megan has declared Tuesday morning as famous flying pancake day.  It is nice that something as simple as pancakes brings such joy to the kids. Most of Father's Day was spent at my father-in-law's.  I packed up everything needed to grill out and we headed over there. It was a great afternoon.  Slow, relaxing, good company and Megan and her cousins had a blast \"swimming\" in the hot tub.  All of the summer fun sometimes wears a person out.  Naps are rare for Megan.     When she sacks out it reminds me that she is still a little thing.  I am trying to cherish the moments as she is growing up much to fast.  I hope that you are having plenty of days with sunshine and blue skies.  With just the right amount of rain mixed in. :)May your day be filled with joy and contentment.  Happy Summer!"},
{"title": "Laundry Lessons", "date": "Sunday, June 10, 2012", "text": "Like most of you I spend a good deal of my time doing laundry.  Once upon a time I detested laundry.  It was the chore that seemed to pile up and then it took forever to get it done.That was before I stopped working and had the time to really embrace home keeping. I now have a laundry schedule and for the most part I am able to keep up with it.  I especially like doing laundry when I am able to hang it out on the line.  Not only does it makes it smell good it gives me time to think.  Just as laundry must be cleansed often, diligently, I must also take the time to cleanse my heart.  For I am human and have many faults. Who can understand his errors?  Cleanse me from secret faults. ~ Psalm 19:12 Laundry is cleansed by soap and water.  I am cleansed by God's word.How can a young man cleanse his ways?  By taking heed according to Your word. ~ Psalm 119:9If we confess our sins.  He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. ~ 1 John 1:19When the laundry is complete you end up with fresh smelling clean clothes.  When I cleanse my heart by the word of God I end up with peace.And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. ~ Colossians 3:15May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},

In the end I had just enough for a batch of jam. There was just enough left in the pan for a taste.  Megan proclaimed \"Yum!\"This is just the first of the canning season.  Beets are in and I plan to pickle some for my father-in-law.  I always this time of year referred to as the lazy days of summer.  I don't know about you, but I find these anything but lazy.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},
{"title": "Salad in a Jar", "date": "Sunday, June 03, 2012", "text": "Our time away from the daily grind was fantastic!  With a death in the family and then a sick little girl the to do list went out the window, but it was still relaxing.  After our romp through the family farm we encountered some ticks.  Megan ended up with one on her back.  It was removed and then she started to complain of a headache Friday evening and was running a fever by Saturday morning.  I spoke to the doctor and was told we would monitor her the next 24 hours.  She didn't seem concerned about the tick bite.  On Sunday morning she was running a 102.9 temperature with Tylenol.  I am not a freak out kind of mom, but with the recent tick bite I was being extremely careful.  We took Megan to the after hours clinic and this doctor was also concerned because of the tick bite.  We started a round of antibiotics (which is the first time Megan has been on one) and hope and pray that is the end of it.  Thankfully she is already feeling better.Have you seen the salad in a jar on Pinterest and other blogs?  I have seen several of them and thought what a great idea!  While Megan spent time sleeping I was busy in the kitchen whipping some of them up. I started out with a bagged lettuce mix that was on Managers Special at Kroger.  I then added chopped carrots, a hard boiled egg, some cut up roasted chicken breast and topped it off with a little cheese.  Really the combinations are endless. I love a good salad in the summer.  I don't always make them because sometimes lunch time is hectic with little ones ready for a rest.  I  am looking forward to enjoying a good salad without all of the last minute prep. May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},
{"title": "Lucketts Virginia", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2012", "text": "One of the places I wanted to go while in Virginia was Lucketts.  Lucketts is where my grandmother was raised.  I woke up the first day I was in Virginia and it hit me that Miss Mustard Seed had a booth in a shop there.  I knew that I had make a stop there. On Saturday we made a stop at The Old Lucketts Store.  Oh my! What a great place.   I could have spent hours and hours there, but it was hot.  Super hot.  I made a beeline for Miss Mustard Seeds area.Because space was limited, especially with our treasures from the farm, I had to restrain myself.  I purchased these keys to go with the lock we salvaged at the farm.I also purchased this watering can vase from another vendor. If you are in the area you won't be disappointed if you stop by.  If so you need take a peek at the restored school building across the street.  This is the building where my grandmother went to school.They are in the process of finishing the restoration of this building.  I am so pleased with all the small details that have been maintained.  After checking out the school we ended driving out into the country.We went on a search for Granny's place.  The home was built by my maternal great grandparents. I have a picture of this home from the 1950's.  It really hadn't changed much.  I was amazed to see that the same fence is there.  I don't know of many fences built today that will still be standing in 50 years.  They sure don't make things the way they use to.This home is still in the family.  My aunt by marriage, Ada, still lives here.  She moved in as a young bride with my great grandparents and raised four children here.  When we would go visit the men were usually in the fields and Ada and Granny together in the home.  It always makes me think of Olivia and Grandma on the Waltons.  My hope is that this land and home will stay in the family for generations to come.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},
{"title": "Chasing Roots", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2012", "text": "It had been ten years since I had been to Virginia.  Although I still have family there I know that with Pops passing I may never return.  I have deep roots there and knew I needed to take some time to chase them down.My great grandfather Donohoe grew up on a farm that was about 800 acres.  He ended up married to a neighbor girl, Carrie.  Carrie and her sister Cora lived with their parents on a 300 acre farm. Seeing as how Cora never married the land ended up in the hands of my great-grandfather Donohoe. When my grandparents, Mom & Pop, married they ended up settled in a home across from the home Carrie and Cora grew up in. For years they were neighbors to Aunt Cora.  They lived there from '40's until Pop's brothers forced a sell of all the land in the '70's.The place we refer to as the old place or the farm is where I will begin.Aunt Cora lived in her childhood home all her life.  When she passed away no one moved into her home.  No one did anything with the place including clearing it out.  My mom said she has no idea why.  She said growing up there was even home canned goods still in the cellar.After the farm was sold Aunt Cora's place was bulldozed.  Luckily for us it was dropped and there most of it lays.     Chuck and my mom climbed up the debris and did a little digging.  There were able to pull out bits and pieces.  One of the things they found were bricks from the chimney.  Considering the bricks are over 100 years old they are in great condition.  Full bricks that didn't even have mortar on them.  We took enough for all of us, including the grand kids to all have one.  The younger grand kids didn't quite understand why we wanted bricks.  I know that in time they will cherish the link to their past.  It was like the bricks had been waiting for us!Not far from Aunt Cora's Pop had built a small barn for the cows.  The barn is still standing and as we looked over my sister spotted a bucket that had been turned over the fence post!So many questions.  Who put the bucket over the post?  How long had it been there?  I know that it had been there for a while as the bottom is no longer in tact. There was a door leaning against the barn.  Chuck said that it was perfect.  No rot and it looked like it could have still been used.   There was part of the door lock still on the door and Chuck took it off for me.Our intent when we talked about going to the old place was to get boards off of the big red barn.  The barn is no longer there.  We did the next best thing and took boards off of the cow barn.The next best thing turned out to be the best thing.  Mom remembers Pop building this barn.  Knowing that Pop physically touched the boards while building this barn... wow... what a great piece of history to have.  I have some plans for the boards.  I will share when I get it all together.  In front of Aunt Coras were a stack of stones.  Mom said the stones were part of a fireplace.  A fireplace to slave quarters.  I debated if I should share this.  I know it brings to mind different emotions from different people.  What I will say is that although I don't think it was right to own another human times were different then.  From dates it looks like that occurred when my great-great grandparents ran the farm.  This area must have been used for dumping or storage.  There were many treasures uncovered in this area.This poker was a favorite find of moms.The home where mom was raised is no longer there. When it was demolished the debris was cleared away.  Chuck did go to that area and found a couple of things.  He found one of my favorite type of Ball jar.  I will always wonder if Mom (grandmother) used this jar.  He also found this bucket.  The bottom is missing and I plan to use it as a planter.Around the old barn this jug was found.  Pop use to make homemade root beer.  Could this jug have been used for that?An old pully wheel was found.  I am not sure but I think it had a leather belt that ran around it to operate machinery.  I imagine many would see these things as junk.  I see them as a link to my families past. As sad I am that the barn and house were no longer standing I am glad that we went there.  It gave me some closure and I am happy to have shared it with Chuck and Megan.  If you made it to the end of this post... thank you for sharing my journey. May your day be filled with joy and contentment."},

Pop or his grand kids.  You know that was back in the 70's when candy wasn't given to children the way it is now.The smell of petunias, windows open at night with the sounds of crickets, dinners around the table and evenings spent sitting on the porch are the memories I hold dear of Mom and Pop.  Nothing fancy, just the little things that mean the most.  With the loss of Pop and Mom being gone for many, many years before him I feel like a chapter in my life is coming to an end.    A very, very good chapter that I will hold near and dear!My advise is to slow down and cherish the little things.  After all they are the things that truly matter."},

Anyway, this is some of the things that have been happening around my place.Megan covering up the green bean seeds.  She was a big help in the garden.There are carrots, tomatoes, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers and zucchini planted in the main garden.  My girl has a summer birthday and during the last two weeks of school you can pick a day to celebrate with your classmates.  On Friday I sent in cookies and goodie bags.The goodie bags included a mini watering can, sand rake and a water ball.  A cute tag was attached and now it is time to patiently wait for the school year to wrap up.Chuck used scrap fencing to make some cute planters for the boys I watch.  Painting with a 19 month old and an almost 3 year old at the same time was interesting.  Certainly a learning experience.  I told Chuck it looked like a paint explosion in the kitchen.  Once the explosion was over I used a dry brush to blend all of the paint blobs together.  I then let the boys decorate the front with a paint marker.  I loved they way they looked after the boys used the marker.  I hope mom liked them too.  I have been working on the never ending task of weed pulling.  Then the fun part of planting and getting to look a pretty spot.  The early spring has done wonders in the garden.  The clematis is full of blooms, blossoms and is pure joy to look at.  Of course in all the happenings there was a Mother's Day.  I was treated to breakfast out before heading to the grocery on Saturday.  Sunday morning brought cards and a new pair of earrings.  Chuck told me that Megan took money out of her piggy bank to buy them.  That makes them even more special!  I made an angel food cake and fruit truffle to take to my parents Sunday evening.  The boys grilled out and I spent a pleasant evening sitting on porch swing.  Surrounded by the ones I love makes for a great day!  Hope you all have a great week.  May your day be filled with joy and contentment!"},

Leftover ham on homemade bread made a quick Sunday dinner.Stock made from a turkey carcass makes a nice base for turkey noodle soup.  Along with leftover homemade bread this will make a yummy lunch on Monday.Eggs, leftover diced ham and cheese will go into the freezer for an easy breakfast. I got the idea for them from here.Ham will be used to season green beans and for this and that.  Turkey will be pulled out for a quick turkey manhattan dinner.With the rising cost of food it is hard to let things go to waste, especially if it is Mom's home cooking!

Although she is only in kindergarten half day I have enjoyed having her home in the mornings.  Everyday the kids have asked to put their chairs in a row and watched my cooking show.  I guess it is fun to watch me make lunch.  I spent most of today getting goodies ready for Sunday.  I made cheesecake and packaged in these cute jelly jars.I could no longer find the link, but I did see this idea on Pinterest.  I think they are adorable!I hard boiled 8 dozen eggs.  A few to devil and most were for coloring.It is a tradition to get together with my parents and my sister and family to have dinner and color eggs on Good Friday.  Always a good time!Most of you know that I am an avid reader.  My mother-in-law and I pass books back and forth and then they usually end up at Chuck's grandmothers.  I figured she gave the books away when she was done.  Nope!  We were over there last week and she brought out a huge box of books.  I had heard about paper back swap and thought this would be a good time to give it a try.  I signed up on Saturday and have mailed out 16 books so far.  I am excited to start receiving books.  As we have been reading lots of Easter books this week my heart and mind have been thinking and reflecting on the greatest sacrifice and gift.  It certainly humbles me.

I had one of those round metal ones and I never liked it.  It was hard to hang large items.Chuck took great care while putting this together.He used a half lap to make everything nice and secure.THE BASIC RULES FOR CLOTHESLINES(Author Unknown)1. You had to wash the clothes line before hanging any clothes--walk the entire lengths of each line with a damp cloth around the lines.2. You had to hang the clothes in a certain order, and always hang \"whites\" with \"whites,\" and hang them first.3. You never hung a shirt by the shoulders, always by the tail! What would the neighbors think?4. Wash day on a Monday! Never hang clothes on the Weekend, or Sunday, for Heaven's sake!5. Hang the sheets and towels on the outside lines so you could hide your \"unmentionables\" in the middle.6. It didn't matter if it was sub zero weather....clothes would \"freeze-dry.\"7. Always gather the clothes pins when taking down dry clothes! Pins left on the lines were \"tacky!\"8. If you were efficient, you would line the clothes up so that each item did not need two clothes pins, but shared one of the clothes pins with the next washed item.9. Clothes off of the line before dinner time, neatly folded in the clothes basket, and ready to be ironed.10. IRONED? Well, that's a whole other subject!A CLOTHESLINE POEM(Author Unknown)A clothesline was a news forecastTo neighbors passing by,There were no secrets you could keepWhen clothes were hung to dry.It also was a friendly linkFor neighbors always knew,If company had stopped on byTo spend a night or two.For then you'd see the \"fancy sheets\"And towels upon the line;You'd see the \"company table cloths\"With intricate designs.The line announced a baby's birthFrom folks who lived inside -As brand new infant clothes were hung,So carefully with pride!The ages of the children couldSo readily be knownBy watching how the sizes changed,You'd know how much they'd grown!It also told when illness struck,As extra sheets were hung;Then nightclothes, and a bathrobe, too,Haphazardly were strung.It also said, \"Gone on vacation now\"When lines hung limp and bare.It told, \"We're back!\" when full lines sagged, with not an inch to spare!New folks in town were scorned uponIf wash was dingy and gray,As neighbors carefully raised their brows,And looked the other way.But clotheslines now are of the past,For dryers make work much less.Now what goes on inside a homeIs anybody's guess!I really miss that way of life.It was a friendly sign.When neighbors knew each other bestby what hung on the line.I have been putting it to good use.

I never seems to work out because it is usually to wet.  The gift of the dry, warm weather has allowed me to work in the garden.My dad loves tiling so he takes care of that task.  He turned the soil Friday evening and we let it set to dry out a little more.  He was back on Saturday to til again.  Once that was done we did some planting.First beets and carrots were planted.  I added a couple rows of peas.  Thne Megan planted broccoli.  The remainder of the garden will rest because I am sure a more normal spring will return.  Much later the green beans, tomatoes and such will be added.Last year is the first time I have had a raised bed. I love them!I planted some leaf lettuce, bib lettuce and cabbage.  I am looking forward to trying grilled and roasted cabbage this year.   I hear they are wonderful. I should run.  I need to take some more pain reliever and then head over to pick up Megan.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

It is really hard to deep clean with the boys here and with the warm air and sunshine begging us to be outside.I did manage to make a trip to the library this week.I was after gardening books, but it looks like so was everyone else.  The selection was slim.One of the great things about having kids is that you sometimes get to act like one.It is fun to sometimes forget the list and just play.We spent an evening picking up sticks and doing a little raking.  Next thing I know Chuck says he is going to push over a dead tree. After a lot of pushing...it is going....and gone!This tree had needed to come down for a couple of years.  It stated to fall and then got caught up in another tree.  It is behind the fence in the wooded area keep getting pushed down the the to do list.The warmer temps prompted me pull out Megan's warm weather clothes.Other then her dresses most everything from last year still fits. She is still wearing size 4 shorts and capri's.  She seems to grow up and not out.  To bad her mother doesn't have that problem!Eli was a great help getting all the summer clothes pressed and put away.This has been a great week.The warm air, sunshine and outside playtime is just what we all needed.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

The attendant then comes out and pumps your gas.  Where I live you don't find that kind of service anymore.We picked up some ground beef from a small store.  You know the kind where it ground in the store from fresh beef.  Nothing that was ground in a factory far away and shipped in.  The butcher even chatted with us.We took advantage of the great weather to grill some of the beef on Sunday.  Delish! It was a very enjoyable day.  Every now and then you just need a day to get away.

She keeps telling me that she looks weird.  I think she looks adorable! :)A yummy meal ready to go into the oven.It is always the simple things that change our lives. And these things never happen when you are looking for them to happen ~ UnknownRainy days are meant for warm, cozy candlelight and baking...the old fashioned way (you know, without the use of the kitchen aid.)  It can be quite the workout for the old arm.  No wonder our grandmothers and great-grandmothers didn't need a gym membership.Sometimes I wonder why we ever spend money on toys. A bowl and a spoon or pot and lid occupy this little man better than any toy I have.  The marketing is good to make us...me... think that the kids need stuff.Warmer temperatures mean that I am able to step out in the evening.Catching a glimpse of the moon makes me happy!Tomorrow we are taking a road trip with my parents.  We are going to chase down some family history and visit a cemetery or two, drive down some country roads and you never know what else we might get into.  I am super excited!

I enjoy seeing all of the new life.It always reminds me of my heavenly father and His promise of eternal life.Megan loves hard boiled eggs.  My mom recently bought Megan this egg holder.Isn't it adorable?!  Speaking of eggs... Megan really wants chicks.  Over the weekend we went to the farm store and saw some.  She keeps asking Daddy if she can please have chicks.  He teases her and says chips, sure what kind of chips do you want.  She doesn't think it is very funny.The completion of the fence is the big project for this summer.  There would be no time to build a coop.  I told her we would talk more about it next year.  I will have read up on it and chat with some chicken owners.  Just to see how much work and cost is involved.  I admit the chicks are cute little things.Megan made a trip to the dentist today.  She has two loose teeth on the bottom and the permanent teeth are already coming in.  She had a cleaning and we wanted to make sure the baby teeth were not going to mess up the permanent teeth.Thankfully not.  The dentist said in a week or two the baby teeth should be out then the permanent teeth will naturally pull forward and straighten out.  Whew!  I wasn't looking forward to having those teeth helped out.  We spent a quiet afternoon and evening at home.  There was a lego and train party in the living room.   It resulted in a huge mess, but lots of fun!Tomorrow I start my early schedule with the boys I watch.  It is now time for me to settle down with the good book and then to hit the bed early.

The area south of where I live has been hit hard.  Towns are destroyed and many lives have been lost.  The story of the toddler girl found in a field had been our story of hope.  Sadly this sweet little one joined her parents, older brother and baby sister in heaven today.  Just heartbreaking.This morning Chuck and I were talking and I was saying I wish we could help.  Go and pass out water, do some clean up, anything really.  Honestly the best thing we can do is pray and offer monetary support.  It is going to take a lot of time and money to put the lives of these families and communities back together.If you felt led to help those in need the best way is to make a donation to the Red Cross.People can help those affected by disasters like the Midwest tornadoes and storms, as well as countless crises at home and around the world, by making a donation to support American Red Cross Disaster Relief.

Open windows are one of my favorite things.  No wonder I am feeling the urge to spring clean. :)Good use was made of the warmth and sunshine.

Made out of shaving cream.Blue food coloring was added to the shaving cream to represent the water that had evaporated into the cloud.Then the cloud burst and down came the rain!Simple, fun and educational!  When Conner's mom came he was excited to show her what we had done.  I loved listening to him explain it to her!  Makes all the effort worth it.

Like thinking I had a whole box of elbow macaroni and then finding out there wasn't enough to finish dinner. My solution was to purchase glass jars. I think it looks pretty and there are even empty jars in the back. The solution if I needed cooking directions was to print them off and then cut it fit the lid of jar. Since the storage solution for toys in the living room is working so well two units were purchased for Megan's room.Much, much better. Megan did a great job purging. We ended up with two trash bags of items to give away. I was able to move the craft items out of the closet. They drove me crazy in there because the doors were always open.

Boy did the closet need to be cleaned out!A couple of shelves were added to the bottom of the closet.Ah, much better.The medicine cabinet was wiped out and a few things were thrown out. I love that there is empty space! There is a drawer under the vanity. This is fantastic storage space. I added some baskets and plan to get a few more. It is amazing how much neater this space stays without the contents moving around when the drawer is opened and closed.Having everything neat and tidy made it easy for me to make a list of things I need to stock up on.

It is a love that I have enjoyed since I was a child. Those of you who are readers also know that it can get expensive. I am fortunate that my mother-in-law has the same taste in books and we pass books back and forth. Even with the book sharing it can still be expensive.I have tried using the library, but I wasn't thrilled with it. Most of my reading has a Christian base. The Christian area at my local library isn't large. One of my goals is to try to utilize the library more. So far it is working well!I use my latest book magazine to browse for books I am interested in.I circle those that I am interest in and mark out those I have already read.I then search to see if the book is available at the library.I then mark library if I find it. I have found that my library system does purchase Christian books just not a large quanity of each book. That explains some of the frustration when I would go to the libary and couldn't find what I was looking for. By searching I am able to see if the book is available anywhere in our library system. If so when ready I can put a hold on the book and it will be sent to my local branch.I receive an e-mail when the book is ready and then all I have to do is swing by and pick it up. I received an e-mail last week that two books on hold were ready. By the time I got to the library on Saturday all four of the books were on the hold shelf. Yes!As long as the books are picked up before the hold date expires and renewed or returned on time this is a thrifty way to support a reading habit.

One of the joys of living a full life! :) This probably didn't help.I did a crazy thing on New Year's Day and caught my finger in the beaters of a mixer. Yes, you heard that right! I was getting ready to mash potatoes and couldn't get one of the beaters locked in. I meant to hit eject and catch the falling beater. Instead I hit the on button and it caught my finger and twisted it. I feel really silly that it happened.Anyway, it hurt a lot! Luckily I pulled my wedding ring off when it happened because it immediately started to swell. Years ago I broken the same finger. I still had the plastic splint that the orthopedic doctor gave me at that time. I didn't see the need to spend money going to doctor since I knew there wasn't much to be done. It is better, but I still can not bend it any further then to make my hand into a C. I will continue to wear the splint and see how it goes.For January the weather has been strange. The beginning of the week it was cold and blustery. A perfect day to make a pot of turkey noodle soup.Cuddle under a warm blanket with friend and watch a favorite Bible story, David and Goliath.Then the warm up began and by Friday it felt like a spring day.This weather has caused some amazing sunrises.I love stepping out for a bit of fresh air and enjoying this view as I begin my day.It has also meant some outside time. Chuck worked a little bit on the fence and finished up one of the gates.Megan used her outside time to fly a kite.Even our furry friends were out and about enjoying the warmth.I hear that the cold and maybe a snowflake or two is heading back next week. In the meantime I will cherish the glorious weather.I am ready to settle down with a cup of tea and finish up An Amish Christmas.

Oh, how nice it has been!We were able to take time to set some goals for the new year.There are three categories on our list: financial, home and personal. The plan is to come together every three months and evaluate these goals and see if they need to be tweaked.I have already started on one of the goals for home. To purge and put every nook and cranny in order. I still have many things to do but I am feeling so much better already. I love it when things are neat and orderly. I think that once I am done I will start all over and go through and purge again. Especially in the office/craft/catch all room and Megan's room.Stuff is just that stuff.

I am a little bit stressed and overwhelmed at the moment. My heart just hasn't been here so I have decided to take a little break.I will be back. I just don't know when, so don't count me as gone. I am hopeful to get my act together while on my hiatus. Nothing serious going on and no one needs to worry. Just a bunch of little things and we all know how the little things can add up and then feel like a big thing. I will still be reading blogs I just don't feel like my mind is clear enough to make good post.Take care and I hope you are stopping to enjoy the simple moments! Really those are the moments that matter most."},
{"title": "My Kind of Day", "date": "Sunday, December 04, 2011", "text": "I had my nieces over on Saturday so my sister could do some shopping. When I found out they would be coming I knew exactly what we would do... craft!We started out making snow globes.Super easy. We hot glued mini ornaments (with the hanger cut off) into the lid of a baby food jar. Filled the jar with cold water and added 1 tsp of glitter. The lid was put on and then hot glue was added where the lid meets the jar.Next wooden ornament were painted.Then snowmen were made.You can find directions here. This was my favorite activity of the day.Last but not least were paper chains. They are a countdown to Christmas.A super fun day and I can't wait to have another crafty kind of day.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

He who does this builds a sanctuary for God and opens a fountain of blessing for men. ~ J.R. MillerAfter a busy weekend it has been a pleasure to spend some time at home. Like the title of this blog says my heart is always home.Winter is starting to make itself know. It has cooled down, the skies are gray and there have been some snow flurries. A perfect time to try a new recipe.Honey wheat bread. Not a keeper, but that is okay. Sometimes you win and some times you don't.Laundry washed, ironed, folded and put away.At least for a moment!With the grey skies and early sunset there have been more and more candles burning.I love the warm glow.It gives me pure joy to sit back in the evening and know that my kitchen is tidy and ready for a new day.The new toy shelf is working out well.They love being able to grab a container and take off to play with it. Megan and Abe took the potato heads to the kitchen table.I love it when they play with things that spark their imagination. Not every moment at home is fun, but if you stop and savor a few simple moments you can find so much joy.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "My Weekend", "date": "Sunday, November 27, 2011", "text": "It is tradition that the tree goes up the day after Thanksgiving. Megan was so excited she about drove me crazy last week asking how many days until tree day! Things started out great.In no time the tree was up and ready for the fun stuff. Or so we thought. It is a pre-lit tree and half of the lights were not working. After some trouble shooting it was determined that they were beyond repair. I had to unclasp, untie and cut all of the lights off. Good news is that we did get it finished and the light strings look even better.Finally we were able to do the fun stuff!Here it is almost done. My step-mother-in-law used a decorative fence in her decorating one year and we asked to borrow it. Chuck modified it some and this is the finished result.A tree that I hope is safe from a couple of wild toddlers!I didn't go out and join in all the crazy shopping Friday morning, but I did step out for a quick run Friday evening. There was a shelving unit that was part of a three day sale. I thought it would be perfect for holding toys in the living room.The kitchen that I had out was not working. Abe was trying to ride on the doors and Eli dumped out all of the food and dished. I spent Saturday moving things around in Megan's room so the kitchen would fit and swapping toys.Ahh, much better.I spent Sunday afternoon working on an Advent.You can get a free download from Ann at A Holy Experience. I am super excited to do this!It has been a long, wonderful weekend. I am sorry to see it end.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I have been dealing with a little one just not feeling her best.Only a cold, but enough to make her miserable, grouchy and needy. Thankfully she has felt much better today.Lots has happened in my home today. It started off with pancakes for breakfast.These are suppose to be turkeys. Chuck couldn't see it in the picture, but the kids loved it.On a commercial Megan saw where cookies were cut into the shape of your hand print and made into turkeys.I almost didn't do this because of time. I bought pre-made cookie dough and frosting on a last minute run to the store today. I am so glad that I did. Out of all the activities we have done this month this might be Megan's favorite.The kitchen has been a busy place today.A couple dozen eggs were deviled, the kitchen sink was clogged (thanks to my mom taking care of that problem!), brownies are cooling and tomorrow I will make the green beans with potatoes. Then it is off to Grandmas.

{"title": "Felt Poinsettias", "date": "Tuesday, November 15, 2011", "text": "I am working on some crafty things. Things I can make that are inexpensive to decorate my home for Christmas. I saw these over at Kindra's and knew exactly what I would do with them.I had to purchase the felt and the bells. The cost was under $6.00 and would have been less if I hadn't forgotten my 40% off coupon! Still much less then if I had bought pre-made poinsettias.I couldn't find my floral wire so I used pipe cleaners instead. They weren't quite as strong as the floral wire would have been. To counter that I placed cotton balls in the jars for stability.I thought the cotton balls gave it the effect of snow.My next project will take a little longer as it involves a little sewing. I don't normally decorate until the day after Thanksgiving but I am anxious to get going this year.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Giving Thanks", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "One of the things that I really like about Thanksgiving is that it causes you to pause and give thanks.To help Megan stop and give thanks we have been working on a thankful book.We are using the alphabet and daily stop to write in the thankful book.Certainly something I want to keep so I had Megan write her name and year on the back of the book.I am always looking for few things to do with Megan. I would love to hear ways to help your children to stop and count their blessings.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Sun to Snow!", "date": "Thursday, November 10, 2011", "text": "I finally finished the deep clean of my kitchen. It took my several days, but I am thrilled with the results.When you look at this picture it might not look much different then it normally does after I tidy up, but I know the difference. I didn't realize my cabinets were so dirty until I had cleaned a couple. Every nook and cranny inside and out has been wiped down. Now if I can only keep it this way!I did slow down on the cleaning to enjoy a beautiful day. The sun was shinning and it reached 70*!We were busy outside playing and putting things away for winter. It was so nice that I sat out on the swing until well after dark.I snapped this picture on my way inside. I love how cozy my home looked. :)The following day I woke up to rain and it was super windy. The windy brought in cold weather. With the colder temperatures we enjoyed one of our favorite lunches.Today we saw snow!There was enough that it stuck to the grass. I know it won't last, but it was sure pretty.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I am knee deep in a big cleaning project.The living room is done and the kitchen is almost there. I am hopeful to have my entire home deep cleaned by the end of next weekend. We'll see. It is a major project and with babysitting and normal life it might not happen.Megan is a beginning reader. She is constantly sounding out words and asking me to spell things for her. This is what I found her reading this evening.Oh yes, that is the phone book. She was reading the numbers to us. Silly girl!If a few days pass and you haven't heard from me you'll know I am busy washing baseboards and vacuuming behind furniture.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Monday night we joined my sister at my parent's home for dinner and some trick or treating.Megan as a \"Jak in Bos\" She sounded it out and that is how she spelled it. I am enjoying watching her develop her reading skills.The weather has been mild and we are trying to get things put in order outside.All of the flower beds have been cleaned out for their winter rest.My clematis has a couple of flowers and some of the leaves are starting to green. I think it is confused!Megan has been spending lots of time outside. Oh, how sad we will all be when most of our time is spent indoors.Enjoying the sunset.When I see things of beauty like this it is hard to understand how someone can question or even deny God.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Literally!Friday started out with a fundraising Jump A Thon at school. Then there was an orange party in the classroom. Dinner with the in-laws and a trip to the hardware store. Another section of fence was almost completed.The swoop needs to be cut and then this section will be done. Yes!Megan asked for a large pumpkin this year.She was delighted with this and anxious to get busy.After all of the yuck and muck was removed it was carving time.Megan drew both of the faces and Chuck helped her to cut them. I think they turned out great.I saw a cupcake that looked like candy corn on Pinterest and knew I wanted to try them.This is the first time Megan has used the mixer by herself. She did really well, but I am waiting for the splatter. I don't think you get the don't pull the beaters out of the batter statement until you do it and make a splatter mess. One of those lessons that you have to learn the hard way.I didn't get the color separation I was looking for because I forgot to drop the pan on the counter to settle the yellow before I put on the orange batter. Oops! Oh, well I think they are still cute.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

While out and about we saw a sign that said showed a horse and buggy and said next five miles. We decided to turn off the main road and ran right into an area with about six Amish farms.I know that Amish are just people. They have their ups and downs just like anyone. I think the thing that draws me to the Amish is the simplicity of their lives. I sometimes wish it was as easy for me to turn away from the world. Leave behind phones, television and pressure to keep up with the Jones.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Soaking Up Fall", "date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "text": "Thursday afternoon we headed out for our annual fall getaway. I wasn't sure how the weekend would be since it was raining and we were under a high wind advisory when we left. Luckily by Friday morning the weather had improved and we enjoyed frosty mornings, sunny days and crisp nights. Perfect fall weather.Megan is still enamored with the Smokey the Bear display.The inn that we stay in does a great job decorating for the season.Each year we try to get a picture of all of the grand kids in front of this wagon.Most of the trails and road are centered around a large body of water.Chuck was trying to show Megan the proper way to skip a rock. One of Megan's favorite things to do. She tried and tried.There turned out to be more plops andsplashes then skips. She still had a great time.Chuck took the girls for a hike while I stayed back and enjoyed a good book.There was also time for a drive. I love old, little towns.This building was along the town square. In faded letters the top of building says \"Genn a Cohen Farmer Friendly\". I would love to be able to take a peek at this cute town square about 75 years ago. I can just imagine the hustle and bustle on a Saturday.There was a cute country decor store and some antique stores to explore.On our way back to the inn we got off the beaten path and ran across an area of Amish farms. Soon I will share some of those pictures.As nice as it is to get away it is always good to be home!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Pajama Day", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "Megan is out of school for fall break. She had asked for a pajama day. We called the boys I watch and asked them to join the fun. The day started out with pancakes.Have you ever used a squirt bottle to make pancakes? It is really fun! It gives you control to make letters and shapes. I made everyone's first initial and then created hearts.While I tidied up the kitchen they used their pillows and blankets to create a house.They had loads of fun!I made an afternoon snack of popcorn.Then we watched a movie.A Christmas movie! We even listening to Christmas music. A great way to spend a rainy day.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Homemade Paint", "date": "Wednesday, October 19, 2011", "text": "This paint was a huge hit.Use equal parts water and flour to make this. I used 2 cups each. Mix well and then add food coloring. I poured mine into baby food jars and then added the food coloring in order to have a variety.I like that I don't have to worry if the toddler gets this in his mouth. Yesterday was day two of using this paint. I would suggest that you shake it really well after it sits for a while. The flour starts to settle to the bottom. I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Pumpkin Patch", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "text": "On Friday we went on a field trip to the pumpkin patch. It was quite a trip from from where we live. At first I wasn't happy that a kindergarten class was going on such a long trip. Once we arrived I knew it was worth the drive.We drove down a gravel road through the tree nursery. Once we reached the truck loaded with pumpkins we were finally there.I just love this truck! Oh, the stories it could tell.Mama, Daddy, you have to come see the ducks.The ducks were cute, but the view is what caught my eye.I felt such peace as I looked over the pond.Next it was time to hit the pumpkin patch. We loaded onto the hay wagon and off we went.I love this picture! It captures the fun and joy of the day.The pumpkins are grown among the Christmas trees. Talk about making every space count.I like the pumpkin growing in the trees.It reminded me of an ornament.I found it! The prefect one.There were so many things to see and do.There was a nip in the air and then it started to sprinkle so we wrapped it up and headed home. I am grateful that Chuck was able to take the day off and join us. A fun, fun trip! I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Work In Progress", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2011", "text": "This weekend was spent working on projects. While I was at the table working on some Christmas things Megan spent time working with her beads.She happily created bracelets and necklaces for herself and cousins.Chuck spent most of the day outside working on something for my sewing nook.He built a shelving hutch to go on my sewing table.It turned out great! I had envisioned open shelves that would just back up against the wall. When I saw he had added beadboard to the back I was so excited. Beadboard is one of the things I love! Chuck is great about taking an idea I have and turning it into something great!There is a ways to go before it will be finished. It needs a good sand and a couple coats of paint. I have a hard time working in a space that is cluttered so I am excited to get things organized and get creating. I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Box Full of Fun", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2011", "text": "Friday evening Chuck brought a big box home from work. As soon as Megan saw it she was ecstatic.Daddy and Megan spent time cutting out a door and making windows. Then it was time to climb inside and play house.The house is seeing lots of activity.Smiling faces greet you when you stop by for a visit.Chores are carried out with joy.I am beginning to learn that it is the sweet, simple things of life which are the real ones after all. ~ Laura Ingalls WilderOne the best things about Fall is the leaves. All of the colors, textures and the beauty of watching them fall to the ground. Raking all of those leaves doesn't have to be a chore. It can be fun!Honestly we don't do much raking. The tractor is used to mulch them up.When we don't let them get too thick the lawn mower will clean the yard up nice.It looks like today will be the end of our Indian Summer. The rain arrives tomorrow along with cooler temperatures. There will be plenty of time for indoor chores. Today will be spent outside soaking up warmth and sunshine.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Afternoon of Fun", "date": "Monday, October 10, 2011", "text": "On Friday afternoon there were no additional kids in my home or errands to run. A treat not to be wasted. We started out taking a walk and collecting leaves. When we returned Megan wanted to craft. This is what we came up with.She decided what to write and I helped her spell the words. This was shared with Grandma and she was thrilled!While crafting I keep looking out at this view.The sky was blue, the sun was shining and the temperature was a wonderful 80*. I knew we had to get back outside!I grabbed a table cloth while Megan gathered a stack of books.She looked at books and then she practiced her reading.After reading for a while we layed down to look at the sky.Watched the leave dance their way to the ground and were silly.Hey Mama, take an upside down picture of me! A wonderful, simple afternoon I that I will cherish.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "As The Light Fades...", "date": "Thursday, October 06, 2011", "text": "I step on the back porch in the crisp evening air and reflect on my days.A week that started out a little rough is turning into a great week. I could have dissolved into a puddle a few times Monday and Tuesday but I carried on. Choosing instead to accept the fact that the great days and not so good ones are all part of Gods plan. Without some down days would we really enjoy the good ones?I stepped inside and saw this.It made me smile and think of my sweet little girl that was tucked soundly in bed. Oh how my sweet girl fills me with love! She is a happy little thing. I call her my sunshine.As she practices her letters and cutting she sings praise to the Lord and ask me many times if I know that God loves me. Yes, baby girl I know!I made some sausage biscuits to wrap up and freeze for Chuck to take to work.Now if only I could master making the biscuits from scratch. I have tried several times and it is always a fail. The sad thing about it is that when I worked at Chick-fil-A I use to make biscuits from scratch every day. Of course that was a long, long time ago. I will keep trying until I one day master it.For dinner Sunday night we had hamburgers with onion soup.Have you ever tried this? After the burgers are cooked you pour over a can of french onion soup and let them simmer. Something I grew up having and it is so good.The sky has been bright blue with bright sunshine this week.All of the kids I watch have been here often this week and we have been outside soaking up the sun.Potatoes are sliced and waiting for tonight's dinner.Laundry is on the line.I just love how the sun is peeking through the trees! It looks to be another glorious day.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "A Thankful Heart", "date": "Tuesday, October 04, 2011", "text": "There are some things happening around me that have made me think deeply, pray hard and have a very thankful heart. The things around me break my heart, talks of divorce (just to clarify, not Chuck and I!) and a man who drinks too much and is abusing his wife in front of his children. Sigh!At first all of this really consumed me. I was very worried and allowed all of my thoughts to be about these two situations. Then I realized that allowing these things to lay too heavily on me is not a good thing. I can't fix a marriage that is not mine, I can only lend a listening ear and offer words of encouragement to make it right. I can not make her remove herself and her children from an abusive situation and I can not make him walk the right path. All I can really do is pray. I have been praying and will continue to pray for these two families.All of this has given me a thankful heart.And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. Colossians 3:15I am thankful for a man that values marriage, family and God. Thankful for a man that loves and cherishes me. Thankful for a man that tries to protect his daughter from the evils of the world. Although the life I live is far from perfect I choose to live my life with a thankful heart.Saturday afternoon we headed out to see a movie.I highly recommend this movie! It has action, tears, laughter and best of all a great message. I don't want to give the movie away, but it really makes you see that even in your darkest hour God has a plan. One of my top five favorite movies!The weather is suppose to be warm and sunny this week. I am looking forward to spending time outside. I need to start cleaning out the garden and flower beds. Always more fun to do in the warm sunshine. I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I see beauty in the sunset and sunrise, in a kind word, in a meal prepared for your loving family and in the flowers that grow.The weather is turning cooler and the summer flowers are starting to fade. Petunias are my favorite summer flower. Not only do they smell beautiful, look beautiful, but they remind me of my grandmother.I gathered the last remaining blooms and added a little beauty to my counter.Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.I even find beauty in this drawer of neat and tidy towels. Really beauty can be found anywhere. Just open your eyes and your heart!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Not Feeling It", "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "text": "This drawer describes how I have been feeling this week.An overwhelmed mess! My heart and my home. I know that I have mentioned before that I tend to be an all or nothing person. Honestly, at this point, that is not going to cut it.I care four days a week for a one and two year old. That is probably all I need to say. You see I am far from perfect, but I want so badly to be perfect. For things to be perfect. I have been frustrated easily this week. Bits of paper here and there from Megan's crafting. The same basket of toys being dumped and picked up time after time all day long. That pile of paper that comes back day after day. Even after I have just cleared them.As I sat on the floor helping the boys pick up that basket of toys again! the song 7 x 70 by Chris Angus caught my attention. The line \" 7 times 70 times I'll do what it takes to make it right\" really struck me. My heavenly father doesn't except perfection and neither should I. He allows me time and time again , even more then 7 times 70 times, to get it right. He never gives up on me. He just expects me to keep going, keep striving to live my best life, my life for Him.So I will keep moving forward. One day at a time, one second at a time. Getting my home in order one cabinet at a time. Keep loving the precious children in my life and encouraging them to pick up that basket of toys (or even better, not dump it in the first place!). Keep my heart and attitude in check by spending time in prayer and reading His word. Be encouraged that it may take 7 times 70 times to get it right, but that is okay.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Then I glued on some silk leaves from my fall box.I am super pleased how these turned out!There has also been some kid crafting going on. I picked up these wooden pumpkins for less then $2.00.Using watered down glue the kids glued on pieces of tissue paper and then later I came back and put on a coat of Modge Podge.

First stop was the cooler. (sorry about the picture. The lighting in the cooler wasn't good.)I was amazed at the stacks and stacks of crates.All full of fresh picked apples!The next area we entered the walls were plastered with fair ribbons.Oh my, I loved looking at all of the ribbons. I had a hard time keeping my mind on the tour. :)The day we were there they were bottling fresh cider.Yum!Sack lunches were enjoyed and then it was playtime!The play area had many fun things to doand a beautiful view!

If you are wondering how the three of us eat all that is produced, let me assure you that we don't! Many of the things baked are shared. Mostly with Chuck's co-workers.The littlest guy I watch has started to toddle.Oh my! It is a precious sight!Megan is working hard at her schooling.It is a joy to watch her absorb everything and it warms my heart when she has that moment when things click.She has been trying and trying and finally tied her shoe last week!After she accomplished it the first time there has been no looking back.

Making a batch of Caramel Apple Cupcakes.I used a box mix and whipped up a spice cake. Before baking I folded in 1 cup of diced apples. I made 24 cupcakes and then allowed them to cool completely.For the topping you take 24 unwrapped caramels and 6 TBS of milk (I used whole milk) and melt over a low heat.Dip the tops of the cupcakes into the caramel mixture and then roll in nuts. Insert a popsicle stick and you have a delightful treat!I will refrigerate these. I am afraid that if I don't then the caramel might melt if it gets warm.

Megan had lots of fun and it is good exercise.Chuck spent some time working on fence.One side of fence (240 ft!) is almost done. He ran out of screws and just has to finish the gate and then cut the rest of the swoop. I am super exited to see the progress.After dinner last night I went out to the back porch to read. I could hear some clatter in the kitchen and came in to see this.Megan and Daddy ran to store this afternoon to get me some more medicine and picked themselves up a treat. It warmed my heart to see this!I am off to start the day. There is plenty of housework to catch up on and I am looking forward to spending some time outside.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

The cooler temperatures have me thinking of all things fall related. The candles I made are inspired by those baking mixes in a jar.I gathered up all of my supplies: 2 jelly jars, wicks, 6 tarts, cutting board, knife, labels, rings and lids.I found these cute lids and rings at W*l-Mart.I put my wick in the jar and then cut the tarts into chunks. First I layered in the Vanilla Frosting tart, next came Macintosh Apples, then Cinnamon Sugar. I had little more space to fill and added a little more of the Macintosh Apple.I made the labels in Word and added an apple from clip art. I used my hot glue gun to attach them.I plan to use twine to attach a tag and give as teacher appreciate gifts for the first day of Fall.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

A simple pleasure indeed!The baby took a long nap yesterday so we snuck outside to play.Although it was a little chilly the band keep marching.I started a little fall decorating. Nothing fancy just a few simple mums here and there.Since it was too cool to have the baby out I have to come up with ways to keep things fun. I quickly drew roads and a little town on a piece of kraft paper.It was a huge hit! Not only did they play with cars for a long time but they also pulled out crayons to decorate the town.A chilly day called for a chili dinner. I placed a serving of chili in Mason jars and topped with cornbread batter. I then baked it.If you like cornbread mixed in your chili you will love this. The batter drops down into the chili and it was delicious!I plan to throw open all the windows later this week and start cleaning.

I made the statement that I have missed our snuggle time. She replied that is because you are always in a hurry.\r\r\rOh.my! My heart dropped and I think it may have skipped a beat or two. She carried on chatting while I tried to wrap my head around her statement.\r\rI can't stop thinking about it because you know what... she is right. Some mornings she will ask for mama time and I will give her a quick kiss and tell her I have to get in the shower. At lunch the boys are ready for rest so we hurry to get the boys in bed. In the afternoon I tell her to hurry up and clean up her craft or puzzle because the boys will be waking up. Then later I hurry to start dinner so it is ready when Chuck gets home. Then it is hurry so the boys are ready for pick up. Then it is hurry and get through evening task of homework, pick-up, bath and snack.\r\r\rMy heart desires a slow, simple, life. Am I really living that life? I guess in little bits and pieces I am. Do I feel rushed? At moments, yes. Do I want Megan to grow up thinking that I was always in a hurry? Absolutely not!! \r\r\rThe balance of life can be hard. I have had lots to ponder today, and for days to come I am sure. It is time look at my days and make sure my most precious gift doesn't feel like life is hurry, hurry, hurry.

{"title": "Grape Jelly", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2011", "text": "When I mentioned that I was going to make some jelly I was asked to show how I do it. First you need a cute little helper! :)Seriously you need to have 5 cups of grape juice. To do this you need approximately 3-4 lbs of Concord grapes. Removes stems, wash grapes and then crush. Put in sauce pan with 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer covered for 10 minutes.I then run the grapes through a sieve to remove seeds and skins. You can take the \"pulp\" stuff in the top of the sieve and squeeze through cheesecloth to remove more juice. If you end up short on juice you can add up to 1/2 cup of water to equal the 5 cups needed.Now you proceed to the next step or you can store your juice in the refrigerator for up to a week. This works well for me since I have young kids in my care and don't always have a large block of time.Pour 5 cups of juice into a large sauce pan.Stir in one box of pectin. (I prefer Sure Jell.)Bring to a rolling boil stirring constantly. Then add 7 cups of pre-measured sugar.Return to a rolling boil stirring constantly. Boil for one minute and then remove from heat. Skim off any foam and then ladle into sterilized jars. Process in a water bath canner for 5 minutes.Remove jars and place on a towel. You should hear a lovely \"pop\" sound as the jars seal. Once cool check to ensure all of your jars have sealed. The next day I remove the rings, wash jars in soapy water, date the lid and store to enjoy later!All of these instructions are included in your box of Sure Jell. I find jelly to be super easy. You can go here and see how I made apple jelly. Hope this helps!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Looking at this blog where everything is made from scratch, looking at that blog where the pictures of her home look like it should be on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens. It is a wonderful thing to learn and see new things. The problem begins when we start feeling discontent with the blessings in our own life.\r\rIs it okay to make everything from scratch? If it brings you joy then yes.\r\rIs it okay to decorate and maintain your home as if Better Homes and Gardens would walk in the door? Sure, if it brings you joy.\r\rThe point is that we should all be living life in a way that brings joy to you, to your family  and most importantly the Lord.\r\rShould your worry if your neighbor looks down on you because you have laundry on the line? If it brings you joy, no.\r\r\rYou have to ask yourself why am I doing this? If you are canning because it is the \"in\" thing. Then you shouldn't do it. If you find joy hearing the pop of the lids and seeing the jars lined up then yes you should do it!\r\r\rIf you live your life trying to fulfill the perfect imagine of others you will never know true joy.\r\r\rFinding joy is a personal thing. It really is a matter of the heart. When you do things that are pleasing to the Lord, make you smile, please the ones you love and make your heart sing, then and only then will you find joy.\r\rI hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Megan was a little disappointed that we weren't able to pick. A sample apple put a smile on her face and I assured her that the time is near.\r\rThis orchard had a wonderful country store. Selling local beef, blue ribbon winning veggies and they even had some local Amish fair. I spotted some fresh butter and knew it was a must have.\r\r\r\rWe enjoyed it on our dinner rolls last night and it was wonderful!!\r\r\rThe grapes have been worked into juice and will turn into grape jelly some time this week.

Many things have happened, nothing exciting, just moments that make up my life.\r\rI recently acquired an electric tart warmer. I love it!

{"title": "On My Mind", "date": "Sunday, July 24, 2011", "text": "Do I know that God is in control of my life? Yes! Do I always let Him be in control? Sadly, no. I have been feeling the nudge. You know what I mean. The nudge to make a change, the nudge that says things aren't the way they should be. The nudge that we all sometimes ignore. That nudge has been pulling me toward slowing down and simplicity.Simplicity can mean different things to different people. For me simplicity means:♥ Less Stuff ♥Stuff is a constant battle. Does it make me feel happy? For a moment maybe, but then it starts to feel overwhelming. Stuff becomes clutter not only in my home and mind, but in my heart. I am by no means a neat freak but when there is to much stuff I tend to become overwhelmed. That leads me shutting down and having a forget it attitude. Not good. Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ~Matthew 6:19-21 ♥ More Time at Home ♥Learning that it is okay to say No. I don't have to be every where and please every one. (very hard for me since I am a pleaser) This doesn't mean that we will be home all of the time. It means that we will be selective about the things we do and make good use of our time.She watches over the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. ~ Proverbs 31:29♥ Letting Go of Worry ♥This goes along with my pleaser personality. I really need to stop worrying about what others think. Make decisions that are best for Chuck, Megan and myself ~ my family ~ with out worrying about what others might think or say. (This is probably my biggest issue. I am so bothered when I think someone is upset with me or doesn't agree with a decision we have made.)This doesn't mean that I won't plan for a rainy day. It means that I will take each rainy day as it comes. Knowing that I am really not in control but in good hands. His hands!For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. ~ 2 Timothy 1:7♥ Living in the Moment ♥Not longing for simpler times or for a less chaotic tomorrow. Making today where I want to be.Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. ~Matthew 6:34♥ Spending Time in His Word ♥This is the most important thing I can do. It keeps me on track with my priorities in the correct place.Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. ~ Psalm 119:105Life is full of choices. Are you making the right choices? Are your priorities in the correct place? Are you feeling at peace with the direction of your life?

Places to go and things to do and sometimes it feels like life is passing you by. It is the simple moments here and there that make you stop and realize what is really important in life. I am grateful for those moments and cherish each and every one of them!While watering flowers Megan asked me to spray her. A great way to beat the heat.

Well worth it since we ended up with eight gallons. My mother-in-law came over to help and took most of them to share.We have also been working on removing a tree. To save some money we had a tree cutter drop it to the ground and then Chuck cut the tree up.A guy he works with is coming for the wood this weekend and he hope to go out late tomorrow and get the rest of the brush clean up.After little stretches of work each evening we have been cooling off in Megan's pool.We never dreamed this pool would benefit the whole family!

{"title": "Laundry Saving Tips", "date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "text": "Along the way I have picked up a few ideas that help save money while doing laundry. I am by no means an expert, but I thought I would share what is working for me.I have found that using a powder detergent works best for me. I find that when I use a liquid detergent I am lazy and will hold the container over the washer, push the button and just drop some in. I am sure that I use to much detergent this way.Instead of using the scoop that comes with the detergent and recommended amount of detergent I use a 1/8 measuring cup. I find that my laundry comes out just as clean using this little bit. If I have an extra large or dirty load I will add an extra scoop and use 1/4 cup.When I was working and we had more wiggle room in the budget I would go to Sam's and buy this container of fabric softener.Now that every penny counts more then ever I buy the least expensive fabric softener. I am able to get twice as much from the bottle by pouring it into my large container and then filling the bottle up with water and adding to the large container. Just be sure to shake the large container well to mix the water with the fabric softener.I am also to able to double my fabric sheets by cutting them in half.The only time I find that I need more then half a sheet is when I dry blankets during the winter. I don't know why but the static is terrible on a load of blankets.I love coming across money saving tips and hope that this helps you save a penny or two.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

To many my days and life may seem boring, but the simple hum of my days make my heart sing.Tuesday was a day full of laundry.Without a packed schedule there was time to play.I feel that it is so important for children to have time to play. Time to explore, use their imaginations and just be. I don't feel children need to be constantly entertained or in planned activities. I made my first purchase on Craigs list a week or so ago.This table and chairs was purchased for $20. I bought it to add two chairs to my existing table. Here are the chairs around my existing table.I wasn't loving this. The chairs didn't slide under the table enough and although it looks okay in the picture once the baby pulled up on a chair or Megan tried to push one up to the table it looks crowded and messy. Last night I convinced Chuck to bring in the other table to try out. I am liking this much better. The quality of the table isn't as good as my other one, but this one will meet our needs. We usually eat dinner while the boys I watch are still here and this makes it a much better experience for everyone. One of the things I like most about ordinary days is gathering around the dinner table.Enjoying some fresh green beans from my garden and even better company.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I was introduced to a new hot dog topping...Baked beans on the dog. Yum, yum!Of course there were fireworks.Grandma (Chuck's mom) and Megan waiting for the big show.A little town close to us host the fireworks on the 3rd. We love this for many reason. For one it is on the 3rd and that means that we are not out late on the 4th and then Chuck has to be up for work the next day. It is small, close to home and the traffic isn't bad compared to going into the city. All good things in my book.On the actual fourth there was more swimming, cooking out and sparklers.I have traveled and lived out of our country and I have seen first hand how great we have it in America. I may not be happy with everything that is happening in our country, but I am proud to be an American! Happy 4th of July!!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Some time was spent last night tying up tomatoes and putting up a fence for the cucumbers.It was way past due! There are baby cukes and Megan is thrilled.There are also little green beans.A cabbage ready for harvest. I am looking forward to cooked cabbage with ham. Yum!I still have grapes on the vine. The last few years they have all dried up and died about the time they ripened. I just used the last jar of homemade grape jelly. I have heard that you can use frozen concentrate to make jelly. Has anyone every tried that?I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I have been busy taking care of a few things and just didn't make the time to update.I went to browse a store closing and picked some inexpensive decor. This area of my hutch has never made me happy. After I had everything taken off I realized that I didn't take a before picture. :(I am very happy with how it turned out.My mother-in-law is planning a garage sale so I have started cleaning things out. I started with the closet in the living room.I took anything sewing related and moved it into the third bedroom. Straightening that room out will come very soon.I am always amazed at the amount of stuff I accumulate. It feels so great to clear out the clutter!.I also completed a make over last week.I picked up this quilt holder at Goodwill. It is the perfect size to fit in the corner behind the love seat. I am pleased to have a spot to put my blanket. It drove me crazy when it was draped on the back of the love seat.This past week I have been wondering who came up with the saying the lazy days of summer. I feel like things have been anything but lazy. The plan is to slow things down this week. Living life at a harried pace is not how I want life to be.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

It was quiet and beautiful!We took a nice long walk where the girls picked wildflowers and tasted some wild raspberries. I am excited to pack a picnic and take Chuck back.We meet up with a few of the girls that were part of Megan's adoption group. The little girl next to her was in the same foster home. It is wonderful that we all live close enough to get together.I have been thinking about cutting Megan's hair and finally took the plunge this weekend.I love it! It got rid of all of the uneven, thin areas and now it looks full. Her bangs were cut a little shorter then I like, but they will grow quickly. I plan to let it grow longer, but now it will be all the same length and hopefully will grow out nice and thick.Chuck spent some time building a couple of little benches for me.Megan and I spent some time painting them. I hope to have the finally coat on soon and then I will show you where I will be putting them.There are many things on the to do list this week. I am looking forward to getting some things accomplished. Have a great Monday!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I don't know if my heart has changed, my attitude or what, but I am finding that I am much more content.My nieces spent the night one night last week and Chuck surprised them by putting a tent up in Megan's room.Saying they were super excited is an understatement!I loves how when they fell asleep they were all facing the same way. :)Today the weather is what I consider perfect. Mid 70's with beautiful sunshine. The windows are open, laundry was on the line and it was cool enough to turn on the oven without over heating the kitchen.Peanut butter cookies are one of the favorites around here. I dipped a few of them in chocolate and they are yummy!Some time has been spent in the garden.We borrowed my parent's mini tiller and Chuck ran it through the garden.I got my first pea harvest!This is the first time I have ever grown peas and it is exciting to see those cute little pods! I remember sitting on my grandparents front porch shelling peas. As I shelled my tonight and heard the ping as the peas it the bowl it took me back there. I have such great memories of time spent at Mom and Pops.On Saturday Chuck had to work and Megan and I went out and about for a little bit with my parents. One of the places they stopped was Gordon Foods. I found these adorable scoops for my canisters.Aren't they cute!For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Chuck is great about taking my vision and making it a reality!Once he cut the pickets into the desired shape it is my job to sand the top edges.My dad and Megan have a little ice cream thing going on. Some evening Grandpa calls over and says \"ice cream, ice cream\" which is exciting for Megan since it means a trip to the ice cream store.The other night we turned the tables and had Megan call Grandpa to say \"ice cream, ice cream!\"Before bed I usually step outside for a breath of fresh air.I turned and look back at my home and thought how cozy it looked.The boys I watch returned this week after me taking last week off.The three peas in a pod were back together and very happy to see each other. Abe came running up the driveway yelling Mae, Mae (which is what he calls Megan.) Very cute!Some time crafting when the afternoons were too hot to be outside.As always there was housework to be done. I had all of the laundry washed, dried, ironed and put away. If only for a day it made me happy, happy.My niece, Alison, and her boyfriend invited everyone over to my parents for dinner one evening. They served salad, chicken parmesan and cake for dessert. It was delicious and I enjoy watching Alison develope a love for domestic things!Many hours have been spent outside.A permanent home was found for the bird feeder. I really enjoy watching our visitors.After much practice and determination Megan has finally mastered swinging. She has been trying hard since last summer to coordinate the pumping of her legs.My nieces, Lauren and Kayla, have been here playing for most of the afternoon. They are now sleeping over. Chuck is surprising them with something fun! I will share pictures next week.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

When Katy showed how she had made her own, I was like why hadn't I thought of that!This is the soap bottle that I took the pump off of.Chuck added a step in making this. Once he had cut the hole and put on the soap dispenser he then used a little chalk around the underside so that the pump was permanently attached to the lid. That is just the way he is. :)I prefer the foam and I find that Megan makes much less of a mess with it.In the future I will use regular hand soap and dilute it myself. For half a pint you would take 4 tablespoons of soap and then mix it with water.See it works great!Wouldn't one of these make a super gift? Thanks for sharing Katy!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

She was then awake at 6 this morning. We were barely out of the parking lot before she was asleep.We decided to take a little drive so she could get in a cat nap.I am a country girl through and through so we headed away from town. Our first sight was a couple of old barns.Silos standing ready for a new harvest.We've had a really wet spring and I was happy to see the corn is coming up.Don't you just love a little country church?I always imagine that everyone is super friendly and close. I bet their pot luck dinners aren't full of store bought items!On the way home we made a quick stop for milk and to pick up a couple of other things.I don't normally go to Wa*-Mart on Sunday and was surprised how busy it was. It is rare that Chuck is at the grocery with me. It gave me a chance to browse the bakery section while he ordered some lunch meat. I was shocked by the prices. About $3.50 for a dozen cookies! Yikes!We hit the gas station next.It is sad when any price under $4.00 makes me happy. :(Then it was time to head home where Megan helped me with a few things in the kitchen.She was suppose to wash off the strawberries and hand them to me to cut. A bunch of them never made it to me!Next I got things ready for dinner.Note to myself... set the frozen meat out before I leave the house.I took some time to catch up on a news program that I had taped. Clip coupons and then I finished this weeks menu.While I did that Megan was out in the garage with Chuck.She said that she was playing school. Chuck watched the race and worked on straightening up the workbench.Chuck fired up the grill and started dinner. My mom finds great meat deals on managers special. She is generous about sharing her great deals with us. Steak, baked potatoes, corn (that I froze last summer) and salad. You should have stopped by there was plenty. I didn't even eat half of my steak! When dinner was cleaned up I stepped outside and blew bubbles with Megan. We then came inside and read some library books.Megan ended the night with an ice cream cone.Pink sprinkles made for a happy girl!Vacation is over and tomorrow it is back to normal. I have Chuck's lunch ready and am looking forward to seeing the boys tomorrow morning. Megan has been talking all evening about what she is going to teach Abe tomorrow.Megan is snuggled in bed sound asleep. I think that sounds like a great idea.

If it were like this all summer I would be a happy, happy girl! Other then a trip to the grocery and coming in to eat the day was spent outside. As I was sitting on the back porch sipping my tea I was taking in the beauty of the clematis.Through out the day Chuck worked on the fence.His little sidekick was always ready to lend a hand.I went to check out the garden and took my camera along.The green beans are looking great!Cabbage are starting to develop heads and the leaves are huge. Bigger then I think they have ever been.It had been a couple of days since I had been to the garden and I found that my head lettuce once again failed. The heads were starting to develop the last time I was up at the garden. Every year my head lettuce fails. I will have to do some research to see what I am doing wrong.Zucchini blooming.This is the first time I have ever grown peas. I was tickled to see that the pods are growing. I can't wait to shell some peas!I saw this morning that my neighbor had put up a clothes line.I noticed a few times that she was looking over while I was hanging out laundry. I am glad to see someone else enjoying the savings and the simple pleasure of line dried laundry. No matter what the laundry bottle says you just can't duplicate the smell of line dried laundry.My silly girl is loving all of the outside time.She was wearing Daddy's hat and added her butterfly net and told me she was collecting honey. I love that imagination!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

With temperatures in the 90's the sprinkler was pulled out and the kids had a great time cooling off.While the kids played the men worked really, really hard.I tried to stay out of the way and only help out if asked. My job was to supply plenty of water and lemonade. Along with serving lunch. All of the fence post have been dug and the post are in on the west side of our property. Thirty of them!Today the post will be set on the east side. Only twenty-five of those! Thankfully my dad will be stopping by to help out. Then we will be able to slow down some. Chuck will work on cutting all of the post to the correct height and then he will be building the fence panels himself. I see this as a work in progress for a while, as time and money permit.The weekend ended with a refreshing splash at my parents.Chuck is on vacation the rest of the week. We plan to stay home and work, play and relax.I also wanted to mention that I am having a horrible time commenting on blogs. Especially those blogs that have the comment box at the bottom of their post. I am reading and really want to comment but am unable. Grrr! I hope that it is fixed soon.

Megan thinks that is the best part of celebrating someones birthday!Saturday we celebrated with his dad and tonight we will have dinner with his mom. We decided to have a celebration with just us because the bad thing about divorce is that the complications never end for the kids. If we invite over his mom then his dad is jealous. If we invite over his dad then we feel guilty that mom isn't here. If we try to include everyone then it is awkward. We love them both and know they love Chuck.

Hamburgers, hot dogs, chips, salad and cottage cheese.After eating my niece, Lauren asked if we wanted to play a little baseball.It was so much fun!

I saved them and will cut them into rounds and roast them to go along with baked chicken tonight.I like mine with a little salt.Chuck and Megan like a little more kick to their fries. I made a season salt for their fries. Chuck said that they tasted just like the curly fries from A*by's.1 tsp paprika1/4 tsp cayenne1/8 tsp garlic powder1/8 tsp onion powderMix together and sprinkle on fries while they are still hot.

To rest and take the time to do some things that you might not normally do. I took a little extra care setting the table for supper.I used my new table cloth.Isn't it adorable? I fell in love when I saw the chickens!I went out between raindrops to clip the first emerging peonies as my center piece. Sunday supper was eggs, sausage, potatoes and biscuits. Simple fare that felt special served at a nice table.Chuck and Megan tended a few small chores. Cleaning out Flower's tank was one of them.I spent a little time on the back porch with a mug of hot tea listening to the sound of the rain on the metal porch roof.While on the back porch I used the quiet time to make a to list for today, peek at the latest Country Woman magazine and soak up a little bit of the Word.

Training for the future I guess. :)I have been spending any spare time I have planting flower.Megan is always willing to lend a hand.Chuck has worked overtime several evenings this week. After the boys left Thursday I cut grass while my parents were entertained by Megan. I can't say enough about the hard working husband I have. After working 13 hours he brought the tiller over from my parents and we all finished planting the garden.Megan was covering the green beans. Gardening is work. Lots of work! The payoff is so worth it. Nothing can compare to veggies that are fresh. Fresh from your garden, grown by and canned by your own hands.The cherry tomato plant already has baby tomatoes. Just seeing the baby tomatoes is payment for all the work that goes into growing them.My body is tired from all of the work. Last night I had to have Chuck help me out of the chair because my back was hurting. Today I ran a few errands and spent some time porch sitting at my parents. Ahhh, some time of rest and good company. I am still tired and achy.

Abe is a very busy boy and I have been trying to slow him down and get him engaged.Rice and bowls along with measuring cups and spoons were a big hit. Abe played for over twenty minutes! A record for him. I think he would have played much longer but it was time to go home. Megan is already asking to do this again.Mother's Day gifts were made.I had a little problem getting good hand prints. Mom didn't seem to notice!I planted some strawberries a few weeks ago. They were growing so well that I could see the tops from my kitchen window. Well, until yesterday.Either the squirrels or the mean crows dug them up. I am not happy! I have purchased some more plants and Chuck will be making a cover for the planter. I hope to outsmart the little critters!It has been dry and the sun has been shining the last couple of days.

Something that we will be doing again.Something new has been added to the daily routine. Around 4 I was trying to get dinner started and freshen up. Things were pretty chaotic. Give Abe an inch and he takes a mile or two. I felt like all I was saying was stop and no. I was frustrated, Megan was frustrated and then Chuck came home to all of this. Something had to change.I introduced what I call quiet TV time. Megan and Abe have a designated place to be and then they watch a recorded show; usually Caillou. The rule is that no one is allowed to get up and they need to rest and quietly watch the show.Chuck is coming home to a peaceful home and the kids are happy to see him without attacking him as soon as he comes in the door.

I think that it felt a little fuller then normal because everyone was tired from a busy Easter. The boys I watch left early and Chuck suggested that we go out for dinner. With gas prices now at $4.15 eating out will be a real treat.On the way home there was a stop at the store for milk and such. There were plenty of clearance flowers and some tulips came home with me.The are my absolute favorites!Everyone is itching to get outside.

He is just so excited to share the news that Jesus Lives!! Each year he leaves a pamphlet in the basket explaining that it isn't about the eggs and bunnies, but about the greatest gift we can ever receive.We then had our traditional Easter morning breakfast and it was then time to get ready for church. We are on the search for a new church home and tried a new church. The congregation was small (about 100 people) yes! the message was good, yes! not many people our age (most were older) no! the music was mainly older hymns and not very moving, no! We did have someone come up to us when the service just started and asked if it was our first time, welcomed us and got some contact information. More then I can say for some places. Also after the service I saw hospitality in action. One member came over to ask the lady who sat alone in front of us to join her family for lunch. Not sure it is the place for us so the search continues. I was so hoping that we would walk in and feel like it was the one. I am sure that we will find the place that feels like we belong soon.We joined Chuck's family for dinner. I brought green beans with potatoes, lots of deviled eggs (requested by my fil!) and this cake.Spring showers have been plentiful here and that meant the egg hunt was inside.Plenty of fun even in the limited space.One of the things I love about getting together with Chuck's family is that there are plenty of extended family around. Lots of cousins for Megan to play with.It is back to the routine today. Plenty of laundry and picking up to do.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

As I grew older the true meaning of the weekend became more and more clear. Along with that came a deepening in my love for this weekend.As I was boiling eggs to color tonight andand looking at the bunny decor on the kitchen counterI couldn't help but think of the real reason we celebrate Good Friday.My long time friend summed it up better then I ever could.\"Today is Good Friday!! Better than any other Friday because it is when we remember and celebrate what Jesus did for each and every one of us when He died on the cross so we may live. Not good for Him but great for us. It is Friday and that meant death for Him but we must remember that Sunday is coming and that means LIFE for us!! Peace and Love to all.\" ~ Pastor Jim Clark*I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!*Jimmy and I went to high school together and spent many hours together working at Chick-fil-A.

Last year we didn't mulch the flower beds and they are in desperate need this year. Chuck's aunt made this stepping stone for Megan. It makes me happy to finally have a home for it. Maintaining the flower beds is lots of work but so worth it when you see the beauty. Megan is all about homemade. She is always saying homemade is better, right Mama? She asked about making homemade orange juice so I picked up a juicer. It was a hit and next on the list is lemons. Fresh lemonade... yum! I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

The evenings are staying light longer and the temperature is perfect for a nice hot cup of tea. I really enjoy sitting out and sipping my tea while reading a chapter or two of my book. Several years ago I read the  Red River series by Lauraine Snelling. I fell in love with Ingeborg Bjorklund! I have followed her and her family through the Return to Red River series, Daughters of Blessing and now Home to Blessing series. If you enjoy historical Christian fiction I highly recommend this series. I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Stained clothing is not my friend. I finally pulled out the items and tackled them. I tried something new on the underarm stains on Chuck's shirts. I used Borax and water to make a paste. I then scrubbed the stains and washed as normal. Worked like a charm! The season for hanging out laundry has also returned.Nothing like the smell of a line dried blanket!

Weeds were pulled from the driveway and the garden was tilled thanks to my dad.  It makes me happy to smell the fresh tilled earth. Yum! Peas were planted and now it will rest until it is warmer. Our property line was staked on Friday.  We were a little surprised to find that one line of our property ends on our neighbors concrete drive. Yikes! We aren't concerned about it, just surprised.

The recipe is from Fresh From The Farm. I doubled the recipe and added raisins.  Oh my is this delicious! It smelled like I was baking oatmeal raisin cookies. I am thinking of adding some m&m's and nuts to make this into a snack. By far my favorite granola. The cookie jar was filled. Some banana muffins for the freezer. The little guy I watch loves muffins for snack. I enjoyed my nice, cozy day in the kitchen, but I am ready for some warm air and sunshine! I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!  This week is spring break and yesterday I received a call from my nieces asking to come over. It is always a pleasure to have them over. It was close to lunch when they called so I suggested that they join us for pizza. With the late notice there wasn't time to put together homemade pizza. Ordering out was the next best thing.After lunch we put together ice pops. I read somewhere that you could put a slice of banana in the bottom to place the stick in. I didn't have much luck with it though. The banana keep floating. If you have any ideas of how to keep the stick centered without plastic wrap please share. It wouldn't be a party with a craft.

After the table and chairs were clean Megan came in from her quiet time. As I took things down she washed them for me. She had a blast! Today I will clean the oven and finish this room.

I am finding new life everywhere. This lilac is from my grandparents old farm and means so much to me. Soon I will smell their sweet fragrance and see that beautiful purple.Megan can't get enough of the warm, fresh air. She grabbed a bucket and went on a nature hunt. She brought back sticks, leaves and pine cones.While at Lowes over the weekend I couldn't resist picking up a couple of things. A few pansies for my potting bench.A new bird feeder. Currently it is hanging off of the back porch. This won't be the permanent home. Until I find a permanent home I am enjoying watching the squirrels from my kitchen window. It is certainly entertaining!Unfortunately our warm days are over for a while. The forecast for the next week is only in the 40's. I am so grateful for the last few days.

The raised beds were leveled and filled up. One box was planted with cabbage and lettuce. It is expected to cool down this week. There is rain and possible frost in the forecast. The plantings were covered with jars for protection. The back box was covered to warm up the soil and to hopefully keep the soil from getting water logged. Soon peas and carrots will be planted there.My sister found a new dining room table and I took her old one. The third bedroom was re-arranged to make room for it.  I am so excited to have a place to keep my sewing. The table has seen lots of wear and will eventually receive a makeover. I have some ideas for this space, but for the moment the priority is to clear out the clutter. This room is the jack of all trades. The computer is housed here. Food storage is in the closet. The little man naps in here. Now it has space for sewing and such. My home is small so I try to make the most of my space. There is still lots of work to be done in here. Once it is complete I will be sure to give you the grand tour. It was a great weekend. Plenty of things accomplished, but also time for rest and fellowship.

I hope that we can get them placed tonight and filled with soil very soon. I have always wanted to try raised bed gardening. These will be a great place to plant early season veggies. I am thinking peas, carrots, lettuce and cabbage to start with.The forecast for today is sunny and 70*!

{"title": "Once A Month Shopping", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2011", "text": "Several times I have mentioned that I do the bulk of my shopping once a month. I have had some questions about how I do that.I keep a running list on my frig of things that I have run out of or am about to run out of. Toward the end of the month I will use that list and look through my pantry and any recipes I have clipped to try. That is how I make my initial list. I also look through my coupons for those that are about to expire and the most recent sale fliers.I go to the store with a detailed list. Marking items I have coupons for and items that I am price matching.At one time I was shopping weekly at drugstores and chasing grocery deals. It became overwhelming and I felt like I was on the go all the time. I didn't feel like it was a good use of my time. That is when I made the decision to do my main shopping once a month at W*l-Mart. Main pantry in the kitchen.I buy enough milk and fresh fruits and produce to last two weeks. The things like bananas I know need to be eaten first and things like apples keep fresh longer.Cabinet next to the stove that housing baking and spice related items.I do have to make stops for milk and such during the month. Many times I will have Chuck stop and do that on his way home from work. If there is an exceptional deal and room in the budget I will do some stocking up during the month.  I am one of those weird people that love to grocery shop!  I find that the less trips I make to the store the less money that I spend. This week with sales and coupons I was able to get cereal for less then $1.40 a box so I thought it was worth it to make a trip out for that.  With the unstable economy I have been trying to stock up each month.  I will buy a few extra canned goods and watch for the great deals (like the cereal this week).   In our third bedroom there is a closet that ended up being a catch all.  It has been cleaned out and Chuck searched for some wood from the shed and this is what became of the closet.Now I have a nice area to store my home canned goods and for additional food storage.  I love having the extra food stored because you never know when you might need to skip a shopping trip or two.  Each week I am able look through the pantry and freezer to plan my meals.  I hope this was helpful and I answered all of your questions.  I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

This is just the day it gets a little extra love.A co-worker of Chucks' lives on a farm and we have been getting some wonderful farm fresh eggs.   She only charges $1 a dozen!They taste super yummy and you don't get the unique shells from the store cartons. The company Chuck works for has a reward program. If you get caught going above and beyond they will give you a gift card.  There is a website where you go to exchange it for a gift. We have gotten a large cooler and recently an ice cream maker.Megan was fascinated watching it. She asked for some whipped cream to top her ice cream. I didn't have any on hand so I added some whipping cream and sugar to a jar and let her go at it.She had fun and next time we will take it a step further and make butter.The boys are still coming four days a week. As you can imagine they keep me very busy.Eli is 5 months and just a joy! He is very content and rarely cries. Abe is 18 months and he makes up for his brothers calm. He is my handful. Always pushing the limits and he just started potty training. We all know how fun that can be!Quiet time is must for me. I need that little bit of time to unwind and recharge for the rest of the day.

Toward the end of week Megan helped me put together a pot of vegetable soup. This is the first time that she has been able to cut.Oh my was she excited! I purchased this knife.She keep saying \"look at my big girl knife!\" It is such a joy to have her help me in the kitchen.Friday morning we woke up to more snow. The roads were bad and Megan's school had a two hour delay which means no school for her. This is the first snow this season that was wet enough for a snowman.Now that Megan was finally able to make her snowman I hope that there is no more snow. It is beautiful, but I have had enough this year!   The good thing about this time of year is that the snow doesn't stick around long.  The only snow left in the yard last night was the bottom of the snowman.  Crazy time of year... snow on Friday and thunderstorms last night!While Megan and Daddy were out playing in the snow I pulled out my sewing machine.I don't use it as often as I would like. It is a pain to pull it out and then have to put it away when it is time to eat. I told Chuck that for a week or so it is going to sit out on the kitchen counter. I am in the middle of a project and really want to get moving on it. I hope to be able to show you some of the progress later this week.I also receive my copy of Ann's book this weekend.I'll let you know more when I get further along. I have already marked a couple of pages.

Eventually all of our ceilings will be covered with tongue and groove car siding that is painted white. I love the way it makes the room have an old farmhouse feel. We only pay cash for our home improvements so it takes a while to get things done around here. It is a great lesson in patients!Chuck had a cute little assistant!She loves to pull out her \"tools\" and work beside Daddy. It warms my heart to see this.While that was happening I worked in the kitchen. My kitchen sink always seems to look dull and dirty.I tried Fly Lady's Shiny Sink 101 and this is the final result.Not perfect, but I am okay with that. My sink has seen lots of use and as we all know when you use something  often it shows the love!I also went through all of my cabinets.

Have you ever used this Model Magic?It was Megan's valentine gift from her Aunt Lana in Texas. It has a marshmallow feel to it and when you let it dry it has a spongy feel to it. We have been having lots of fun with it.Remember when I posted about working on a solution for the paper clutter Megan was creating? I happy to report that I am gaining some control of it!A bulletin board was added to a door in the kitchen. The rule is that once the board is full that a paper has to come down before a new one goes up.It is fun for Megan to pick and choose what goes on the board. She has even gotten creative with getting the push pins in all the way!As for all of the other papers. Placing them in a folder is the current solution. It is suppose to be that when the folder is full that some papers need to be gotten rid of. Something that currently needs to be done. I am not sold that the folder is the best solution but it beats finding paper everywhere!I put many papers in the recycle, but there is a little girl that thinks everything is a keepsake.

I mentioned something to Chuck and he finally heard it on Friday. Chuck looked up possible causes. Some things were simple like a dirty furnace filter or a bad thermostat. Then it started to get more serious like a blower motor and such.The filter was fairly new, but a new one was put on. A new thermostat was bought and after it was put on the furnace would try to cut on but then would fail. The old thermostat was put back on and the same thing happened. Ugh!We were officially without heat. The space heater from the garage was brought in.There was plenty of warm blankets and hot chocolate.We waited and waited to receive a call that the repair tech was on his way. While we waited we talked about how a major repair wasn't in the budget. Our cordless phone had been slowly dieing and we had just replaced them that morning. I prayed and prayed that it wouldn't be a costly fix. We received a call from a repair tech. He had one call before us and then would be over. Shortly after that call we received a call from a different repair tech. After speaking with him for a few he told Chuck that it sounded like there was some oxidation on the flame sensor.  He told Chuck what to try and that he should call him back if it didn't work. It worked and the fix cost us NOTHING!!!God orchestrated a set of perfect events. A second repair tech called us, it was late (after 9:30) and I am sure he was ready to be home and my husband was here try the repair techs suggestions.

Sometimes I still do. I was looking for perfection and that isn't necessarily what cooking from scratch is about. I have learned I am not nor will I ever be as perfect as Martha Stewart. That many magazine and cookbook pictures are doctored. Yes, it is real food, but many times they do unrealistic things like use eye droppers for the perfect look of sauce or butter. Sometimes cheese is put on one shred at a time for the perfect look. Talk about setting us homemakers up for failure!What I have learned is that the more you do something the better you become at it. The more I make homemade pizza crust the better I get at making the crust look like it might have come from a pizza restaurant. The more I make bread the better I get at forming the loafs. Biscuits are still a hit and miss item, but I keep trying.Sometimes an item is a complete miss! This tomato soup was okay before I canned it and not so great when it was all done.Even Megan tells me how much better homemade is.  It makes my heart sing when I hear her say \"Mama you make the best pizza!\" It makes me happy to know that I made the item, I know what is in it and I can see my family enjoy it.  I encourage you to get in the kitchen and just do it! If I can I know that you can too.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

We are thankful that we only lost a few branches.I don't think I will be hanging laundry out any time soon!Chuck has been in and out through out the day and he called me out to hear the crack of the trees as they are trying to move. We anticipate that at some point we will lose power.We have prepared as much as we can.The lamps have been filled.The generator is gassed and ready to go. Having your whole family home bound is not a bad thing. Chuck graciously cleaned the living room carpet.There are plenty of things to keep us busy. So much that we could be busy for days and days. There are games to play, books to read and there is always cleaning!

I layed a piece of craft paper under my wax paper. I then folded the wax paper in half.On one half of the wax paper I used the pencil sharpener to make crayon shavings.I then covered the shavings with the other half of the wax paper and then covered it with another piece of kraft paper. I then ironed over it until the crayons melted. (Be careful of the crayon running out of the edge of the wax paper while you melt them.)I then used two different sized cookie cutter to make my heart shapes. I then put a hole in the top of each heart and strung three of them onto a piece of thread.They look wonderful when the sun is shining through the window!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

This kind of weather makes me want to spend cozy time where it is nice and warm.Chuck had to go into work for a few hours on Saturday and then he tackled some maintenance things around home.Daddy's little helper was right by his side. While they did that I tackled some laundry.Nice and clean! Ready to be hung in our closets.There were also quiet moments. This is where I spent a good part of Sunday afternoon.The rag garland for my Christmas tree was a little short and I finally added a few feet to it.  I have plenty of scraps leftover and I have an idea in mind for those.  I am going to try to make a braided table runner.  Has anyone ever made a braided rug or such?  If so I am open to hints you might have.A rich, warm beef stew and biscuits is what was for dinner last night.  I love it when dinner simmers away all day.

I had a wonderful birthday with a couple of meals eaten out over the past several days and some nice gifts. Before I share a couple of things that I received remember that I am a practical kind of gal. I know that some women would be offended if they received these things. My parents bought me new towels.I have had a couple of new towels here and there but never an entire closet of new, matching towels. I certainly feel spoiled!Chuck and Megan got me lotion, an ironing board cover and a drying rack.A drying rack has been on my wish list for a long time. No more draping things over the back of the kitchen chair during the winter or rainy days.This week brought more snow. It has been beautiful gazing out at it.There have been littles to cuddle and play with.This little man is such an easy baby and I am so grateful for that! He was a little stuffy last week so there was plenty of cuddle time.One afternoon Megan and I filled the cookie jar.Notice Megan's stripped dress in the picture. She took this picture and I think she might have seen her Mama take a few pictures for the blog. He!He!I heard the words this week that mothers dread. Not the I'm bored, but the I don't have anything fun to do. Ugh!!! I was not happy and then listed off all the fun things that she had available.I think I got my point across since she has been able to find plenty of fun things to keep busy since then.I spent time reading.I finished Choosing To See and thought it was a good read. Although I sniffed and cried through a lot of it I also laughed and was inspired. I am certainly \"choosing to see\" that God is with me! I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "All About the Name", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "I have been asked how I came up with the name of my blog. I guess I need to start out by explaining where I was when I started blogging....Chuck and were married and settled into our cozy little home. No littles had come the old fashioned way and we were making our way through the world of adoption. I was working outside of the home and was not very happy with that. The journey of life was not going the way I had planned. Not.at.all. You know the plan where I would have 2.5 children, stay at home and the world around me would be perfect. Ha!I started to follow a couple of adoption blogs and there was link on one that lead to a homemaking blog. I started reading that blog and one thing lead to another. Pretty soon I was reading several blogs that centered around home and family.When I decided to start blogging I thought long and hard about a name. My Heart is Always Home just seemed to fit since I was working away from home, but my heart really wanted to be at home!Since I started blogging my faith in God has really grown. I have learned that living a simple life of faith, family and home is more full filling then I ever imagined. I have also learned that I have no control over the journey of life (I am still learning this daily) and that home is truly where my heart is. So there you go.... the history of how the name came about.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I don't feel like I am over the hill, or that I am on the down hill slide. Just the opposite. In many ways I feel like life is just beginning.I am grateful for all forty of my years on earth. Oh, there are many things said and done that at times I wish had turned out different. If that were the case though I wouldn't be where I am today and that is a very good place! My heart is overflowing with love for God, my wonderful husband, the daughter that I prayed and prayed for, my parents, sister and nieces, my home and life in general. No, things are not perfect.

While laundry was going it was time to tackle Megan's room. It was need of some TLC to weed out some things and find places for some new things. It was such a disaster that there was no way I was taking a before picture!  Everything was removed from her closet and a place was found for everything. When that was complete it was on to the rest of the room.  Every drawing and piece of paper she writes on becomes a keepsake to her.  It felt great to get rid of all of that stuff.  I have a solution, or at least I hope, to combat the paper clutter.  When I have it in place I will share it with you. Oh, so much better.  I can't stand stacks of paper and that is what had become of her dresser.  Once everything was cleaned up Chuck helped me install the new valances.  Her windows have had no treatment for about two years.  Since I handed down all of the crib bedding to my sister-in-law.  They match the bedskirt on her new bedding.  I was amazed at the difference they made.Saturday night was game night.   We played several different games and shared lots of laughs.  I have been fighting a cold for the last few days and lost on Saturday.  I don't feel super bad.  I am just tired and very stuffy.  I have been taking some cold medicine and spent all of Sunday at home taking it easy.  I hope that it passes quickly!  Now it is time to get the day going.  Cleaning the kitchen and making some bread to go with our spaghetti and meatball dinner is on the agenda for today.  Have a great Monday!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I knew the size would be perfect to fit beside the love seat and the handles would be handy for moving it around.It is still in need of a makeover. I was anxious to use it and since there isn't time for the makeover at this time I went ahead and started using it. I am so happy to have found a home for my knitting/crochet stuff.

You might even call them life changes.Reading is one area that I am changing. I love to read! Everyone knows this and I was gifted a stack of books for Christmas.I use to read a couple of books a week. You know before becoming a mom! I do enjoy it and plan to make it a priority.I do enjoy reading my Christian fiction, but along with that I plan to add this book.I have tried several times to read the Bible from cover to cover and haven't succeeded. Some parts are just tedious, especially in the Old Testament. I am determined that this is going to happen!! I plan to give a monthly update to keep me accountable.I have a binder of recipes that I pull out of magazines, print off blogs and such. I wish I could say that they are organized nicely and that I have tried them all, but I can't.The plan is to go through this binder and get rid of the things that no longer interest me and then get them put nicely into the page protectors. Then the fun begins! The goal is to try one new recipe a week. I am sure that many of these will be shared with you.Small things that I am certain will bring me joy.

We have been enjoying slow days puttering around the house.I saved the pan drippings and two turkey breast carcass from dinner at my parent's. Today I tried my hand at making my own stock.I used the new stock pot I received as a gift.Oh my did my home smell good! The stock is now in refrigerator. I am letting it sit so that I can skim off the fat tomorrow and then I will be canning it. Yum! Yum!I am not sure if I mentioned that Abe the little guy I watch has a little brother. Eli joined the fun here last week.Eli is an easy baby and has fit right in around here. When Chuck returns to work I am sure we will easily find our new routine. It is such a joy to have this little baby to snuggle!With some of the new things received for Christmas it feels like I have been doing laundry non stop. I am almost done and was so happy to get the new bedding for Megan's bed washed.All of the washing from potty training had taken its toll on her old comforter. It was wearing thin and had been mended several times. Her new bedding is bright and sunny. I really like it and so does she.It seems that I always get the urge to purge and organize as a new year approaches. My kitchen is going to be the first one on the list. I have a pile here and there on the counters of things that need to find a home.It is going to get a deep cleaning and some tweaking. I am looking forward to finding the time to tackle this project.I am not sure how much posting I will be doing the rest of the week. It will depend on how much time I have. Besides cleaning,organizing and a trip to the grocery store I have some important things to do this week. Like playing new board games with my family, baking cookies with Megan and having a family dinner at my parent's home. Have a great week. I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

We spent Christmas Eve afternoon at my mother-in-law's.She couldn't wait to try these out! After we opened our gifts Christmas morning we then went to my father-in-law's.

We live a very different life then Chuck's step siblings so they always think we are crazy, but that is a different post!I then cut out squares of fabric and attached to some heat and bond and then cut out the handprints and attached them to my fabric. I then stitched name and year of birth under each handprint and added the year of marriage between the handprints. The little prints where added under their parents. A border was then added. I found that it was less expensive to finish off the quilt with a fleece blanket on the inside and then use a sheet to back it.

I have been using up the last of the Thanksgiving turkey this week. I made a turkey rice soup with carrots on Wednesday.I diced four large carrots and cooked them in a can of chicken stock, added water to fill up my pan and 2 tsp of chicken bouillon. It let it cook until the carrots were tender and then added my leftover turkey. Season with salt and pepper. Next went in 8 oz of rice. It let it cook and cook until the rice was done and the soup had thickened up. I did have to add additional water several times after I added the rice. It was super easy and the little guy I watch gave it his stamp of approval. Abe is 15 mos and after his second bite he said \"ummm, more.\"Chuck is off today and it looks to be busy.

Mom has always been resourceful and did a great job stretching the family money. She did such a great job that as children my sister and I never felt that we lived in a home were the pennies were sometimes really stretched.Each year there was a star on the top of our Christmas tree. Not just any star but a star that my mom made herself. A cardboard star covered in tin foil. I am not sure what happened to that star. Over the years the star was replaced by a store bought angel. Now there is nothing wrong with an angel on top of the tree; I am just a fan of the star.When I had my own home I purchased a plastic star for my tree. Nothing fancy and it served its purpose. Several years ago that star broke and I have looked and looked for the perfect star. Most of them were to flashy, to commercial. So for several years the top of our tree did not have a topper. While on vacation we stopped at the Ben Franklin Five and Dime store and that is were I found the star.As soon as I saw it I knew it would be perfect! I added the fabric to match the garland on my tree and am super happy with how it turned out. Although it is not a tin foil star it still reminds me of my childhood tree and how the Wise Men were guided by a star.Do you use a star, angel or something else for the top of your tree?I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Then add 2 cups of brown sugar, 1/2 cup corn syrup and 1/2 tsp of salt (increase to 1 tsp if using unsalted butter) and increase temperature to medium high. Stir continuously until it reaches a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Do not stir during this time.Remove from heat and add 1/2 t of baking soda and 1 t of vanilla. Pour over popcorn. Stir until coated well. (I used two large bowls to do this).Spread corn onto parchment covered baking sheets. Bake for 40 minutes stirring every 10 minutes. If corn is still mushy cook for 10 minutes longer until you reach the desired crunch. (I found a recipe for this on another blog. I tweaked it just a little and wanted to give her credit for the original recipe.)Allow to cool and store in an airtight container.Chuck declared this the best carmel corn ever! He said he will not buy store bought again. yippee!I will be packaging this is glass jars to hand out at Christmas.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Rice Art Turkey", "date": "Thursday, November 18, 2010", "text": "Daddy was working late last night so Megan and I had some fun. I have had this idea saved for a while.First you mix 1/2 cup rice, 5-8 drops of food coloring and 1 t of white vinegar (this will help the color set) together.Next you spread the rice onto a foil lined cookie sheet. Make sure to keep the colors separate! Then bake at 200* for 45 minutes. Once cooled the fun begins.Choose or draw a picture and then paint on some glue. Sprinkle the rice over the glue. I had Megan do this on a cookie sheet so when it was time to shake off the extra rice it was a little bit contained. The finished guy that has been named Turkey Lurkey. This was a fun project and there is enough rice left over for a couple more afternoons of fun.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I have been trying to make it fun and I did this craft yesterday with Megan and the little guy I babysit.I printed Psalm 69:30 on card stock and then had the kids add their hand print over the scripture.It was a fast easy project and I made extras for the grandparents. Are you doing anything to make Thanksgiving special?I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Days Go By", "date": "Tuesday, November 16, 2010", "text": "As the days go by I am trying to enjoy each moment.During quiet time I have been crafting while Megan is near working on her letters. It is such a joy to watch her learn to write and realize the letters make words.I received some peel and stick chalkboard paper from Chuck and decided to use it as my menu.It is pretty neat stuff! If I decide I don't want to use it as my menu I can peel it off and stick it somewhere else. I think it would be great to make a child table into a chalk table without painting.As the days grow cooler I am craving warm, comforting foods.After a yummy dinner and a little reading I am more then ready for bed. With the time change and early night fall I find that by 8:30 or 9 I am ready to turn in.Another day awaits me. Today the kitchen needs a deep clean, there is always laundry and all of my babysitting kids will be here this afternoon. I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I find myself listening to music often during the day and on Friday I found the Christmas music! Oh! I squealed with delight and I could just see the oh no look on Chuck's face. Much cooler temperatures, the threat of snow flurries and Christmas music is all I needed to start crafting away.I am a list maker and started by making a listing of all the things I want to get done soon.After making my list I hit the ground running. I gathered up all of the things I would need to complete my list.I have several things started and was able to complete one project.I used scraps of frayed fabric and wrapped it around a styrofoam cone. The stars were not my first choice, but I used what I had on hand. I covered the wooden stars with glue and then sprinkled on cinnamon. Oh my they smell wonderful!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Chuck and I were talking toward the end of last week about how relaxed the weekend was going to be. There wasn't anything on the calendar and we were looking forward to an easy weekend at home. Ha! Funny how fast things can change.While looking at the calendar for November and December I realized just how busy we are going to continue to be. In order to keep myself from completely stressing out it was decided that taking care of the Christmas pictures would be wise.Here are a few shots of my girl. I really like the second picture.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Buried Treasure", "date": "Thursday, November 04, 2010", "text": "When I was a little girl my grandparents still lived on the old home place. Across from my grandparents home sat another home. As a child I didn't think much about the house. It was just an abandoned old place that looked like it was about to fall down.As I grew older I began to appreciate my family history and started to ask questions. This house belonged to my grandfathers parents. They had a daughter that never married and after they passed Aunt Cora lived there alone. She lived there until she was no longer able to live alone and then she moved in with her sister (my great-grandmother). Not long after Aunt Cora passed away (in 1960) so did her brother-in-law (my great- grand dad). For reasons no one knows my great-grandmother never did anything with the house. I asked why my grandparents did nothing and mom said that it wasn't their place.Mom told me that as a child she and her siblings use to play in the house. The cellar was full of canned goods, there were old records that they use to play with and then break (gasp!) and even some furniture.On a recent trip back to Virgina my parents went to visit the old home place. Aunt Cora's house has been bulldozed and this is all that is left. They did a little digging in the area where the root cellar was located and my parents brought me back this buried treasure. Saying I was giddy when I saw these is an understatement! If these jars could talk imagine all of tales they could tell.  I will certainly treasure these jars.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},
{"title": "Vote!", "date": "Tuesday, November 02, 2010", "text": "Just a friendly reminder to go out and VOTE today. I know that it is sometimes hard to choose. It feels like you are voting for the lesser of two evils but the way I look at is if you don't vote you really have no right to complain about government decisions you don't like. At the moment there are many decisions being made that I do not agree with.Voting is a gift. There are many people in other countries who fight and even die for this right. A right that many Americans take for granted. The bottom line is that you should vote because you can!"},
{"title": "Fun, Fun Weekend!", "date": "Monday, November 01, 2010", "text": "We hit the ground running on Friday and keep running until we crashed last night. Friday was Megan's first school party. It was a Farmer Party and her teacher put a lot of thought into it. For activities there were four stations.I was the lucky mom who got to man the cookie decorating table. It was just a little messy!Another station was stuffing a scarecrow. When the last group went to that station they had a class picture. Notice the little guy to the left at the table. He stuck out his tongue in every picture!There was a station to shuck corn and then you were able to take it home.My favorite activity was canning corn. There was a bowl of candy corn that the kids scooped into a canning jar and put on a sticker saying they had canned corn. I thought that was very creative. Great job Mrs. F, it was lots of fun!Friday afternoon there was a play day with some friends we went to China with. Saturday consisted of lots of errands and then yesterday it was time to trick or treat.Megan dressed up as a clown. Here is a picture taken in the same spot (just a little updated now!) in 1974. I am on the left and was 3 and my sister was 2.  Megan with my nieces ready to hit the road! Although busy it was a great weekend.I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

{"title": "To Blog or Not to Blog", "date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "text": "Well that is what has been weighing on mind and heart. It seems that my time away from my blog has slowly been increasing. I hadn't been feeling the joy and contentment that I had in the past with blogging.I took time to step back and to evaluate the reason I was feeling this way. One thing that stuck out to me was that some of my reading choices may not have been the best. Now I am not saying that there was anything wrong with the content. It was just content that didn't leave me feeling good about myself.I am sure we have made a stop at a blog that leaves you feeling like you are not good enough. This person makes everything from scratch, this person can take a piece of string and have her living room looking like it should be in a magazine, this person shops at 10 stores with 10 kids spends $5, home schools and still has a spotless home with dinner on the table each night. Then there are the blogs that have tons of followers and make me feel like my little bit of space doesn't matter much. I know that you get the picture.Matthew 6:19-21 is a scripture that I keep coming to while thinking about this. Why was really blogging? In all honestly it isn't for comments, followers or fame. For where your treasure is there your heart will be also. Matthew 6:21What things do I really treasure? The answer was here all along, right up in the header of my blog.... Faith; an on going, ever growing relationship with my Lord and Savior. Family; the people that I love and cherish. Home; a place that I hope is cozy, warm and a refuse from the crazy world around us.So, the questions is will I keep blogging? After reading this post and the comments today I knew the answer was Yes. I will blog for the reason I first began. A place to share what is on my mind, heart, what is happening in my life and a scrapbook of sorts for the ones I treasure."},
{"title": "This is the day...", "date": "Wednesday, October 20, 2010", "text": "I have to be honest and admit that yesterday did not start out to be my best day. I was short will the kids, had a headache, and just wasn't feeling it. I am sure you can relate to the kind of morning I am talking about.I prayed for patients, temper control (my fuse was short), and kindness. By lunch time I knew that things were going to change. We enjoyed a nice peaceful lunch and then I laid down the law that everyone was taking a nap. Not just rest, but a nap.When I went to check in on Megan I had to smile. It looks like she took the \"everyone\" part literally and put all of her friends to bed!After a nice rest things were back to normal. Thank goodness!!When dinner was complete I realized that I didn't empty the dishwasher. I was in a time crunch to be somewhere and thought that it would be more time efficient to just hand wash the dishes.There is something simple and soothing about hand washing dishes.Some time was spent outside.Sweeping up leaves for the fun part.It seems that jumping in a pile of leaves is timeless.My parents are out of town and while over checking mail and setting out trash we picked tomatoes. There is the possibility of frost and we wanted to make sure they didn't go to waste.This day was a great reminder that for life to be good it doesn't have to be perfect.This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Psalm 118:24I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

{"title": "Glass Storage Love", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "text": "I've had an idea of adding some glass storage containers to my baking/spice cabinet for a while. The hold back was the price of the containers. I was at Meijer yesterday and ended up with a $20.00 gift card for a new prescription and I had a coupon for $2.50 off an order of $17.00. A perfect time to pick up the containers!They were priced at $5.99 each. I picked up four, gallon containers and after the coupon and gift card I spent a grand total $1.56. Yes!I attached a tag with a piece of twine.I have room for two more containers on this shelf. My favorite jar is the one that holds sprinkles and miscellaneous baking items. This is the top shelf of the cabinet and I was forever knocking the sprinkles over as I searched for the one I wanted. I am so happy with the way this turned out. I just love glass storage jars!I hope you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I laid in bed with a smile on my face as they peeked in and told me they had a surprise.After a few minutes I started to smell bacon cooking. I walked into the kitchen and Megan told me to go back to bed because it was a surprise. I informed her that I knew what the surprise was because I could smell the bacon. Still she insisted that I leave. When I was called to breakfast this is what greeted me.Chuck said that it was 100% Megan's idea for them to make breakfast. What a wonderful way to start the day!Chuck headed out to finish painting the shed. You can see a before picture here.While he did that I worked on clearing flowers and such away for the winter. I also worked on laundry and did a little cleaning.I cleaned our bedroom from top to bottom. I cleaned out closets, drawers and even vacuumed under all of the furniture. I will be adding that to my list a little more often! The only bummer is that I ripped the bed skirt while removing it. Off to the mending pile it went. It feels so great to step into a spotless, uncluttered room.The day was absolutely beautiful! All of the windows were open, the house was quiet and peaceful. I fluttered between puttering inside and out. I recently picked up a couple of things and did a little tweaking.I don't think this is the permanent home for the blocks, but I couldn't resist putting them out.Doing little things like this is not something that I always find the time for.A home cooked meal for the ones I love.It was the kind of day that sooths and refreshes. Ah! I hope you taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

{"title": "Still Here", "date": "Friday, October 08, 2010", "text": "I am really terrible at blogging lately. My days have been busy and by the time night is here I am to tired to do a post.I spent some time this week shopping. One day for groceries. That is another area where I am also slacking. I have been hitting a big box store and not really hunting the deals. I just don't feel like I have the time at the moment. I need to get back into the groove since I know that it does help the bottom line.I also spent a day shopping for winter clothes for me. Never fun! I needed some long pants. If I could wear Capri pants year round I certainly would. I also looked for some dresses for Megan. The only dresses that I found acceptable where corduroy which Megan doesn't like. I just don't understand why the manufacturers think when a little girl moves from a size 4 to a 5 that you want her to dress like a teenager. To be honest I don't even want her in this kind of clothing when she is a teenager. Ugh!The family that I have babysat for for years have returned. They are very part time. I only have them for five afternoons this month. The new baby is very fussy and that makes for a long afternoon. I was afraid that he just didn't like me, but mom said no he is just a fussy baby. I prayed yesterday morning for things to get better and yesterday afternoon was better. He was still fussy but I was able to calm his more. I am also feeling the need to do some fall cleaning. I have started working in our bedroom and hope to have it finished this weekend. Then I will move on to Megan's room. It feels good to purge, clean and organize.I hope to be better at blogging next week, but if I am not know that I am just living life. I hope you taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

We headed out Thursday night to spend the weekend at a state park. It is located not far from a small rural town and the park is surrounded by woods. There was time for long walks.Taking in the sights and sounds of nature. We even spotted a Blue Heron.There are plenty of Amish in the area. We saw several along the road selling things. Here two ladies were selling vegetables.You know that you are in a farming community when this is what you see when you reach the end of Main Street!We took a little drive into a neighboring town and I thought it was beautiful the way you crossed a one lane bridge and there was the courthouse. I long for life in the country and I am always refreshed when I return from this area.  Only God knows if I will someday a home in the country.

Remember a few years ago when I posted about a leak in a drain pipe? Well, the hole has been here for what seems like forever. Chuck did use scrap wood to cover it so it wasn't like we were falling in the hole while on the back porch. We don't have credit cards and needed the funds to finish this project. You know how it goes... when we had the time there was no money and when there was money there was no time. Finally time and money came together to get this done.Megan loves to help out. She carried down a piece of 2x4 that was used as a frame.Saturday was a chilly day and our crew showed up nice and early. Here my dad (in the shorts) and my father-in-law are helping Chuck.Almost done and I was starting to get excited!After all of their hard work I thought it was only right to feed the crew. Nothing better on a chilly day then a nice pot of chili. That was served along with toasted cheese and homemade apple crisp. I am so happy (and so is Chuck!) to have this project marked off of the list. It has been a long weekend so I am off to bed.  Tomorrow I am going to finish laundry and make some applesauce.

Yesterday there was another field fire and 160 acres of corn were lost. I saw the clouds moving in and thought do I dare hope that rain is coming? Come it did!It started out with a slow pitter patter on the tin porch roof and then it let loose.When it has been dry for so long what is a girl to do when the rain starts? Go out and play of course!We still need more rain, but I am so thankful for what we received.It was such a treat to sit outside and smell the wonderful scent of rain!"},

I have great memories of visiting Granny's. From the wood stove in the kitchen, collecting eggs, seeing my first runt piglet, sitting on front porch, playing with a favorite cousin, Georgie and so many more!

{"title": "A Great Weekend", "date": "Monday, September 20, 2010", "text": "I hope that everyone had a great weekend. My weekend started out with a play date at a local park Friday afternoon.The only thing that has changed about this park in twenty years is new paint and mature trees. There are still the old metal slides and merry go round. It was lots of fun and we are hoping to make it a monthly thing.Saturday was the company picnic for Chuck's work. This year they hosted it at a place that has a pioneer settlement.One of the great things about this place is that it is very hands on. Megan pretended to pump water.We watched the blacksmith make nails.It was such a neat thing to watch!After lots of walking Megan decided it was break time.By this time we had walked and walked and it was about all that a four year old could handle. We headed off for a cold drink and then home.It is starting to look a little bit like fall! We are still having some 90* days, but the mornings and nights are getting cooler.In my spare time I worked on laundry and changing out Megan's clothes. All of her winter items are washing, ironed and put away. I have a couple stacks of summer clothes to look through and decide if they should be stored for next year or given away.  I hope to hit our room this week and do the same thing.  We don't have much to switch out, but it is always good to go through things and get rid of items we are no longer wearing.  It looks to be a busy week with school, babysitting, housework and few fun things on my list.  I hope that you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

I caught it Wednesday night and by Thursday Megan was feeling bad. All three of us sick at the same time was not fun! Luckily Megan had it least of any of us. As you all know it is hard to see your child not feeling well. The plus of the whole thing is that by Friday we all were feeling better and ended up having a relaxing weekend. Sad that it sometimes takes getting sick to make you slow down.I haven't done much fall decorating yet. My tubs are still down in the shed. I did buy some mums a couple of weeks ago.A couple of pot to put here and there and the rest were placed in the ground. It is super dry here and I am hoping that they will make it.Since it has been so dry I have been making sure that the bird bath has fresh water every evening.Not many bird have been out, but the squirrels have been using it. It is so dry that the other day a squirrel keep watching us while on the swing set and keep creeping closer and closer to the bird bath. He finally risked it for a drink. I have never seen the squirrels get that close while we have been out.This is a picture of my front lawn.That will give you an idea of how dry it is. The area farmers are having a hard time because of it. The other day there were three field fires in one day. Unfortunately not only crops were damaged, one family lost their home.This time of year evenings are a favorite time of mine. We have been spending some time out enjoying the cooler weather. The other night we stayed out well past dark, lite a candle and then ended up putting on a puppet shadow show.It really is the simple things that make life fun!Chuck and Megan have a special time at bedtime. After we read a story and have prayer time I leave the room.Megan asks Daddy to tell her a story about her friends. They make us stories about each of her favorite stuffed animals. Chuck has stated writing down the stories they create so we can create a book for her. It really warms my heart to see them have this special time.I hope that you are taking time to enjoy the simple moments!"},

Laundry hung out to dry. Banana bread fresh from the oven cooling.A sweet sleeping child tuckered out from all the fresh air and outside play. Some time to tweak. I had a coupon and tarts were on sale at Yankee Candle so I stocked up. I love the way they look displayed in this glass jar. Time to relax with the soft glow of candle light and a wonderful fragrance of Farmers Market.It was the kind of day that just clicked along and make me praise the Lord for all of my blessings. I love a day like this. I feel tired and content and know that I will sleep well tonight. I hope you were able to find time to cherish the simple things today. I hope that you all enjoyed your long weekend. We sure did. I teased Chuck and told him that he gets a Labor Day holiday so he can labor at home!Faith, our youngest niece, celebrated her first birthday this weekend.She was so dainty while eating her cake and was not happy to have dirty hands. It was funny to watch.Sunday evening we went to my parents to take the steps out of their pool. It is hard to believe that it is that time already. It feels like we were just getting the pool ready. After a dinner of my mom's fried chicken we all headed out to the pool.With the cooler temperatures we have been having the water is too cold for swimming. The girls still had a fun time dipping in their toes. Notice the dryer sheets? That was my sister's idea for mosquito protection!Monday was spent working outside. While Chuck worked on prepping our shed for paint I painted my potting bench and then gave the back porch a really good clean.Boy did it need it! I hadn't realized how dirty the siding or windows had become. I am amazed at how clear my view is now. I will have to put outside window cleaning on the list more then just spring and fall.When I was almost done with the porch a new neighbor came by. He asked us to join his family for an early dinner. They are Mexican and served steak and pork in homemade corn tortillas. Yummy! We had spoken to them in passing and it was great to get to know them better.Here is the potting bench almost complete.The buckets are something I got on clearance after Easter. I got them dirt cheap and love the way they look. Eventually I will paint them with chalkboard paint and then I can mark what is in them.After so much time spent outside I am off to give the inside of my home and little TLC.  Have a great Tuesday!"},

We ended up taking her out for lunch and getting her a gift card to a favorite restaurant.  I have mixed feelings about giving gift cards. I really wanted something a little more personal. This is what I came up with. I pulled some wooden flowers out of my craft stash and had Megan paint them. Chuck printed off a picture from each of Megan's four years and cut those into circles. Those were attached to the center of flower and then a wooden skewer was hot glued onto the back.I had saved an old formula container and used that as the flower pot. I wrapped it in scrapbook paper and added a ribbon. To finish it off I had Megan to write her name onto a tag and tucked in the gift card. A huge hit with Grandma!The mom of the little guy I watch had a birthday yesterday. I wanted to make a card for Abe to give his Mommy. I gave him a crayon and let him color onto a piece of cardstock. I then traced his hand and cut it out to make the petals of a flower.  A favorite picture was added to the middle and mom was presented a personal card. I love that I was able to make these using items that I had on hand."},

It had been sitting on the back porch for what seems like forever.Finally it is complete and hanging back on the shed.

Anyone who has knowledge of China adoption would know that they are know as a sign of good luck. They were gifted to me while we waited for Megan. I 'm not sure how much good luck they might bring, but I think they are cute.The unexpected item on the list was a new radiator for my car. Saturday evening we were on our way to the hardware store and the car was getting hot. We ended up scraping the trip to the store and headed home. When Chuck opened the hood the radiator was steaming and he could see that the steam was coming from a crack. Yikes!We skipped church so that Chuck could get this taken care of. He looked online and found that one junk yard had one radiator that would fit the year of my car. He started working on it about 8 and didn't get it complete until almost 6. A long day and an unexpected event yes, but through it all God is good. We are grateful that it didn't happen while I was in the car pool line with kids to deal with, that we were able to find a used radiator at a reasonable price, that it happened on a weekend when my handy husband was able to take care of it.  I am certainly grateful for a husband that is willing to give up his day of rest to take care of his family.  I hope your weekend was great and that Monday is even better!"},

Tuesday is an off school day and we did it that afternoon. It gave me a change to talk with Megan about her first day. It was a fast easy project and it will be fun to open it up next year and see all of the changes.The weather had been mild the last few days and it has had a fall feel to it. Spending time outside has been top priority. There have been pretend picnics with \"friends.\" Plenty of weeds to pull and even some baking has taken place. One of my favorite wind down things is to sit on the back porch with a cup of hot tea. When it is accompanied by a slice of fresh lemon cake it is even better.I don't do well when things are complicated and overly busy. It feels good to be able to slow down and enjoy some simple moments."},

She did great!I shed a few tears seeing my baby go off as such a big girl. She did not say one time that she did not want to go. I think the separation issues might be working themselves out. Yes!She got into the car after school with a big smile on her face and said that she did not want to leave ever. Later in the day she did tell me that she keep asking her teacher and aide if it was time to go home. She is already talking about going back on Wednesday. I am super proud of her!"},

Thursday afternoon Megan and I prepped carrots for canning. I peeled them and then she placed them in the sink to wash. It was fun listening to her. She had carrot people doing all sorts of things. She played and played for a long time and I loved listening to her imagination.Ten pounds of carrots were diced and then 19 pints were canned. . I love the way all of those jars look!Saturday a few errands were run and then we headed to my father-in-law's for pizza. Once home I worked on things for a family reunion on Sunday. I baked brownies, deviled eggs and prepared beans for baking. Every dish came home empty and I take that as a high compliment. The reunion is held in a state park about two hours south of where we live. The weather was great and we enjoyed a great time of food, family and fun.Butterflies were everywhere. Megan and Grandma (Chuck's mom) finally caught one. There was a long hike taken with Grandpa and cousins. After all of the excitement of the day Megan was out! She crashed hard.Today looks to be just as busy. Megan has her first day of school and there is housework, laundry and hopefully time for some weeding. I enjoy a productive day and hope this is one.

Megan was able to collect eggs, plant seeds and then pick her harvest.Once that was done she was able to take all of her goodies to market. She was issued play money and able to go to the market and buy a snack or drink. Lots of fun! I love looking at the vintage kitchens. Since we went on a weekday they had women actually cooking in them. This kitchen was from the '30's and the lady had just pulled a cobbler out of the wood stove.The FAA had set up minature golf. It was the first time that Megan had played.Fair food was consumed and lots of lemon shake ups were drank. Megan got to see a huge pig up close as it almost ran her down. A young kid was taking walking the pig up the auction when it decided to turn around and go the other way. No pictures of the pig because we were too busy getting out of the way and laughing at Megan's facial expression! I love going to the fair and am already looking forward to next year."},

You know the time to start thinking about Christmas. I really should have started last month, but you all know how some times the days just get away from you.I have decided that I am no longer going to be part of the crowd that wanders the mall endlessly searching for just anything to mark someone off of my list. I am longing for a simple Christmas centered on the true meaning... Jesus.One way to meet this desire to come up with gift ideas that will mean something to the recipient. This is my first idea.I used word and picked the font that I wanted (I used Bradley Hand ITC) and just played with the font size. It really depends on the length of the family last name. Under the family name I put an established date, which is the date the couple was married. Then I picked out a heart from clip art and centered it. I then add the couples name on either side of the heart and the names of the children under the heart. Under that I added a scripture. I choose 1 Corinthians 16:4 Let all that you do be done in love.This turned out to be a fairly frugal project. The card stock cost $0.39 and the frame I purchased at Wal-*art for $2.50. Not a bad gift for $2.89!"},

God has a plan for my life and I have to admit that it is working out pretty well!!It has been on my mind for sometime about Megan's schooling. Would she be home schooled or sent off to school? I was pulling for homeschooling, but things just weren't leading down that path. With babysitting I just wasn't able to make the commitment that I needed to. Of course that wasn't the only concern.My parents brought up schooling on Friday and asked if we were interested in sending Meg to a preschool program at a Christian school. I laid out all of the reason why I didn't think we could. They then laid out all of the reasons that we should. Chuck and I decided that it was best to go ahead and send her to school. I know how wonderful the program is because two of my nieces went to this school. They use the A Beka curriculum which is something that I had been looking at.Yesterday I went to do a walk through with the principal. Megan was a little shy at first, but then she warmed up. She finally let go of me and was talking with the principal. She even gave her a hug before we left. How wonderful it was to see that from my separation anxious child! I keep telling myself that it only for three mornings a week. As I told a friend of mine it isn't about what I want, it is about what is best for Megan. Oh yeah, and also learning that I am not in control!For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.

Yum!Abe, one of the little guys I watch, celebrated his 1st Birthday this weekend.He wasn't sure what to do with all the presents. Not to worry, Megan showed him how it works!There was finally a break in the whether and we spent some much needed time outside. The grass was cut and tons of weeds were pulled. Due to our poor growing season we went ahead and pulled up most of the garden.There are tomato plants standing and the rest of the green bean brush has now been hauled away. Thanks to our Amish friends we will have some green beans to can in a few weeks. I sure hope the growing season is better next year!I had a rough night on Saturday so it was decided that we would sleep in on Sunday morning. I didn't seep late but didn't get dressed until noon! That is something that I rarely do. Most of my day was spend doing this.Enjoying some fresh air and a good book! Although I am not back to 100% I am feeling better. Sometimes you just have to push through, which is what I will be doing today. Housework, children to care for and hopefully some time to enjoy the sunshine are all on the agenda for today.

Next thing I know she is running out the door in her swimsuit. After running through the water for a little while it was time to hit the pool. Chuck and I ended up getting in also.

I haven't even had my first picking of green beans and have done no veggie canning.Zucchini seems to be the only thing producing really well. My little helper begged for me to let her grate zucchini. I finally let her try under close supervision and she did a fantastic job! Helping me in the kitchen is something that she loves. I have great plans for all of the photos of Megan in the kitchen. I am planning on making her a recipe scrapbook that I will present to her at her wedding shower.

I don't feel that I have been \"watching over the affairs of my household\" lately. Now I haven't been \"idle\" just busy.Last week Megan went to VBS. I don't think I have mentioned this, but Megan has some separation issues. Last Sunday evening she started in with the crying and saying she didn't want to go. It went on and on. She started in again Monday morning and I put my foot down and told her she had to go that she didn't have a choice. Grandma picked her up each morning and then I picked her jbefore lunch. She went everyday and had a great time. I am so proud of her!Of course Sunday morning she still didn't want to go to church. She started getting upset as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. VBS has given me hope that we will be able to work through the separation issues.Two favorites of VBS. Megan has wore her sheep mask almost every night since she made it.She loves when Daddy plays the Big Bad Wolf and chases her around. The closing program was also a hit. Silly Safari did a program and had this snake for the kids to touch. Yuck!Yesterday I started the day by putting my kitchen back in order. It makes me smile when my kitchen is neat and tidy!The weather was beautiful so I washed all of our bedding and extra blankets. I love the smell of linens fresh from the line!

She is tickled pink to call Flower her own. She has been showing him off the everyone who stops by.After I returned home from running some errands on Friday I was greeted by this.Part of one of our pine trees fell into our neighbors yard and took out a good portion of her maple tree.One of the first things she says to us is \"I hope you have good insurance.\" We looked at each other and both thought oh no! The she comes over on Sunday and says she is surprised Chuck wasn't out working on the tree (he had to work Saturday) and then tells us that her insurance company said we were negligent for not taking better care of the tree. What! It was a perfectly healthy tree. As our insurance agent said it is an act of God. We have always had a good relationship with this neighbor and have been trying to take the high road through all of this. The thing that we are finding most upsetting is that we never implied that we were not going to take care of the matter and haven't appreciated her attitude.The tree has been cut up and moved off of her property and Chuck is taking care of her tree that was damaged. He cut off the broken branches and is trying to save some others. I feel that we have done all we can to make it right; maybe even a little above and beyond. Chuck is extremely upset over her behavior and I am trying to keep him calm and to help him realize that this all will pass.Besides work and the stress of the tree situation we were able to have a little fun. We went to a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese for my nephew. Megan always has a good time there.I have started working on some things for Christmas.

Grateful that we could head to my parents home. Since I was not sure when this will be taken care of today we loaded up ourselves and the laundry and headed to my parents.

I will say that the idea of putting up my own canned goods and not purchasing them at the grocery really appeals to me.There was also a chart (click to enlarge) that list the amount of each item to put up and how many jars you would get from each bushel.There are many, many recipes in this book.

Now all Chuck and I have to say is twist and pull and we both crack up!We left with 2 1/2 of these containers; about 8 1/2 quarts.We shared some, eat lots and made strawberry jam.There are still lots of strawberries left.

I love that they are all involved in her life; each adding something special.Meet Grandma (Chuck's mom), who Megan refers to as My Grandma!The two of them have a very special bond. Grandma likes to stop by after work and pick Megan up for a few hours. They have a routine that involves stopping by the store to pick the makings for dinner. The most important item they purchase is cookie dough!When we go to pick up Megan we are usually treated to a cookie. One night Grandma mentions that cookies are starting to stick to her sheets. I tucked that little bit of information away for later.For Mother's Day I purchased her two new air bake cookie sheets. Then I asked Megan to tell me all about the cookies from Grandmas. She tells me that after dinner Grandpa brings out the cookie dough and cuts it with a sharp knife. Then she gets to eat one cookie dough and Grandpa eats two. That Grandma's job is to put the cookies in the oven. She goes on to tell me the best part of going to Grandma's is the cookie dough!Obviously I know that she likes more then cookie dough about going to Grandma's. What I do know is that making cookies is becoming a very special memory for her. To preserve this memory and to let Grandma & Grandpa know how much it means to Meg we made a story book to go along with the cookie sheets.Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. ~Proverbs 4:23We are very particular of the influences in Megan's life and are so grateful that she has Grandma in her life. She is kind, caring, godly and loves our little girl so much!"},

I thought I would outsmart the rain and just go buy them from the farm stand. Nope. Can you guess why? The rain has slowed down the ripening process. Our berry picking and jam making will just have to wait until another day. Sigh. I really don't want to sound like I am whining. I do know that the rain is necessary and am grateful that we are not experiencing flooding. I would just like a little break. Planting my garden and a little sunshine would make me a happy girl.

One thing that I have a problem with is saying no. I really want to be helpful and sometimes put helping others above the welfare of my own family. I am trying hard to work on this!Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated. ~ConfuciusAnother thing that I think helps with living a simple life is contentment.

We used the fencing to cover a rain barrel.I have been wanting one for a long time. A nice barrel is pricey. Our solution was to make our own.There is a downspout at the back of our house in one of my flower beds. A perfect place for our rain barrel. Chuck bought a barrel from a landscaper off of Craigslist for $15. He cut the top off and scrubbed it out. After the ground was level the barrel was put up on blocks. I wanted to be able to put a watering can under the spout. Chuck then did some fancy stuff that I don't really get. He drilled holes added pipe and a hole in the lid for the down spout. Routed the downspout into the barrel and then was ready to enclose it.He then built panels with the fence to cover the pretty green barrel. Drilled a hole in fence and added this pretty little spout.  I plan to paint this a beige using some leftover house paint. Most of the barrels we saw online were $100+ we were able to complete this little project for about $45. Rain is in the forecast for the weekend and I am excited to see this fill up!"},

{"title": "Whipped Cream", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2010", "text": "For a long time I was under the impression that making whipped cream from scratch would be time consuming. Not so. It is fast and super easy.2 cups heavy whipping cream (approx 2 cups in a one pint container)3 tbs sugar3 tsp vanillaStart mixing on slow and gradually go to the fasted speed. Whip until peaks form.I used this for a fruit salad I took to a pitch in on Sunday. I added half a pint of blueberries, 2 lbs sliced strawberries, 2 cans drained mandarin oranges, 2 apples diced. I placed the apples in lemon juice as I diced them to prevent browning. After mixed together I added 3/4 of the fruit into a dish. Added 3/4 of the whipped cream and repeated. I saved out some of the fruit for garnish.If you have left over whipped cream you can use your cake decorating tip to freeze dollops. These are good to pull out and use on the top of hot chocolate or warm pie. Just don't thaw before using because it loses it's texture. I have also heard that the next day you can whip the whipped cream again to bring back the light, fluffy texture. I haven't tried this.The taste of homemade whipped cream does not even compare to the store bought stuff. This is the only whipped cream that Megan will eat.  Do you make your own whipped cream?"},

What I have learned so far is that it is going to be a long hard process. I have been reading food labels and am not liking most of what I see. I am really having a hard time understanding why food manufacturers feel the need to add so much to our food.One argument of eating healthy is that is takes too much time or cost too much. I admit that I have used the argument that it takes too much time. Not anymore! I recently had a five pound bag of carrots. I cleaned and peeled them all at one time. I was able to cut some carrot sticks for snacking, dice some for soups, stews and side dishes and then cut some for pot roast.I have always been a big fan of canning my own food. Carrots are something that I am adding to my list to can. If you buy frozen carrots your are getting just carrots. If you buy canned carrots you are getting carrots, water, salt and calcium chloride. Growing my own is not something that has worked for me. I can never get a large sweet carrot. The plan is to watch for a great sale and then put them up. I will know the quality of carrot and exactly what is in each can."},

I hate to admit it, but I seem to have lost my joy.I am happy and wouldn't trade the life I lead for anything. I am finding myself feeling overwhelmed with task. There is so much to be done and quite frankly I just don't want to do it! Yes, I know I sound like a toddler having a temper tantrum, but that is where I am.My intentions are great. It is the follow through that is lacking. I will get in the cleaning, organizing mood and get a couple of task complete. I just can't seem to find the motivation to keep going. Then things fall into a bigger mess and sometimes it is easier to just say forget it. Then that leads to the overwhelmed feeling.I don't like this feeling at.all. I want to get up each morning and embrace a new day. Be ready to face all of the challenges of life with a joyful heart.I want to find joy in dusting... everything shining and clean along with a fresh scent.I want to find joy in laundry... fresh clean clothes hanging in our closets ready for use instead of a mountain of dirty laundry.I want to find joy in balancing the checkbook and paying bills... we have money that needs balanced and are able to pay bills.I want to find joy in cooking and baking... providing a tasty meal for my family and making treats for my hard working husband.I want to find joy in reading and playing with Megan... to find joy in this and not feel like I am going through the motions.I know that life is a cycle of ups and downs and without some down time it hard to really enjoy the good things in life. I am on a mission to find my joy again, to truly enjoy all things big and small.***This post was written a few weeks ago. I am slowly finding my joy again. Chuck saw this quote \"Life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful\" That could not have come at a better time. I find that I tend to be my worst enemy. I am extremely hard on myself.Chuck has been a huge help. He has made me realize that he doesn't care about perfection and that the way things are at home are fine. That we are living life, I am not only caring for my family, but also the children of two other families and that I can not be expected to do it all. I think that is a hard thing to accept. I really want to be able to do it all. I am finding that it is better to do a few task with joy in my heart then to try to do it all and have no joy. I am sure that this is a journey I will be taking for some time."},

You can see that winter is trying to hang on, but spring is letting it's presence known.These are my lilies and crocus. The daffodils and tulips are also making their presence known.This was the temperature yesterday afternoon. With a temperature like this it won't be long before I will see some blooms.I know that we are bound to have some days that seem more winter like. That makes the nice days even more enjoyable. I have been making the most of them.Opening windows and letting in the fresh air. Oh, how I love this!Putting Mr. Grill to work. These pork chops were wonderful!I am making my spring cleaning list and Chuck and I have been talking about the projects we would like to complete this year. A shed, back porch and playhouse all need a coat of paint. It looks like paint might be a theme this year!I feel like I have been neglecting this little blog. My days seem to be very full.This is Abe. The little guy that I watch full time. He just turned 7 months and it seems like he has taken off overnight. Literally! He started sitting up and then scooting within a couple weeks of each other. He is now a full fledged crawler and is starting to pull up/push up on things. I have a feeling he will be an early walker. Between doing fun things with Megan and keeping Abe out of trouble I haven't had much time for anything else.  Just the normal day to day stuff. Some days it seems crazy around here but I wouldn't trade it for anything!"},

I love that everything is beginning fresh and new.Besides enjoying the heart warming sun I was able to do something fun. I went to a local middle school home economic room and tested some products for Ball Canning. Fun!Fun!Fun!After testing the products I walked away a little cash, some great coupons and products to sample.Unfortunately I am unable to tell you the items that were tested. What I can tell you is that it looks like some old favorites are going to be updated. How is that for vague!?It looks like the spring like weather will be sticking around this week. Temperatures in the mid to high 50's are forecasted and so are some spring showers. I hope the remaining piles of snow will melt away this week. It is still early and I suspect we will still see a flurry or two. It is Indiana and as all good Hoosiers know there will always be a touch of winter until the high school basketball tournament is over! I know what is on the way so I know I will make it!Laundry and a kitchen floor in need of a good mopping is calling my name. Have a great Monday!"},

It was previously in this spot and sported a natural wood look.  I would love to update it even more by getting rid of the hearts.  All in good time.I took a basket that flowers were delivered in years ago and added a black and white gingham ribbon.   A jar filled with old wooden spools of thread and a crock on the other side.On one end there is this plate that I picked up at Flower Factory. It says \"Family -all because two people fell in love.\"The other end of the shelf holds the star that Chuck and I made.  I love that the only thing purchased for this makeover was the plate.

The ironing is what gets me behind.Yesterday I cleaned the oven and did my Tuesday chore of cleaning the living room. I am feeling much better about the state of my home. I even took some time for crafting. I painted a shelf for my living room and made a banner.I printed off the letters in Word. I then cut them out using craft foam. Once they were attached onto a rectangle piece of foam I then glued them to a piece of twine. Very easy and it is shows where my heart is... Spring! I plan to hang it across my kitchen window. I usually wait until the first of March to bring out the spring things. I am having a very hard time waiting this year.

I have cut those off and put them back for Christmas crafting.I cut the first wreath down and used almost 3/4 of it to make a couple of candle rings.I plan to glue on an updated heart and then dry brush on a brick red. Give it a little sand and then add a couple of new candles. Slowly I am getting my living room put back together. I have lots of things to makeover. I am waiting for some warmer weather so I can break out the paint and spend some time in the garage. Come on Spring!"},

Just the pick me up a girl needs on a cold, snowy day.Speaking of sweet nothings...Megan and I whipped up these pretties over the weekend in anticipation of Valentine's Day.I also spent some time puttering in the living room. The wallpaper is up and I am at the point where I am putting the goodies back. This is one of my newest finds.The best sweet nothing of the weekend was this.I had mentioned to Chuck that I wanted a board for the stove top. I had shown him a couple of pictures and I found this waiting for me on the stove yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised. I never know what I might find when he has time to spend in the garage. I am not sure how I am going to paint this up, but am excited to begin. I can't wait to get it finished and then add some goodies on top.We are expecting another snow storm to roll in tonight. Thankfully we didn't get hit like my east coast family. I am hearing from my northern Virgina family that they have up to 30 inches of snow. Wow! Have a fabulous Monday!"},

I spent a little time this week planning out what I want my daily and monthly chores to look like. After planning it out I made a list in excel.I have certain days that I clean each room and this will help me not to feel so overwhelmed. Especially since I have a habit of trying to do it all at once and then getting stressed out!Each night after dinner I have been pulling out my list for the next day.

When she know what is happening next and what is expected there seem to be less behavior issues and melt downs.

Some of the things writen; I love Grandma, I love Grandpa, Hugs are Great!, verses from 1 Corinthians 13:4-6 and then Megan wrote her M on one. Megan then choose what she wanted to glue into each cup and I helped her to glue the cups onto the cardboard.

The baby I watch is almost six months old and has not wanted to sleep. That has been challenging along with some extra babysitting duties this week. I wasn't able to do as much for this challenge as I would have liked. With my harried week I know that I needed time in His word more then ever.I am finding the best time for me to do my reading is during afternoon quiet time. Even if no one sleeps my home is quiet and I need this time to recharge. I feel like I am rushed in the morning and exhausted in the evening. I know as the season in my home changes that finding more quiet time will be easier.I am currently looking for a daily devotional to do during this time. Something that is simple. I am open to suggestions.  I hope to have time to browse my local Christian bookstore this weekend.Although I didn't start a prayer journal or memorize the Psalms I am okay with that.

I don't know about you but sometimes the radio is on but I am not really listening. It is on more out of habit and tends to be background noise. Something caught my attention. There was a short segment about being a Proverbs 31 Woman.She was talking about how about how stressed and overwhelmed she sometimes feels. About her endless to do list and the schedule full of outside activities. About how at the end of the day or week she will feel like a failure. Sound familiar? It certainly does to me. That got me thinking about what it really means to be a Proverbs 31 women.I found this site and a list of The Seven Principles of the Proverbs 31 WomanThe Proverbs 31 Woman...*Pursues an ongoing, personal relationship with Jesus Christ.*Loves, honors, and greatly enriches the life of her husband, encouraging and supporting his leadership within his family and his church.*Nurtures the next generation, shaping and molding the children who will one day define who we are as a community and as a nation.*Creates a warm and loving environment for family and friends.*Is a faithful steward of the time and money God has entrusted to her.*Speaks with wisdom and faithful instruction as she encourages others and develops godly friendships.*Shares the love of Christ by extending her hands to help the poor and opening her arms to the needy.Virtues that I certainly want in my life. Living that stressed overwhelmed life is not fun. Feeling like a failure is not fun. Look for more post about this as I ponder this and what it means to my daily life."},

I have decided that the areas I want to improve the most are health, heart and home.I recently stepped on the scale and let's just say that I was not very happy. I have struggled with my weight since my mid twenties. I have had many ups and downs along the way. Diets just don't work for me. I find that I can stick to it and lose weight, but then I usually pick it back up and then some. So going on a diet is not the plan to solve this. Getting healthy is. Changing the way we eat and adding that much dreaded exercise. This is not so much about losing weight as it will be changing our lifestyle. I know that it won't be easy, but I think if I take baby steps and change a little at a time I can do this.As far as my heart, I want my thoughts and actions to be pleasing to the Lord. I think that we have a choice about how we are perceived and the way we perceive life. I can get up each day and be thankful no matter what or I can get up and decide to grumble about things. I want a joyful, contented heart. I plan to do this by spending more time reading the Bible, surrounding myself by those that are positive and making a conscience choice about the things I do and say.Home... that is where the heart is. At least it should be. I have been thinking about the need for more space. Then I started asking myself do we really need more space or less things. The answer is really less things. I plan to go through and purge and organize. To change things to make my home comfortable, inviting and most of all a haven for those I love.As I work through this I will share what I am doing and how things are working out. My hope is that by posting here I can hold myself accountable to make these changes. I speak often about the desire to live a simple, fulfilling life. Desiring it is one thing, taking steps to make it happen is another.Wising you a great Monday!"},
{"title": "Christmas Weekend", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2009", "text": "Yesterday afternoon it started to snow. Oh, it was so pretty!We had no where to go so I was able to snuggle up with a good book while Megan and Daddy played games. After a few day of running here and there it was pure joy!I hope that you all had a very nice Christmas. Ours was great. Megan received so many great things. A Jack in the Box which was on the top of her list and a workbench.She is always Daddy's helper while he works in the garage and this was a big hit.You can see her excitement while opening this package.It warmed my heart to know she found so much joy in a simple slinky.Besides Christmas morning at our home we had three other get togethers. All the kids at my father-in-laws are three and under. I was impressed with how much self control they had while waiting for present time. It was very hard on my nephew.Megan was having more fun playing with the bows and ribbon. She keep taking the bows off of everyone's present. I was so happy to see that it wasn't all about the presents for her.I won't be posting anymore this week. Chuck is on vacation this week. We have a couple of small projects to complete. Some good ole' fashioned family time is on the agenda also.Wishing all of you a New Year full of health, peace, love and faith."},

Add remaining ingredients. 2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup chopped pecans. Roll into balls about the size of a small walnut. Bake for 12 15 minutes. Roll in powdered sugar while still warm.I usually roll them about three times and then sprinkle extra powdered sugar over the top when storing. What is your favorite Christmas cookie?"},
{"title": "Feeling Crafty", "date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2009", "text": "I have been in a crafty mood the last few days. I made this as a gift for the little guy I babysit for to his Mommy and Daddy.It was inspired by Monica.Megan and I made ornaments out of plain glass bulbs. We decoupaged wrapping paper scraps on the first one. This was not easy since it was hard to get the paper to conform to the circle. Next we tried squares of tissue paper.  This worked much better. Then it was time to finish making scripture/picture coasters. This pretty little thing is my youngest niece, Faith. All that is left to do is box them up.There are more things I would like to complete, but have decided that I am done until after Christmas. There are just so many great ideas that I keep seeing.  I have started to compile a list and I plan to make time for Christmas crafting at least once a month."},

A carousel ride with my best girl. Pretending to be the Mama Dinosaur. The train exhibit is so neat. We could have stayed there for hours watching it.

{"title": "Christmas from the Heart:  Photobooks", "date": "Tuesday, December 01, 2009", "text": "I wanted to share with you another personal and inexpensive gift idea. I made this photo book through Snapfish. I titled it the 12 Months of Megan.I choose a handful of pictures from each month for the last year. I then went in and created a page or two for each month.  I hope you are able to tell that there is a variety of layouts you can choose from. I started with December of last year and then moved forward. This book is a gift for Megan's grandma & grandpa (Chuck's mom & stepdad). I keep that in mind while making the book and tried to include photos of them with Megan. I know without a doubt that they will love this gift. The best part is that it cost less then $8.00 to make this.How many of you Coke drinkers are doing the my coke reward program? If not, I would encourage you to. We have been trading in our points for snapfish products. We are able to print 4x6 photos for free and then I think we were able to print two photobooks this year. There are some limits of what you can do, but to only pay shipping I am willing to jump through a few hoops. I am off to start my day with a trip to the grocery store.  I want to beat the Arctic cold front that is on it's way.  I am not quite ready to shop in 20* weather yet.  Brrrr!  Have a great day."},

We have been having some mild days and maybe I am just dreading all of the cold and snowy days that will keep us inside. As I was looking out my kitchen window today I noticed these trees. They are at the very back of our property and the only trees that still have leaves on them.It looks to me like they are holding on to them for dear life. Maybe I am not the only one not wanting to let fall go easily.I have been preparing things for Thanksgiving. I have two dinners to attend this year. We will be going to by mother-in-law's on Thanksgiving and then to my father-in-law's on Saturday. I found a recipe for Chocolate Chip Cheesecake that I am planning to make for both places. It called for store bought chocolate chip cookie dough, but I couldn't see spending the money on it. I made my own instead and have it waiting in the frig until Wednesday morning.It really disappointed my family that I baked a couple dozen cookies for them! I'll let you know how it turns out.I have also been trying to clean. Things like my oven, making sure there is limited clutter and I really need to shampoo the living room carpet. I am trying to have things as ready as possible for Friday. Megan is over excited about the fact that the tree will be going up. Enjoying the holidays through the eyes of Megan should make things really fun.Time for me to start my day. I will be doing some babysitting today and am hoping that I can make a few more things off of my list. Have a great day!"},

I made it slightly larger to allow for the seam allowance.I then cut out my fabric of choice and to make it a little more sturdy I also cut out a piece of fleece. I sewed them together with the wrong sides together. Turned them right side out and hand stitched it shut. I then folded up the bottom section and sewed up the sides. To finish it off I sewed on a button and a piece embroidery thread to go around the button.A perfect place to store a little money, driver licence, feminine product or whatever their heart desires.I don't know what has gotten in to me, but I am in a crafty kind of mood. I always want to craft, but usually end of talking myself out of it. You know how it goes... I don't have time... I need to do this and that.I have been making the time lately and it feels great!"},

I had gotten out of the habit of doing this and am happy to get back to it. Megan is older now and I know that she is going to enjoy these nights. At this point it is a simple activity. As we start implementing this I will share what we are doing.I don't know it I had mentioned it here but we are doing Financial Peace University. We did our first complete budget for November. We had always sat down and paid bills but never did the budget to the exact penny. It was much harder then I thought it would be! I am anxious to see how we do. It will certainly make us more accountable and less likely to run through the drive thru while out running errands.I am finding it hard to believe that it is November already. It feels like yesterday we were planting the garden and pulling our outside things out. Now we are putting it all away. I have always heard it said that times flies when you are having fun, and fun it has been! Not many dull moments around here. I have been looking for some fun kid crafts to do for Thanksgiving. I don't like that it feels like we jump from Halloween to Christmas.

For some reason the candle did not burn very well. It burnt all through the center leaving lots of candle wax on the sides. I am not sure what caused this, most likely operator error!The wax still had a wonderful scent and I just could not see it going to waste. I decided to melt the wax down and make some tarts.You will need a pan of water, tin can that has the top pushed in for easy pouring, muffin pan and the wax cut into small chunks. (I cut the pictured pieces down smaller before melting.)Place can in a pan of water (if your can does not stay upright then you have too much water) and bring to a slight boil. Once the water begins to boil turn the stove down to medium heat. Then you just wait for all of the wax to melt. You can use a pair of tongs to hold the can of wax if needed.Once the wax is melted pour into muffin pan. I filled the cups just shy of half way.Allow wax to harden and then pop out of pan. If you have a difficult time with then you could place it in the freezer and then the tarts should pop out.I then stacked the tarts and tied them with a piece of scrap ribbon. I inserted the tarts into a cookie bag and tied with another scrap of fabric and a fun tag.I love that the cost to make these were zero dollars. I used items that I had on hand. I plan to give these as a Christmas gift. I haven't decided if I will give them as is or add an inexpesive tart warmer and some tea lights.This was a quick, easy project that I plan to do again. I would love to hear if you try this or have done this and have some tips for me."},

You might want to grab a cup of tea and settle in for a long visit. Finally the kitchen is looking finished.A bead board ceiling was installed, cabinets were painted, wainscotings installed above the new counter top and there was lots of fluffing going on. I don't have a total for the amount of money spent in here, but I can tell you that the ceiling and back splash were a Christmas gift. The only money spent on that was for paint. We purchased the new counter top and then paint. All of the decor was previously here or we made it from scraps. This piece is one of my favorites.This was inspired by http://behindmyreddoor.blogspot.com/.I love that it hides my favorite kitchen appliance.There are still a few things I want to do. Chuck is making me a breadboard cover for the stovetop, I want a large crock for all of my utensils and eventually I want to add new cushions to the chairs.I painted the lazy suzy on my table black and would love to paint my chairs black. At the moment hubby has vetoed that. I really can't complain since he let's me do about anything I want. Who knows maybe in the future I can do that.I hope that you have enjoyed your tour!"},

I then cut out four circles.Next I sewed around the edge with dental floss. About a 1/2 inch to an inch from the edge with large stitches. Leave extra floss at the beginning and end to gather the pumpkin.Place a balled up grocery store bag in the middle and pull the ends of the floss to gather the fabric around the bag. Tie off the ends and cut them. Stuff the ends of the fabric into the center to hide the bag. For the stem use a small stick. I added hot glue to the center and then inserted the stick. I thought the hot glue would keep the fabric and stick in place. They will be mini pumpkins.I placed my pumpkins into a small berry basket lined with a piece of fabric.I thought these turned out super cute and they were easy to make.

I am bringing this up because the baking product sales are around the corner. I try to be a years supply when prices are at their lowest and then store the bags in my freezer. It takes only takes a few minutes for it to thaw and it back to it's original form.This bag had been out of the freezer for about five minutes and with a quick stir it was as fluffy as the day I bought it.Now I know that it doesn't need to be stored in the freezer. Leaving it in the bag or in an airtight container works just as well. I have limited store space and this is what works best for me.Now for more information then you probably need...Did you know that if your brown sugar gets hard that you can add a piece of bread? The brown sugar soaks up the moisture from the bread and becomes soft again.If you try the bread trick and it doesn't work the you can spread out the sugar (the best you can) onto a cookie sheet. Place in a 350* oven for a couple of minutes or until soft.I tried to find out the shelf life but could find none. I looks like it keeps and keeps.

He was 85 and had been bedridden for the last year or so due to a stroke two years past. He was a great neighbor! His favorite thing to do was sit out on his back porch. He liked to yell over at us and ask us to come sit a spell. He had great stories. He talked about visiting family in Kansas during the depression. He thought it was fantastic that they had fried chicken and watermelon the whole time they were there. He was just a boy and probably didn't realize that was about all there was to eat.He lived a fascinating life. He had gun shop in California during the sixties where he raised three children. He and his first wife divorced and several years later he married Celia. I often wonder how they got together since she is an Indiana girl. I never asked since I thought that would be rude.Bill and Celia were married for 23 years and lived in a number of places. They farmed in Oregon, ranched in Tennessee and then traveled in a motor home before settling back in Indiana. Not many people can say they have lived such a broad life.He has a vine growing on a section of fence between our property. He once told me that the vine had been in his family for 100 years! Everywhere he went he took a piece of it with him. I don't know what it is called, but I think of it as Bill's Vine. If we ever move I will certainly be taking a piece of vine with us.

Wash well. Remove stem ends.Slice tomatoes (I skipped since using cherry tomatoes) and onions, sprinkle with salt and let stand overnight. Rice well in cold water; add peppers.To the vinegar, add spices (tied in a cheesecloth bag) and sugar. Cook over low heat (or in crock pot) for about 2 hours. Remove spice bag.Put vegetables into clean jars and cover with hot vinegar, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Adjust and seal lids. Process in boiling water bath for 10 minutes.Makes five or six 1 pint jars, depending on size of vegetables used.I can't say if these are tasty or not because this is something that I would eat. Just not my taste. These will be put back and go into my Christmas stash. It is a tradition to give my mother-in-law and step-father-in-law home canned goods each year. They love it!"},

She loves the idea of preschool and not leaving home. A win, win situation.Although we are exploring and learning everyday we will begin our official preschool on Monday.

I enjoy browsing the isles, looking for deals and matching coupons to stretch my dollar. I usually go early in the morning. I like to be there before it gets crowded. I do not enjoy a busy grocery store.The one thing that doesn't make it enjoyable is having a cranky little along. I imagine we have all been there with a little who doesn't want to sit in the seat or who promises to hang onto the cart. One second things are fine the next you wonder how your little got half way under the cart so quick! I am sure you get the picture.I have been thinking that I needed to find a way to make the shopping trip fun for both of us. My solution was to give Megan her own shopping list.I choose to use a half sheet of paper and put two items we buy on a regular basis on her list. I cut out pictures from the grocery ads and then wrote out the words. I made four different list and laminated them with contact paper. Now I don't have to make a list for each trip and this gives her a little variety.Not only is it a sanity saver for me, but it makes Megan feel like she is contributing to the shopping trip."},

{"title": "Responsibility", "date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2009", "text": "When Megan turned three we decided that it was time to start teaching her about family responsibility. I made a Megan can do it! poster.I knew that over time that the responsibilities would change and wanted this poster to be flexible. In order to achieve that I knew that I could not put the specific responsibility directly on the poster.I made the poster and then took it to the office store to be laminated. I then added a piece of velcro over each of the six rectangles. Next I printed out pictures of Megan completing her task. I then wrote out her responsibility and then attached the corresponding picture. I covered her task card in contact paper and then attached the other part of the velcro to the back. Her task are: setting the table, helping me dust, putting things in the recycle bin, putting her dirty clothes in the hamper and sleeping in her bed all night. (She ends up getting up and sleeping on our bedroom floor most nights. We know that she does this and lay down a quilt so she won't be cold. We don't hear her come in and are trying to encourage her to stay in her bed all night.)Once a task is complete then Megan removes her responsibility card and places it in the envelope above the poster. The responsibility card is then replaced with a star. Before going to bed each night we visit the post and remove the stars. We talk about how proud we are of her for being a responsible member of the family and how helpful it is to help out. The cards are then put back on. I used the same color paper on the task cards and the poster. That way we can practice colors and matching each night when we put them back on.For each star that she receives she receives a bead. The beads are then placed in this jar.She can exchange the beads for treats, such as a trip to the bookstore. We are still trying to figure out if she needs to fill the jar for the treat or earn a certain number for certain treats. Figuring things out as you go along is what parenting is all about, right?To help out with the responsibility of setting the table I made table setting placemats. These are a huge hit! The only problem is that Megan thinks that we need to use every utensil with each meal. I have tried to explain that a spoon isn't needed for a certain meal and I get the \"but Mama it shows a spoon!\"I would love to hear if you assign certain task to your children and if so are using a reward system. It is always great to hear how others are doing things."},

It just flew by and when I finally slowed down around 8 o'clock I could not believe that Monday was almost gone!I was on the move all day and although I didn't get everything accomplished it was a good day. The day started out with some cinnamon strudel muffins. Chuck walked into the kitchen and said \"ooh muffins\" so I think that was a good way to start the day.I put up some more pickles and picked green beans. Summer is back and I was a little warm by the time I finished. This hot, humid stuff isn't my favorite. I was really spoiled by the mild July weather. There was lots of laundry done, some cleaning and I worked on a craft project.We ended the night with an ice cream treat andsome quality television of the Andy Griffith Show.

{"title": "Embracing the Moment", "date": "Wednesday, August 05, 2009", "text": "I was reminded today that it isn’t just planned events and schedules that make a simple life. It is also taking time to embrace the moment.When I woke up I was not happy that I needed to leave home again. I needed to exchange a few things that I had purchased the day before. I keep thinking about all of the things that I needed to get accomplished at home.I picked up my mom and we went to Kohl’s. By the time we finished it was close to lunchtime. We made a quick trip to the grocery store and then back to Mom’s for sandwiches.I had a plan to eat lunch, hurry home to put Megan down for her nap and then rush through my list. After lunch and some chit chat with my parents Megan and her cousins were involved in play.I ended up staying all afternoon and even for dinner. I am so glad that I decided to embrace the moment. If not I would have missed Megan and my nieces laying towels on the garage floor and putting on swimsuits. They were enjoying a day at the beach.I would have missed the girls taking a quick swim. Even though I know the water was too cold, they all managed to tell me it was just fine.I would have missed using spent day lily stems for swords and Megan doing a little dance when she picked a tomato.When Megan is grown she won’t remember that the house was a disaster or that Daddy had to get socks from the dryer and not his drawer. What she will remember is a pretend day at the beach, a swim in the pool, a sword fight with flower stems, picking fresh tomatoes and a day spent with family.Simple things that I hope will bring her memories of a simple childhood. I am so glad that I decided to embrace the moment."},

All the years I waited for Megan this is one of the things that I dreamed. I know that might sound silly, but I am so happy to be a mom and so grateful that I am able to do the mom things I always dreamed about.All of the pictures from the week are on my mother-in-law's camera. All I have is from the evening the kids put on their program. There was a slide show with pictures from the week. All of the kids had a great time looking for their picture. Megan said that she was not going to get on stage and sing and dance with her group. Much to our surprise she got up on the stage and did sing and dance to \"Get Down.\" After getting down and lifting up several times I think she realized that there was an audience. She proceeded to the edge of the stage and started to cry as I helped her down. Bless her heart! We were very proud of her for trying.Since the theme was Crocodile Dock the night ended up with a program by Silly Safari. There was an actual alligator for the kids to touch. Megan wanted nothing to do with it!I am already looking forward to next years program."},
{"title": "Bulletin Board Makeover", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2009", "text": "After opening the refrigerator and everything sliding off of the front I knew that I had to come up with a better solution for Megan's creations. Especially since we had all the additional things from VBS and the start of our Homeschool Preschool approaching.I saw a fabric covered memory board at the craft store. It was priced at $14.99 and wasn't very large. I started thinking about what I had at home and this is what I came up with.There was a bulletin board that use to hang over our old computer desk. It has just been sitting in our third bedroom for a couple of years. I painted the frame purple using paint from my craft stash.I had leftover wrapping paper from our birthday madness month. I used some spray adhesive Chuck had for drywall corners to attach the paper to the board. (I did paint a band of purple around the perimeter of the cork. That way if the paper was not perfect you would not see the cork.)Next I attached ribbon using my glue gun. At the points where the ribbon crossed or ended I added a button with embroidery thread tied through it. I thought this made it look like the ribbon was sewn on.After hanging up this up I wrapped ribbon around the pegs on shelf and tied a bow. I then glued the bows to the frame to make it look like the board was handing from the pegs.Once it was hung up I realized that the placement of Megan's bed would give her too much access to the stuff hanging up. The solution was to switch the placement of her bed and dresser. Now little hands won't be all over this.Since I had most of the material on hand this was a economical solution. The cost break down is $1.99 for grosgrain ribbon and $2.29 for the package of buttons. The total cost was $4.28. Megan is so proud to have a special place to display her things and that my friends is priceless!"},

We had it at my parent's with hopes of getting in the pool. It poured almost all day so there was no swimming. Luckily it cleared up enough that we were able to go outside to play \"stick the kiss on the frog.\" The last stop was Sunday afternoon at friend Reagan's 3rd birthday party. It was held at Bounce U. At first I wasn't sure about it because the kids were a little overwhelmed. The dad's jumped in on the fun and it ended up being a blast.I am not sure who had more fun, Megan or Daddy!Luckily this weekend there is no party to attend so we can recover.

It makes approximately 19 loads. That breaks down to $0.11 per load. I use a coffee scoop which is 1/8 cup per load.To store my laundry soap I bought this snack container on clearance at WM. I believe it was $3.00.I printed off \"Wendi's Homespun Laundry Soap\" and used double stick tape to attach it on over the word snacks. I thought about just using my previous cardboard container but after a spill of fabric softener I thought this would be better.

My mom was 7 years old that year.I find it very interesting to see the price of things from years past.The handwriting in most of the book belongs to my grandmother, Mom. When I see her handwriting it brings back so many memories of her. Later in the book there is sometimes handwriting that I don't recognize. It looks to be the writing of a child.

A couple of good suggestions were celery, peanut butter and raisin. Making ants on a log would be fun! Crackers, cheese, grapes and pretzels was another suggestion.

Until bubbles and top begins to brown.This is a recipe that I am sure originated with Campbells. I tried to find it, but was unsuccessful. As a child this is something that mom made often. She always added a drained can of peas. Since I am not a fan of peas I omitted those. Instead I serve the veggie on the side.This is the combination that I usually serve. Green beans, blueberry muffins and a fruit. This night it happened to be applesauce.I always have the items in the pantry to make this.

{"title": "62 Cent Bathroom Decorating", "date": "Tuesday, June 09, 2009", "text": "Come in and take a look at the changes in my bathroom.Remember when I posted about a shelf I got from my father-in-law? Well, it was the inspiration to finally decorate the bathroom. Here is the shelf before...and the after.I had purchased three valances to use in the bath, but after putting them up I realized that two curtains above the shower was to much. I had saved the extra valance and used it to made these towels.  The items on the top of the shelf were previously in the bathroom. They sat on a single white shelf that I was never in love with.Here is the middle shelf. The glass jars were in storage. I pulled them out and my wonderful hubby used scrap wood to create the box they are sitting in. All of the stars were pulled from my craft stash. The black star started out as just the star without the stand. The scale was off so I found a dowel in the garage and had Chuck cut a scrap to make the stand. A little hot glue and it was perfect.For the bottom shelf I used frames that were in my craft stash. The frames were very inexpensive to begin with. I think they were all $1 at Michaels. I gave them a coat of paint and I stitched the saying \"All Because Two People Fell In Love.\" I put bathtime pictures of my sweet girl in the other frames. That is were I spent my 62 cents. Printing out the pictures! This sign is hanging on the same wall as the above shelf. It is above the mirror and a couple of towel racks.I used scrap wood and the stencil belongs to my sister. It turned out much better then I imagined.This area is on the opposite wall from the above shelf.To disguise the top of the ugly shower doors I hung a valance. The signs are made from frames that again were in my craft stash.Here is a close up of the signs. I wanted them to look like they could old slates. I really wanted to use black paper and white lettering, but my printer would not do that.The signs say: A merica, B rave, C ourage, D ependable, E nergetic, F aith, G od, H ome This sign hangs above the closet door. It was a Christmas gift from Chuck. It was made by the very talented Kindra. Last but not least is this shutter. This is something that was already in the bathroom. It was already red, but not quite the same as the large shelf. I gave it a coat of paint to make it match.I hope that you enjoyed the tour!"},

A little girl that is the answer to my prayer. The prayer to be a mom.   I know that I am blessed.  I feel blessed.  There are just those moments.

It was so soft and sweet!We were invited to go see some pigs. I thought it would be a few pigs in a barn, but no that wasn't it. We went to a hog operation.I can't say it was the best experience. The smell about knocked us over and it was a little sad to see that the pigs spent their entire life in a building. One of those parts of country life that isn't very pretty.Megan had a blast \"driving\" the tractor.We saw firsthand the change in rural America scenery. There were hundreds of wind turbines in the area.There were four on the farm where we stayed. We were able to walk out to the field and have a close look.This will give you an idea of how big these things are.It was amazing to get to see one up close.The main reason for the trip was for a wedding. Chuck's uncle brought his bride to be and her son here from China in February. It was a beautiful wedding with a mix of American and Chinese traditions. I think it is wonderful that Megan has an aunt and cousin that are Chinese. I hope that you enjoyed a glimpse of our trip to Iowa. As great as it was it is always great to be home! I look forward to settling back into our routine."},

The population is approximately 712, there several churches, a farm implement store, elementary school , gas station and the old Main Street. Along with farm after farm. Did I mention I love this place?! A place where neighbors look after neighbors and the community focus is God, Farm, Family and Community.We are going to attend the wedding of Chuck's uncle. He is marrying a lady from China. How neat that Megan will have a Chinese aunt! We are staying with Chuck's cousin on their 500 acre farm.

For the last week we have been blessed with warm days and sunshine. Perfect for a picnic! Megan and I whipped up an invite for Daddy and left it by his spot at the dinner table.I packed my wicker picnic basket full of canning jars and sandwiches cut into flower shapes. The sandwiches were wrapped in wax paper, tied with twine and had a name tag.When we saw a table with this backdrop we knew this was the spot.All set up and ready for dinner. I just love the look of all of the canning jars. Not only do they keep the food from getting squished but I think they look great. I can just imagine that my Granny's picnic might have looked similar to thisI think drinking out of a jar might have been one of Megan's favorite thing for the evening!I am looking forward to many more picnics this summer."},

{"title": "Restoring Order:  Under Sinks & Computer Cabinet", "date": "Friday, April 24, 2009", "text": "I love the idea of restoring order to my home! This week I have been motivated and tackled three areas. The first area I worked on is under the kitchen sink.Everything had been removed when we had the issue with a broken pipe. Since we knew we were going to be doing some updates to the kitchen this area was neglected for a while. Chuck glued some of my leftover counter top to the bottom of the cabinet and the stuff was never put back in order.I tackled this area one afternoon while Megan was napping.  The next area was the cabinet under the bathroom sink.Megan had fun playing with all of the lotions and potions while I was sorting things.  I was able to put somethings in the charity box.  I was so motivated that not only did I clean under the sink, but I went through all the drawers and wiped the outside of the vanity down!The last area for this week was the computer cabinet.  I removed everything and dusted. Then I tackled the filing that was scattered all over the desk. Ugh!  I always proclaim that I will never let the filing pile up after I clean this area. Will I never learn?!I am loving this! Thank your Monica and Rebecca for the motivation I needed!"},
{"title": "Stuff", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2009", "text": "Happy Thursday! Yesterday was a good day. I am finding my groove with housework. It feels so good to have the desire to get things going again. I love being home and love it when my home is in order. I just got off track and lost my motivation for a while.Besides housework we were able to spend some time outside. I received my first bouquet from Megan.I just hope she isn't too disappointed when she sees the dandelions are gone and I am sure violets aren't far behind. There are still plenty of those wild things for her to pick.We use to have our yard treated. I admit that it looks really nice when there is nothing but a lush green lawn. That was the first thing to go when we started slashing the budget. Not to mention it is not good for the environment or children.After watching some of the Earth Day programs it really makes me think. We do recycle, but it makes me feel like that is not enough. All the plastic that I keep seeing yesterday makes me wonder why the manufacturers keep producing everything in plastic. Remember the glass soda bottles? I remember returning them to the store for the deposit. One summer my cousin, Rick went on a bottle search and earned enough money to buy fireworks. It just had me thinking about what I can do and why the more manufacturers aren't more environmentally conscience.I have some decisions to make about my kitchen. The original plan was to paint my shelves black. Now I am questioning that. It just seems that black really shows dust. Now I am thinking about going with white. Such tough decisions. If you have black shelves let me know if you love them or hate them.Today is suppose to be warmer then yesterday. I put off washing sheets yesterday and can't wait to hang them on the line. I love that smell! Hope everyone has a great day!"},

I ended up laying down with Megan after she was startled awake. Rest is exactly what I needed. I made a simple dinner of tacos and just enjoyed being home.After dinner Megan insisted Daddy join her in her room. I had a great time listening to their fun. They pretended to sleep and wake up, went to the store for Veggie Tales and just enjoyed being with each other.

Oh, how I love that smell! This has been on my wish list since we moved in almost eight years ago. Can you tell how happy I am!?What is a clothesline without a clothespin bag? Certainly no fun! My solution was to make my own bag. I have seen some really cute ones online. My goal was for it to be functional, cute and most of all free! I achieved this by using one of Megan's old dresses. The dress I used is a 24 month and is too short for Megan. Not only was it too short, but had developed a hole in the bodice. No longer a candidate for resale or handing down.I first turned the dress inside out and sewed the bottom of the dress closed.I then took the back where the buttons were folded them to the wrong side of the dress and sewed them closed. This is what will make your opening large enough to get your pins in and out.Oh, and don't forget to remove the buttons for your button jar!I then turned the dress right side out and sewed the sleeves shut.I then inserted a hanger just like I would if I was hanging up the dress. I stitched under the hanger to secure it.Here it is finished.The thing I like most about this is that years from now I will be reminded of how small Megan once was.Have a great weekend!"},

Instead of making one large pizza I divided the dough in half and made two pizzas. I love to do this since everyone is able to personalize their pizza.Pizza Crust1 Tbs active dry yeast1 c warm water (105-115)1 tsp sugar1 tsp salt2 Tbs vegetable oil2 1/2 cups flourDissolve yeast in water. Add rest of ingredients and mix together. On floured surface knead until smooth. About 5 minutes. Roll out & press down on greased pizza pan. (For my personal pizza I divided the dough in half and then used a plate to form the dough. The plate helped my to keep the circular shape.)Spread barbecue sauce on pizza. Add diced, cooked chicken. Top with cheese and bacon. Bake at 450* for about 12-15 minutes.This crust recipe is from http://biblicalwomanhood.com and is my favorite recipe. I love that I don't have to wait for the dough to rise.Are you all shocked to see two recipe post one right after the other? Funny what you can accomplish when you actually stay home! I am now  motivated more then ever to slow down and spend more time at home.Happy cooking!I saw this recipe in the newest Kraft Food & Family magazine. My mom currently has the magazine so these were not made per their recipe. I just winged it.3 Russet potatoes1/4 cup cheddar cheese, shredded2 slices cooked, diced baconsaltSlice potatoes into thin rounds. Coat skillet with oil and add potatoes. Add salt to taste.

If not we can start over.I think this was Megan's favorite part.I don't any kid that doesn't love the spray bottle!The pots were then placed into some plastic trays and placed in the kitchen window.Megan had lots of fun and I can't wait to see her excitement when they start to grow.Have a great weekend!"},

I hate to say it, but I am still working on the kitchen. This has turned in to the project that won't quit! I know that it will be worth all the work in the end.The back splash has been installed and has been painted. Here is a peek.The yellow isn't quite what I wanted, but I like it. The first coat was much too bright. I toned it down with some white and am satisfied. The plan was to paint the walls the same color as the back splash. Now I think it will be too much. I am going to add more white and paint the walls a paler yellow.I am excited to get all the painting done so that the fun stuff can begin. For now I have just thrown stuff on the counters. We were tired of not having a table to eat at.One of the things that was on the table was this crock with a candle. The candle had been used up for some time, but I couldn't part with it.My solution was to clean out the candle and see the crock on the counter to hold dishwasher tablets.Well, that is what I have been working on. Be sure to stop by and visit Leslie to see what other have been working on.Have a great Wednesday!"},

Sorry can't. I guess when Chuck up he went into the kitchen to get a drink and heard a hiss sound. He didn't pay much attention to it since he was still in that not quite awake state. When he went to leave he heard it again and went to investigate. Somehow the water line to the ice maker had sprung a leak. What a mess!I had no idea any of this was going on. Daylight savings time along with a very busy Sunday left Megan and I very tired. It was eight o'clock and we were still asleep!! When Chuck woke us up I was surprised. I asked what was going on and he said he would tell me when I was more awake. I first thought was that he lost his job! I couldn't think of any other reason why he would be home. Thankfully that wasn't it. Whew!We are still uncertain about the wood floor under the frig. It was very wet. A fan was ran most of the day and we will just have to hope for the best.This unexpected day off did allow me to get some stuff done in the kitchen. The back splash is painted. The pantry is ready to be moved back in and I am ready to start prepping the cabinet doors for paint. Yeah! I will be back tomorrow with some picture of our progress.Have a great day!"},

Right?We took a break from our kitchen last night and headed out for dinner at Cracker Barrel and then a trip to the hardware store. While there I couldn't resist picking up some of these. (I took this picture on my new counter top.)I plan to start the lettuce seeds this weekend. I want to be ready to transplant seedling in a few weeks. This is what is left on the back splash. I think Chuck said he has eight boards left to cut.I am loving the way it looks. He should get the rest of them cut tonight and then he will remove them all and number them. Starting Friday he will be able to start to glue them up. Then the fun painting part begins!   Slowly, but surely it is coming together.Have a great Thursday!"},

It will be ready to come back into the kitchen or into the garage sale box. Very soon you won't be seeing those outdated blue counter tops in my pictures. Yeah!The stove was pulled out and the microwave was taken down. All I can say about the stove is yuck! It will certainly be pulled out and cleaned more then once or twice a year.After the stove and microwave was moved it was time to pull down the laminate that was behind the stove. We found the original kitchen walls.Certainly vintage late 1950 early 1960's decor! I wouldn't want to see it everyday, but I admit it is fun seeing the way things were in the past.I hope that we are able to get much accomplished over our long weekend.

{"title": "Bedtime", "date": "Friday, February 20, 2009", "text": "I feel like this is a reoccurring theme for us... bedtime struggles.How can someone who looks this sweet and happy cause her Mama so much frustration? Frustration to the point that at times I have shed tears. Oh, I know the answer. She is two, she is testing her limits and she is a normal little girl.It began with Megan coming into our bed at night. Just couldn't have that because it really messed with our sleep. She is smart and soon realized that sleeping with us was a no go. We then started to find her asleep on our floor when we woke up. Really I was okay with that. We started to lay a blanket on the floor for her lay on and one for her to cover up with. We were just worried she would get cold.It then progressed to the point where she would not get into her bed at night. I would love to say that I am a parent that tells her child to get into bed and she does. I can't because that would be untrue. She was laying on her floor and slowly moving out of her room into the hall. Some nights it was well after 9:30 before she fell asleep. This has gone on for several weeks and finally we decided that it had to stop.Here is the solution:A bedtime reward chart. Megan gets a star if she go into her bed and sleeps there. For nap time this is working perfect. I put her down and don't hear a sound out of her until she wakes up. Oh the peace!For nighttime she is pretty good about going into her bed. We had an issue with her not wanting to last night, but we were firm. She cried and called for us, but we knew that she was fine. (Her door was open and I could see her from where I was sitting.) She never got out of bed and only fussed for about 10 minutes.She still isn't staying in her bed all night. I have been rewarding her with half a star and giving lots of praise for laying in her bed and going to sleep. I consider this progress.The reward is that once she earns 30 stars she can go to the store and pick out a toy. Although this has been frustrating I still feel fortunate. This is the only behavior issue that we have with Megan. The rest of time if she starts to misbehave we warn her that a time out is coming and the behavior usually stops. Thank goodness because although I know it is necessary it is hard on a Mama's heart to disciple."},

Luckily it is only a sheet and a half so it should be easy to take down.I have the corner cabinet almost half done. I am only removing the paint on the outside of the cabinet. The inside will get a light sand and then a coat of paint. I am thinking about painting it the color of the walls (a yellow)so it looks like it was built directly against the wall. Then the outside of the cabinet will be red.This basket is my Goodwill find. I will be painting it black and placing red pip berries in it.

It tends to be the room where things get dumped. Especially in the closet. Here are the before and after pictures.I had a container of toys in the closet for my nieces. They were some older toys that Megan wasn't able to play with when she was younger. Now that she is older all of Megan's toys have been moved out. The only exception to that is the crayons and coloring books. They are housed in the nightstand that is in the closet. I have a fear of stepping into Megan's room and seeing crayon on all the walls. So for now they will stay in the spare room.I still need to do Megan's room, but I am dreading it. All of the toys that have been taken out of the living room and spare room have been put in Megan's room. It is a disaster. I am hopeful that I can get to it next week.

The lights were put up in the kitchen and I can now officially say the ceiling is completely done. Yeah!Now I am moving on to removing the wallpaper.I was only able to get a little bit of it done today. It is not something that I can do for a long period of time with a two year old around. I will work on it as time permits and I hope to have it done by weekend.We plan on doing our hallway ceiling the same way we did the kitchen. We have a very small hall so we should be able to complete it in a weekend. Since Chuck already had the saw out he went ahead and cut all of the boards.I bet you thought you were done hearing about ceilings!!I also be working on laundry today. Washing all of the bedding and a load of towels. I have been feeling the urge to craft and will try to work that in also.Be sure to visit Leslie at My Country Home to what projects others are working on."},
{"title": "Happy Tuesday!", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2009", "text": "After a slow start to the morning I think I am finally ready to get moving. I hate to admit it, but as I write this we are still in our PJ's!Yesterday was full and long. My sister and family were here until about noon so that threw our schedule off. I then had my afternoon kids and as soon as they left it was time to get ready to head to Chuck's dad and step moms.They had been in Australia for the past two weeks and we were going over for dinner and to celebrate birthdays. It was lots of fun and we were out much to late for a Monday night.All of the grandkids were there which made for much noise and laughter. Chuck's dad really likes to get the kids wound up. We also found out that there will be another grandkid this year! Chuck's step-brother Brian and his wife Brooke are expecting. It was so hectic that I didn't get all of the details. It does explain why Brooke left all of the action Christmas Day to go take a nap! I don't know when but Brian is being deployed sometime this year. I just hope that he will be here the arrival of his baby. The joys of being in the military.On the schedule for today is: finish laundry, tidy the house, watch kids this afternoon and I am hoping to be able to take down wallpaper in the kitchen.Have a great Tuesday! I received an e-mail yesterday from a friend. She was telling me that cell phone numbers are going public? What? Maybe I have been living with my head in the sand, but I had no idea this was happening.Here is what Cathie had to say:\"REMINDER.... all cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketingcompanies and you will start to receive sales calls.... YOU WILL BECHARGED FOR THESE CALLSTo prevent this, call the following number from your cell phone:888-382-1222.It is the National DO NOT CALL list. It will only take a minute of yourtime. It blocks your number for five (5) years. You must call from thecell phone number you want to have blocked. You cannot call from adifferent phone number.\"I figured if I didn't have a clue about this that some of you may not have heard of this either. My cell number is only given out to a handful of people and I sure don't want to be receiving unsolicited calls. It took me less then a minute to have my cell number added to the no call list. It should take effect within 31 days."},
{"title": "Craft, Coat Closet & Kitchen Ceiling Update", "date": "Monday, January 19, 2009", "text": "This weekend was great and I feel like so much was accomplished. I have gone through everything in the living room, including the closet! Oh, it feels so good to sit in here and know that there isn't a messy closet or clutter stuffed here and there. Here are the before pictures of the closet.And the after.There is still a little more in there then I would like, but when you live in a smaller house you make the best of it.While cleaning it out I did realize that I have too many project in progress or to be started. Until I get a few things accomplished there will be no more trips to Michael's or JoAnn's!This is one way that I store my projects.Once I have everything I need for a project I will place it in a bag and place it over a hanger. I then hang it in the closet and when I am ready I have everything I need in one place.Megan went home with her Grandma (Chuck's mom) after church and we were able to finish painting the kitchen ceiling.I think it turned out great and I can't wait to get the lights back up. The next step is to remove wallpaper.I am off to start laundry. My sister and nieces will be coming over later this morning and then I have my babysitting kids this afternoon. Looks to be a busy day! Have a great Monday!"},
{"title": "P.E.A.C.E.", "date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "text": "As I was reading one of my favorite magazines, Country Woman, I ran across an article called Get Organized! by Sue DeRoos. Since I am in my organizing mode I immediately perked up. I thought I would share a part I found helpful...\"In a nutshell, these are Sue's tips to make PEACE with organization:Put like items togetherElimate items you don't need, use or loveAssign a home for everythingContain within designated spacesExecute these steps periodically\"Sure these are common sense things, but I liked how she used the word peace to get the point across. I don't know about you, but I sure feel more at peace when things are organized.Chuck is off today so I am off make breakfast and then start painting my kitchen ceiling. Have a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Cozy Day", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "text": "We are experiencing some cold weather. The news is saying that today and Friday will be the coldest days we've had in two years. Great days for staying home nice and cozy. Megan and I spend a very relaxing day... a little laundry, a little reading and a little cookie making.After reading Katy's post yesterday I had to bake some chocolate chip cookies!There were snow showers for most of the day and Megan was begging to go outside.Chuck and Megan bundled up and headed out for a few minutes. They were out for about 10 minutes. I think it took more time to get ready then they spent outside.Well worth it because she had so much fun!They were greeted with a warm cup of hot chocolate, with marshmallows of course, and fresh baked cookies.Hope you are able to spend a warm, cozy day with those you love!"},
{"title": "Still on Clutter Patrol", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2009", "text": "I am close to being done with the living room. I just have the big job left, the closet. As with most things it usually isn't as bad as you think.Chuck's step-dad was given a wonderful kitchen for Megan. We managed to find a place for it in the living room. I added a couple of baskets on the hutch to hold all the important kitchen stuff and a basket in a \"cabinet\" above her refrigerator.I then moved on to the shelves under the tv cabinet. I removed some toys that she is too old for and added a basket to hold some of her books. I am very pleased with the way this turned out. I was tired of seeing books falling off of the shelf. Sorry when I first started I forgot to take before pictures.The next area is my constant trouble area.I removed a stack of magazines to go through and just left a couple of catalogs, two devotionals, the book I am currently reading. Return to Holly Springs by Jan Karon. The gift bag is holding my learn to knit and crochet things. Since this is a constant battle I might have to remove the basket if I can't keep it under control.Oh and the blanket you see peeking out from behind the couch is the blanket we use for Megan in the car. That is the only place to keep it where I remember to grab it!Megan had fun with marshmallows during her afternoon craft time. She was placing marshmallows on a snowman. Did you know that if you wet a marshmallows it will stick to the paper. Actually Megan would lick it and stick it to the paper. Of course there were lots of marshmallows making it into her tummy!I am off to start my day. Hopefully I will get the closet taken care of today. Have a great day and for my friends nearby, stay warm!"},
{"title": "Happy Tuesday!", "date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "text": "Thank you to everyone for the sweet birthday wishes! I had a wonderful birthday. I had planned to just drive-thru Chick-fil-A on the way to my sisters, but she called and I was joined by her and my parents. Now that is a great way to start the day!The stenciling in my sister's hallway went really quick. I was even able to help her hang her decor and family pictures down her stairs. Sorry, no pictures because I forgot my camera! I then headed to my parents while Megan spent the afternoon with my sister. I had some quiet time on the computer. Sweet!We all meet up again for dinner and cake at my parents.This is the cake that my nieces decorated. Sorry, I know they picture is terrible. I forgot my camera and all the pictures from my parents camera looked this way. I thought it was really sweet of them.After being away from home most of yesterday I am looking forward to being home and getting a few things done. Have a great day!"},
{"title": "Library Bags, A Gift & A Birthday", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2009", "text": "I hope that everyone had a fabulous weekend. Mine was nice and relaxing. I spent a little time crafting and made monogram library bags for Megan and myself.Mom had given me these canvas bags. She purchased them for a $1 at a discount craft store and had given me some left over fabric from a blanket she made. I used Word to print out the letters. I used the font Coppers Black size 500. After cutting out my letters I used Heat & Bond Adhesive to attach them.  A simple, inexpensive craft. I am so pleased with they way they turned out that I am thinking of making these bags to use a gift bags for Birthdays/Christmas presents.We have the most delightful neighbors. She is in her 70's and he is in his late 80's. Due to a stroke over a year ago he is bedridden and is not really able to communicate. Chuck and Megan go over to visit with Bill and it is the highlight of his day. We received a call over the weekend asking Chuck to help out with something (he has become her handyman) and saying that she had a gift for Megan. She crocheted Megan a blanket!I think handmade gifts are the best!!Today is my birthday. All I will say is that I am thirty-something! I am heading over the my sister's house to stencil her upstairs hallway. I just might treat myself to breakfast at Chick-fil-A on the way. This evening we will be going to my parents house for my birthday dinner. Wishing everyone a great Monday!"},
{"title": "Snow, Playdough and More", "date": "Friday, January 09, 2009", "text": "Finally it snowed a little bit here. Not much really. Just a dusting, but I was glad to see it. I can't believe that we are in January and this is the first snow, if you can call it that, we have had. It was very pretty and I stepped on the back porch to snap a picture.Megan was a little stinker yesterday and didn't take her normal nap. Later in the afternoon while playing with playdough I stepped out of the kitchen for a minute. When I came back this is how I found her.I have had my afternoon kids everyday this week so it has slowed me down on my clutter control. The one thing I did get removed from the living room was Megan's diaper bag. Since she is potty trained (except for nap time and night time) we rarely took the diaper bag with us. I have been keeping a bib and wipes in my purse. There will still be times when I might need an item that would normally be in the diaper bag so this is my solution.I placed an extra outfit, pajamas, pullup, bags for dirty clothes, first aid kid, benadryl spray (great for itchy bug bites) and hand sanitizer in a gallon ziploc bag. This bag will slide under the seat in the car and I no longer need to lug a diaper bag around. It looks so much better not having the diaper bag hanging from the coat rack.The plan for the weekend is to work on our ceiling and if time permits I will continue to remove clutter from the living room. Wishing everyone a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Whatcha Workin' On Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, January 07, 2009", "text": "Wednesday, wow, this week is certainly flying by! Let's see where to begin...We haven't worked on our kitchen ceiling so far this week. The plan was to get it prepped for paint this weekend. Monday night we were both tired. I guess that is what happens when the vacation ends and \"real\" life begins again. Last night my mil picked up Megan and by the time we ate dinner and cleaned up it was almost time to go pick up Megan. Oh well, taking a break might be a good thing.Speaking of dinner... I think I might have found a good pancake recipe. Yeah! I want to tweak it a little more before I share it. I have been trying batch after batch and just wasn't completely satisfied.My e-mail has been hacked and I am not very happy about it. Right before Christmas I received a weird e-mail that was sent to my e-mail box from my e-mail address. I thought it was strange, but just deleted it. I go to check my mail on Sunday and my password comes up invalid. We get the password changed and when we get into the mail it has all of these return to sender e-mails. Whoever had gotten in was trying to send e-mails from my e-mail address to my e-mail address. The only thing we can think of is that whoever wants us to open the e-mail and then it will spread a virus. When I tried to open my e-mail last night the password had been changed again. I changed it back and there was nothing strange in my e-mail. I just don't get people!! I guess I will have to get a new e-mail address.I have finished cleaning out all of my cabinets and drawers in the kitchen.It feels great to open everything up in there. Now I won't have any issues when I remove the cabinet doors to paint them. I will be moving on to the living room next.It feels really good to be getting back into the swing of things! Be sure to check out Leslie @ My Country Home to see what others are working on. Have a great day!"},

{"title": "Kitchen Ceiling & Cabinet Organization", "date": "Monday, January 05, 2009", "text": "This weekend was all about the kitchen. Chuck was busy installing the new ceiling. Here is a during picture. You can see the ugly tiles that were there before.While Megan napped I worked on cleaning out my kitchen cabinets. I ended up removing two boxes of stuff.  Here are a couple of before and after pictures.This cabinet is next to my stove. It holds baking supplies and spices. It had become neglected and I was just stashing stuff instead of putting it away. I consolidated a few items, but other then that everything went back in. Just neatly! It really pays to be organized. I had just bought a new jar of peanut butter thinking we were almost out. I found an unopened jar of peanut butter hiding in the mess. Sigh!I just need to clean out two utensil drawers and then I can mark the kitchen's hidden areas off my list.I am also happy to report that the ceiling is now completely installed. Now the fun painting part begins. Have a great Monday!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Thursday, January 01, 2009", "text": "The year 2008 was a delightful year for us! We had our ups and downs, but overall enjoyed life!We are not the party kind of people. We started the day out with breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then it was home to settle in. I spent the day watching movies on Lifetime and Chuck worked on the kitchen ceiling.   We then spent a quiet evening watching movies and were tucked in sound asleep well before the New Year began.I have some goals for 2009. Simplify is the name of the game for 2009.My house is a disaster! Now when you come in you don't see it. It is the closets, cabinets and such that need help. All of those hidden areas that I would just die if someone saw. Well, you will get to see them this year. The first thing on my list is to get rid of the clutter and get things in order. I don't know about you, but when my home is cluttered my mind and heart are cluttered too.My kitchen is getting a budget friendly update. I am so looking forward to it. I will take lots of before and after pictures to share.I plan to say no to more outside activities and enjoy the pleasure of being home. With the pleasure of being home I will have more time for the things I enjoy. Reading and crafting. I plan to learn to crochet and knit this year. Hopefully spending more time at home will help with our budget killer... eating out!Another goal is to work on follow through. I will have a project that I begin or plan to begin and then never see it through to the end. I will be working hard to correct this bad habit.The final goal is to establish a new budget and stick to it!I am looking forward to what 2009 brings. My wish is for all of my friends and family to have a home full of faith, hope and love in the New Year!"},
{"title": "Christmas Wrap Up", "date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "text": "I hope that everyone had a wonderful Christmas. We had a wonderful time full of family, fun, gifts and most importantly remembering the birth of our saviour!I have a funny story to share. On Christmas morning we hear Megan come into our room about 4am. She has her blanket and pillow and lies down on a quilt next to our bed. She immediately falls back to sleep. Whew... we are happy parents! Megan then wakes us up about 6:45. I look over and guess what I see... Christmas presents! Apparently she woke up and went into the living room before waking us up. She had been playing with toys from her shopping cart and brought them back into our room to play with. Very funny!After having a good laugh we headed out to see what was under the tree.This is what was waiting for us!I received a wonderful gift. A sign handmade by Kindra at 3 Guys A Girl and a Prim Place. I love the saying and was so touched that Chuck got it for me! Kindra makes wonderful things, so be sure to check out her shop.One of Megan's gifts was a baby cradle. Not just any cradle, but one that used to be mine. My sister and I received matching cradles for Christmas when we were about 3 or 4 years old. Here is the before picture.After a coat of paint and some handmade bedding it is as good as new!We keep Christmas morning simple and had a wonderful time. As much as I love Christmas I am always ready to return to our normal schedule. All of the Christmas decorations are put away and I am looking forward to a uneventful week home with my family."},

{"title": "Snuggle Day and a Craft", "date": "Monday, December 22, 2008", "text": "I guess that Old Man Winter wanted make sure we knew that yesterday was his day. When we woke up yesterday morning the news was reporting that it felt like 10 below with the windchill and by the afternoon would feel like 20 below. It was decided that it would be a great day to stay inside and snuggle.The Little Lady woke us up before 6 so we had an early breakfast of pancakes.Megan received a special pancake. She watched me pour it on the griddle and excitedly yelled out Mickey Mouse!I found some time during nap time to make our Christmas thank you cards.It is a tradition to make my own thank you cards each year. This is the card that I made last year.For dinner i took left over rotisserie chicken and placed in on top of roasted potatoes and topped with gravy. It was served with home canned green beans and glazed carrots.A stick to your ribs kind of meal that is great for a cold day.We then spent the rest of the evening listening to Christmas music and just being together. My kind of day!"},
{"title": "Life", "date": "Friday, December 19, 2008", "text": "Life had been ticking right along around here. We have been busy wrapping presents. Megan wanted to help last night and this is her version of wrapping a present.She won't win any wrapping prizes, but I would be tickled pink to receive a gift wrapped with such love!My parents received a wonderful fruit and nut basket from a neighbor.It was more fruit then they could eat so they shared with us. We love the clementines! We have eaten almost all of them and are planning to pick up a crate this weekend. Megan loves them so much that she can eat two at a time!I also get to keep the basket. I am so excited about that! I plan to make this our picnic basket. I will be buying some red and white gingham to make a liner. I can't wait to test it out this spring.Tonight Megan is heading to Grandma & Grandpa's (Chuck's mom & step-dad). The plan was that they could watch her while we finished our shopping and then we would pick her up when done. My mil called last night and asked if she could spend the night and they would make cookies Saturday. We get to have a date night! Now the plan is to go to dinner (how nice it will be not to have to take a little to potty a couple of times!), finish our shopping and then sleep in on Saturday morning.We have keep our shopping pretty light this year. We need to get some stocking stuffers and a gift for Chuck's step-dad. I can't wait to be finished. Hope everyone has a great weekend!"},

Hopefully Megan won't catch anything and we will all be healthy by next week.Megan is becoming quite the little helper. Yesterday she helped me make pizza for dinner. She was concentrating hard on spreading out the sauce.Putting on the pepperoni was fun. We practiced counting and got all the way to 8... then we hit 13, 9, 2.Caught in the act! My little cheese snitch.I am having so much fun with Megan at this stage.Today will be spent doing housework and wrapping presents. Have a great Wednesday!"},

Nothing major; just a sore throat, cough and basically feeling yucky. Just enough to slow me down. Chuck is home today to get some rest. He went to bed Saturday night with a sore throat. Sorry I shared the germs with him!Sunday afternoon Megan and I went to my parents for our annual cookie baking afternoon. It is always fun! Megan was old enough to participate this year. Her job was to add the sprinkles to the sugar cookies. She only made it through a couple of cookie sheets, but had fun while it lasted.I put together a couple to trays for Chuck to take to his department pitch-in on Tuesday.It is such fun to pass this tradition along to Megan."},

They had fun and I think they turned out really cute.To finish them off I add a ribbon for hanging.Megan's is sending this with Daddy to hang in his office.For our breakfast with Santa I made ornaments for all of the kids.I bought inexpensive letters at the craft store and found scrapbook paper with Asian writing. I traced the letters and after I cut them out I decoupaged them to the letter. I added a ribbon for hanging and then wrote a little note to each child on the back.I love doing little craft projects and plan to start doing it more often."},
{"title": "Christmas 1 Corinthians 13 Style", "date": "Tuesday, December 09, 2008", "text": "If I decorate my house perfectly with plaid bows, strands of twinkling lights and shiny balls, but do not show love to my family, I'm just another decorator.If I slave away in the kitchen, baking dozens of Christmas cookies, preparing gourmet meals and arranging a beautifully adorned table at mealtime, but do not show love to my family. I'm just another cook.If I work at the soup kitchen, carol in the nursing home, and give all that I have to charity, but do not show love to my family, it profits me nothing.If I trim the spruce with shimmering angels and crocheted snowflakes, attend a myriad of holiday parties and sing in the choir's cantata, but do not focus on Christ, I have missed the point.Love stops the cooking to hug the child.Love sets aside the decorating to kiss the husband.Love is kind, through harried and tired.Love doesn't envy another's home that has coordinated Christmas china and table linens.Love doesn't yell at the kids to get out of the way.Love doesn't give only to those who are able to give in return, but rejoices in giving to those who can't.Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.Love never fails. Video games will break, pearl necklaces will be lost, golf clubs will rust... but giving the gift of love will endure. ~Author Unknown~"},

It was so fun!Angie had a box breakfast for the kids. The doughnuts were a hit with all the kids!Megan did so well sitting on Santa's lap. Chuck was able to get so many good shots that it was hard to pick just one.Santa was very generous and brought everyone an early Christmas present.It is heartwarming to watch the girls start to develop friendships.We wanted to get a picture of all the girls with Santa, but by this time they were over it! A picture with the mom's was the best we could do.Thanks Angie, John & Ava for hosting such a fun morning!"},
{"title": "Build a Bear", "date": "Thursday, December 04, 2008", "text": "Chuck called yesterday and suggested that we head to the mall for dinner and take Megan to build a bear. Sounded great to me!Our first stop was TGI Fridays. Yum!After a great dinner we headed to Build a Bear. Megan wasn't sure what was going on when she was filling up the bear. After we moved on to the grooming area she started to have fun.If we would have let her I think she would've stayed in this area all night. We picked out clothes that made her bear a ballerina and moved on to the naming station. She thought Bear was an appropriate name for a bear.After Daddy and Megan finished Bear's birth certificate we headed off to a few more stores. It was so nice. The mall wasn't crowded and we were able to enjoy the music and the beautiful decorations. Thanks for a great evening Chuck!"},
{"title": "Whatcha Workin' On Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, December 03, 2008", "text": "Yesterday was a great day. I spent the entire day at home. I didn't even go out to get the mail. I did some light housework and a little bit of decorating. I am almost done. I just need to put the garland up on the kitchen cabinets. That will require Chuck's assistance. Maybe that will be done this evening.After losing Baby Jesus for a few hours this afternoon I decided I wasn't going to do much more decorating. Never a dull moment with a two year old helper!My cookie jar was empty so I whipped up some Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies.I don't know what happened but when you hear your little tester say \"no smell good\" and your big tester ask \"what did you do different to these?\" it is not good. I make these all the time and have no idea why these did not turn out. Oh well, I'll just have to make a new batch of cookies today.I have also been making stars.I have one more to finish sewing and then they need to be stuffed. I am missing the cord to my sewing machine so I have been had sewing these by hand. Chuck will be making a little wooden box for these. The plan is to paint the box black and distress it. I will then place the stars inside as a gift for my sister.Stop by and visit Leslie at My Country Home to see what everyone else has been up to. I am off to run a couple of errands. Have a great day!"},
{"title": "Thanksgiving Weekend", "date": "Monday, December 01, 2008", "text": "I hope that everyone had a fantastic Thanksgiving! Our Thanksgiving was nice, but busy.We started with meal number one at my parents. It was a small gathering this year. My sister and her family and then my uncle and his daughter were there. After dinner the kids had a coloring contest.We then headed to my mother-in-law's for dinner number two. I ate very little there. Just enough so I didn't offend anyone! It was a long day. We left the house about 10:30 and didn't get home until 8. Megan was exhausted. She fell asleep in the car and we were able to slide her into bed without her waking up.Friday we started decorating. Unfortunately I didn't get far. The tree is up, but still needs a little more. Megan had fun \"helping.\"I ended up going out on Friday. I hadn't planned on it, but mom wanted to go out. We hit Kohl's and boy was it busy! The line from all the way to the back of the store. Luckily everyone was patient and even held places in line so you could do a little more shopping while you waited.Saturday night we able to attend a private party at The Children's Museum. We had such a great time!I ended up getting an early Christmas present from my parents. Want to see?Twenty four packages of pine tongue and groove paneling! It is going to be my new kitchen ceiling! It was on sale buy one package get one free so it was a great deal. I have been wanting this for a while and am so excited! Chuck is on vacation from Christmas Eve until after the New Year and is planning to start the installation then. I can't wait!Today I plan to get the house back in order so that I can continue to decorate. Have a great Monday!"},

Hubby hates when I let that happen... and I do it all the time. Not only the camera but my cell phone also. I don't know why I always let it happen!Saturday we had a lazy morning and I was treated to breakfast. Chuck made eggs, bacon & toast. Yummy! I love breakfast, especially when I haven't cooked it! We then went to one of my favorite places... Lowes! I know some people don't get that I love home improvement stores. I see all of the wonder potential projects! We priced wainscoting for my kitchen back splash, picked up paint samples for my cabinets and looked at counter tops. I won't get my dream counter top, but Chuck thinks we might be able to swing a much less expensive one. Anything has to be better then the 1980's blue!Megan hung out with my sister's family Saturday afternoon and Chuck and I wrapped Megan's Christmas presents. Sunday afternoon I moved some things around in the living room to make room for the tree. I can't tell you how excited I am about Christmas this year. I won't start decorating until Friday. Just because Chuck hasn't brought up the decorations yet!I hope that we have cut grass for the last time this year. The leaves have been so late in coming down. Chuck spent a good part of Sunday afternoon outside picking up leaves. It was funny to see Megan out jumping in the leaves wearing her hat, gloves, winter coat and snow pants! We ended the day by enjoying hot chocolate. A first for Megan.I am looking forward to laundry, cleaning and hopefully a little crafting today. Have a great Monday."},

Instead of using a straw to make the hole I cut out a freehand heart.I wrote her name and age on the back of the ornament. I plan to give it out as a gift.

I am just grateful that I am able to do laundry again.I have also been working on my garland.I ran out of a couple types of fabric and had to make a run to JoAnn's last night. I was just heartbroken to have to go to that store!My goal is to cut the fabric today and have it complete by Friday.I also bought fabric to make a star for the top of the Christmas tree. I had a cheap plastic one that was broke last year when I unpacked the Christmas stuff. I have a vision of what I want. I just hope it comes out how I envision it!I would like to make some ornaments for the tree, but I am not sure if there will be time before next weekend.

I took a nap today so it was fun for me!After resting we made our blessing wreath. (Sorry about the picture, I couldn't get Megan to stand still!)I had traced my little blessings hand before nap and had the hand prints cut out. I took a paper plate and cut out the center to make the wreath frame. Megan then \"painted\" glue onto the back of her hand print and I helped her place it on the plate.If she were a little older we would have written our blessing on each hand, but since she is two this is our version. She is proud of her wreath and had fun, which is the point.Finally our drain pipe will be replaced! I can't wait to do laundry at home. So tomorrow I will be inviting the plumbers in for the day.I was unable to make the banana cookies because the bananas were very brown once they thawed. Yuck! I will be making a quick batch of cookies in the morning to share with the plumbers tomorrow.I have had a great time making my home a haven this week. A huge thanks to Monica for the inspiration!After spending all day yesterday at my parents doing laundry I am ready for a fun day at home! Rain is in the forecast and unless the weekly sale fliers tempt me I plan to stay home all day.Today's plan:*finish putting laundry away*do walk through to make sure everything is tidyNow for all the fun things Megan and I will do!*make a blessing wreath*bake banana cookies*snuggle under a warm blanket and read as long as Megan desires*weather permitting, take a walk while getting the mail*enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with lots of marshmallows!Be sure to stop by Monica's to see how others are spending their fun day!"},

You know jumping into the pile and throwing the leaves in the air. A great time was had by all, even those of us watching the fun.We have gone for long walks and collected more leaves then I know what to do with.We spent a fun afternoon making collages yesterday.I have also been getting my Christmas cards together. I looked at the calendar and realized that there is only three weeks until Thanksgiving! I have a tradition of mailing out my cards the day after Thanksgiving. I still need to get the family picture taken, write the family letter and double check the mailing addresses. Yikes!I plan to sit down this weekend and make a list of things to do.

{"title": "Life's Bump", "date": "Wednesday, November 05, 2008", "text": "What do you do when life gets a little bumpy? For me the only thing to do is climb over the bump and just keep going. Well, we have a bump in the road at the moment.I had noticed a smell like rotten eggs while doing laundry and then while weeding I noticed a wet spot by the house. Hubby dug up the area that was damp and we ran the washer.... water poured out the cinder block foundation of the house.We had a plumber come out and with an estimate of about $3000 we went to plan B. Plan B is that we (meaning hubby) takes care of it. Plan B was to remove a wall of cabinets jack hammer up the floor and replace the broken drain pipe.After Chuck's step dad came over tonight we are on to Plan C. The new plan is to only tear up the floor under the kitchen sink and then run a new pipe outside of the house. The only downside is that some of the concert on my wonderful back porch has to be removed. Although that is a bummer at least the pipe can be repaired with minimal disruption to the kitchen.Speaking of the kitchen. I removed some wallpaper today. Look at my wonderful wall behind my counter top.Yuck! I am sure that about 1986 that was one hot looking kitchen, but not so much anymore. We are talking about removing the back splash, but that involves lots of work and if I do that I would want a new counter top, but not sure if that is the budget.The solution may be to just wallpaper again. Stay tuned for more fun from the kitchen!"},

We have dinner and then take the kids out. It is fun to be back in a familiar spot. My sister and I were talking about how many times we had walked those streets as kids.Saturday morning it was grocery time.My little helper was scanning the ads for the best deals. WalMart is already playing Christmas music! I guess that I shouldn't be surprised, but what happened Thanksgiving. I remember going to the grocery store as a kid and seeing the turkey decorations go up after Halloween.Every minute that we were home this weekend was spent outside. All of the flower beds, window boxes and the garden have been cleaned out. The back porch furniture was been put away for the winter and when this warm spell ends we will put all of the outside toys away. There are a few other small things left to do, but since the next couple of days are suppose to be nice we should be able to complete them in the evening.As sad as I am to see the season end it is satisfying to know that things outside are secure for winter. With the time change it is a reminder that winter will be here soon. It was dark by 6:15 tonight. In our area of Indiana were I live this is only the second year for changing time.Since I spent so much time outside I have some housework to catch up on. Have a great day!"},

After that she had no problem.She enjoys going out to light her pumpkin each night.We roasted the seeds.Megan had fun cleaning and salting the seeds, but didn't care for the taste.I think this was the highlight of the week. I couldn't find my pumpkin cookie cutter so I just made circles.Chuck and I ended up frosting most of the cookies. Megan was happy with just one cookie.

We connected during our 10 year reunion and well... the rest is history.2. I was born an Army brat at Ft Leonard Wood, Mo.3. I don't like tomatoes, but I do like tomato based foods.4. I use to drink at least a six pack of Diet Coke a day. It was hard, but I broke the habit. I now only have a Diet Coke if I am in a restaurant.5. My former job was investigating credit reports for mortgage companies. I was the lucky person who got to call people and tell them they had unpaid collections on their credit report. Not fun!!6. I am a quiet person. I am not good at small talk.7. My favorite home task is cutting grass. I love the smell of fresh cut grass and the peace of being alone with my thoughts for a little while.Now I am suppose to tag 7 other people.

Monday was spent doing laundry and all of those fun household chores. I do most of my laundry on Monday, with sheets and towels on Wednesdays. I will run a load of clothes on Wednesday and Friday if I have enough for a load. Since I keep up pretty good on the laundry I had forgotten how much work it is when you just do it once a week. I felt like I was never going to finish up the laundry on Monday.Tuesday was spent doing yard work. Megan and I went out and picked up pine cones in the afternoon. Then grandma stopped by and Megan went with her to see grandpa and have dinner. Chuck and I used this time to cut grass. We then hit the Chick-fil-A drive thru and stopped by the bookstore on our way to pick up Megan.I hadn't been to the bookstore in a while. I could have spent a fortune there!Today was spent cleaning out my closet and crafting. I am using some of the collected pine cones to make a wreath for my front door. I had Chuck cut out a large circle out of cardboard to use as the base for the wreath.I then started to glue on the pine cones with my handy glue gun.This is what I have completed so far:The plan is to add a large homespun bow and hang it on my front door as my Christmas wreath. I usually like to hang a wreath of fresh greens, but I am trying to cut back on spending. You can't beat a wreath that is well... free!Once I have it complete I will post a picture.

We stay at an Indiana State Park Inn and it is fabulous!It is fire prevention month so the inn had a huge Smokey the Bear in the lobby. Megan loved him! She had to go say Hi every morning and goodnight in the evening.We took some long drives in the country. I know some think this is weird, but we love to explore old cemeteries. We found a little country church in the middle of no where a cemetery is on the church grounds. We spent a good portion of the afternoon exploring. The oldest birth we found was 1775. They are in the process of replacing some of the old stones. I feel it is so important to preserve our past!There is a pioneer village in the park. We had a great time exploring it. I thought this cabin was so cute!Can you imagine a winter in a space this small? I certainly can't, but what a cute vacation spot this would be.We wanted to attend the church service at the pioneer village chapel, but were not able to make the 8:30 service. Maybe next year.We split for dinner one evening and took three of our nieces. We found a great picnic spot for dinner and then the kids had a good time running around and exploring the area.

Oh well, it is done and I am pleased.An unexpected expense and task this weekend was a new starter on Chuck's truck. It hadn't been starting correctly and sometimes would take several tries to get it going. He took it apart thinking that the connections might just need to be cleaned. One thing lead to another and he ended up installing a new one. I am just grateful that he could save some money by doing it himself.Megan had an adventure this weekend. She went for her first sleep over at Grandma's. Everyone was shocked that I let her go and I have to say that I am still shocked that I let her go! She did really well. She went to bed with no problem and sleep from 8:30 until 1. She woke up two times after that crying for her Daddy but they were able to get her back to sleep.

We then had pancakes for breakfast. After that I started the dishwasher (forgot to set it the night before... oops!) and started a load of laundry. I don't normally do laundry on Tuesday, but Megan's pull up leaked. I washed the bedding and then did a load of towels.After we were dressed and ready for the day I tackled this trouble spot.I only keep the most recent catalogs and put the rest in the recycle bin. I had a pile of recipe and craft books. I have put them all away for now. I have so much going on that I don't need any new projects!I then vacuumed the house and my helper was right beside me using her toy vacuum. Too cute! We went for a walk and then I did a quick clean of the bathroom. It needs a deep clean, but that is for another day.It was then time for lunch and nap time!I surfed the web, did some reading and made cookies while Megan napped.I had to babysit in the afternoon. The kids arrived about 1:15 and Megan was up by that time. It was a beautiful afternoon and we headed outside. We had a good time playing on the swings and taking a walk.The kids were picked up about 3:00 and we headed inside to finish dinner. We sat down to roast beef, mashed potatoes and green beans when Chuck arrived home around 4:30.I spent a portion of my evening cutting fabric for my garland.I have all the fabric cut in width and just need to cut it to the correct length. It looks like I need to pick up a little more green fabric. I am taking this project on our get away next week. It is a project that will be easy to pick up and work on as time permits.We ended our evening with a gentle rain.Megan enjoys watching the rain and hearing it hit the metal roof on our back porch. After that it was time for Megan to head to bed.Chuck and I watched NCIS and watched some of the debate. By 10 o'clock I was snug in bed and fast asleep.Hope you enjoyed you peek into my day."},

I hope she didn't think it was her bottle to drink!The local fire department was there and so was the lifeline helicopter. We were sad when they received a call and had to take off. Although it was neat to see the helicopter take off. Megan keep telling everyone about the helicopter flying away.Of course it wouldn't have been a festival without games!It was so much fun and we heard the total in attendance was about 400 people. Great turnout!The thing that made us the happiest was that Megan did so well with all of those people around. Usually when there is a crowd or we are someplace new she wants to be held. She did not ask to be held once and was even talking with people! She has come such a long way.Speaking of coming along way... here is her toddler bed.

She was having some of the branches trimmedand I couldn't resist taking a few. They were loaded with crab apples and I ended up with a five gallon bucket.So far I have placed some in the bottom of my Mason jar candle holders.I am not sure about the fabric I tied on. What do you think, with or without the fabric?I have also started to make a garland. I am not yet sure what I am going to do with it.I am thinking about using some in a wreath and my neighbor mentioned that you can make jelly out of them. I have lots of crab apples to use, so if you have a suggestion let me know."},

During the afternoon I was chilly so I went to check the temperature. It was 69degrees in the house. Time to pull the extra blankets out to wash them.Megan is becoming my little helper.Folding laundry is one of her favorite things to do. She is actually getting pretty good at folding wash cloths. Do you think I could train her to do all the laundry by the time she is three? I didn't think so either!I didn't get much completed yesterday. Megan didn't take a nap and I had a headache most of the day. Hopefully today I will have a productive day today. Have a great Thursday!"},

Nope. On the way home I mentioned the walnuts to Chuck and said that they were whole walnuts.I became very excited and started imagining all the fun we would have collecting nuts and all the free nuts I could stash in my freezer.I had in mind collecting a five gallon bucket of nuts. Imagine my surprise when we showed up and my father-in-law had already collected a 32 gallon trash can full!I can't believe that I never knew that he had walnut trees!

My thought was to combine our two likes. I used my family recipe for applesauce cake and added the cocoa powder and chocolate chips. This applesauce cake recipe is from my grandmother. It is a very moist cake and I have many memories of this cake... Aunt Dianne making it while we visited my family in Virgina...

Oh, how sweet that was! It was my last week to watch my niece and nephew so we were busy with the kids. Lots of fun outside playtime.I have many things on my to do list this week. Here is a peek at what I will be doing today:Although my week is already packed full of things to do I am looking forward to it. I am hopeful that I will gets many projects well on their way.

The play area is even fenced in!Grandma and Grandpa (Chuck's mom and step-dad) live nearby and were happy to stop by and play!This was the hit of our time there.Someone had brought their bunny to play. Megan had never seen a real bunny and was very happy to love on this bunny.A great way to spend the afternoon!I will start with the positive stuff. Remember this post about bedtime? Things have really improved. We are turning on a nightlight when we enter her room and leaving it on until we go in to check on her. We are also allowing her to pick two books from her bookshelf. We then sit her in bed instead of laying her down. We then tell her to read to her friends.She happily goes to bed for the evening and nap time. We don't hear a peek out of her once we put her in bed. Thanks to everyone who left comments with suggestions and encouragement!Now that not so great, but expected news. Grandma Gerry passed away Saturday afternoon. We expected it and received a call Saturday afternoon that she was going to be removed from the ventilator.This week will be busy. It is the last week to keep my niece and nephew. The showing is Tuesday night and the funeral is on Wednesday. So, it I am scarce this week you'll know why. Have a great week!"},

She was hospitalized due to pneumonia. She is not doing well at all. In the past two days her breathing has become very labored. The doctors are saying that the ventilator is basically breathing for her. She is on a very strong antibiotic and if she is not showing improvement with her breathing by Tuesday she will be removed from the ventilator.If that wasn't bad enough we were also informed that the she has cancer of the liver. She had been treated for cancer of the pancreas last year. The conclusion is that if she doesn't pass away from complications of the pneumonia then we will lose her to the cancer. The cancer doctor said that chemo will not help her this time and that given her weakened state that the cancer will spread quickly.Our one consolation in all this is that Gerry has strong faith and we know that when her time comes she will be going home to her Heavenly Father. Please pray that Gerry does not suffer and that the aching hearts of those who love her will be healed quickly."},

I never really thought about how great it is to push that button and have access to the house and garage.I received a call today from my cousin's wife. She had received some clothes from my recent garage sale for her granddaughter. She was going on and on about how they were the best clothes she has ever gotten from a garage sale and ended up asking if I had any clothes left. Why yes. I was able to sell everything of Megan's that was left over from the sale. She is ending up with something like 7 paperboxes of clothes. I am so happy! (And so is Chuck since we won't have to store it until next year!)I recently found out that I will no longer be caring for my niece and nephew. I currently have them four days a week. I have mixed emotions about them no longer coming. I am sad that Megan will lose her playmate and the extra money has been really nice. Since they arrive at 6:30 in the morning it has made for some long days. I have also had a few difficult moments because they parent very different then we do. I will miss them, but it is always better when mom can stay home. Since I was pre-paid through the end of the month she decided to work until then.I have a busy day planned for today. Baking some banana and zucchini bread. Some for my father-in-law and some for the freezer. There is tons of branches and pine cones that have to be picked up before the grass can be cut. Thanks Ike!

Rain is in the forecast for the entire weekend so we were trying to beat the rain by attending last night.There were sprinkles on the drive there and then a steady rain when we first arrived. Luckily it didn't last long.One thing I love about this festival is that it is local. You can get a hot dog and ribeye sandwich from the local Little League. Pulled Pork sandwiches from the local fire department and grilled corn on the cob from the town's United Methodist Church.Most places were you spend the money it is going right back into the community. We ran into people we know and someone from a booth even called Chuck by name to say Hi! This is exactly the way I picture it in Mitford!Megan played a couple of games and then we headed home. There will be a parade on Saturday, but due to the rain I don't think it will take place. My hope is that while growing up Megan will develop as many fond memories of this festival as I have."},

It makes me snuggle further under the covers and I feel all cozy. I love that feeling!Another thing this weather does to me is make me want to clean. Not just dust and vacuum, but to clean things out. I have a list a mile long of areas to declutter. Having the windows open and a cool breeze blowing through the house really motivates me.I like to give the house a good cleaning and to thin things out before winter. Our home is not large and if there is too much stuff I start to really feel the walls closing in during the winter.I plan to start tackling my list today. I will let you know how it is going.

She still is, but putting her to bed is becoming an issue.Megan goes to bed about eight. We have a routine of brushing her teeth, she helps Daddy shut her blinds, pray and then into bed. She is having moments of not wanting to get into bed. The moments are becoming more frequent.Over the weekend we had an issue with nap. She refused to go down. We tried to put her in her crib and she was crying and saying no and just carrying on. We were trying all the tricks and nothing was working. I ended up caving and put her on the couch for nap. She went right to sleep.The last two nights we have had the same drama. This time we did not remove her from the crib. We did the let her cry it out thing. It was breaking my heart! I was ready to go get her but Chuck keep telling me that if we did then she would continue to throw a fit knowing we would come and get her. I know that he is correct, but still this Mama did not like it.We are wondering if she needs to be moved out of the crib. We can remove the front and it becomes a toddler bed. She is now 26 months and I know in my head that it is probably time. Telling my heart it is time is another thing. Megan will be my only child and having her leave the crib means I have to let my baby go! I know that sounds crazy.Do you think that moving her out of the crib will help? Any suggestions?

Surprising what you can hear when the tv is off and there is no one else in the house. The tick tock of the clock, the ice maker filling up with water and sweet, sweet silence.I headed to bed at 7:30 with a book in hand and enjoyed my peace and quiet. How refreshing it is for the soul!

I was telling Megan to give the book back when we heard a crash and glass breaking.We both froze and looked at each other. I said I think it came from the garage. Boy was I scared! We have had a few incidents of trouble in the neighborhood and my first thought was someone was breaking in.Shannon's husband is a police officer and she was had his number ready to call and I had my phone and had 911 punched. I still can't believe I was this brave... I had all the kids stand by Shannon and opened the door to the garage!I never expected to see this!It was a hot day and Shannon had left her van running. I guess she didn't put it in park and somehow after a few minutes of sitting it rolled into our garage door!She is completely embarrassed and can't believe that she did not put the van in park. Neither, Chuck or I are mad about this. It was an accident. We made sure to tell her that several times.The good news is that we are both insured with the same company. That should make it much simpler. At least I hope.Chuck removed the door last night and boarded it up. So even though we don't have a door we are nice and secure.As much of a pain as it will be to get estimates and such I am grateful.Grateful that she had parked so she was in the center of the garage door. Can you imagine the damage if she had hit the house. I am grateful that Megan and Connor were arguing over the book. Had they been attempting to get into the van or someone walked in front of it as it began to roll... so many things to give thanks for."},

I have just been busy and been away from my haven much to often.As I was putting up the September calendar I was happy to see that we have nothing planned for any weekend in September. Yes! We were both happy to see that. There are things we want to do, such a trip to the Apple orchard, but it is nice to know that we are able to do it at our leisure.Hubby even offered to take me to a local teacher supply store last night.

Friday morning at almost 8 I received a call from my mom. A neighbor had also decided this would be a good weekend for a garage sale and had started theirs on Friday. So off I go to set up for the garage sale.We did just okay. My parents ended up running a couple of errands during the sale and said that there wasn't much traffic out. Don't know if it is because it was a holiday weekend or just a sign of our slow economy.We ended up eating out a couple of times this weekend. That is so bad! It is a killer on the budget, but it is so nice to do at times.I do my major grocery shopping once a month. My mom doesn't drive so we end up doing our shopping together. I got up early to head out. I was just about ready to sneak out when I hear Megan saying \"Mama? Mama?\" I thought for sure she would want to go, but she stayed home with Daddy. Shopping without Megan was such a treat!Okay, here is where the gushing starts. On my way to the store I received a call asking if I had toilet cleaner on the list. Why yes I did. He was asking because he was cleaning the bathroom!When I was checking out I received a call from Chuck saying he was on his way to sister's house to help my brother-in-law with something. One of my first thoughts was to wonder what Megan's hair looked like.Once I got home I opened the garage door and the washer was going. Oh.my.goodness. he was doing laundry. Oh ladies it gets better. I walked into the kitchen and I could tell that he had cooked. No cold cereal was served to my baby girl. No sir, he made eggs, sausage and toast.The icing on the cake was when I arrived at my sister's house and not only had Chuck dressed Megan in a cute dress and combed her hair, he had pulled it up into a pony tail along with a bow!Here is the funny/cute thing. He is not a hair kind of dad. He has tried, but just doesn't have the patients. He was afraid that it might come out before I saw it, so he took a picture as they were leaving. heheWhat can I say except... I love that man!Okay enough gushing. I am exhausted from our busy weekend. I plan to do laundry and get my home back in order. I hope you all had a great weekend and an even better week!"},

Even though Spring is my favorite season Fall is a close, close second.We are back in the dog days of Summer with hot, humid days but Fall is making it's presence known. I looked out my bedroom window and noticed my neighbors tree is starting to change.This a beautiful Maple tree and I so enjoy sitting outside on a cool morning or evening sipping tea and looking at the brilliant colors.The one thing that I don't find so great about the change of season is this.Until I had a child I never knew what a pain it was to change out clothes for each season. Poor Megan has tried on so many outfits! I had her try on her 18 month clothes from last Winter. I am happy that the 18 month jammies she got for Christmas now fit!I had Chuck pull out the size 2 hand me downs from my sister. (Thanks Aunt Jenni!) My plan is to go through them and pick out what fits Megan now and then pack the rest away for a future growth spurt.While Chuck was in the shed I had my Fall decor pulled out. I am so excited to put everything out next weekend! Mom even stopped by Saturday with a cute Fall flag for out front. Thanks Mom!I will be spending the day sorting and washing clothes.Even though it is not a fun task I am grateful for all the clothes that have been gifted to us.

I started thinking am I living each day to the fullest? No. Am I providing a positive, loving, fun environment for the kids? No. I have been short with the kids and just \"surviving\" until nap time or until the weekend. Is this how I want to live, is the how I want the Megan to remember her childhood? Of course the answer is no.Chuck and I have been talking about this. I told him how overwhelmed and frustrated I sometimes feel. I told him that when I step back and see how things are I know that my actions are not glorifying God. Ouch! That was hard to admit.I have noticed that my days have been much better. I have had the mindset that I was not just going to survive, I was going to thrive. When I feel myself becoming short I pray. Pray for patients, pray for guidance.I know that I am too hard on myself. That I want things to be perfect. I really need to let that go. I relaxed and made sure that I sat on the floor and sang songs with the kids, read stories and just enjoyed my time with them. Of course I do these things everyday, but much of the time I am thinking about how many things are still on my to do list.I know that this is something that I will have to work on each day. I feel so much better when I am thriving. Thanks Monica for helping me to see that I want to thrive, live today and not wish my life away."},

How special that I was able to find noodles to represent the Birds Nest!It so yummy and we even used chopsticks to eat. Which was comical. I stink at using chopsticks. Thank goodness they pulled out the forks while we were in China! Megan even tried using chopsticks. Look at that concentration. She finally gave up and went back to eating her noodles with a fork or her fingers.Since this was such a special dinner I pulled out Megan's tea set. The province that she is from is know for their porcelain so while in China we purchased her a hand painted tea set.Megan loves tea and thought it was great to be able to drink it out of her tea cup. She keep asking for more. As most of you know China has a very special place in our hearts. We have enjoyed watching the Olympics. It has been so neat to see all the places that we were able to visit. Oh the memories it has brought back.Asian BBQ Chicken1 cup honey BBQ sauce4 1/2 t soy sauce1/2 t ginger1/4 garlic powderCook chicken until juices run clear.

It was a bittersweet gathering due the passing of his Great-Aunt Shari last week. There was some debate over weather the reunion should be cancelled. They decided to continue on with it. When you lose someone you really need those you love near. What better way to do that then to have a family reunion!Before the meal Shari was remembered in a special prayer. Although it was emotional for many it was also a great tribute to a wonderful lady.Again we were blessed with wonderful weather. Boy am I getting spoiled! The reunion is held in a state park that is great.Megan had her first drink out of a drinking fountain. She thought that was fun! Playing in the dirt pile was a fun thing to to with cousins. We took a walk to see the water falls. Megan loved that and wanted to keep going and going and going. Unfortunately we don't have the energy of a two year old! One of the things I took to the reunion was this salad. It was made with all garden fresh veggies. Cucumber, Tomato, Onion Salad This is made with a vinegar dressing.2 cups vinegar3 cups water1/4 cup sugarsalt and pepper to tasteBring to a boil and allow to cool. Pour over veggies and refrigerate.It was hard to put exact measurements to this recipe. It is one of those recipes that you just have keep tasting until you get it right. Mine was a little tart when I tasted it the next morning and I had to add some more sugar and some additional water. I used a huge cucumber, two onions and about six tomatos. I made a really big batch.I am not a tomato or onion fan, but I love the cucumbers marinated in this.This is my grandmother's recipe. I remember it always being served with dinner as long as the garden was producing. It brought back lots of memories as this was made. Enjoy!"},

Quite the fashion statement, huh!?We ended the day with dinner out. We went to Micky D's and were able to have dinner out for $5 thanks to this coupon. (Thanks to Crystal for providing this link.)

So cute!What is it about a wonderful rain shower to take all your cares away and leave you feeling refreshed? Oh, how I love simple pleasures!"},

Chuck ended up taking a vacation day and we were busy all day long.I have the gate flag almost done. I need to paint on the star and then seal it. My problem is that I can't find the pattern for the original star that I used. Ugh! I tried a couple of star patterns that I had in my craft book but they did not work. I will have to surf the net for another pattern. Hopefully we will be able to hang it this weekend and then I can post a finished picture next week.We worked on some maintenance things today also. Chuck fixed the leak in the gutter on the back deck. Slowly but surely Megan's playhouse is getting fixed. The rotten wood was replaced on the porch today and should be ready for paint soon. I can't wait to get it done. I have some ideas floating around for finishing touches.This is the project that I finished today.When we first moved in mom bought this for me. Over the years it was wearing down and needed some repair. This spring we went out to give it some TLC and the barn split in half. The old barn was used for a pattern and a replacement was made. After painting it I gave it a coat of poly to make it more durable. Red barns are one of my favorite things!Be sure to visit Leslie for to see what others are working on."},

Yesterday we spent every waking moment outside.Here are some of the fun things we did yesterday.The swings are always a hit.Running around in the grass and occasionally catching the ball was fun!A trip in the car is always more fun if you have a friend along.  One of Megan's favorite outside activities is chalk. The loved it when I drew a circle, square and triangle. I would say who is in the square, circle etc and they would run to it so they could yell out I am. Lots of fun!The girls even remembered to stop and smell the flowers!It was a very busy, fun day. Megan was a happy, dirty girl when she hit the bathtub. She barely made it to a 7:30 bedtime. I guess all that fresh air wore her out. Today is suppose to be just as nice. I am looking forward to another fun filled outside day!"},

I have had all of the windows open this weekend, which is one of my favorite things.Since the weather has been so nice we have spent lots of time working outside. Chuck finally got his truck fixed! Although I spend most of my days at home it is nice to know that I am able to go somewhere if I want to.We trimmed some bushes and I was able to get all of my flowerbeds weeded. It is so nice to have that chore done. While trimming a bush I looked down and saw a butterfly laying on the ground. I was very surprised. It was just laying there and not attempting to fly off.Chuck picked it up and I was able to snap a shot. He layed it down in the sun and a few minutes later I looked over and it was gone. We weren't sure the butterfly would survive so I was quite relieved.This picture is just because I think it is funny. We often find Megan sleeping at this end of the crib. We always go in once she is asleep and move all of her friends and make sure she is covered up. Occasionally we will sneak in and find her with her feet sticking out.  All of the room she has and she chooses to snuggle up against the end rail.  Too funny!"},

I told her to put it back before I shut the door and went on to a new task.While eating dinner Chuck opened the refrigerator to retrieve something and the can of biscuits fell out and busted open. I couldn't let them go to waste! I rolled them in cinnamon sugar for breakfast the next day. Yummy!"},

When I was young we would go to Virginia every summer to visit my grandparents. One summer while at Mom and Pop's we were introduced to this cake.It is a basic yellow cake that once cooled is poked with a toothpick and then a lemon is squeezed over top. Once that is complete you sprinkle sugar on top. Simple, yet delicious!Mom recently made this cake and both my sister and I immediately thought of our grandmother and all the wonderful memories we have of our time spent with Mom and Pop. My sister even calls this cake \"Virginia Cake.\" Enjoy!"},

Ethan (who is 12 mos) woke up by noon. I had just gotten everything set up and cut a couple of strips and then I heard him cry. Ugh! The good thing is that he went down later in the afternoon.Megan is losing her baby look and I find that very sad. I ran across this picture and think she looks like such a big girl.She is doing her favorite thing. I think she would be happy if we had no toys and only books. Well, as long as she had her Miss Bunny! We ended up with a surprise date night! My mil came over this afternoon and ended up taking Megan home with her. We grabbed a quick burger and then headed to JoAnn Fabrics. Thanks to their 40% off coupon I was able to get a new rotary cutter! Yeah! Then we went to the auto store to get a new oil pump for Chuck's truck. We are such an exciting couple!Yes, the truck is still broken. It has been a nightmare. They have been talking about things like raising the engine, yikes! Chuck's uncle is coming over tonight and I hope that they can figure it out.Gotta run. My niece and nephew will be dropped off shortly. The humidity has finally lifted so hopefully we can spend the day outside. You should see the weeds! Have a great day!"},

It seems that she is always working on something, very inspiring!I made this flag about 6 years ago to hang on our shed. When we moved in there was a dog run with a picket fence type of gate. We took down the dog run and I had Chuck hang on to the gate. I knew I could find something to do with it. I ended up cutting the gate in half and making it into a flag.Well here we are 6 years later and it was starting to not look so good. Chuck took it down for me while doing some paint touch up on the shed. I am going to give it a good sand and then re-paint it. Once it is back up on the shed I will take a picture. Another project I am working on is a homespun garland for my Christmas tree. I am cutting strips out of this fabric for my garland. I can't find my rotary cutter so I have been cutting fabric by hand. Ugh! I have so many strips to cut that I might have to go buy a new cutter. This project will be a work in progress for a while. I doubt I will be able to show the finished project until closer to Christmas.Be sure to stop by Leslie's to see what others are up to."},

It was very strange to hear her talk about Crystal from MoneySavingMom. Such a small world!She shared her fantastic binder. She uses the baseball card holders, puts her coupons in alphabetical order by brand name and staples multiple coupons together. I had tried paper clipping like coupons together. That did not work so well. I can't wait to try stapling them together.She put on a nice program. There was a lady sitting next to me that had just starting to clip coupons so I am sure this was very helpful for her. She had a print out with resources such as coupon sites, books and even places to donate the free items your family won't use.It was fun to be around like minded people. So many look down on the couponing gang. I would encourage those good at couponing to consider a program like this for your church. I can only imagine the money I might have saved if I had been taught the tricks of the trade earlier!I had been lax with my CVS shopping. Heidi helped to get me back into the game. I didn't have many ECBs so I ended up spending $23 out of pocket, but ended up with $22in ECBs. Thanks for the motivation Heidi!"},

{"title": "Chicken Parmesan", "date": "Wednesday, July 30, 2008", "text": "Yesterday I was talking to my mom and she said that she was sending Dad over with two leftover uncooked chicken breast. As we were chatting I told her that spaghetti was on my menu. She suggested that I use the chicken to make chicken parmesan and serve it with a side of spaghetti. Wonderful idea!  Especially since that is my favorite dish when we go to Olive Garden. Here is my version:Take two chicken breast and dip in milk wash (that is just an egg and milk mixed together). Coat chicken in bread crumbs that have been mixed with some parmesan cheese. I then browned the chicken breast and put them into oven at 400 degrees. I let the chicken bake for about 20 minutes. I then spooned on some spaghetti sauce and returned to the oven. Once the spaghetti sauce was hot (about 10 minutes later) I sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. Bake until cheese is just melted.I served this with a side of spaghetti and bread sticks. I had wanted to add a salad but the grocery store by my house was charging $1.98 for a head of lettuce! The store where I do most of my shopping had lettuce for $0.98 the last time I was there. I just couldn't bring myself to pay that much.This meal was yummy! Thanks for the suggestion Mom."},

We were able to eat there for under $20, which shocked us both!We then purchased the present and browsed around the bookstore before heading home. I don't hit the mall often so it was fun.Saturday afternoon we headed to my parents to celebrate my niece Alison's birthday. She is 15! Boy does that make me feel old! It was a wonderful afternoon for a pool party.All of the kids were in the pool having a blast! They had a friendly match of chicken which was fun to watch. Then they took a swimming break for a water balloon fight. The big boys decided to join the fun. It was very funny to watch the boys get blasted by balloons!Megan decided that all of the noise and splashing from the big kids was too much for her. She spend the afternoon hanging out on the pool deck.Sunday we spent a lazy afternoon at home. I pulled a few spent flowers from my lilies while Megan napped. Chuck tried to fix his truck, but had no luck. It needs a new oil pump and he was unable to get the oil pan off. His uncle is coming by tomorrow night to help with that.We grilled out burgers for dinner and then spent some time outside playing. Megan helped me water flowers and played on the swing. I then made ice cream cones for everyone and we headed in for bath time.I really wanted to do some crafting but just ran out of time. Hopefully I can get a few things started this week.I know that I have been a sporadic blogger lately. My days are full and have been passing too quick! I do enjoy blogging and reading other blogs so hopefully things will slow down around here.Have a great Monday!"},

This is a Mama and daughter picture of those from Megan's orphanage group. There a total of eleven families but only six were able to attend this year. Attendance seemed to be down this year. Not sure if it is the high gas prices are the fact that it was a very, very hot day. Our travel group had something like 33 families. Here is a picture of the girls from our travel group.

This little guy was very easy to make. Here are the directions.Take a roll of toilet paper and wrap it in saran wrap. (This is so it is easier to slide.)Put the toilet paper roll into a white tube sock.Add a 3 in styrofoam ball on top of the toilet paper roll.Gather the sock on top of the styrofoam ball and tie off with a piece of fabric.Use a piece of fabric to tie between the toilet paper roll and the styrofoam ball to make the scarf. I then cut the ends of the fabric to look like the fringe of a scarf.Then gather some of the remaining sock and make a toboggan hat for your snowman. Tie off the hat with another piece of fabric. Then cut off the remaining sock leaving just a little sticking out from where you tied off the hat.Add two black glass stick pins for the eyes. Glue on a triangle cut from orange card stock for the nose. Then glue on three buttons of your choosing. I used BDU buttons that I had in my button jar. I plan to make a snow-woman to go with this little guy. I will create an apron for her and then display them in my kitchen window this winter."},

Every year I always have a list of things that I want to make. It seems to me that Christmas is here before I know it and I am not ready. My goal this year is to start working on things so that I can actually enjoy the month of December.The first item on my list this season was Homespun Gift Tags.These were really easy to make and used two of my favorite things... brown craft paper and twine. I first cut out two different sized stars. For the larger star I used red card stock and for the smaller star brown craft paper. You can find the pattern I used here.I then used double stick tape and attached the two stars together.Next I cut out a heart shape. I could not find a pattern that had the homespun look so I drew my own heart. This was taped on top of the brown star.The next step was to decide how I wanted to stitch on these. I couldn't decide between stitching on the heart or around the star. I decided to do a few of both. I found that it was easier if I used the needle to punch out the holes for the embroidery thread before stitching. I then used two strands of black floss.The finish these off I made a bow with twine and hot glued it onto the heart. I also used twine to make a loop for hanging and hot glued this onto the back of the star.These were simple to make and I think they will look great on a package wrapped in brown paper and tied with  red ribbon.I am hoping to post a Christmas craft once a week for the month of July. Of course it always depends on how busy my family life is!"},

I opted not to try. Megan and Daddy tried but were unsuccessful. That was fine with Megan because playing in the water was just as fun.The elephants were a big hit. We had been reading a Sesame Street book At The Zoo and as soon as Megan saw the elephants she started to use her hand to make a trunk and the elephant sound. Something we had been doing everyday during story time.  We were fortunate to have free access to the roller coaster, a private dolphin show and as many carousel rides as we wanted.The first go around Megan wasn't sure she liked the carousel.

It is something that I have been doing with Megan since the day she was placed in my arms. I can tell that it has had a big impact on her. She loves her books!The problem I have been having is that Megan is use to sitting on my lap while I read. With additional children in the house this poses a problem. If I turn the book so those sitting on floor can see then Megan can not, and if I make it so Megan can see the book then it is difficult for the others. It was getting to the point that our morning story time was stressful!My solution was to make everyone a story time seat.I gave everyone a piece of scrapbook paper to color on. I then cut the paper into a circle. I used Word and made the first initial of every ones name and then attached it to the circle. I then used contact paper to make the seat durable.It is working out great!Now if someone is getting up during story time all I have to do is remind them that during story time their bottom stays on their story time seat. Less stress for all of us and the bonus to all of this is that it is helping the kids with letter recognition for their first name!"},

Oh the joys of parenthood! I sent home my full day childcare kids and call off the afternoon kids. Poor little thing! She continued to be sick until Tuesday evening. All she wanted to do was be held or sleep. She ended up taking five naps on Tuesday.Today was better. She has not gotten sick. She only cried and cried for about an hour this afternoon. She wanted me to stand up and hold her, then she wanted me to sit down and hold her, then she wanted to go bye, bye, then she wanted me to put her down. None of these things made her happy.Finally I was able to spoon feed her some chicken noodle soup broth. She then fell asleep. After waking up she actually got down to play!, asked for oatmeal and took a couple bites of a banana.So, that is how I have spent my week. The one good thing is that I have gotten lots of snuggles the past few days. It looks like she is on the mend. Thank goodness!"},

Since we are having some warm summer days I decided to use some of it up by making sundaes. 1 cup heavy whipping cream1/4 cup sugar1 tsp vanillaWhip cream until it just starts to peak. Add sugar and vanilla. Mix until it completely peaks.I had never made whip cream from scratch. Now that I have tasted it I can't see store bought in my future. Thanks to my Kitchen Aid mixer it was so easy. Can you imagine how much work it was for Grandma to whip it up by hand!"},
{"title": "Happy Birthday Grandma", "date": "Monday, June 02, 2008", "text": "We had the pleasure of celebrating Grandma's 80th birthday over the weekend. She is so funny. I didn't hear the entire conversation so I don't know what lead up to this answer, but this is what Grandma had to say about being 80... \"it took a long time to reach eighty.\"I love this picture. It represents four generations. Chuck's mom, Megan, Chuck and Grandma.Grandma is not a woman of many words. She is the kind of woman that when she speaks you need to be listening. She was born in log cabin in Kentucky in 1928 to a farming family. I have heard her talk of waking up in the loft and being covered by snow. Today she told us that when she became a young adult that gas was .12 cents a gallon and postage stamps were .03 cents. Someone commented that cars were inexpensive in her youth. She agreed but said still no one could afford a car.When we talk about how complicated life is and how much we wish for \"the good old days\" she always shakes her head and says she does not want to go back in time. She says that although times were simple it was lots of work.Life has not always been easy for Grandma. She raised seven children, lost her husband when her youngest child was 7 years old and survived open heart surgery six years ago. Although life may not have been easy she is always positive and just keeps moving on.Happy Birthday Grandma!"},

This is something that Chuck's family does one Friday a month. Each month one family takes a turn to host this event. Since it was Memorial Weekend I went with an Americana theme.This what I used a center pieces.The pinwheels came from the dollar store. There were eight in a pack. I planned to just use sand to hold in the pinwheels and then tie on red, white and blue ribbon. My mom surprised me with the red, white and blue stones. Thanks Mom! I thought they turned out really cute. I plan to remove the pinwheel, add a votive and candle and display a couple in my kitchen window through July 4th.   I love how veritable Mason Jars are!"},
{"title": "Puff Pastry", "date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2008", "text": "I have been wanting to try puff pastry after seeing it on several cooking shows. I cut stars out using one sheet. (There are two in a box.) I then sprinkled them with a cinnamon sugar mixture.It was interesting to watch them puff up.My plan was to use them as \"shortcakes\" and add strawberries and fresh whipped cream. Well, I forgot to get the whipping cream so instead I served a dip of vanilla ice cream with sliced strawberries and then used the puffed star as a garnish.  Megan thought this was the best! She keep asking for a bite of \"cookie\" and a \"straw-b.\" I will be using puff pastry again. I found that it had a flaky pie crust like taste. Next time I will try it as a main course. May fill the sheet with chicken, broccoli and cheese. Have you used puff pastry?"},

I can't wait to sit down with a glass of sweet tea and have the pleasure of reading this. A devotional book along with cute post it page tags. Great making all of those words of encouragement! A mini clip board and the cutest flip flop notepad. I am a list maker so I will use this often.There was a package of seeds for a butterfly garden, along with gardening gloves and a hand fork. Megan has already claimed the \"glubes\" as her own. After I am done gardening I can hit the tub with cream puffs, apple blossom bubble bath (which smells wonderful!) and two bars of soap. A great way to end a busy day!No worries about this package being late. There were more important things for Amy to worry about. I am so grateful that all is well with you Amy and Baby T!

It is our turn to host Family Fun Night this Friday. I am busy planning the menu, making my shopping list and making sure I have enough chairs and tables. I will post pictures next week to let you know how everything turns out.On top of all of this fun I decided to start potty training Megan this week.

I thought I would give you a little tour.The front of our house faces north so the area near the house is fairly shady. I have hostas planted up next to house.We live in a 1950's ranch so we have high windows in the bedrooms. To spice the windows up Chuck made window boxes. I have planted the boxes on the front of the house with impatients.I have several peonies planted at the back of the house. They are full of blooms and should flower very soon. I can't wait!Here is my little helper. She thinks it is neat to water the flowers. Let's hope she still feels that way at the end of the season!I have two planters of pink petunias hanging off of my back porch. They greet you each time you walk onto the back porch and the bonus is that I can view them from my kitchen window.Tucked in with my peonies is this little wagon.I have four identical planters on my back porch. I planted the same thing in each container.On the west side of the house there are two garage windows. Each window has a window box planted with petunias. Our neighbors are able to eat breakfast and gaze out their kitchen window and see these flowers. They thank us each year for planting them.In the front landscaping I placed the wishing well planter Chuck made for me. As you step onto the sidewalk it is one of the first things you see.As you can tell I still have some work to do. I need to touch up paint on the wishing well, the window boxes on the garage and the mailbox is in deperate need of being replaced. We have a new one so I am sure that will be taken care of soon. I will be sure to post later when everything is in full swing. I hope you enjoyed your peek at some of my flower gardens!"},

Thank goodness because we were worried about taking Megan. She had a great time clapping and when a song would end she would say \"more.\"Lauren had a speaking part in the program and did a fantastic job. Her favorite food is marshmallows, her favorite part of the Bible is the crucifixion of Jesus and she wants to be a police girl when she grows up. I was a very proud aunt!Congratulations Lauren.

I have two areas that seem to be my hot spots.One is the my book and magazine basket that sits beside the love seat. I seem to never have enough time to get through all of my magazines and am always wanting to look through a cookbook or two.I looked through all of the magazines and clipped the things I wanted for future reference. I got rid of lots of catalogs and only keep the most resent issue of those I love.Another problem area is the kitchen counter. This is not only my problem. It seems to be the drop off zone for everyone. This picture is mild compared to how it looks sometimes. I have really been trying to keep up on this area.I clipped my coupons, put my note cards away, put my last craft project in a safe place and filled out a stack of deposit envelopes. I like to have these filled out to save time. It is much more convenient to just have to fill out the amount. I also cleaned the corn so that it is ready to cook.I don't know about you, but I always feel so much better when things are in order. Now if I can only keep it this way!"},

I have been scouring websites, magazines and catalogs and have found some ideas. Since I am trying to do this for as little cost as possible I have decided to get crafty!So far I have completed one project. I bought three stacking paper mache boxes.This is what I did with them:I painted the larger one black and then sanded it a little to make it look somewhat distressed. The middle box I decoupaged on some scrapbook paper. I love the handwriting on this paper. I thought it looked like an old letter you might have seen in your grandmothers keepsakes. The top box I painted a color that I pulled out of the fabric I am using. I decided to make it a solid coljor since you could not see much of that box.I then tied all of the boxes together with a scrap of the curtain fabric and tied on a star. I decided that writing \"Simplify\" on the star would be perfect since I am always striving to make my life more simple."},

Step-mother-in law decided she no longer wants to watch the kids. She wanted them put in daycare. She even went so far as to find a daycare center and thought because she was going to pay for it that it would be so. Hello... not your children, not your decision!To make a long story short... my sister-in-law and brother-in-law decided that they did not want their kids in a daycare center. Starting on Tuesday I will be keeping the kids four days instead of my normal one day. This is not something that I had planned on doing. Having three kids two and under is lots of work!Chuck and I talked about it and decided to give it a try. The extra money will help us with some financial goals and the kids really are good.I am sure that there will be some adjustment in the first couple of weeks. I will need to find a schedule that allows me balance meeting the needs of my family and home and the needs of the kids. I am a little anxious about this but I keep telling myself that I can do this, I can do this, I can do this!So if my post are sporadic you will know why!

Since I don't have a sewing machine I used ribbon to frame out the wording.I also bought a discounted black frame instead of painting one.

I think it turned out pretty well since I am no artist!I wish I could claim this wonderful idea as my own, but I can't. I found the idea here. Be sure to check out Leslie's version.

I do my main shopping once a month so it was nice to have hubby along for that. It is quite a task and I am always happy once it is done. I was very tired by the time we retired for the evening.Friday I woke up with a sore throat. Not fun! I pushed on hoping that it would go away. I even ended up taking a nap that afternoon. That is very rare for me. That evening we had dinner out with my parents.On Saturday I worked on a couple of craft projects. Neither one is finished yet. I hope to get them wrapped up this week and to share them with you. As the day wore on I started to feel worse. By the time I went to bed I felt horrible!Sunday we had plans to celebrate our anniversary, but because I was feeling bad they didn't happen. My wonderful husband ran out to get breakfast for us from here. It was delishious! I ended up heading back to bed and I hate to admit this... I sleep until noon. I was shocked myself.We headed to my parents to celebrate my nieces 5th birthday last night. Kayla was so funny as she was opening her gifts! As always mom made a wonderful meal. The leftovers see sent home will be very tasty tonight!I plan to take it easy today and get rid of this crud I picked up. I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend."},

I started ticking things off of my list today. Today I cleaned the outside of my kitchen cabinets. I didn't realize how bad they really were until I started cleaning them. That is something I need to add to my routine. Even hubby noticed the difference.I sewed the ties back onto a couple of the kitchen chair cushions. It takes no time to do this. I keep thinking I needed to do this, I just keep putting it off.The freezer in the garage was gone through. I made a list of everything in there and brought food in to fill up the kitchen freezer. I am so glad that is complete. We were both getting tired of searching for things in there.I have some other task that I plan to complete very soon. I need to paint the living room ceiling so I can hang wallpaper. Wallpaper I receive for Christmas over a year ago! I just keep saying \"someday\" I will get to that!I also want to touch up a couple of spots in the bathroom and re-decorate it.

It actually turned into more than the seasonal sort. My sister has been giving me hand me downs and I had just been stashing them in the garage. (Remind me not to do that again!) I ended up sorting all of the hand me downs and getting them into the shed for storage. I am in the process of washing all of Megan's summer clothes. This task should be complete today.While sorting clothes we also started getting our garage sale boxes together. With all of Megan's out grown clothes and the junk, I mean stuff, we have gathered from the garage it looks to be a large sale. Hopefully I can get it all ready within the next month.Sunday afternoon we ended up at my parents. It was by sister's birthday, so we all gathered to celebrate.On top of all of this we worked on some household chores. The grass is cut, the dandelions are sprayed and I was able to get the living room carpet cleaned. Whew!I told Chuck that I feel like I have been going 100 miles an hour and am ready to slow down, relax and do some fun projects. He whole heartily agreed, especially to the relax part!Hope everyone has a great week!"},

I cut out the jean pockets following the stitching.This is how I cut the top of the pocket. I used pinking shears to cut the top and cut low enough so that the cut line would not be seen from the front of the pocket.I decided to us bandannas as napkins. I folded them into fourths to create a square and then placed the silverware at an angle.I then folded the bandanna from one side until I rolled past the silverware. I then rolled the rest of the bandanna from the other side. I basically made the bandanna into a burrito.I then folded up the bottom half of the bandanna and slid it into the jean pocket.I thought these would be really cute to use on our outdoor table."},

Just remember not to make your packet too tight. There needs to be some room in there. Grill over medium heat for 15 minutes. Turn packet over and then grill until potatoes are tender. It was left on for an additional 15 minutes, but we decided to remove it after 10 minutes next time. As you can tell some of our potatoes were a little toasty!We finished off the weekend with a little ice cream cone... and I do mean little.The box said kid size cones, but I never imagined they would be that small. There was maybe a tablespoon of ice cream on Megan's cone. Perfect for her and isn't the cone the cutest!?"},

We have been blessed with lots of hand me down outside toys and started putting the toys under there.  It worked perfect!Well, except for when it had rained. Because of the lack of sunlight the soil would stay wet for a long time. Our solution was to line the area with landscape fabric and then put rocks into the area.Now the toys can be \"parked\" in what we lovingly refer to as the \"garage.\" I no longer have to worry about Megan stepping in mud when she gets her car out of the \"garage.\" When playtime is over and I tell Megan and friends that it is time to clean up and put the cars in the \"garage\" they know exactly where I mean.

Cook until thickened. Refrigerate until completely cool.Beat together:1/2 cup butter1/2 cup shortening1/2 cup powdered sugar1 cup sugar1 tsp vanillaAdd milk & flour mixture. Whip well. The more you whip the fluffier it gets.Spread mixture on half of the cake and then top with the remaining half. I wasn't thinking when I cut the cake in half. I should have cut it in half by cutting off the top! I am not sure what I was thinking when I did that. Oh well, it still tasted great, it just didn'quite have the Suzy Q look. Enjoy!Yesterday was fantastic! I wasn't quite as lazy as I thought I might be, but I just did what I felt like. After showering Megan and I went outside to remove the covering from the plants. There have been freeze warnings the last two nights. We chatted with a couple of neighbors and then headed back inside. It was much to cool to stay out for long.I ended up doing three loads of laundry, cleaned the bathtub, sink and toilet. I still need to do some more cleaning in there, but that was all I felt like doing yesterday.My swap package is almost ready to go. I have a few finishing touches to put on the goodies and then it will be ready to mail. If not late today then it should go out tomorrow. It is always so much fun getting my package together.For dinner I made something simple. Scrambled eggs with ham & cheese along with biscuits. Pillsbury. I have not found a wonderful from scratch biscuit recipe yet. I made biscuits for years at Chick-fil-A, but I was young and didn't hang on to the recipe. I was there in the \"old\" days when everything was from scratch. Now they use mixes. If you have a tried and true recipe that you would like to share....After dinner we ended back out to re-cover all of the plants. There is suppose to be a warm up today so we shouldn't have to do that task tonight. Hopefully not again until fall.I went to bed last night feeling refreshed and am still feeling that way this morning. I have a huge list of things to do today so I need to get busy.

(Megan is 2nd from the right on the couch.) This was taken this past Saturday. (Megan is again 2nd from the right on the couch.)We had some unhappy ladies as we were trying to take this picture. I am sure you can imagine the fun we had with nine children two and under! We plan to take this photo each year to document how much our little ladies have changed.A huge thanks to Paul, Wendy & Reagan for opening your home to all of us. We can't wait to see all of you again in July!"},

{"title": "Chalkboard Flower Pots", "date": "Monday, April 07, 2008", "text": "While browsing through the Lowe's Creative Idea Magazine I stubbled upon this great idea.I did change up the project some. I used 4\" Terra cotta pots. They were spray painted off white. I was very intrigued with the idea of making my own chalk board paint. Once I priced the ingredients to make my own vs the price to buy a ready made can, I choose the pre-made. With that said I am still very interested in making my own and if I had been doing this with a group of others then the cost might have been justified.Instead of tracing the oval pattern and painting it Chuck suggested making a stencil out of contact paper. It was placed on the pot and after covering the rest of the pot Chuck sprayed the chalkboard area. (He helped me alot with this project. I always have runs when I spray paint.) I am very please with how they turned out. After setting these in my window I thought they needed something. I asked Chuck to make a holder for me. He used scrap wood and I painted it with left over paint. Here is the finished project:For the Lowe's instructions on this project you can visit here.I can just taste the rosemary in my marinade and chives on my baked potato. Yum! I couldn't find starts for the basil and parsley so I will just have to be patient for my seeds to spout.If anyone makes their own chalkboard paint, please let me know how it turns out!"},

Chuck made a wonderful DVD slide show along with the song I Hope You Dance by Lee Ann Womack. It brought tears to my eyes when I watched it. It was so wonderful that I wanted to share it will all of you. Unfortunately the program he used to make it is not compatible with Blogger. Boo! He also had a book made that is titled The Story of Megan. Such a thoughtful man I am married to!We have started to teach Megan the importance of saving money. She was very excited when we introduced her piggy bank, which she affectionately calls \"Piggy.\" She loves to put coins into Piggy. Spare change is no longer safe in our home.I was able to chase a few more good deals this week. (Okay Mom, you were right, this did make my blog!) Kroger has some wonderful sale items this week. I was able to purchase all of the above (32 items) for $14.77. Chuck was very excited to get some snacks that I normally wouldn't buy. You can find out more information by visiting Money Saving Mom.I have been working on a cute herb garden for my kitchen window. I am hoping to have it finished this weekend.

She saw an egg, sat down and thought she was just suppose to play with it.With lots of help she was able to fill her basket.Here she is checking out the goodies in her Easter bucket. She received a stuffed bunny, two books; Peter Rabbit and Bible stories. There was the traditional chocolate bunny and eggs filled with goodies.By the time Megan hunted eggs at my parents she knew what she was doing.Our last stop of the day was with Chuck's family.

Welcome Spring!I am way off of my spring clean schedule, but I am working on getting it all done. I worked on my laundry area. My laundry area is in the garage.Here is what I did:*Wiped out the cabinets and made sure they were in order.*Wiped down the outside of the cabinets.*Wiped down the washer and dryer.*Cleaned out the sink.*Dusted all of the decor.*Moved everything to sweep and mop.*Removed any garage item that had made its way into the laundry area.The only thing that I was not able to do is empty the recycling.

Most of you know that Megan spent the first 9 months of her life as an orphan. As a small baby she was not cuddled, rocked and loved the way a Mama loves her baby. Megan has always liked to be held as long as she was in an upright position. When I would try to hold her in this position she would resist and try to get upright. She recently started putting herself in this position. She loves it when I hold her like this and sing to her. Which is saying a lot since I can't carry a tune!Another thing that Megan has done recently is ask for a hug. Chuck came home from work and gave me a hug and kiss. We have the same routine each day when he comes home. Megan came up to us and said \"hug\". She has always been pretty affectionate. She gives kisses and when we say hug she will happily comply, but this was the first time she asked for a hug!It might seem small, but considering Megan's beginning these are major things to us."},

Inserted the tortilla in order for it to take on the desired bowl shape. I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I found that the edges cooked much faster then the bottom of the bowl. In the future I think that once the shape is set after baking for a few minutes I will transfer it to a cookie sheet. I think this would help it to bake more evenly.This is what dinner looked like. I admit that I ate very little of the bowl. Just because I am such a lettuce lover, but I loved the presentation!"},

Put you treats into a greased funnel. Once removed you may have to reshape into the kiss shape. I don't have a funnel so I put mine inside of a measuring cup to make the basic shape and then made the cone shape by hand. That might be why mine didn't turn out quite as professional looking as Mrs. Wilt's, but that is okay. It is the thought that counts, right?"},

This just wasn't working for me.This is my solution.I bought a binder and found picture holders for my coupons. I was able to add tabs and break things down. I am able to have as many pockets within a category that I need. I can now separate my toothpaste and shampoo coupons where in the past they were all lumped together in one pocket. The thing I love most about this is that I have a category for CVS so I can keep track of my ECB's, craft store and restaurants coupons.

We were given a prescription to help with her running nose and congestion.You know a 19 month is not feeling well when this is how her evening is spent.At this time she was running a 104.7 temp.

We then hit a new bookstore. While there we picked up a book of Bible stories to go in Megan's Easter Basket.Saturday morning we meet my parents for breakfast. Yum! We then did a little shopping. I bought Megan's Easter dress and a few capri outfits for Spring. Come on Spring! By the time we were done shopping and finished a couple of other errands Megan was sacked out in the car. We decided to go for a drive so she could get a good nap. We ended up finding a 620 acre historic farm for sale. If only... a girl can dream!Sunday was a day of rest.

That usually means that things end up in the cart that normally wouldn't be there. One thing that ended up in the cart was a box of Hot Pockets. Quite pricey not to mention who knows what is in them. My solutions was to try making my own.Make bread recipe of your choice. (I use the basic white from Betty Crocker.) Allow bread to rise. Punch down dough and divide into 16 pieces (for a double loaf recipe). Roll each section of dough into a circle. Add your desired filling. I made ham & cheese and pizza. Fold over your dough and pinch edges together. Pinch firmly so they won't open while rising. I used a fork to make a good seal. Allow to rise. Note: it may take longer then normal to rise if your filling is cold. Bake at 400 for approximately 10 minutes.The leftovers went into my freezer for lunches. They can be re-heated in the microwave for a minute or two, depending on how hot your microwave is. Chuck gaves these the thumbs up, so this will be a staple around our house. Enjoy!"},

This is something we will be doing more often since I found out today that Jamie doesn't really know how to hold her crayon and to scribble.To finish off the project I placed the girls colored heart into a soup can that had been wrapped in scrapbook paper.Megan would hand me her finished heart and then say \"more.\" (Her project is on the right.) The girls had so much fun that I need to find some more ideas for crafts with toddlers. If you have any suggestions or know of a good resource please let me know."},

I wrote 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 on each heart.Love is patientLove is kindLove does not envyLove does not boastLove is not proudLove is not rudeLove always trustLove always hopesLove never failsI decided to hang it at the kitchen window. It was looking a little bear after all of the Fall and Christmas decorations had been put away.Another thing I did was change out my Mason Jar candle holders.I removed the corn and the candles and ribbon that match my kitchen. I added Conversation Hearts, pink polka dot ribbon and pink candles. They are so versatile and use two things that I love, mason jars and candles! The best thing about these is that come the first of March I can leave in the pink candle and ribbon and just add jelly beans to the bottom! I am so glad that I stumble onto this idea.I have been working on a few more things for Valentine's Day. I am hopeful that I will have them complete before Valentine's Day.

I still have a desire to live in the country and hope that becomes a reality some day.2. I am legally blind in my left eye. It is due to a birth defect. It does not affect my quality of life. I wore a patch over my right eye, which is referred to as my good eye, to strengthen my left eye. It didn't work and saying I hated the eye patch is an understatement! I wore the patch pre-kindergarten and I remember it vividly.3. I love breakfast food, especially when I go to a restaurant and don't have to cook it myself.4. I do not like any kind of sausage. I like the smell, but not the taste.5. I love a good thunderstorm. I like to watch it roll in and the fresh way it smells after it passes.6. My favorite flower is a tulip.7. My favorite kind of ice cream is chocolate. Well, maybe anything chocolate is my favorite!I don't know who to tag that hasn't already participated.

I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and the best for a healthy and happy New Year!I have been busy finishing up last minute Christmas gifts. This year one of the gifts for my step mother-in-law is ornaments with pictures of the grandkids. This is what you need to make the ornaments: glass ornaments balls (purchased at Michaels 4 for $2.94), shredded paper (purchased at Wal-Mart for 0.94 cents), ribbon and scrap scrapbook paper (if you want to make a tag), and pictures of your choice.Cut your picture into a circle.(I cut out circles on scrap paper to get the correct size I needed.) Then roll your picture up so you can slide it through the top of the ornament. Once inside it will pop back open. You may need to play with it a little to get it in the correct position. I used my cake tester and a pair of tweezers to help out as needed. You then put shredded paper behind the picture to cover the backside of the picture. Attach a ribbon for hanging and a tag if desired. I just wrote Merry Christmas 2007 on my tags.Sorry for the quality of the picture. It was hard not to get a glare when taking a picture of a glass ball! These ornaments are simple and inexpensive to make.  Who wouldn't love to receive a gift with a picture of their little ones!"},

With Christmas around the corner I thought it would be fun to something special for her.I am going to have a craft afternoon one day a week until Christmas. To make it even more fun for her I decided to invite over my 4 and 5 year old nieces. They were very excited.We made Christmas trees by gluing a green triangle and a brown rectangle onto a piece of red card stock. To decorate the tree I had cut tissue paper into squares and balled it up. The girls then glued the tissue paper onto their trees. To top it off I used some star garland and cut the stars apart.Here is a trick from my old days of teaching preschool: pour glue into a cup, then let the kids use a paint brush to apply the glue. They love this because they feel like they are painting and you no longer have half of the bottle squeezed out on the paper!There you have it, a simple easy craft that the girls loved!"},

{"title": "Prayers Needed", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2007", "text": "When I checked my e-mail before turning in last night there was one with a plea for prayer. Currently there is a family in China adopting their first child and tragedy has struck. The family received their daughter, Hannah and finalized their adoption with China. Before they were able to secure the visa to bring their daughter to the US the father died. He had some complications due to diabetes and passed away in a local hospital. If losing your husband isn't bad enough this lady might loose her daughter!Our government is declining this lady a visa to bring her daughter home. They state that since the family structure has changed she would have to re-file paperwork and they can not guarantee the outcome! Their return flight was scheduled for Saturday and the mother is currently stuck in China. There have been thousands of calls logged into her home state of Michigan pleading for help. They are asking that no more calls be placed to the government of Michigan. Her senators office is working on this. The only thing left to do is pray that little girl gets to return home with her Mommy!Since I received this e-mail last night I have not been able to get this family off of my mind. I don't know them personally, but my heart breaks for them. Please pray for them!You can find out more here.***Update***Several people are posting that Hannah has been issued a travel visa.  They should be leaving China with the rest of their travel group on Saturday!2 cups all-purpose flour1/3 cup light brown sugar1/3 cup sugar2 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp salt2/3 cup milk1/2 cup butter; melted and cooled2 eggs; beaten1 tsp vanilla12 oz chocolate chips (6 oz of mini chips is all I had on hand)Mix flour, sugars, baking powder and salt.

My dad during Vietnam, Chuck during Desert Shield/Desert Storm, my brother-in-law served in Bosnia, I have another brother-in-law currently in Afghanistan, not to mention several cousins on active duty. A big thank you to our past, present and future men and women who serve our great country!Remember this post about the brown paper Chuck brought home from work? Last night he called me into the garage and surprised me with this:A dispenser for the very large roll of brown papers! What a thoughtful thing for him to do. This will make it so much easier to use this!"},

{"title": "Hard Boiled Eggs", "date": "Thursday, November 08, 2007", "text": "Okay, I admit it I have a problem making hard boiled eggs. Well, maybe I should say did have. My issue has been two fold, either the yolk wasn't completely done when I cut into the egg or it was so done that it was starting to turn gray. According to Martha this is how to make the perfect hard boiled egg.Place eggs in pan. Cover with 1 in of water and cover pan. Bring slowly to a boil over medium heat. Turn off burner and let eggs sit for 12 minutes. Remove to ice water.That is it! For so many years I have messed this up and look how easy they are to make. I guess maybe I should have looked up the directions before now. Oh well, live and learn. Now I am off to make egg salad. Yum!"},

The only thing on the list that had not been marked off was baby.

It beats all of the other stores in my area for price.  My local store is great about going through and marking down items that are on sale at other stores and they even price match.   I do get frustrated sometimes while shopping there and if it weren't for having a tight shopping budget I would go elsewhere.On this shopping trip I was looking for oranges.  My little one is a huge fruit fan, especially oranges.  I picked up the best looking oranges and the tag said \"Fresh from South Africa.\"  Hum, how fresh can they be if they are from South Africa?  I opted for oranges that didn't look quite so pretty, but at least they were grown here in the states.  I know I shouldn't be shocked that they are bringing in \"fresh\" fruit and veggies from overseas, but what happened to supporting your local farm or at least farms here in the States.  Ok, that is the end of my rant!"},

This is my family, my parents and my sister's family (minus my brother-in law who was at home working). You know you are in a small country town when you see the Amish out running errands. We stopped by the local apple orchard. I love the hospitality of a small town. The orchard offers a free apple to children, free popcorn and samples of apple cider. They also have this cute area set up for pictures. We went for a hayride. It was chilly so Megan stayed back in the room with my mom. Next year she should be big enough! This wagon is outside of the inn we stayed in. It made a perfect spot to get a picture of Megan with her cousins.It was a wonderful time away. It is always great to reconnect with family members.

For her shower I made this cute blanket.You can find the instructions here. Once I saw the adorable \"I love Mommy, I love Daddy\" fleece I knew it would be perfect! To package the blanket I folded it and wrapped in some ribbon I had saved from Megan's shower. I then placed the blanket in a gift bag along with some other goodies. You know those things you can't live without... nail clippers, diaper cream, baby bath and such. Then I included a homemade card with a handwritten note. I would encourage you to try this blanket. It was a little time consuming cutting out all of the strips. Once I tied a couple of pieces and got the hang of it, it went quick. I am thinking of making smaller versions of this blanket for my nieces to use with their baby dolls. Along with a new baby doll or some doll accessories I think it would make a nice Christmas gift!"},

Apples!", "date": "Tuesday, October 02, 2007", "text": "This is what I did with my apples.On Saturday afternoon mom and I put up 21 pints of applesauce, 5 quarts of apple pie filling and 12 jars of apple jelly. I had not intended to make apple jelly until mom told me how her mom made some of her jellies. She used the skins, cores minus any bad spots to make the jelly! You learn something new everyday! Apple JellyTake your peels and cores removed from apples bring to boil with approximately 2 cups of water.Boil for about half an hour. Be sure to stir them constantly to avoid scorching. Don't ask how I know this! Once boiled you need to strain the mixture, several times. Then you follow the directions on the SureGel package. I used 7 cups of the apple juice brought to a boil. Then added 9 cups of sugar and a box of SureGel. Brought back to a boil and boiled for 1 minute. Ladled into jars and put on tops and rings. No need to process, the jars will seal themselves.Mom also told me that her mom used peach peels to make peach jellies. I am sure you could do the same with pears. My grandmother grew up on a farm during the depression and was a young farm bride during World War II, so she knew how to be resourceful. Such fun to make goodies for my pantry, spend time with Mom and learn great details about my family!"},

Fry golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. (Use fork to press down tortilla if it starts to puff up.) Drain on paper towel. Sprinkle with cinnamon & sugar. (1/2 cup sugar & 1 tbs cinnamon)Top with ice cream and drizzle with chocolate syrup. Paula topped her tortilla with homemade cinnamon ice cream and a cherry. I did not have any cherries and used regular vanilla ice cream. You can go here for Paula's complete recipe. Enjoy!"},

This weekend I made these candle holders.You can use any glass votive holder that has smooth sides. I used the square holders because that is all that was available at my dollar store. I then covered them with scrapbook paper. Using my computer I printed out the word fall and cut each letter out in a circle. I then attached the letters to a larger circle and attached to the candle holder. To make it look like the letters were thumb tacked on I used some scrapbook buttons I found on clearance for $0.50. I then tied a piece of jute around the bottom of each holder. I did not have four votive candles so I used tea lights.   I love candles and think this gives off a wonderful little glow!"},

Brown for about 2 minutes and then turn them over.  I rolled most of them in powdered sugar.  I made the chocolate glaze by melting chocolate chips and adding milk to thin it out.  I need to work on it.  The chocolate was a little too strong.I remember the first time I made donuts in middle school Home Ec.  We used refrigerated biscuit dough.  Do you still remember your Home Ec cooking experiences?"},

I would like to get my fall things ready. Also do some crafting if I have time. Then we have the normal things like yard work and such. Oh, and maybe we can squeeze some rest and relaxation in there too!Hope you all have a great Labor Day Weekend! This year everyone will be receiving a pair of mittens with their package!  I thought these would add a little spice to brown paper wrapping.  I will be writting who the package is to on one mitten and then from on the other. Other then the time it takes to cut these out, they are so easy.  Enjoy!"},

To make large cookies I used an ice cream scoop to get an uniform size.  Once the cookies where scooped onto the cookie sheet I flattened them slightly.  After the cookies had cooled I put them in the freeze.  (You need to freeze the cookies so they do not get mushy when you add the ice cream.)  While the cookies were in the freezer I scooped the ice cream.  I put it on a cookie sheet and put in the refrigerator to soften.  I added each scoop to the cookie and pushed the ice cream down using the other cookie.  I then rolled the edges in mini chocolate chips.   These are so rich that we could not each a whole sandwich.  I ended up cutting one in half and we shared it.  Enjoy!"},

Slice your apples and soak for 20 minutes in 2 cups lemon juice and 3 tbs salt. Remove and pat dry. Roll pieces in cinnamon and allspice mixture (optional). Place on wire rack on top of cookie sheet and bake at 150 for 6 hrs or until dry. Turn pieces over if they start to curl. I found that with the chunks instead of slices it took about 8 hrs for them to dry. They smell so yummy when they are drying. Chuck came home and thought I made apple pie!Next I cut a piece of floral wire to the desire length. I then pushed the pieces onto the wire; leave enough wire at both ends to twist the wreath together. Then I cut a piece of fabric and looped it around the wreath. This covers the twisted wire and gives you something to hang the wreath with.I then added a bow and the wreath was complete!I hung these from a corner cabinet in my kitchen. I was able to fold the fabric over the door and attach with a thumbtack. To preserve the wreath you should spray it with acrylic spray. I opted to skip this step so that I could have the cinnamon smell throughout the kitchen. Enjoy!"},

I found a basket that I had received a gift in to contain all of the diaper supplies. Then we sorted out the CD's.  We had tons of then. More then we were listening to. Chuck ended up taking them to a used CD store. He called on his way home to say he sold most of them for $280! Saying I was shocked is an understatement.

For the closure I punched a hole in the back of the seed packed and a matching hole in the top flap. I then threaded ribbon through the holes. The ribbon is then tied in a bow to secure packet closed.5. Decorate the front of the seed packet to your liking.I made six packets and put a scripture on the front of each one. In case you are interested this is the scripture I used.\"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive\"1 Corinthians 15:22\"He has made everything beautiful in His time.\"Ecclesiastes 3:2\"The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.\"Isaiah 40:8\"The whole earth is full of His glory!\"Isaiah 6:3\"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.\"Psalms 37:7\"The Lord has done great things for us, and we are glad.\"Psalms 126:3I tied the packets together with twine. This will go into a gardening basket. Along with a stepping stone that will have Megan's little foot prints.If anyone is interested in making these I would be happy to email you the pattern.

Megan's group is still pretty young so we spent most of our day spread out on blankets just chatting. This is just a fraction of the babies that were adopted on our trip. There was a total of 33 families that traveled with us. Megan is in the last stroller on the right. She all laid back and sound to sleep. The day was just too much for her!It was great to see everyone. We are looking forward to seeing our local families for our September play date! My cousin, Austin, married his high school sweetheart, Trisa, Saturday evening. It was a simple, yet beautiful wedding. They will be heading to New Mexico where Austin is currently stationed with the Air Force. Wishing you both lots of joy!On Sunday we headed south to a state park for Chuck's annual family reunion. The park is beautiful. This is one of the water falls. This is a picture of Chuck's grandma (lady on the left in the pink shirt) and her brother's and sister. Recently grandma lost of her sisters suddenly. This really made all of us remember how precious each day is.We presented each of them an identical picture frame.

I was a bad Mama and did not have the camera! I could not get Megan down before we left and thought she would sleep in the car. Nope. After about an hour of floating around I picked her up and she was out. We put her on a big raft with an umbrella. It was so cute. I can't believe I did not have the camera. Rats!Chuck met us there for dinner. It was 90 degrees when we were heading home at 7 tonight. I wonder what summer will be like for us since we are already having hot days? I definitely make the right decision to ditch the list. There is always tomorrow!"},

I know that I am subject to hearing friends complain about their spouse. I always wonder how different their life would be if they would encourage their spouse instead of complain about all the things they dislike.I try to be an encouragement to Chuck. One of the things I do is sometimes is leave him a little note out with his things for the next day. Thursday was the last day of work for him this week and this is the note I left him:I could not get a clear picture. This is what it says: \"Happy last day of the work week! Let's hope for a long peaceful weekend full of joy and happiness! Love, Wendi\"Sometimes the note is as simple as Have a great day!, We love you! or Thanks for all you do. Chuck has commented that this simple gesture is encouraging and brings a smile to his face.So the next time you are frustrated that your spouse left the cap off the toothpaste again remember you will be rewarded for the encouraging things you do for your spouse.   A little kindness goes a long way!"},

The only problem we had was how. The solution was to take two metal pipes that we drove into the ground. We spray painted them to match the door (I see they are in need of a new coat of paint this year) and then put the screen door in the middle. Then using u brackets the door and the pipes were attached together. It is functional, keeps an old door out of the landfill and added that little bit of country charm that I love!"},

She put both near her purse.Dad called out, \"I thought you were going to bed.\" \"I'm on my way,\" she said. She put some water in the dog's dish and put the cat outside, then made sure the doors were locked and the patio light was on.She looked in on each of the kids, turned out their bedside lamps, hung up a shirt, threw some dirty socks into the hamper, and had a brief conversation with the one who was still up doing homework.In her own room, she set the alarm, laid out clothing for the next day, and straightened up the shoe rack. She then washed her face with 3-in-1 cleanser, put on her age-defying moisturizer, brushed and flossed her teeth and filed her nails.She got into bed and said her prayers.About that time, Dad turned off the TV and announced to no one in particular. \"I'm going to bed\"And he did.Anything extraordinary here?

All you would need is a magnetic sheet (available at craft stores) and then you could top it off with wallpaper, contact paper or even scrapbook paper. Then all you would need to do is use a knife to cut out the areas for pictures and to round off the corners.I think making something like this would make a wonderful gift, especially if you included the pictures!"},

Magi and I adopted our daughters at the same time.  We were together on the first and last part of our trip to China.  After months of reading her blog it was a pleasure to meet her in person.  I am very flattered by the things you said about me.  Thank you.Here are five blogs that I love and make me think.1) Monica at The Homespun Heart is the first blog I read everyday.  If it takes place in the home you will find it here. From reading her blog it is evident that she is organized,  crafty, kind, caring, and very giving.  She definately knows how to follow through on a theme!  She inspires me to be a better wife, mother, homekeeper and most importantly a better Christian.2) Christy at The Abundant Life is a very deep thinker. I don't comment on her blog as often as I should, but she really makes me think about the bigger things in life. 3) Sandra at Jazzie and Tahlia.  She a mom to two beautiful little girls.  Both of her daughters happen to be from China.  She has shared very personal things.  Her older daughter Jazzie is deaf.  They had no idea she as deaf until she was placed with them.  She also shares her post-adoption struggles she has had with Tally.  Just amazing that she is willing to open up and share some really personal things.4) MaryAnn at Mrs. MaryAnn's House.  MaryAnn shares tidbits about her daily life.  She has opened up about her struggles with living on one income and ways she budgets, especially on groceries. 5)Meredith at Like Merchant Ships.  This is one frugal lady.  She has a good eye for bargains and thrifting.  She has been able to decorate her home on mainly thrift items and it looks great!  She inspires think about how I spend my money.Congratulations, you won a Thinking Blogger Award!Should you choose to participate, please make sure you pass this list of rules to the blogs you are tagging.

I had been told that I would feel love for my little one like never before. Everyone who said this is so right!!What a difference a month has made. Megan has changed so much that I am just amazed. She had gone from the little thing that could hardly hold her head up to an active little thing! She rolls over, sits up and loves to jump. She has even started to wave Bye Bye.

The card said:Dreams Do Come True!Thank you for all of your hard work.Chuck, Wendi & Megan XxxxxxxxI also included a personal note for our coordinator.To finish off the basket I wrapped it in plastic and tied it with a bow.

I have been busily writing thank you cards this weekend. The above card is the one that I am sending out.I am a huge believer in thank you cards. This is huge pet peeve of mine. I feel that if someone takes time out of their busy life to buy you a gift and send or deliver a gift to you that the least you can do is write them a thank you card. Saying thank you or e-mailing thank you is not enough in my opinion. I believe a hand written thank you card is a must. In our age of computers and text messages hope we don't lose this simple pleasure."},

Yes, that metal gadget the sign is hanging on is our doorbell. We have a home build in the 1950's and are lucky that no one removed the vintage doorbell. You turn the handle and there is a ball that strikes a plate to cause ding dong sound.The bell is quite loud and it never fails that someone shows up while she is sleeping!Turn the sign over and this is what you will find. I love to be outside. Once the weather gets warmer we will spend more and more time outdoors.I printed the wording using Word and used scrap card stock for everything else. The ribbon I had on hand. To laminate the sign I used clear contact paper. I have a roll of the contact paper that comes in quite handy."},

Unfortunately both Chuck and I caught a cold shortly after returning. That most definitely did not help! Day by day things are starting to settle. Megan went for her first pediatrician appointment yesterday. She weighs 15.1 pounds and is 25 inches. The office did the happy dance that she hit the charts. She is 3% on her weight and a whooping 75% on her height. The doctor said for her to come back in 6 weeks and at this time she did not want to do anything regarding her development. She wants to see how much she progresses between now and the next visit. She did receive two shots... Ouch! My good friend, Lesle, is the pediatrician's nurse and was the lucky one to give Megan her shots. I teased Lesle and said Megan may not like her since she will be thought of as the Shot Lady!! Megan made her first appearance at church today. She went to visit Grandma. (My MIL is the church bookkeeper) She let grandma hold her as long as she could see one of us, but would not go to anyone else. Pastor Brian keep putting out his hand trying to get her to take his finger. She wanted nothing to do with him.There are two ladies that come in most Thursday morning to pray for those on the pray list. They have been praying for us since we left to bring Megan home. Wouldn't you know it, the morning we go in they decide not to come to the church!We know there are lots of people at church anxious to meet Megan. We have decided that Megan is not ready for that many people and that much attention yet. This will be another Sunday we will not be in attendance. Soon, very soon we will be back!Each day we work a little more toward a routine. A big thanks for Monica at The Homespun Heart for sharing her daughter's schedule!"},

Had it fallen the other way it might have hit our neighbors house.I am still trying to figure everything out. Wednesday is the first pediatrician appointment. I am looking forward to that. I have been winging so much that it will be nice to have reassurance that everything we are doing is correct.I may be asking some of you to share schedules as I work toward figuring everything out.Jet lag is still hanging around. Each day is getting better. Megan sleep through the night last night, which really helped us.Parenthood is everything I imagined and more. It is exciting, rewarding and very exhausting! I wouldn't change a thing!"},

I am so happy when the windows are thrown open, the sun is shinning and the birds are singing.  Happy Spring to everyone!I have been reading several post about freezer meals. It is not something I have ever done, but with our up coming trip I thought now was a good time to try it. Yesterday afternoon I used:2 1/2 pounds of ground beef4 jars of spaghetti sauce2 packages of shredded cheese1 box rotoni noodles1/2 box of lasagna noodles1/4 box rigatoni noodlesI made a rigatoni casserole for dinner last night. Then I froze a lasagna, rotoni casserole, and then some plain browned beef. Much cheaper then if I had purchased pre-frozen meals. I am sure after 17 days away from home all of this will taste great."},

In the Midwest thunderstorms mean one thing... Spring is coming!! So the spring cleaning bug bit me that morning. I started with the bathroom. I pretty much had it done when I thought even though I have cleaned the base boards they really don't look as bright as I would like. So I decide to give them a coat of paint. Which leads to painting the wainscoting and the ceiling. Now I am going to give the walls another coat of tan.Then on Friday Chuck has a plumber come to fix the leak on the main shut off for the house. The main shut off is in the entry way closet. We move everything out for the plumber. I have been wanting to make it my craft/scrapbook storage area, so why not go for it since the closet is empty.So now I have a project to finish in the bathroom and one in the living room closet. Just love it when one thing leads to another and another. Will I ever get the spring cleaning done!Check out Monica at The Homespun Heart she has also been bitten by the spring cleaning bug also. She is offering a prize drawing for all who join her in spring cleaning.Hopefully soon I will be posting that I have actually finished a spring project!"},

The great thing about this couple is that this is their second adoption, so they had lots of great information.Saturday I was on duty at my parents. I spent the whole day there helping out.This afternoon we ran some errands for Mom. Filling prescriptions, getting groceries etc. She does not drive so the next week should be fun.

I used left over paint on the pegs. The doll in the center of the shelf is a Language Little. She speaks both English and Chinese.All the toys on this shelf were given to me by my sister.

Chuck went out to shovel and hear a neighbor across the street standing on her porch talking on her phone yelling her address. He said he heard her yell her address a couple of times and went over to see if all was well. It was not, she told him that the house was on fire! Her husband had been at the neighbors shoveling snow and had gone back into the house. My kind hearted husband went into the house to see if Ron was alright. I didn't know if I should hug him for being such a good man or to yell at him for taking such a big risk. All is fine. The motor on the furnace blew up and caught fire. The fire was small and there was mainly smoke and more smoke. Thank God! They will get a new furnace and then have to do some serious cleaning.

God knew we were meant to be together and we had to patiently wait (me not always so patiently!) for the right time.We decided not to have a large wedding. There was so much going on in my life at that time having my \"dream\" wedding would have been too much. At that time I was working 6 days a week about 80 hours a week. Not by choice, it was mandatory. The one thing we both agreed on is that we did not want to go to the Justice of Peace, we wanted to be married by a minister.I was able to take 2 days off of work and we decided to go to Gatlinburg, TN to get married. We choose a quaint little chapel, Chapel in the Village.Once we decided where, it was time to find a dress. I knew I could not have the typical wedding dress, but I knew I didn't want to get married in a suit. I found the perfect dress. It is a floor length tank type dress with a jacket. It has a crochet top layer over the satin. When I saw it, I knew it was perfect.My bouquet was made by my friend, Carol. We worked together and would lunch together daily. My office gathered one afternoon and showered my with gifts. When Carol presented the bouquet I was so touched.Off we went to Gatlinburg! The next day Friday, May 4th we were off get our marriage license. At 2 p.m. that afternoon we were married!It was such a beautiful day and it turned out this was my dream wedding! I feel so blessed to have Chuck in my life. I grow more in love with him each day we are together.Thanks to Monica for hosting this. Please check our her blog for more stories."},

Any event that is planned, birthday parties, dinners out with friends, if I am going to go out scrapbooking, everything.When we receive a call and someone is asking us to do something we automatically go to this calendar. This keeps Chuck from saying yes to something and me saying yes to something for the same day. No this does not take place of communication, but it helps if one of us are out of the house and gets a call. It also helps us to keep things from being over scheduled. I even have my sister trained, when she calls she will say look at your calendar and see what you are doing on the 15th."},
{"title": "Guess What I Am Doing This Weekend?", "date": "Friday, January 26, 2007", "text": "I am getting a new washing machine! For the last month or so I would go to change the loads of laundry and occasionally the clothes would still be soaked. I would re-spin the load and move on. On Monday I went to change the load and there was water all over the place. Luckily the laundry area is in the garage! Chuck came home took it all apart and could find nothing wrong. He ran a load and all was fine. Then yesterday on my first load it did not spin out all of the water. I ran the spin cycle again but this time it leaked again! The washer is 11 years old and Chuck has repaired in a couple of time, so decided to get a new one. With all the laundry our new little one will add I know this is a good idea.Now for the silly part. What I am most bummed about is the fact that we currently have a matching set and I know even if we buy the same kind it will not exactly match. After 11 years styles change. Isn't that silly!"},

To get ready I made this door hanging. First I cut 2 identical hearts out of felt. Then I cut out a smaller heart out of white felt and attached it to the middle of one of the hearts. Next I stitched the two hearts together using a whip stitch (if that is not the correct term, please let me know. That is what I have always heard it called.) I attached a coordinating ribbon and then stuffed the heart before making the final few stitches. (I did not have any batting, so I improvised and used cotton balls!) I then hung this on the nursery door. I also plan to make one for our bedroom door. Enjoy!"},
{"title": "Our Adoption Story", "date": "Tuesday, January 23, 2007", "text": "I have always known that I wanted to be a mom. I feel in my heart that to truly be satisfied with my life that this is a must.Chuck and I were married May 2001 when I was 30 and he was 29, what some might consider later in life. We knew right away that we wanted to start our family.When I was in my 20's I was diagnosed with PCOS and knew this might be difficult.Three months into our marriage I spoke with my doctor and due to my history and age it was recommended I see a fertility doctor.I took the fertility shots with no success. We were told that invitro would be our only option. I began taking the medication and going for frequent blood test. Time after time my sugar came back too high and we could not proceed.This time was very hard emotionally for me. I can not say enough about how supportive Chuck was. During this time I keep thinking about adoption. Time and time again I keep thinking that I want to be a mom, not just I want to become pregnant. I think during this time God was planting the seed for adoption.I finally said my heart could no longer take the disappointment of the fertility treatments. I mentioned adoption to Chuck, but he was not ready at this point.I began to research adoption because I knew in my heart that it was the right thing. I began to pray that if this was the plan for our family that God would open Chuck's heart to it. By this time he said he wasn't opposed to adoption, he just wasn't sure.I completely understood this. I had time since my 20's to prepare for the fact that I may not have a biological child, Chuck had much less time to prepare for this. If you haven't been in the situation it is hard to explain. I guess that you almost grieve for the child that will never be.After many tears, prayers and heartfelt conversations Chuck's heart opened to adoption.We researched all of our options, domestic adoption, foster to adopt and international adoption. International adoption was our choice.I am not even sure if Dad is aware but he the main reason we went with China. We were talking one afternoon about my desire to become a mom and Dad said \"why don't you go to China and bring home a baby girl.\" Once again I believe God was planting the seed. We prayed about our decision and keep feeling pull to the China program.The road has been long and hard. We submitted our application on March 2005 and our paperwork was logged in to China 10/13/05. When we began the process the wait time from log in was 6 mos, we have currently been waiting for over 15 mos. The wait has been very difficult. I finally asked God to carry this burden for me and feel at peace about it. We continue to wait, but I know the wait is all part of God's plan for our family. Soon we will see the beautiful daughter He has always had in mind for our family.We don't know for sure when we will have our referral, but it looks like it will be in the next two months. We are overflowing with anticipation and excitement."},

I took an empty detergent box that I lined with tissue paper and used it as one would a gift bag. I sat the larger items in the laundry basket. I am going to look for an inexpensive homekeeping book to add to the basket. I am thinking about weaving ribbon through the baket holes and making a bow on the front. I hope it is not too practical.

Quite a combination don't you think (plenty warm)Have you heard from Monroe or Frank (my grandmother's brothers, who were off to war)yet? Wish they would write me. Did I tell you I heard from John Meyers again? He's somewhere near Monroe, wish they could get to see one another.Aunt Lee just got back from Aunt Nora's. Had the doctor for Grandmother. Nothing serious, same old trouble - high blood pressure. Mabel leaves for her vacation Saturday morning. She & three other girls are going to Maine - Have a cottage they rented. I can hardly wait for mine to come.I am unable to read the rest of letter due to the tear, and I have no idea who wrote the letter. The recipe on the back states it is from Home Demostration Club.

I received a call to meet in the ER right after Christmas last year. He was having trouble taking a deep breath and when he went to see the company doctor he was sent to the ER. He ended up having Arterial Fibrillation. Which is an electrical problem where his heart was not beating correctly. He spent the night in the hospital and was given some test and sent home with several medications. He has had no problems since then. The only change for him is that this has slowed him down. He tends to tire more easily. I am so grateful that it is something easily controlled.We also lost a couple of great people this year. Even though we rejoice in the fact that they are in Heaven, it is hard not to have them in our daily lives.We thought that we would be united with our daughter last spring, but He had other plans. We should finally meet our Megan this year!My office was closed in November, so I lost my job after working there for 9 years. Even though that was tough I am enjoying my time at home.There were some great things that happened last year. Chuck's cousin,  Melanie and her husband Michael brought home their son, Jacob, from the Ukraine. Mom continues to be cancer free. My nieces are happy, healthy and bring much joy to our lives!  I continue to have a great relationship Chuck!  I am truly blessed to have him in my life!Here are some of my goals for the New Year:*Bring our daughter home from China!*Spend more time reading the Bible. My intentions are always good, but I let life get in the way of this. I will make this a priority this year.*Start Weight Watchers. We will be starting Wednesday.

During December it was overwhelming with all the request we had to bring in food, come in and sing etc. It was really sad when we had to turn down these request. What was even sadder was the fact that the other 12 mos of the year many of the resident had no visitors.I know that it is hard for some people to visit a nursing home, but there are many people we can show the blessing of giving.

Here is the history of the song:It's hard to believe that the quiet, calmng refrains of the peaceful \"Silent Night\" were actually composed under pressure! A broken organ on Christmas Eve was the inspiration behind it's creation. The church's priest quickly penned some verse and asked his organist to compose accompaniment.

Unexpectedly that is what I have become (for now anyway).Two years ago my company (a small, local credit reporting agency) was sold to a large corporation. We had the promise of job security. Six months later half of the staff was let go. We were told that each office is reviewed every six months.I have watched our office slowly become downsized. I also saw an office in California close, then New York and unfortunately our office today.Yesterday we were told there was a corporate wide conference call today. We all (7 of us) gathered in the conference room and instead of a conference call there was a HR person from Virginia there. We were informed our office is immediately closed.We all received a small severance package and that was it. Nine years at a job I really enjoyed gone.My greatest concern is our adoption. Our approval to bring our daughter home will expire in March. It does not look like we will be home before that happens, so we need to have our home study updated and our approval extended. I am worried that without my income we may not make it. I can not believe this is happening. Surely God wouldn't let us come this far, just for it to end. I know everything happens for a reason and I need lie this burden with Him, but I can not help but worry. Please say a quick pray that it all works out."},

We moved on to high school and I don't remember seeing him after we left middle school.Jump forward to our 10 year high school reunion. We talked for a few minutes and he said there was a Halloween party a friend of his was having and to stop by. I said sure I would stop by. I ended up being sick that weekend. While he was at the party I left him a message saying that. I left the message because I said I would stop by and didn't want him to think I blew off the party. He called back the next evening and asked me out!The next Saturday afternoon he picked me up and we went to the mall and walked around (we shared a delicious cookie, a peanut butter cookie shaped like a cup filled with chocolate icing ~ I am making those for him, so I will share that in another post). We then went to dinner at Chi-Chi's. A mexican restaurant that is no longer around. We saw a movie. For the life of me I can not remember the name of it. It had Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. That is all I remember.He phoned the next afternoon and the rest is history!Tonight he came phone with 1 red rose. He said because I am his one and only!

During this time I was living in Germany and her cancer touched my life from a distance. I was told that she knew something was not right, but choose not to a seek treatment. By the time she finally went to the doctor there was no treatment that would change the outcome.A friend of mine, Becky, found out she had Breast Cancer while she was expecting her second child. She felt something and was told that it was due to her milk coming in. She accepted that for about 4 months before she asked for a second opinion. She was told at that time that she had stage 3 Breast Cancer. She delivered a healthy baby girl by c-section and began her treatment. She battled cancer for 3 year before she lost her battle the Spring of 2003. She left behind a husband, a son (age 5) and a daughter (age 3). She was a true inspiration. She never felt sorry for herself, but keep a positive attitude. She believed that God was in control and she left the burden with him. I have never been to visitation like hers before. I waited in line for2 hours to reach the family! I can not even put into words how inspiring she was.September 2003 my Mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. She was at a health fair and had a free mamogram. She had 2 surgeries, Chemo, Radiation and so far the cancer has not returned. She had some pre-cancer found in her Colon this Spring and had surgery to remove most of her Small Intestine and most of her Colon. She has fully recovered from that surgery and continues to be Cancer FREE! We all believe that early detection has been the key to Mom's success. I am grateful everyday that Mom is still a part of my life.So, ladies be sure you have your Breast exam each year during you Gyn visit and discuss with your doctor when you should begin your mamogram screening. You are the best guide to what is happening with your body, so it doesn't feel right, keep pursuing it!"},

We have no children, but are in the process of adopting from China. We started our adoption process March 05.  We were DTC (Dossier to China) 09/23/05 and received a LID (Log in Date) 10/13/05.  This is when the \"real\" wait began.  We have been waiting for 10 mos and have no idea when the wait will end.  For those of you not in the adoption community it is hard to understand.  We basicly just have to wait our turn.  Each month China will release referrals (a picture of child matched to a family with medical information). Depending on how many referrals each months determines the current wait times.  Currently my adoption agency says the wait is 13-14 mos, but they expect that to increase.  It is frustrating, but the way I look at it is.....God knows when and where I will meet my sweet baby and I have to try to paitently wait.  Easier said then done at times.  Off to finish dinner.
